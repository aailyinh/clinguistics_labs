      "text": "US President Joe Biden has said that he is weighing a US diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympic games due to be held in Beijing, China. \n\"That is something we are considering,\" he told reporters ahead of talks with the leaders of Mexico and Canada.\nA diplomatic boycott would mean that no US officials are sent to attend the games. The decision comes amid rising tension in the US-China relationship. \nOn Monday, Mr Biden held his first direct talks with China's Xi Jinping. \nAt the White House, Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the US and China leaders did not discuss the Olympics during their three-hour virtual meeting on Monday. \nBoth Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called for a diplomatic boycott as a means to protest against Chinese human rights abuses. \nA diplomatic boycott would not affect athletes, but Ms Psaki said the US is still finalising \"what our presence will be\" at the games, which are due to begin on 4 February. \nThe US has accused China of genocide towards the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group which lives mostly in the autonomous region of Xinjiang. \nTensions have also risen over the way China has acted to repress political freedoms in Hong Kong.\nMr Biden's comment came as he was hosting Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for formal talks at the White House.\nThe talks, dubbed the Three Amigos Summit, are expected to focus on border issues, tax subsidies for electric vehicles, Covid precautions and other issues. \nLast month, US senators proposed a draft amendment to a bill that would ban the US State Department from spending government funds to \"support or facilitate\" the attendance of US diplomats at the Games. \nNancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in Congress, has called for a boycott, saying that US leaders who attend would lose their \"moral authority\".\nRepublican Senator Tom Cotton said on Thursday that diplomatic boycott of the \"genocide Olympics\" would be \"too little, too late\" and called for a total boycott of all athletes, officials and US corporate sponsors. \nNikki Haley, the former US representative to the UN under Donald Trump, has also called for a complete boycott.

      "tags": "NI Health,Mental health",
      "text": "Concerns have been raised about the oversight of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in Northern Ireland.\nECT involves passing electric currents through the brain to intentionally cause seizures to treat conditions such as severe depression.\nIt has emerged that Northern Ireland's health watchdog stopped inspecting individual ECT clinics four years ago.\nAnd only half of Northern Ireland's ECT clinics currently have the recommended accreditation.\nNorthern Ireland has six ECT clinics - Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Londonderry is the only one that is not a member the Electroconvulsive Therapy Accreditation Service (ECTAS).\nThe Western Health Trust said Altnagelvin Hospital was taking \"preparatory work\" to apply in spring 2022.\nIt said delays were due to maintenance within the hospital estate and the Covid-19 pandemic.\nECT clinics at Holywell Hospital in Antrim and Belfast's Mater Hospital are members of the ECTAS scheme but their accreditation has expired.\nHolywell's ECT clinic was reviewed in October 2021 and it is awaiting a decision on whether it will be accredited again.\nThe Mater Hospital's review was delayed because of the pandemic and has been rearranged for June 2022.\nThe scheme is run by the Royal College of Psychiatrists to support \"the improvement and quality\" of ECT but reviews only happen every three years.\nThe organisation believes the regular monitoring of individual ECT clinics in Northern Ireland should be the responsibility of the health regulator.\nThe Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA) has responsibility for the inspections of a range of Northern Ireland's healthcare settings.\nBut it confirmed to BBC News NI that it stopped inspections of individual ECT clinics in Northern Ireland in 2017.\nIt changed from inspecting individual wards in acute mental health services to wider inspections of mental health provision within a hospital site that its says are led by \"intelligence and concerns received\".\nWhen asked why it made this change, the regulator said there was no requirement under legislation to inspect ECT services or produce reports and that wider inspections of mental health services \"may include arrangements for ECT\".\nAn RQIA spokesperson said: \"Given that ECT suites are accredited by an external organisation, we believe they are best placed to advise on the assurance of quality in the administration of ECT.\"\nBut the Royal College of Psychiatrists told BBC News NI: \"While ECTAS undoubtedly plays an important role in improving the quality of services for patients, it cannot be a substitute for statutory regulation.\n\"The college is concerned about the limited powers and responsibilities that the RQIA has been given by the government to inspect and regulate mental health services as a whole.\"\nSara Boyce from mental health campaigning group PPR said: \"This raises serious concerns around the use of ECT in Northern Ireland.\n\"Alongside gaps in accreditation across all clinics, there is a clear lack of monitoring and inspection around the use of such an invasive intervention, and this is profoundly worrying.\"\nA spokesperson for RQIA added: \"Whilst we are not required to inspect ECT services we will examine any concerns raised with us.\"\nThe use of electricity to treat mental illness started out as an experiment in the 1930s when psychiatrists noticed some heavily distressed patients would suddenly improve after an epileptic fit.\nBy the 1960s, passing a strong electric current through the brain was being widely used to treat conditions such as severe depression.\nIts use became increasingly controversial, particularly after new anti-depressant drugs introduced in the 1970s gave doctors new ways to treat long-term mental illness.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends the use of ECT for some cases of moderate or severe depression as well as catatonia and mania.\nBut last year the journal of Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry published research concluding: \"The high risk of permanent memory loss and the small mortality risk means that its use should be immediately suspended.\"\nNICE has confirmed to BBC News NI that it is reviewing its recommendations on the relative benefits and harms of ECT for adults with complex and chronic depression.\nA consultation is due to take place in November 2021 with the final guidelines expected to be published in May 2022.\nDr Julie Anderson is a consultant psychiatrist who has overall responsibility for ECT in the Northern Health Trust.\nShe said: \"In terms of what ECT does, to be honest it's not completely 100% understood and it is something there needs to be more research on.\n\"But studies have known that around 70% of people will experience a significant improvement in their mental health after a course of ECT and that's higher than a lot of medications.\" \nShe added: \"It's also worth noting the most common reason people get ECT is for depression at the severe end of the spectrum, usually when other treatments such as medication haven't worked.\"  \nHowever, critics of ECT point to a long expressed body of anecdotal evidence from patients unhappy with side effects such as severe memory loss and headaches. \nWhen asked about the potential side effects of ECT, Dr Anderson said: \"Memory problems are something we take very seriously and we monitor it throughout a treatment and can adjust ECT dosage if there are any concerns.\n\"But it is often hard to measure because if someone is depressed it can impact memory and so can medication.\n\"All I can say is that I have found that ECT can be genuinely life-changing and bring relief to conditions such as depression for some people.\"\nLisa Morrison was born in South Africa and was diagnosed with major depression at the age of 14.\nShe spent some time in an inpatient mental health unit during her teenage years and received her first course of ECT when she was 19.\nShe moved to Northern Ireland after she was married and received several courses of ECT.\nClick here to read her interview in full, including her concerns about the impact the treatment had on her memory."

      "text": "The worst ever performance figures have once again been recorded by hospital emergency departments and the ambulance service in Wales.\nFigures for October show fewer than 65% of patients spent less than four hours in departments like A&E.\nThe ambulance service responded to just half of immediately life-threatening calls within eight minutes.\nThe director of the Welsh NHS confederation said the service was facing \"unsustainable pressures\". \nThe statistics also show another growth in waiting lists, with 668,801 people waiting for planned treatment in September - equivalent to 21% of the Welsh population.\nWelsh government said while it had invested an extra \u00a3248m this year to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times, \"real progress\" was not expected to be seen before the spring.\nDr Suresh Pillai, vice president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine Wales, said the figures \"once again show a worrying further deterioration in performance\".\nIt comes as the NHS Confederation in Wales - the body that represents health boards -  warns shortages in the care sector are proving to be a \"massive challenge\" and increasing pressure on A&E departments and the ambulance service.\nAccording to it's director Darren Hughes, as many as 15% of acute hospital beds are filled with people who are medically fit to leave hospital but are stuck waiting for care to be arranged elsewhere.\nJust 64.9% of patients spent less than four hours in emergency departments at Welsh hospitals before being admitted, transferred or discharged in October.\nThis was down from 66.8% in September - which was a record - and far below the target of 95%.\nThe figures also show 9,484 people had to wait more than 12 hours in urgent care departments in October - the highest number recorded and up from 8,485 the month before.\nThe target is that nobody should be waiting that long.\nDuring October, the ambulance service responded to 50% of \"red calls\" - where a life is at immediate risk - within eight minutes, down from 52.3% in September. \nThese are the worst monthly response times since new targets were introduced in Wales in 2015.\nThe target of 65% has not been met for 15 consecutive months.\nLast month's HIW report found ambulance crews had to wait more than an hour to transfer patients on no fewer than 32,699 occasions. \nThe figures also show there were 668,801 on NHS waiting lists in Wales in September - again, the highest number ever.\nThis equates to more than 21% of Wales' population.\nIt has also been revealed that 240,306 people had been waiting more than 36 weeks for treatment.\nThis is down slightly from the previous month's figure of 243,674, but is more than nine times higher than at the start of the pandemic - with 25,534 waiting more than nine months in February 2020.\n\"The urgent and emergency care system in Wales is facing a crisis and we are only just entering winter. Patient safety is at risk,\" added Dr Suresh Pillai.\n\"The government, boards and NHS leaders must understand and act now to ensure that the current crisis does not deepen and lead to more avoidable excess deaths.\"\nDarren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: \"The NHS in Wales is currently facing unsustainable pressures, from all angles.\n\"These statistics show the unrelenting high levels of demand the ambulance service and emergency departments are facing, with October seeing the highest number of immediately life-threatening calls made to the ambulance service since records began.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"The latest data shows pressure on our health and care system continues to grow, but our hardworking health and social care staff continue to deliver high quality care when people need it. \n\"We have invested an extra \u00a3248m this year to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times, but because of the ongoing pressures and effects of the pandemic we don't expect to see real progress before the spring.\n\"The ambulance service in Wales, like the rest of the UK, continues to be under great strain, the number of red calls, which are classed as life-threatening, in October were the highest ever on record.\n\"We encourage people to consider the best options for care, and not necessarily head to their local emergency department.\"\nThe spokesperson added: \"We need to be honest with the public that winter is going to be extremely difficult. The whole system is working together to find solutions to solve the problems... but the pressure on the system is higher than at any other point during the pandemic.\""

      "text": "Plans to scrap the eastern leg of HS2 in favour of a link that terminates in the East Midlands have met with a mixed reaction in the region.\nThe government's new Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) states the Birmingham to Leeds route will now terminate at East Midlands Parkway, in Nottinghamshire.\nIt also plans to electrify the existing Midlands Mainline and invest about \u00a311bn in rail links in the region.\nWhile some were relieved at the decision, others were disappointed.\nBen Bradley, Conservative MP for Mansfield and the leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, described the proposals to link the East and West Midlands through Leicestershire as \"fantastic\".\n\"The biggest thing for us in Nottinghamshire is our economic development and jobs creation,\" he said.\n\"Off the back of this, we are linking disadvantaged communities into huge sites for jobs.\"\nHowever, Lilian Greenwood, Labour MP for Nottingham South, accused the government of selling the region short and branded the axing of the eastern leg a \"rail betrayal\".\nShe said: \"The [plan] is a huge betrayal of our region and, by spinning this as a good deal, Ben Bradley is simply selling our county and our region short.\n\"We'll lose out on massively improved connections to Leeds, the North East and Scotland.\n\"By scrapping the full eastern leg, we won't get the extra capacity needed to create more local rail services and get more freight on rail - and lorries off our roads.\"\nI've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a short hop to Doncaster.\nHe pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2 is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its demise.\nA multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new line to East Midlands Parkway.\nHe also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and Nottingham to Sheffield.\nAnd while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport hub will still be built there connecting local services.\nAnd it may not be the end of the full eastern leg.\nThat could still happen in the long term.\nAlex Norris, Labour MP for Nottingham North, added: \"This U-turn will be a blow to our regional and local economies.\"\nOriginal proposals for the route suggested it would run through communities on the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border to a major hub at Toton, connecting the cities of Nottingham and Derby.\nUnder the new plans, the Midlands Mainline will be electrified as far as Sheffield - something rail campaigners have long called for - and Toton will become a mainline station.\nThis will connect to the reopened Maid Marian Line - closed during the 1960s Beeching Cuts - to provide passenger connectivity with places like Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Selston and Pinxton.\nIt comes alongside a commitment to extending the Robin Hood Line out to Edwinstowe and Ollerton.\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service suggests this is a project long campaigned for by politicians including the Government's chief whip and Sherwood MP Mark Spencer.\nThis would connect with the Maid Marian Line in Ashfield to reach the Toton station, and eventually on to HS2 via the light rail connection.\nJason Zadrozny, the independent leader of Ashfield District Council, welcomed the Maid Marian Line news but criticised the overall HS2 plans.\n\"We've always said reopening the Maid Marian Line to passengers was a no-brainer,\" he said.\n\"With regards to HS2 - it's been the worst kept secret in Nottinghamshire for years that HS2 would not stop at Toton.\n\"[The government] talks about levelling up, yet this looks like it will further exacerbate issues in Nottinghamshire and put us further behind the rest of the UK.\"\nHowever Midlands Connect - the government-funded regional transport group - said there were positives in the plans.\nChair Sir John Peace said: \"Today's announcement gives businesses and local leaders the reassurance they've been waiting for - that HS2 is coming to the East Midlands.\n\"Although these plans are different in some respects to what we'd expected, there are a lot of... things to be excited about - a new high speed connection between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway [and] direct links on to HS2 for Derby, Nottingham, and Chesterfield.\"\nHe added the delivery of a new station at Toton could start, which would help kickstart regeneration in that area.\n\"The plans around Toton, the adjacent freeport and the wider Development Corporation could create 84,000 jobs and add billions in value to the regional economy; the developments cover the size of three Olympic Parks,\" he said.\nHe added an upgrade of an East Coast Mainline junction at Newark - also mentioned in the plan - would allow better connectivity with Nottingham, Lincoln and other regional hubs.\nResidents in the towns and villages affected by the original HS2 scheme, said they were relieved about its axing.\nGeoff Cotton, who has lived in Trowell since 1988, would have seen HS2 come past his house.\n\"Obviously it's pleasing from a selfish point of view, but I do also feel that the way the economy is working at the moment with people working from home more, the need to travel down to London fast isn't as significant as it would have been,\" he said.\nHowever, he criticised the amount of time the decision had taken.\n\"People's lives have been totally put on hold for a long time because nobody is saying what is going to happen,\" he said.\n\"People haven't been able to move on with their lives because they can't sell their properties.\"\nJill Sisson, who has lived in Trowell for more than 50 years, would have seen her home demolished.\n\"I'm quite happy to be staying here,\" she said.\n\"To have been living with all this pressure is very hard. I don't think it's been handled very well. One minute you're hearing one thing and the next minute you're hearing something else.\n\"It leaves you up in the air as to what's going to happen. It's all the uncertainty.\"\nSim Harris, editor of Rail News, said the proposals for the eastern leg of HS2 had always had problems.\n\"The idea of running the line to the east of Derby and the west of Nottingham meant neither city got a high speed station,\" he said.\n\"Putting it at Toton was an unfortunate compromise. By the time residents had travelled there, they could have been on their way to London on a regular train.\"\nHe viewed the location of East Midlands Parkway as a better choice. \"It will prove a useful east-west corridor and could mean a faster service between Derby, Nottingham and Birmingham,\" he said.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "Visitors should be allowed into maternity units without restrictions, a charity has said.\nSince the coronavirus pandemic started, some units have stopped all visiting while others have limited times parents can spend with their newborns.\nBut with restrictions on movement and social distancing eased across Wales, Birthrights wants this applied in hospital maternity units too.\nThe Welsh government said maternity services keep their rules under review.\nLeah Lewis-McLernon's husband, Michael, had to leave 40 minutes after she gave birth to a baby girl at Glangwili hospital in Carmarthen, and wasn't allowed visitors for two days.\n\"No-one was allowed in,\" she said. \"It would scare me, having to go through it again. I know Cali was with me, but I felt so alone. I was so tired, and was just asking, 'where is the support?'\n\"You're allowed to go to a pub but can't have the company and backing of your partner in the hospital when you've just given birth to a tiny baby. It's just not fair at all.\"\nVisiting rules vary among health boards in Wales.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg in south-east Wales doesn't allow visitors, while the others limit time to up to two hours per day.\nAt Aneurin Bevan health board, one designated partner is allowed between 08:00 and 20:00.\nEluned Glyn Williams gave birth to her son, Gruffydd, at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales a month ago, but after an hour her husband had to leave.\n\"I was in hospital for four additional days and my partner was allowed to come in for just two hours a day,\" she said. \n\"So even after I was getting better, it was difficult to do anything, with regards to lifting Gruffydd or moving about. I'd had a spinal block as well so I was stuck in bed.\n\"It's not fair. A mother needs the support and the help during that difficult period in their lives.\"\nBirthrights has written to Health Minister Eluned Morgan asking for change, saying Wales has \"some of the most restrictive visiting arrangements in maternity services in the UK\".\nProgrammes director Maria Booker warned the charity would be prepared to take legal action if needed.\n\"It's often the women who have a more complicated medical situation who are staying in hospital for longer,\" she said. \n\"So sometimes the baby might be ill or they might be recovering from a more traumatic birth or a caesarean section, which is major abdominal surgery. \n\"And so they're coping with their own recovery and also having to look after a newborn baby on their own, which is really tough.\"\nThe Welsh government said there was a \"delicate balance\" between protecting vulnerable individuals and allowing visiting.\nA spokesman added: \"Maternity services keep their visiting guidance under review to enable partners to support women at all stages of pregnancy and birth.\""

      "text": "The head of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has cast doubt on an email released by Chinese state media attributed to tennis player Peng Shuai.\nThe tennis star has not been heard from since she made sexual assault allegations against a top Chinese government official two weeks ago.\nIn the email, Ms Peng purportedly says the allegations are \"not true\".\nSteve Simon, chairman of the WTA, said the message \"only raises\" his concerns about Ms Peng's safety.\n\"I have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her,\" he said in a statement.\nRights group Amnesty also said the words \"should not be taken at face value\" but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it favoured \"quiet diplomacy\" and would not comment. \nWritten in her voice and published by the broadcaster CGTN, the email claims she is not missing or unsafe, adding: \"I've just been resting at home and everything is fine.\"\nMs Peng - a former number one-ranked tennis doubles player - had not been heard from since posting an allegation about former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli on Chinese social media site Weibo in early November.  \nShe alleged she was \"forced\" into sexual relations with Mr Zhang - who served as the country's vice-premier between 2013 and 2018 - in a post that was later taken down. She has not been seen or heard from publicly since. \nThe WTA and leading voices from the world of tennis have increasingly spoken out about Ms Peng since. \nOn Thursday, the spokesman for China's foreign ministry did not give further details about the situation when asked by reporters.\n\"This is not a foreign affairs matter,\"  Zhao Lijian said. \"And I am not aware of the relevant situation you mentioned.\"\nFormer women's world number one and 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams said news of Ms Peng's disappearance had left her \"devastated and shocked\".\n\"I hope she is safe and found as soon as possible. This must be investigated and we must not stay silent,\" she added in a tweet. \nEarlier this week, world number one male tennis player Novak Djokovic said he hoped Ms Peng was OK, adding that he was shocked, while Naomi Osaka also voiced concerns about her whereabouts. More tennis players and social media users have since posted under the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai.\n\"The WTA and the rest of the world need independent and verifiable proof that she is safe,\" WTA chair Steve Simon said on Wednesday.\nHe also reiterated that her sexual assault allegation must be investigated \"with full transparency and without censorship\".\n\"The voices of women need to be heard and respected, not censored nor dictated to,\" he added.\nMr Simon's comments were echoed by Amnesty. \n\"China's state media has a track record of forcing statements out of individuals under duress, or else simply fabricating them,\" said Amnesty's China researcher, Doriane Lau.\n\"These concerns will not go away unless Peng's safety and whereabouts are confirmed.\"\nMeanwhile, the International Olympic Committee said in a brief statement that \"experience shows that quiet diplomacy offers the best opportunity to find a solution for questions of such nature\".\n\"This explains why the IOC will not comment any further at this stage,\" it said. Beijing is due to host the Winter Olympics in February.\nMs Peng, 35, is a prominent figure in Chinese tennis. She has won two women's doubles Grand Slams at Wimbledon in 2013 and the 2014 French Open, both alongside Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei.\nHer allegation is the highest profile incident in China's fledgling #MeToo movement. \nMs Peng has more than half a million followers on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. \nHer post containing the sexual assault allegations was taken down only minutes after it was posted on 2 November, and other recent posts from her account have also been removed.\nFor Weibo users now searching for Ms Peng's name online, it is still possible to find her account but it is no longer possible to write comments beneath her remaining posts. \nMs Peng hasn't been seen in public nor heard from in weeks. Now an email appears and the language appears flippant. \nThe image released by the state controlled TV network CGTN appears to be a screenshot, with a cursor hovering on the page. All of which has raised immediate suspicions about its authenticity. \nNo other domestic media outlet has picked it up. \nProminent people do disappear from view in China. Sometimes it's billionaire businessmen. It's not usually athletes. \nSporting success, like Ms Peng's, has become a key component of the ruling Communist Party's soft power push. That is, however, yet to include a #MeToo moment."

served up a distraction dish of Covid certification to enter a coffee shop.\"\nOn Wednesday First Minister Paul Givan said the plan for a Covid passport scheme should be put to a vote in the

(BMA) Northern Ireland's GP committee said the next step should be to require proof of a negative lateral flow test before entering a hospitality venue.\nDr Alan Stout said: \"These are measures that none of us want, but what we are seeing with the infection numbers as they are at the moment, with them climbing, with the pressures on the NHS, is that we are starting to see an exceptionally difficult position.\"\nMichael Cafolla, from the Northern Ireland Institute of Hospitality, said that the industry did not \"feel that we are part of any sort of masterplan in terms of how we are going to get out of this\".\n\"It feels like they have had a jigsaw in front of them for 18 months and they have put little pieces together, but we can't see the overall picture and that's very distressing for many of us within the industry.\"\nColin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the hospitality industry was frustrated but he said the debate around Covid passports had now moved on. \n\"We have lost the battle and our debate on this but are extremely annoyed we are being left alone to enforce it with no support.\"\nBefore ministers voted, it emerged that health officials warned that tougher restrictions may be required before Christmas even if proof of Covid status comes into force.\nIn its briefing paper for ministers, the department said that \"further immediate measures are required to increase adherence to continued mitigations, including use of face coverings, work from home, outdoor meetings, ventilation and limiting contacts\".\nThe paper also said that the number of positive cases had risen by 23% in Northern Ireland in the past week, hospital admissions were up 19% and hospital occupancy levels up 10%.\nQueen's University Belfast virologist Dr Connor Bamford said the passport scheme would be most effective if introduced in tandem with other measures.\nHe said it had the potential to both cut the risk of infection and encourage greater vaccine uptake, but that vaccine's were not a \"silver bullet\".\n\"There's multiple things we have to do because vaccinations are just not enough,\" he told BBC Radio Foyle.\nMaggie Hogg, from Glengormley was shielding during the last lockdown due to a lung condition.\nShe said the new measures will make her feel safer when visiting hospitality and entertainment venues. \n\"I would feel more confident going to the cinema knowing that everyone sitting around me had either been vaccinated or had shown a negative test,\" she told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \n\"We're going to have to live with Covid and I'm for anything that will make my life and indeed anybody's life easier.\"\nGareth Murphy, who owns We Are Vertigo, an activity centre in Belfast, said he does not believe the passport scheme will \"deliver the results we need\".\n\"If we look at what's happening in Ireland, we're pinning our hopes to something which isn't in isolation working so well,\" he told BBC News NI. \n\"If we had real tangible results which said 100 miles down the road this worked, we'd be all for it.\"\nSpeaking after the vote on Wednesday, Health Minister Robin Swann said that the Covid passport was not the only option for people wanting to enter hospitality premises under the scheme. \nPeople could also use a negative lateral flow test taken in the previous 48 hours or proof of a positive PCR test taken in the previous 30 to 180 days.\nThe plan would mean the regulations would take effect from 29 November but will not be legally enforced until 13 December as there would be a 14-day grace period before fixed penalty notices could be issued. \nIt is understood the measure would apply for access to:"

      "text": "A \"miraculously lucky\" farmer who survived being impaled through the abdomen by a tine on his forklift truck has thanked medics who saved his life.\nJonathan Willis, 42, was unloading straw bales at his Cambridgeshire farm when the vehicle rolled into him.\nThe emergency services managed to free him before he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for surgery, still impaled by the tine.\nSurgeon Emmanuel Huguet said his survival seemed \"near impossible\".\nOn 26 October last year, Mr Willis was standing by a trailer of straw bales at his farm near Wisbech when the forklift rolled forward and trapped him. The tine entered his lower back and exited his abdomen.\n\"As soon as the spike touched my back I was wondering 'what's that', and I started to twist around to the side - that's why it went across my whole body, because I wanted to see,\" he said.\n\"It was a big worry. There wasn't a lot of blood so I was thinking 'hopefully this isn't too bad'.\" \nHis wife Wendy called 999 at 16:32 GMT and the East Anglian Air Ambulance arrived within seven minutes. \nIt took an hour for ambulance, police and fire teams to cut the steel tine from the forklift. \nMr Willis was given advanced pain relief, but was awake and standing throughout.\nAir ambulance consultant Dr Nathan Howes said: \"It was incredibly important that any movement of Jonathan or the tine was minimised, in case it worsened any internal bleeding, but we also needed to free him quickly. \n\"I was so impressed by how stoic Jonathan and his wife Wendy were.\"\nMrs Willis described it as \"living my worst nightmare\".\nShe said she would be forever grateful to those who helped her husband.\n\"You have saved our family,\" she said. \"My five girls will grow up with their daddy, and their lives would have been very different.\n\"All we can say is thank you a million times.\"\nMr Willis arrived at Addenbrooke's at 18:51, where a surgical team of about 30 people were on standby.\nConsultant liver and transplant surgeon, Mr Huguet, said they were \"astounded by the trajectory of the spike\".\n\"It had transfixed parts of the intestine, but somehow found an incredibly improbable 'eye of the needle' line past all the major blood vessels, as well as missing the right kidney, liver and pancreas,\" he said, making its removal safe. \n\"Mr Willis was... miraculously lucky.\"\nThe farmer said he was \"so thankful that there were so many expert teams available to help me get through it\".\n\"They were second to none,\" he said. \"None of them would go home until everything was sorted, even if they were supposed to be off their shift. \n\"They were brilliant and I couldn't thank them enough.\"\nThe family has since raised \u00a345,000 for the air medics charity that helped saved his life.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "HS2,High Speed Rail,Northern Powerhouse Rail,Northern",
      "text": "The government's decision to scale back its rail plans has been branded a \"betrayal\" of northern England.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the eastern leg of HS2 - running from the Midlands to Leeds - had been cut.\nMPs have also accused the government of breaking promises over Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) - a raft of upgrades and additions to the network.\nMr Shapps said the new Integrated Rail Plan would bring benefits much sooner.\nBoris Johnson doubled down on the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project after he became prime minister, and would later include it as a manifesto promise.\nIn 2019 Mr Johnson pledged \"to fund the Leeds to Manchester route\" and \"turbo-charge the economy\".\nThe government insists it is still delivering NPR through additional investment, and said upgrades to existing routes would cut journey times and increase capacity much sooner than the previous plans.\nSome have said the new announcement marks a significant shift away from previous plans and recommendations, with politicians and businesses in some northern cities angry at the government's changes.\nThe HS2 line was due to be extended from the West Midlands to Leeds. This would have cut journey times between London and Leeds to one hour and 21 minutes. \nMPs from Yorkshire said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had repeatedly promised that HS2 and a new Leeds-Manchester line going via Bradford as part of NPR would be \"built in full\".\nHowever, HS2 will only be built as far as a new East Midlands Parkway station, about six miles south-west of Nottingham. That means London-Leeds journey times will be one hour and 53 minutes, some 32 minutes longer than planned. The government has not ruled out bringing HS2 to Leeds, but no timescale has been given.\nThe dropping of the Leeds to Manchester NPR plan means Bradford will miss out on inclusion along the new line. Ministers have promised upgrades to the existing links between the cities and shorter journey times.\nLabour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said the promise to build the new line to Manchester had been broken \"and Leeds and the North have been betrayed\".\nAdding to Mr Benn's criticism of the plans was Tory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford.\nThe city had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains.\nMr Moore said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the new plan, which had \"completely short-changed\" his constituents.\n\"We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,\" he said.\n\"I still want to see Northern Powerhouse Rail delivered with a main stop in Bradford, so that we can unlock our economic opportunities.\"\nThe Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), which represents rail workers, concluded that Bradford would be \"the biggest loser\".\nIt said Bradford had been found to have the worst transport connections of any UK city due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections.\nA report out earlier this week found the city had the worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located.\nManuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, said the plan showed the government had \"sold out the North with more broken promises\".\nIn June, Transport for the North recommended that new lines should be built between Liverpool and Leeds via Manchester and Bradford.\nA high-speed line will instead be built between Warrington, in Cheshire, and Marsden, on the West Yorkshire border.\nExisting lines on the remainder of the route between Liverpool and Leeds will be upgraded.\nLabour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham described it as \"second best for the North again\".\n\"What we are hearing today [is] part new line, part upgrades; that isn't what we were promised and that isn't good enough,\" he said.\n\"I am thinking about everyone living here today, but what about the people's grandchildren and great grandchildren. We are going to saddle them with the wrong railway system for centuries.\"\nIn Sheffield and surrounding towns and cities, concerns were raised about damage to the countryside and disturbance of local communities as a result of HS2's construction.\nThe high-speed service will still run to Sheffield, but the announcement it would not go further was cautiously welcomed in some areas.\nChris Read, Labour leader of Rotherham Council, which has lobbied against plans to route HS2 through the area, said the U-turn was a \"victory for common sense at last\", but urged ministers to keep their promises on the scale of investment in northern rail services.\nBut the new announcement has brought uncertainty in some places, such as the Shimmer estate in Mexborough, near Doncaster. It was due to be demolished to make way for the eastern leg, and many homeowners left when they learned an 60ft (18m) high viaduct was due to be built to carry high-speed lines.\nAfter the announcement, local councillor Andy Pickering said those who remained had been \"left in complete limbo\".\nThe Integrated Rail Plan has effectively \"wiped Hull off the mainline rail map\", according to the Labour Party.\nThe city had hoped the plan would include the electrification of the line between Hull and Selby, to improve its connection to the East Coast Mainline and cut journey times to Leeds.\nHull's Labour leader, councillor Daren Hale, said it was an \"absolute scandal\" for ministers to say that journey times between Hull and Manchester would improve due to upgrades to the line between Leeds and Manchester.\n\"Yet again the people of Hull and this area have been overlooked,\" he said.\nPoliticians in Hull are expecting to meet with rail ministers to discuss the announcement and repeat their demands for direct improvements.\nIf life is about comprises then a very big one has just been put upon northern England.\nIt doesn't have the same train commuter culture as south east England because the stations and rail lines aren't there but it does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To level up.\nCurrently it is a land where new trains run on old lines.\nYorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson.\nThe compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded.\nJourney times will be quicker - and many people will be satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been.\nAt present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of engineering work.\nJourney times cross country from York and the north-east will also improve. There's a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in trans pennine terms.\n\u00a396bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up."

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid case rates in England are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly surveillance figures reveal.\nThe data, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time.\nIn recent months, the 10 to 19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per 100,000 tested.\nIt is too soon to say what is behind the change and if it will continue.\nIn recent weeks, children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) report shows 723 cases recorded per 100,000 among children aged five to nine. \nThat's up week-on-week from 484.5 per 100,000. \nThe rate for 10 to 19-year-olds is 694.2, up from 571.7.\nCovid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those aged 80-plus - with a weekly rate of 76 per 100,000. But this group has the greatest risk of getting more seriously ill with Covid if they were to catch it, particularly if they are not vaccinated. \nProf Steven Riley, from the UKHSA, said Covid rates continue to increase in those from younger age groups, and hospitalisations remain highest in people aged 85 and over. \n\"More people than ever are eligible for second and booster doses - and it is as important as ever to get vaccinated or receive a booster jab as soon as you are offered one.\n\"Socialising indoors in places with poor ventilation increases the risk of infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to ventilate the room when meeting people inside. Wash your hands regularly and wear a mask in crowded places. If you have any Covid-19 symptoms, stay at home and get a PCR test as soon as possible,\" he advised. \nThe UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures.\nOverall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old.\nMore than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. \nThe UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period.\nThere were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded.\nMeanwhile, levels of influenza remain low, but people who are eligible for a flu shot are being urged to get one as a precaution.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Germany,Angela Merkel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Germany is set to introduce tighter curbs on people who have not been vaccinated against Covid-19, as cases in the country hit a record high.\nRestrictions for unvaccinated people will be introduced in areas where hospital admissions exceed a set threshold, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders of Germany's 16 states agreed. \nUnder the rules, the unvaccinated will be excluded from certain venues. \nMrs Merkel described the situation with Covid in the country as \"dramatic\". \n\"We need to quickly put a brake on the exponential rise\" in cases and intensive care unit occupancy, she said. \nThe number of daily cases in Germany rose sharply on Thursday to more than 65,000 - by far the highest figure since the pandemic began. \nThe new rules, agreed in a crisis meeting, mean that in areas with a hospitalisation rate of more than three Covid patients per 100,000 people over the past seven days, only the vaccinated and those who have recovered from the virus will be allowed to access to public spaces like sporting events, cultural shows and restaurants.\nThe majority of the country's states currently exceed this threshold.\nAreas with a hospitalisation rate of more than six will have to introduce a \"2G plus\" rule, requiring people to be tested as well as vaccinated, and regions with a rate of more than nine will have to introduce further measures, like restrictions on contact. \nMrs Merkel and the other leaders also agreed on Thursday that healthcare and care home employees must be vaccinated to control the spread of the virus. \nTheir announcement came after Germany's lower house of parliament voted in favour of a new set of Covid measures, including limiting access to public transport and the workplace to only people who have been vaccinated or tested.\nThese measures still need to be agreed by parliament's upper house on Friday, and some conservative politicians have threatened to block the bill.\nThe states of Saxony and Bavaria have already imposed so-called 2G rules placing restrictions on unvaccinated people in response to a surge in cases. \nGermany is not the first European country to introduce restrictions on people who have not been vaccinated against Covid.\nBoth the Czech Republic and Slovakia on Thursday announced tighter restrictions for unvaccinated people, in a bid to encourage vaccine uptake.\nUnder the rules approved by the Czech government, only those who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid in the past six months will be allowed enter restaurants, attend certain events and use various other services from Monday.\nSlovakia's Prime Minister Eduard Heger described new measures there as a \"lockdown for the unvaccinated\".\nAustria earlier this week placed about two million people who have not been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 into lockdown. It means they are only allowed to leave home for limited reasons, like working or buying food. \n\"We are not taking this step lightly, but unfortunately it is necessary,\" Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said.\nTwo provinces in Austria - Upper Austria and Salzburg - will go into full lockdown from Monday, media reports say. \nOverall, Europe has again become the area most seriously affected by the pandemic. \nThe World Health Organization warned on Thursday that there will be a \"hard winter ahead\" for the region.

      "tags": "Housing,Grenfell Tower fire,Construction industry,UK fire safety",
      "text": "\"It's like a crippling depression where you can't get up. My anxiety is really bad, some days I can't leave the house.\" \nSophie Grayling, 28, bought a two-bed flat in Chelmsford, Essex just weeks after her son Reuben was born in 2017. It was supposed to be a safe, secure place to bring up a child, but all that quickly changed.  \nIn December 2020, the mother-of-one was told the building had dangerous external cladding and as a result, the sale on her property fell through. \nSince then, she tells the BBC she has felt \"trapped and helpless\", living constantly in fear that she might lose the roof over her head and have to declare bankruptcy. \nConcerns over building safety were triggered by the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 in which 72 people died. \nAn inquiry found the type of cladding used was the primary cause of the fire's rapid spread. \nIt's estimated more than half a million people are still living in flats with dangerous cladding and flammable materials. Some are facing bills of more than \u00a3100,000 to make their properties safe.  \nNew research, shared exclusively with the BBC by the University of Sheffield and UK Collaborative Centre for Housing Evidence, concluded the building safety crisis is having a \"catastrophic impact on the mental health of some leaseholders\". \nDr Jenny Preece's research is based on a series of in-depth interviews carried out over the summer with affected leaseholders from England and Wales.  \n\"Several people talked about a point of crisis and needing to get help from a GP; they felt trapped and it was leading to feelings of suicide and self-harm,\" she said. \n\"Some participants were taking anti-depressants as a result of the mental health impact of the problems they were living with: you're stuck and there's literally nothing you can do about it.\"\nThe impacts were likened to living through \"ongoing trauma\". Leaseholders talked about the loss of control over their own lives, the inability to plan for the future, no timeframe for building safety problems to be resolved and the crippling financial burden on their shoulders.  \nAnother cladding victim, Will Martin, 33, described it as being \"like a ball and chain wrapped around your legs\".  \nMr Martin is a junior doctor who owns a flat in Sheffield with dangerous cladding. He is the co-founder of the campaign Organisation UK Cladding Action Group and has helped to organise nationwide protests and demonstrations. \nThat has been his coping mechanism, but Mr Martin says he deeply regrets his decision ever to buy a flat.  \n\"I was so embarrassed and utterly ashamed that I, a sensible person, made this colossal mistake and error of judgement by buying this property. The last four years and the impact it has had on my mental health will stay with me forever. It has been torturous,\" he said.\n\"Government has always said 'leaseholders should not have to pay', but the reality is that many face a constant barrage of entirely unaffordable bills and, in addition to paying through their pockets, today's research by the University of Sheffield lays bare the mental health costs faced by many on a daily basis.\" \nBack in Essex, Ms Grayling went to her GP for help and was prescribed anti-anxiety medication. \nHer doctor was so shocked by the situation he wrote to her local MP, Vicky Ford, asking for the issues to be raised in Parliament.  \n\"Sophie feels utterly trapped. She cannot remortgage, she cannot sell.\"   \nLast year, the House of Commons Housing Select Committee, made up of a group of cross-party MPs, warned that the cladding scandal was becoming a public health crisis.\nPsychologists have told the BBC that people living in these conditions for long periods of time will need counselling and therapy to get through it.  \nProfessor Sir Cary Cooper is a leading stress expert and occupational psychologist at the University of Manchester.  \n\"In life, uncertainty and lack of control are the two leading causes of stress, and these people have it in tonnes,\" said Professor Cooper.   \n\"Number one, you know you are going to have to cough up some money. Number two, you don't know how much and it could be substantial. So the worries about that, on top of everything else, these people really do need support and they will need counselling support.\" \nAccording to Dr Preece, the financial burden, rather than safety concerns, has often been the great source of concern for leaseholders: \"If we don't see a change in policy or government action where is it going end?\"  \nHer report makes a series of recommendations, including urging the government to carry out an audit of the number of buildings affected and extend the funding to cover buildings of all heights and all types of fire safety faults. \nIt also calls for a taskforce to be established to pursue residential developers and manufacturers of cladding materials for compensation.  \nMs Grayling's building in Chelmsford is less than 18 metres in height, and, therefore, not eligible for government funding to fix the faults. \nBut after months of uncertainty, the developer of her block has now agreed to pay to remove and replace the dangerous cladding. She hopes she may soon be able to sell the flat and move on with her life.  \n\"I am at the tip of the iceberg, I feel lucky,\" she says.  \"I have support from friends and family [and] my love for my son got me through, pulled me out of the deepest despair and meant I did get help.\"\nThe government has promised a \u00a35bn Building Safety Fund to remove flammable cladding on high-rise buildings of above 18 metres in height, but MPs have estimated the total cost would be \u00a315bn. \nA Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities (DLUHC) spokesperson said the department would be setting out \"further proposals in due course\" to support leaseholders in low and mid-rise blocks.\n\"It is unacceptable and unfair that leaseholders are facing excessive bills - they are innocent parties in this and we recognise the impact it can have on their mental health,\" the DLUHC spokesperson said. \n\"Building owners and industry must make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders. \n\"Most blocks of flats are safe and do not need expensive works, and we continue to drive extreme risk aversion out of the market, by encouraging a more proportionate, evidence-based approach from lenders and insurers.\""

Wherever possible you aimed your knives at your victims' necks.\n\"I have no doubt whatsoever you are a very dangerous man and pose a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm.\"\nMcLeod had previous convictions for robbery, possession of a knife and class A drugs, and possession of an imitation firearm. He was also once jailed for attacking a six-month-old baby.\nThe court heard McLeod had refused a psychiatric appointment in the days before his fatal attacks in Birmingham.\nPrior to that, he had little contact with health services after being released from prison in April 2020, despite a history of refusing to take his medication and hearing voices telling him to kill and stab people.\nInstead, the court heard he had self-medicated with illegal drugs and had recently taken crack cocaine and cannabis in the time before the attacks.\nJacob's mother Joanne Billington said there were still many \"unanswered questions\" about various state agencies' prior treatment and monitoring of McLeod, and believed \"mistakes were made\".\nIn an impact statement, read to the court, she said she hoped McLeod's care would be \"properly looked into and that all involved remember my son bled to death in the street at the hands of someone well-known to many agencies\".\nSpeaking after the sentencing, Jacob's father Keith Billington said while the family continued to grieve \"we must ask the obvious question - why was McLeod... allowed to be out and about on 6 September unsupervised, unmedicated and not under licence?\"\nMr Justice Pepperall said it was a \"matter of considerable concern\" McLeod was \"simply lost in the system for some weeks\".\nHe said he had been left \"without any appropriate follow up by mental health services\" following his release from prison at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nDuring the sentencing hearing Abbie Billington, Jacob's sister, read out a statement in which she asked \"how was a man so unstable and in a mental health crisis able to walk the streets unsupervised?\"\nA multi-agency review will attempt to answer that question. It is unlikely to be published until early next year. \nThis wasn't the first time that someone who was seriously mentally ill had killed someone with a knife in the centre of Birmingham.\nIn May 2001 Rosie Ross was fatally stabbed by Inderjit Kainth, who was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.  \nIn his case, he hadn't been known to the authorities beforehand. That wasn't the case when Glaister Butler killed detective constable Michael Swindells in 2004, nor when Philip Simelane killed Christina Adkins in 2013. \nThe authorities admitted errors and promised to learn lessons then. What the Billington family wants to know is whether the same mistakes have been made again and if lessons will be learned in the future. \nPolice said witnesses' varying descriptions of McLeod and the random nature of the attacks made it difficult to link them on the night.\nMcLeod attacked his first victim just after 00:30 BST in Constitution Hill, where a 33-year-old man sustained a neck wound. \nHe then went on to carry out attacks in Livery Street, and Barwick Street before dumping his weapon down a drain and calling at a pizza restaurant to ask for a new knife.\nStaff, unaware of what had happened, allowed him to call a taxi and he travelled home to Selly Oak, before returning rearmed to continue his attacks, including the fatal injury of Jacob Billington on Irving Street at about 01:50.\nSupt Jim Munro said stabbings in Birmingham were \"not uncommon\" and \"varying information\" from witnesses, coupled with the different locations made it difficult to link the incidents.\nHe said officers \"painstakingly viewed many, many hours of CCTV\", while the pizza restaurant where McLeod had called a taxi helped direct officers to the Selly Oak area, where they later arrested McLeod.\nWest Midlands Police was forced to defend its response to the attacks, but a review found it acted \"appropriately and professionally\".\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid case rates in England are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly surveillance figures reveal.\nThe data, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time.\nIn recent months, the 10 to 19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per 100,000 tested.\nIt is too soon to say what is behind the change and if it will continue.\nIn recent weeks, children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) report shows 723 cases recorded per 100,000 among children aged five to nine. \nThat's up week-on-week from 484.5 per 100,000. \nThe rate for 10 to 19-year-olds is 694.2, up from 571.7.\nCovid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those aged 80-plus - with a weekly rate of 76 per 100,000. But this group has the greatest risk of getting more seriously ill with Covid if they were to catch it, particularly if they are not vaccinated. \nProf Steven Riley, from the UKHSA, said Covid rates continue to increase in those from younger age groups, and hospitalisations remain highest in people aged 85 and over. \n\"More people than ever are eligible for second and booster doses - and it is as important as ever to get vaccinated or receive a booster jab as soon as you are offered one.\n\"Socialising indoors in places with poor ventilation increases the risk of infection. Help protect yourself and loved ones by opening windows and doors to ventilate the room when meeting people inside. Wash your hands regularly and wear a mask in crowded places. If you have any Covid-19 symptoms, stay at home and get a PCR test as soon as possible,\" he advised. \nThe UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures.\nOverall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old.\nMore than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. \nThe UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period.\nThere were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded.\nMeanwhile, levels of influenza remain low, but people who are eligible for a flu shot are being urged to get one as a precaution.

      "tags": "Department for Transport,Rail travel,HS2,Grant Shapps",
      "text": "The HS2 link between the East Midlands and Leeds is being scrapped.\nThe announcement is part of the government's \u00a396bn rail programme - although only about half is new investment.\nHS2 is a massive project intended to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England.\nIt will cost tens of billions of pounds and is aimed at cutting journey times and increasing capacity. \nIt's hoped HS2 will create jobs and grow the UK economy outside London.\nBut HS2 has faced delays and mounting concerns over the exact route and spiralling costs.\nHS2 was originally meant to connect London with Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.\nWork has already started on the first phase, linking London and the West Midlands. \nThe next section will extend the line to Crewe.\nThe final phase was to take HS2 to Manchester and Leeds.\nBut the Leeds leg is being scrapped. This had been billed as reducing the journey time from London to Leeds by 50 minutes.\nUnder the government's Integrated Rail Plan:\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the measures will mean faster journeys up to 10 years earlier than planned.\nBut opponents said he was watering down previous plans.\nThe decision not to go ahead with the eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds goes back on previous government pledges.\nIn May, Mr Shapps said the Birmingham to Leeds link would go ahead - and would be delivered earlier than planned.\n \"We are going to complete HS2 and include HS2 on the eastern leg to Leeds,\" he said.\nHe suggested the eastern leg could be brought forward \"quite dramatically\" by building it \"in a smarter way\".\nThe government says HS2 will cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, down to 52 minutes. \nOnce the second phase is complete, HS2 would also take an hour off journeys from Manchester to London.\nThe plan for the eastern leg was to join HS2 to the existing East Coast Main Line, leading to significantly faster journey times.\nFor example, travelling from London to Leeds currently takes two hours and 13 minutes. Under the HS2 plans it would have taken one hour and 21 minutes. The latest proposals mean it will take one hour and 53 minutes.\nCampaigners against HS2, including those living on the proposed route, have welcomed the news.\nOthers are not happy. Labour's Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said Mr Johnson had \"repeatedly promised\" the new high-speed Leeds-Manchester line would be \"built in full\", adding: \"Leeds and the North have been betrayed\".\nThe Northern Powerhouse Partnership, representing councils and businesses, said not including Bradford in the east-west upgrade would be \"disastrous\" in economic terms.\nThe London and Birmingham leg was due to open at the end of 2026. But this is now expected between 2029 and 2033.\nThe second phase was due to open in 2032-33, but has been pushed back to 2035-2040.\nThe current estimated cost of HS2 is between \u00a372bn and \u00a398bn (at 2019 prices), compared with an original budget of \u00a355.7bn in 2015 (at 2015 prices). \nBut this was made before the decision was taken to cancel the Leeds leg.\nManagement issues and unrealistic land valuations caused costs to spiral.  \nFormer executive Doug Thornton previously told BBC Panorama initial estimates for buying property and land were \"enormously wrong\".\nA 2019 Freedom of Information request revealed that property costs are forecast to reach \u00a35bn, compared to the original \u00a31.1bn estimate.\nHS2 also failed to carry out extensive soil surveys, causing problems for digging and excavation, according to the project's former chairman, Allan Cook.\nHS2 has faced a lot of opposition - much of it to do with the environmental impact.\nPressure group Stop HS2 believes it will increase carbon emissions and damage areas of natural beauty.\nProtesters, including veteran eco-protester Swampy, have built tunnels in an attempt disrupt HS2 construction.\nSupporters of HS2 say it will help cut the number of cars and lorries on the motorways, and reduce the demand for domestic flights."

      "text": "A state of emergency has been declared in the Canadian western province of British Columbia after a major storm cut road and rail links in the region. \nThe Canadian Armed Forces have been deployed to help thousands of stranded residents who have been trapped since the storm hit overnight on Sunday. \nLocal officials warned on Thursday that the price tag to rebuild could exceed C$1bn ($790m, \u00a3590m).\nOne woman was killed in a landslide, and two people are missing. \nOfficials expect more fatalities to be confirmed in the coming days. \nOne man caught up in the storm told the BBC the scenes afterwards were like \"Armageddon\".\nThousands of farm animals have died and many more remain trapped by the flood waters after the storm passed through one of Canada's most agriculturally intensive areas.\nSome 18,000 people are yet to return to their homes after an \"atmospheric river\" - a long strip of moisture in the air that transports water from tropical areas towards the poles - dumped the region's monthly rainfall average in 24 hours. \nAs of Thursday, nearly 7,000 properties remained under mandatory evacuation orders, with more than 2,500 others under evacuation advisory.\nBritish Columbia Premier John Horgan announced the two-week emergency order on Wednesday, in order to keep people off flooded roads and expedite rescues.\nHelicopters on Wednesday dropped food supplies to stranded mountain communities after slides destroyed roads and floods submerged major highways. \nApproximately 1,500 travellers became stranded in the town of Hope after roads closed, Grace Baptist Church Pastor Jeff Kuhn told BBC News in an email on Wednesday. Officials said about 1,000 people were able to leave the town on Thursday.\nSome highways have reopened, including Highway 7, connecting Hope to Vancouver. \nStore shelves have also seen their inventories running low, and officials have advised residents to conserve fuel.\nPeter Rzazewski lives in Burnaby, British Columbia, with his wife, Karina, and two dogs. But the couple has been stuck in the rural town of Hope since Sunday after visiting family in Lake Country. \nThey slept in their car Sunday and Monday nights before spending Tuesday night in the basement of a church and Wednesday night in a home offered to them through the church. \n\"When we got to Hope, it was the strangest thing because there were no lights on, all the power was out. We parked at a gas station under the canopy by one of the pumps and stayed the night,\" Mr Rzazewski told the BBC.\n\"It was like Armageddon. There were lots of cars, lots of people sleeping in cars.\"\nMr Rzazewski hopes that Highway 7 will stay open long enough to allow them to get home. \nOfficials in the region have attributed the natural disaster to the effects of climate change.\nMr Horgan said British Columbia must \"bring the seven billion other souls that live on this planet to understand that we need to act now\" to prevent these events in future.\nThe impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but we know that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\nUniversity of British Columbia atmospheric scientist Rachel White told the BBC that the massive devastation caused by this storm can likely be attributed to a combination of human-caused factors. \n\"As we warm up the climate, heavy rainfall events such as these are going to get more intense,\" she said.\n\"As we warm up the atmosphere, as we warm up the oceans - more water is evaporated from the oceans. So then when we have these atmospheric river events, essentially the atmosphere can carry more water towards our mountains.\" This then condenses into rain. \nThe extreme weather in Canada comes days after world leaders met for the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. \nThe same region, British Columbia, suffered a record high heat wave in the summer that killed more than 500 people as well as wildfires, including one that destroyed the village of Lytton."

      "tags": "Amazon,Personal finance,Credit cards",
      "text": "Amazon will stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the UK from 19 January, the online retail giant has said.\nIt said the move was due to high credit card transaction fees but said Visa debit cards would still be accepted.\nVisa said it was \"very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future\".\nAmazon said: \"The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers.\"\nThe online retailer said costs should be going down over time due to advances in technology, \"but instead they continue to stay high or even rise\".\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the dispute was to do with \"pretty egregious\" price rises from Visa over a number of years with no additional value to its service.\nAmazon is offering \u00a320 for Prime customers to switch from using Visa to an alternative payment method, and \u00a310 for other customers, if they have a Visa cards as their default or only payment method on their account.\nVisa said in a statement it was \"very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future. When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins.\"\nIt said it had \"a long-standing relationship with Amazon\" and that it was trying to resolve the situation so customers would be able to use Visa credit cards with Amazon UK.\nAmazon declined to say how much Visa charges the retailer to process transactions made on credit cards. \nVisa also declined to comment though it claimed that on average it takes less than 0.1% of the value of a purchase.\nAmazon and Visa said any changes in fees had nothing to do with Brexit.\nBoth Visa and its rival Mastercard have raised the so-called interchange fee on cross-border transactions between businesses in the UK and the European Union following Brexit. \nThe dispute between Amazon and Visa is to do with the fees the credit card company charges Amazon for its services in the UK.\nAmazon is also considering dropping Visa as a partner for its US co-branded credit card. \nIt is in talks with payment networks, including Mastercard, American Express and Visa - as part of what it calls a standard process, the BBC has learnt. \nThis row between two corporate titans is now being played out in full view of their customers.\nAmazon says Visa's fees are excessive, and an obstacle to low prices for consumers. Visa says its fees are competitive, has minimal effect on prices, and that nobody wins when choice is restricted.\nWhether or not this row is about fees, or whether that is just a smokescreen is largely irrelevant to consumers using these services. They just know they may have to change the way they pay on Amazon.\nYet, the timing is significant. These messages to customers hit home harder when people are regularly using Amazon for Christmas shopping.\nBut it also means there is still time before January 19 for a compromise to be reached.\nJames Andrews, senior personal finance editor at comparison website Money.co.uk, said the move \"will come as a blow to the millions of Britons\" who use Visa credit cards, including Barclaycard and HSBC customers.\n\"With American Express also rejected by many UK retailers, that means people looking for rewards on their spending or trying to split the cost of shopping with a 0% purchase card on Amazon will be effectively forced to choose a Mastercard,\" he said.\nHe added that a rewards card that is offered by Amazon is \"powered by Mastercard\".\nMastercard's executive vice chairman Ann Cairns, said: \"It's very important that customers have choice, and have the widest variety of ability to pay, whether that's through cards or from their bank accounts or cash, and remember that it is never the consumer that pays fees.\"\n\"We talk to Amazon all the time because obviously we are two big global businesses and Amazon is one of our top customers around the world.\"\nRetail analyst Steve Dresser said in a tweet that Amazon could be aiming to bring Visa fees down with its move.\nThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said credit card fees \"charged by the handful of card providers which dominate the cashless payment space have soared in recent years\". \n\"Small businesses are almost always charged more for card terminals than big corporates - so when online giants start throwing down the gauntlet, you know the situation is becoming critical,\" said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry.\nBusinesses have had ongoing concerns about credit card fees from the major providers.\nLast October, Visa and Mastercard were accused by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) of charging excessive fees. The trade body said they had doubled in two years. \nAt the time, the BRC warned that retailers would be forced to pass on costs to consumers, with credit card bills rising by up to \u00a340.\nThe Payment Systems Regulator said there were \"real questions about how well the cards market is working\".\n\"We will look into how well this market is working, including the issue of increasing card fees,\" a spokesman for the regulator said. \"If necessary we will intervene to address any issues we identify.\"\nHe said a final strategy would be published in the new year.\nVisa shares ended Wednesday's New York trading day down by 4.7%."

      "text": "The Covid-19 passport plan is ministers serving a \"distraction dish\" that will not relieve the pressures on hospitals, the DUP has said.\nOn Wednesday, Stormont ministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introduced in December.\nPeople will have to provide a passport or proof of a Covid test result to access nightclubs, pubs or restaurants. \nSinn F\u00e9in, SDLP, Alliance and UUP ministers backed the proposal but DUP ministers voted against it. \nThe party's South Belfast MLA Christopher Stalford said the plan did not address the root problems in the health service.\n\"The executive hasn't been presented with plans to deal with this or address the fact that pay and conditions for our care staff are utterly inadequate. \n\"Instead ministers were served up a distraction dish of Covid certification to enter a coffee shop.\"\nOn Wednesday First Minister Paul Givan said the plan for a Covid passport scheme should be put to a vote in the assembly.\nBut UUP MLA Alan Chambers said the DUP had a \"sheer brass neck\" to \"play politics\" with health. \n\"The DUP's fingerprints are all over the problems now faced by the health service, not least the staffing shortages which will take years to remedy.\n\"This is not leadership.\"\nHealth officials in Northern Ireland are drafting a second paper that will look at more measures that can be introduced to manage the spread of Covid-19.\nNorthern Ireland's chief scientific adviser Prof Ian Young said it was still possible to \"save\" Christmas. \nSpeaking to BBC NI's Evening Extra programme, he said Covid-19 certification was part of a number of measures brought in to reduce pressure on the hospital system and community transmission.\nHe added: \"None of us can give a complete guarantee that further restrictions won't be required but it's in everyone's hands to do the right things, to wear your face coverings, meet outdoors, reduce your unnecessary contacts and Covid certification will a be part of those measures to save us all from the need for further restrictions later this year and early next year.\"\nMeanwhile the chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) Northern Ireland's GP committee said the next step should be to require proof of a negative lateral flow test before entering a hospitality venue.\nDr Alan Stout said: \"These are measures that none of us want, but what we are seeing with the infection numbers as they are at the moment, with them climbing, with the pressures on the NHS, is that we are starting to see an exceptionally difficult position.\"\nMichael Cafolla, from the Northern Ireland Institute of Hospitality, said that the industry did not \"feel that we are part of any sort of masterplan in terms of how we are going to get out of this\".\n\"It feels like they have had a jigsaw in front of them for 18 months and they have put little pieces together, but we can't see the overall picture and that's very distressing for many of us within the industry.\"\nColin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the hospitality industry was frustrated but he said the debate around Covid passports had now moved on. \n\"We have lost the battle and our debate on this but are extremely annoyed we are being left alone to enforce it with no support.\"\nBefore ministers voted, it emerged that health officials warned that tougher restrictions may be required before Christmas even if proof of Covid status comes into force.\nIn its briefing paper for ministers, the department said that \"further immediate measures are required to increase adherence to continued mitigations, including use of face coverings, work from home, outdoor meetings, ventilation and limiting contacts\".\nThe paper also said that the number of positive cases had risen by 23% in Northern Ireland in the past week, hospital admissions were up 19% and hospital occupancy levels up 10%.\nQueen's University Belfast virologist Dr Connor Bamford said the passport scheme would be most effective if introduced in tandem with other measures.\nHe said it had the potential to both cut the risk of infection and encourage greater vaccine uptake, but that vaccine's were not a \"silver bullet\".\n\"There's multiple things we have to do because vaccinations are just not enough,\" he told BBC Radio Foyle.\nMaggie Hogg, from Glengormley was shielding during the last lockdown due to a lung condition.\nShe said the new measures will make her feel safer when visiting hospitality and entertainment venues. \n\"I would

      "tags": "Alec Baldwin,United States",
      "text": "A lawsuit against Alec Baldwin alleges that a film script did not require him to fire a gun when he fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\nScript supervisor Mamie Mitchell - who called police after the shooting on the New Mexico film set - filed the suit. \nHer lawyer accused the actor of \"playing Russian roulette\" when he fired the gun without checking it. \nMr Baldwin and the film's producers, who were also named in the lawsuit, have not yet commented. \nThe Hollywood actor has previously shared comments from a crew member rejecting suggestions that the film set was unsafe. \nAuthorities are still investigating the 21 October shooting that took place on the set of the Western film Rust. No criminal charges have been brought against anyone. \nMs Mitchell's lawsuit claims that the script called for three tight camera shots - one of Mr Baldwin's eyes, another of a bloodstain on his shoulder and a third of his torso \"as he reached his hand down to the holster and removed the gun\". \n\"There was nothing in the script about the gun being discharged by defendant Baldwin or by any other person,\" it says. \nIn a news conference on Wednesday, her lawyer Gloria Allred described the behaviour of Mr Baldwin and the film's producers as \"reckless\", as she accused them of failing to follow safety protocols. \nAccording to court records, Mr Baldwin was handed the weapon by the film's assistant director who did not know it contained live ammunition and indicated it was unloaded by shouting \"cold gun\". \nMs Allred said Mr Baldwin \"chose to play Russian roulette when he fired a gun without checking it and without having the armourer do so in his presence\". \nShe added that a range of safety failures meant that it was \"a case where injury or death was much more than just a possibility \u2014 it was a likely result\". \nMs Mitchell was standing less than 4ft (1.2m) away from Mr Baldwin when the weapon was discharged, according to the lawsuit. \n\"I relive the shooting and the sound of the explosion from the gun over and over again,\" she told reporters. \nHer lawsuit is claiming assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and deliberate infliction of harm, and is requesting unspecified damages.\nIt is the second to be filed over the incident, after the set's head electrician began legal action earlier this month.\nThe film's armourer, who was responsible for the guns and ammunition on set, has said she does not know how a live round came to be in the weapon."

It makes her drink more.\n\"[If she doesn't have them] it makes her really sleep, she lays around and doesn't have enough energy.\"\n\"Our big fear is having to go to hospital and if we cannot find these crisps, that's 100% a possibility,\" she added.\n\"It makes me very, very anxious. What seems like such a simple thing is huge for her.\"\nShe added many children with disorders that limit their eating tend to favour crisps, and she was aware of many families through social media who were also struggling.\nOn Thursday, Michelle told the BBC News Channel the family had received messages online from people around the country offering to supply them with crisps.\nShe added: \"There is a lot of people that experience this at all ages, but there has been a lot of judgement and a lot of very, very negative comments.\n\"This is a registered eating disorder and a lot of people don't really understand learning disabilities, autism, sensory eating or ARFID so there are misconceptions about what it is.\"\nNicole Kirkland, co-founder of charity ARFID Awareness UK, said many often looked down on the condition and those dealing with it. \nShe said: \"It often deals with complex carbohydrates and processed foods, just by the very nature that they are consistent, so you end up with crisps, white bread, cereal or fast food fries, so it can come across as lazy parenting. \n\"It really opens itself up to judgement but this is not just a kid that is a fussy eater.\n\"The mum is doing the best she can and unfortunately there is very little in the way of help and support for people out there.\"\nWalkers has said supply issues are expected to continue for several more weeks.\nThe Leicester-based firm is prioritising its more popular crisp flavours, such as cheese and onion and salt and vinegar.\nA spokeswoman said: \"We're doing everything we can to increase production and get people's favourites back on shelves. \n\"We're very sorry for the inconvenience caused.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "MPs have backed government plans to prevent them taking on certain jobs in addition to their work in Parliament.\nBoris Johnson made a surprise announcement on the proposals on Tuesday amid sleaze allegations about Conservative MPs. \nLabour has been calling for a ban for sometime and tried to get MPs to back its plan which it said was tougher.\nBut the government ordered its MPs to vote against the party's motion, defeating it by 51 votes.\nUnder the government's plan any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be \"within reasonable limits\" and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents.\nThis is yet to be defined, but International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has suggested 15 hours a week as a reasonable limit. \nIn a statement after the vote, the government said MPs had backed updating the code of conduct for MPs.\n\"This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents,\" it said.\n\"This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.\"\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had provided \"warm words\" instead of a \"plan of action\".\nHis party wanted the standards committee to draw up new rules by 31 January to implement the ban on MPs working as political consultants.\nAnd if the government did not then offer MPs a vote on these rules within 15 days, backbench MPs would gain the power to force one.\nUnder the government's plan, the committee would come up with recommendations by the same date, but steps for implementing the recommendations are not set out.\nLabour ordered its MPs not to take part in the vote on the government's amendment, meaning it was passed by 297 to zero.\nOn Wednesday night, MPs did vote to tighten up the rules on what they are allowed to do to earn money on the side.\nOr, at least, that when there are precise proposals, they will make decisions on it, at some not entirely precise date in the future...\nNo 10 hopes that it will be the end - or at least the beginning of the end - of the self-inflicted fortnight of bad headlines and claims of sleaze that have come, day after day after day.\nAnd, with that, allow the government to move on to make noise about what they are trying to get done, rather than the things that are going wrong.\nWill they get their way?\nRead more from Laura\nThe vote comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson again admitted it had been a \"mistake\" to try and overhaul the standards system at the same time as potentially saving Owen Paterson from punishment for breaking the existing rules on second jobs.\nBut the PM stopped short of apologising for the debacle, during a grilling by select committee chairs at the Commons Liaison Committee.\nHowever, at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson told his MPs he had \"crashed the car\" in the way he had handled Mr Paterson's disciplinary case.\nEarlier, he was involved in furious exchanges with Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, with the Labour leader branding him a \"coward\" over his stance on second jobs. \nIn the debate on second job rules, called by Labour, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was important for MPs to \"maintain connections to the world beyond so that we may draw on the insight and expertise that this experience offers\".\nBut he added that MPs \"should not be for sale\", saying: \"We are elected to Parliament on a promise to work for the greater good, not ourselves.\" \nLabour MPs dismissed the argument that MPs need to be allowed to do extra work for real world experience, arguing that being an MP is a full time job.\nThe party's shadow Commons leader, Thangam Debbonaire, said: \"There should be no MP taking money to be a political strategist, an assistant or some sort of corporate adviser. That should not happen.\"\nArguments over second jobs held by MPs outside of Westminster have intensified in recent weeks in the wake of the Mr Paterson's case.\nThe Conservative MP was found to have broken Commons rules by using his position to lobby for two companies paying him.\nThe government tried to block his suspension from Parliament and get the whole disciplinary process for MPs reviewed. \nBut it abandoned the plan a day later, after an outcry from opposition MPs and some Tories. Mr Paterson then resigned as an MP. \nAppearing in front of the Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson said he believed the MP had broken the rules, saying it was \"extraordinary\" that some of his colleagues \"behave in these ways\". \nThere's nothing to stop MPs - other than ministers - doing extra work on top of the job they were elected to do.\nThe rules do not prohibit them earning money - in addition to their \u00a381,932 salary - or gaining greater experience of the world beyond Westminster.\nSo, MPs can continue to work in professions like the law or medicine. Or they can work as consultants for companies, offering advice on strategy.\nBut they must not lobby - try to alter government policy - for firms, individuals or organisations who pay them, or use Commons facilities to do work on behalf of employers or clients.\nMPs have to register their outside earnings and if they take part in a debate or other parliamentary activities in which their employer/client is involved, they have to declare an interest.\nAny breaches of Parliament's code of conduct can result in punishment, including a suspension from the Commons."

      "tags": "Rail travel,HS2,High Speed Rail,Northern Powerhouse Rail,Grant Shapps",
      "text": "The government has scrapped the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail line as part of a package that ministers promise will transform services.\nThe prime minister said the overhaul would mean faster travel up to 10 years earlier than planned, and said claims of broken promises are \"total rubbish\".\nThe package won support from some business leaders, and anti-HS2 groups.\nBut Boris Johnson faced criticism that he had reneged on investment promises to the Midlands and north of England.\nThe axing of a new East Midlands-Leeds high-speed line, with HS2 trains now to run on existing upgraded routes, and a scaling back of the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project, drew strong condemnation.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson had \"ripped up\" promises he made that HS2 would go all the way to Leeds and that there would be a new NPR line from Manchester to Leeds.\n\"This was the first test of 'levelling up' and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North. You can't believe a word the Prime Minister says,\" he said.\nThere was also criticism that a significant portion of the \u00a396bn pledged as new investment has already been announced, such as \u00a3360m to improve ticketing.\nOn a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, Mr Johnson dismissed the charges of broken promises as \"total rubbish\", insisting the government would deliver on them \"eventually\".\n\"Of course there are going to be people who always want everything at once. And there are lots of people who are [going to] say, look, what we should do is carve huge new railways through virgin territory, smashing through unspoilt countryside and villages and do it all at once,\" he said.\nAnd in a BBC interview later the prime minister said that laying new track through countryside would take decades to complete.\nMr Johnson said: \"You can wait decades and dig up virgin countryside and plough through villages, but you have to wait an awful lot longer and it costs an awful lot more. \n\"I'm afraid that we are going to be building a huge amount of new line but what we're doing is doing it in the most efficient possible way and to bring the maximum possible commuter benefits.\" \nIn addition to the HS2 changes, there is also a scaling back of a new Trans-Pennine rail route between Manchester and Leeds as part of the NPR project to improve links between major northern cities. \nThe route between Leeds and Manchester will now be a combination of new track and enhancements to existing infrastructure.\n\"We're cutting journey times from Manchester in half from 2 hours 9 min to 1 hour 11 min,\" said Mr Johnson.\n\"We're also cutting times from Manchester to Leeds from 55 min to 33 min and [creating] a crossrail for the Midlands for the first time.\"\nHe added that there would also be a new high-speed line taking the time needed to travel from the West Midlands to East Midlands, from 1 hour 14 min down to 26 min. \n\"What that means is you will be able to have HS2 trains all the way up to Sheffield, taking half an hour off the time up to Sheffield,\" Mr Johnson stressed.\n\"You will have a crossrail for the north, a crossrail for the Midlands and then the HS2.\"\nTory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the plan, which had \"completely short-changed\" his constituents.\nBradford had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains.\n\"We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,\" Mr Moore said.\nDelivering the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) in the Commons, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs it was an \"ambitious and unparalleled programme\" to overhaul inter-city links across the north and Midlands, and \"speed up the benefits for local areas and serves destinations people most want to reach\".\nWork has already started on the first phase of HS2, linking London and the West Midlands. The next section will extend the line to Crewe.\nThe final phase was to take HS2 to Manchester and Leeds.\nCommenting on plans for rail links between the East Midlands to Leeds, Mr Shapps said: \"We'll study how best to take HS2 trains into Leeds as well\".\nHowever, that is likely to be via upgrades to existing rail network, a move condemned by MPs and regional business leaders who said a high-speed line was vital to the economic growth of the Midlands and north England.\nLabour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said: \"Today that promise has been broken, and Leeds and the North have been betrayed.\"\nAndy Bagnall, director general of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: \"While millions of people will benefit from this major investment in boosting connectivity between major cities in the North of England and the Midlands, leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero.\"\nby Katy Austin, BBC transport correspondent\nThe government's argument is that faster delivery at lower cost is now the best approach. It also makes the case for putting cash towards better local services, not just high speed inter-city connections. \nThat won't wash with those who will accept nothing but the original proposals for both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail - with their full capacity benefits, as well as journey times. They feel a promise is being broken. \nBradford is one example of this; a city whose leaders view a new, full high-speed link to both Manchester and Leeds as essential to regeneration.\nOpponents of HS2 - a controversial project - will see today's news as a relief. Although the door has not been fully closed to the eastern leg being completed at some future date. \nHowever, businesses in Yorkshire who hoped HS2 would bring jobs, investment and confidence, albeit not for a while, feel that opportunity has just been diminished. \nLabour also point out that despite the \u00a396bn label, much of this money had already been earmarked for HS2.\n'Waste of money'\nNews that part of HS2 was being scrapped was met with \"elation\" by campaigners against the line.\nSandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was pleased, \"not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer. It's a complete waste of money\".\nShe said: \"The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain.\"\nHowever, business people warned about the economic loss from scrapping the HS2 line. James Greenhalgh, who runs the Flamingos Coffee House, in Leeds, told the BBC it would deter investment in the city.\n\"We want to encourage other businesses to move up from London, up to Leeds, get people moving around and coming to our city centre. It is really tough, it is stopping businesses from expanding,\" he said.\nThere was praise, though, from business leaders at regional trade body Midlands Connect.\nChairman Sir John Peace said: \"Although these plans are different in some respects to what we'd expected, there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about - a new high-speed connection between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway, direct links onto HS2 for Derby, Nottingham, and Chesterfield and a commitment to the Midlands Rail Hub.\""

      "text": "Geordie Greig is stepping down as editor of the Daily Mail after three years in the role.\nHe will be replaced by Ted Verity, the current editor of the Mail on Sunday, who will have overall responsibility for both papers.\nAnnouncing the move, Lord Rothermere, chairman of the Mail's owner DMGT, said Greig had been \"outstanding\".\nGreig - who will now become a consultant editor - wished the newspaper \"continued good fortune\".\nEton-educated Greig joined the Daily Mail in 1983 as a junior reporter and has been its editor since 2018, when he replaced its long-running boss Paul Dacre.\nHe was previously editor of the Mail on Sunday and has also held editorships at society magazine Tatler and London's Evening Standard. \nAnnouncing the changes on Wednesday, Lord Rothermere said Verity will become editor of Mail Newspapers, a role that includes overall responsibility for the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.\n\"Under Geordie's leadership, the Daily Mail has continued to inform and entertain millions of readers with the very best journalism, becoming the biggest-selling newspaper in the UK and winning multiple prizes for daily newspaper of the year,\" said Lord Rothermere.\n\"Geordie has been an outstanding editor of the Daily Mail and, before that the Mail on Sunday, and I thank him for his contribution over the last decade.\"\nGreig said: \"I am grateful to Lord Rothermere for 10 extraordinary years as editor of his newspapers. I thank everyone who has worked with me; my colleagues have been heroic and inspiring.\n\"I wish my successor Ted Verity good luck and also continued good fortune to the Mail.\n\"I look forward to new opportunities ahead and will bring the best of what I learnt from my years at the Mail on which I first joined in 1983 as its most junior reporter on the graveyard shift.\" \nEarlier this week, Reuters reported other changes were being made to the newspaper group's leadership - with CEO of DMG Media Kevin Beatty retiring and being replaced by Richard Caccappolo, who is currently an executive at MailOnline."

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Justice,Prisons,Douglas Ross",
      "text": "Questions have been raised over why a registered sex offender was released early from prison before he went on to rape and murder a pensioner.\nJason Graham was released from prison on licence in 2018, part-way through a sentence for raping a retired nurse.\nHe went on to murder Esther Brown, 67, at her Glasgow flat in May, and has now been jailed for at least 19 years.\nScottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said there were \"glaring flaws\" in the system which put public safety at risk.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there would be a significant case review into how the sex offender - who had 23 previous convictions - was monitored, saying the processes in place \"clearly did not work\".\nGraham, 30, was jailed for seven and a half years in 2013 for rape - the latest in a lengthy string of offences. He was released on licence in 2018, and was meant to be monitored in the community.\nHowever in May 2021 he subjected Ms Brown to an \"utterly brutal\" attack, repeatedly punching, kicking and stamping on the retired librarian before buying a packet of cigarettes with her bank card.\nSentencing him to at least 19 years in prison, Lord Armstrong told Graham he had committed \"the gravest of crimes\" and \"the most depraved actions\".\nFriends of Ms Brown described her as a \"walking angel\" who helped prepare meals for the local community, and said there was widespread anger that Graham had been released early from his previous spell behind bars.\nAt Holyrood, the first minister said her \"thoughts and sympathies\" were with Ms Brown's family and friends, saying that \"nothing I can say will ease the pain that family is suffering\".\nMs Sturgeon said: \"There will be a significant case review that will assess the circumstances of the protection arrangements in place and the roles of the operational agencies.\n\"It is important to say that there are processes and procedures in place - which clearly did not work in this particularly tragic case - but there are processes in place to minimise risks posed by registered sex offenders.\"\nMr Ross said Graham had been \"released early and not monitored properly\", saying the case was \"another damning example of the glaring flaws in Scotland's justice system\".\nHe added: \"Those processes and procedures didn't save Esther Brown from being raped and murdered. So I'm sorry, that does not cut it when we are dealing with lives being lost.\n\"This government's course of action has let some of the worst offenders back onto our streets, free to commit further offences.\"\nUnder current rules, almost all prisoners serving less than four years are released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence. Those prisoners serving four years or more are eligible to have their case considered by the Parole Board at this point.\nThe Scottish Tory leader said the government was consulting on \"soft touch\" proposals for the justice system which could see even more prisoners released early, claiming that \"far too often, criminals are put first\".\nMinisters recently launched a consultation that could lead to shorter-term prisoners being released after serving a third of their sentence.\nMs Sturgeon said the government had legislated to end early automatic release in 2016 for longer-term prisoners, but said it was important to keep arrangements under review.\nShe said: \"We should all be on the side of victims, but also on the side of making Scotland as a whole safer.\n\"That does mean trying to make sure that we have a penal system in place that punishes, which is a vital principle of any justice system,  but that also helps us reduce the risk of reoffending.\n\"It is an easy soundbite for the Conservatives, but to describe a country as being soft touch on justice when we both have some of the lowest crime rates we've had in many years but also send a higher proportion of our population to prison than any other country in western Europe is simply not accurate.\""

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "The Queen has been seen taking part in public duties for the first time since she pulled out of the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph.\nShe was pictured having a face-to-face audience with Gen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, at Windsor Castle on Wednesday.\nThe monarch, 95, had to miss Sunday's event because she had a sprained back, Buckingham Palace said.\nThe palace had previously said it was the Queen's \"firm intention\" to attend. \nIt is the first time in nearly a month the Queen has been pictured carrying out an engagement in person. She had her regular face-to-face audience with Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week but was not pictured doing so. \nThe Queen was seen standing as she greeted Sir Nick for the military audience in Windsor's Oak Room. \nShe smiled as the pair shook hands and began chatting, with the Queen saying it was \"rather sad\" he was leaving his role. \nSir Nick, who is preparing to step down as armed forces chief at the end of the month, agreed \"it's a long time\", saying he had been in the post for eight years.\nThe Queen's pet dorgi Candy - a cross between a corgi and dachshund - could be seen at the door of the room as the military leader entered. \nThe Oak Room is the Queen's sitting room where she spends much of her time and doubles as her office.\nBefore their meeting, the Queen held an audience by video link with the Commanding Officers of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, Buckingham Palace said. \nPrince Charles, who was asked about his mother's health during his trip to Jordan, said: \"She's alright, thank you very much.\n\"Once you get to 95, it's not quite as easy as it used to be. It's bad enough at 73.\"\nThe Cenotaph service was due to be the first time the Queen was seen in public since taking time away from her duties for health reasons.\nShe had been advised by doctors to rest until mid-November after she spent a night in hospital on 20 October for checks. \nHowever, she did undertake some light duties during that time, including meeting ambassadors via video link from Windsor Castle. \nThe Queen, if not fully back at work, is sending a message that she's back in action. On her feet and engaged.\nIt's a picture that's meant to reassure after worries about her health. Even with some comfortable looking armchairs beside her, the monarch is standing.\nAccording to Palace sources, this engagement and a video audience were part of her planned, weekly \"light duties\" - and it shows she's able to carry them out.\nThe difficulty with the \"back sprain\" and not attending the Remembrance Sunday service was said to be the car journey and standing for half an hour - while these latest audiences were at home in Windsor Castle.\nThis follows a pattern. Over the past month the Queen has pulled out of events requiring travel including trips to Northern Ireland and COP26 in Glasgow.\nApart from a quick visit to her Sandringham estate in Norfolk, the head of the House of Windsor seems to be increasingly staying at home.\nShe also recorded a video message for the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, after pulling out of attending the event in person. \nAnd she missed the Festival of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall on Saturday, which was attended by Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William and Catherine.\nThe Queen was meant to attend the General Synod earlier this week, but her message to the Church of England was delivered by her son, the Earl of Wessex, instead.

      "tags": "Queen Elizabeth University Hospital,Glasgow,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The widow of a top Scottish government official, who died after contracting Covid, believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect the reputation of a troubled hospital.  \nAndrew Slorance went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago.  \nHis wife Louise believes he caught Covid there as well as another life-threatening infection. \nThe health board said it had been \"open and honest\". \nIt said there had been no attempt to conceal any information from the family.\nMr Slorance was head of the Scottish government's response and communication unit, which was responsible for its handling of the Covid pandemic.\nWhen he died First Minister Nicola Sturgeon led tributes, saying the government was devastated. \nShe described the father-of-five from Edinburgh as a \"wonderful person\" who made a difference in all he did. \nThe 49-year-old official went in to the \u00a3850m flagship Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) at the end of October 2020 for a stem cell transplant and chemotherapy as part of treatment for Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).\nHe died nearly six weeks into his stay, with the cause of his death listed as Covid pneumonia.\nBut after requesting a copy of his medical notes, Mrs Slorance discovered her husband had also been treated for an infection caused by a fungus called aspergillus, which had not been discussed with either of them during his hospital stay. \nThe infection is common in the environment but can be extremely dangerous for people with weak immune systems.  \nMrs Slorance questions whether it may have played a part in her husband's death, and if so, why she was not told?\nShe told the BBC: \"I think somebody and probably a number of people have made an active decision not to inform his family of that infection, either during his admission or post-death.\"\nMrs Slorance believes that officials wanted to protect the hospital, which is already the subject of a public inquiry, and its reputation, \"no matter what the cost\".\nShe said: \"The impact of the health board hiding the fungal infection will have lifelong impacts on all members of our family, including five children. \n\"The reason? To protect a building, a health board and political decision-making.\"\nMrs Slorance says a full investigation should take place into incidences of aspergillus at the hospital campus.\nIn response, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: \"Our thoughts and deepest sympathies remain with the family of Mr Slorance. \n\"At all times we have been open and honest with the family about the treatment provided and we are reaching out to them to further discuss the issues they have raised. \n\"After an initial clinical review, we are confident that the care and treatment provided was appropriate and we do not recognise the claims being made.\"\nThey added that infection control procedures at QEUH were \"rigorous and of the highest standard\" and they were providing support to the hospitals public inquiry. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to Mr Slorance in the Scottish Parliament, describing him as a \"greatly valued member of the Scottish government team\" who she said was \"greatly missed by everyone who had the privilege of working with him, and that includes me\".\nShe pledged to ensure his family would get the answers they are seeking, adding: \"I will not and this government will not tolerate cover-ups or secrecy on the part of any health board and where there are concerns about that we will address those concerns.\"\nBut Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the case was the latest in a series of scandals to have hit the hospital.\nHe added: \"This is the worst scandal of the devolution era and in any other country in the world there would be resignations and sackings, but under this government it is denial and cover-up.\"\nAfter it was raised in parliament, Dr Scott Davidson, deputy medical director at NHSGGC said: \"I would like to reiterate that as clinicians, our primary objective is to provide professional care and treatment for our patients and support their loved ones.  \n\"We don't act in bad faith, in secret or attempt to conceal information. That's not what any of our staff does, clinicians and managers, and to suggest otherwise is not acceptable.\n\"I hope that by meeting with the family, we can explain in detail the care provided to Mr Slorance, answer any questions they may have and provide some comfort going forward.\"\nMr Slorance was first treated for Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) in 2015, but suffered a relapse in 2019.\nA second stem cell transplant was delayed when the pandemic hit in March last year but he was finally admitted to the haematology ward at the QEUH on the 26 October 2020, after a negative Covid test.\nDespite being treated in an isolation room during this time, he tested positive eight days later on 3 November, and he was moved for his Covid treatment - eventually to intensive care.\nHis wife, who was at home with his three younger children, said that as Mr Slorance's condition deteriorated, she struggled to get information about what was happening.\nAspergillus is a common fungus, its spores are found in the air all around us.  For most people it will be harmless but it can cause serious infection in people who have weak immune systems.\nExperts say it is very difficult to confirm a diagnosis as the body can incubate it for some time, and high-risk patients are often treated for it as a precaution as they are particularly vulnerable to infections.  \nAndrew Slorance should have been shielded from bugs like this by special air filters as he underwent his transplant, but after testing positive for Covid he had to be moved for additional care, eventually to intensive care. \nHis cancer treatment was always going to be complex, but being exposed to other risks may have put him at greater danger.\nHis widow's anger comes from feeling she wasn't told the whole story.  And that anger is directed to a health board which has previously been criticised for poor communication with families. \nMrs Slorance said: \"On the phone I thought he sounded alright even as treatment was escalating.\n\"Then he went silent and wasn't speaking to any of us on the phone. I think I felt deep down that he was pushing us away to prepare us for the worst.\n\"But he came back to me eventually and said it was too hard to speak with the masks and everything else.\n\"But he actually spoke, and that was the last five-minute call with the kids before ventilation.\"\nMr Slorance was moved to ICU on 20 November of last year and died at 11:36 on 5 December.\nHis wife believes that he contracted Covid in the hospital when he should have been protected by strict infection control measures as his immune system was weakened by chemotherapy.\nMrs Slorance tried to piece together how he could have contracted the virus.\nShe spoke on the phone to her husband's former colleague, the Scottish government's National Clinical Director Jason Leitch, and said the exchange left her \"explosively angry\".\n\"I had a conversation with Jason Leitch where he suggested that Andrew could be in a different situation and therefore could have been incubating the Covid longer, and that the family could have been the source,\" she said.\nMrs Slorance said it felt like the blame was being put on the family. \n\"And yet everybody had spent seven months doing everything they possibly could to protect Andrew and keep him safe, and that impacted every aspect of our lives,\" she said.\nIn response, Prof Leitch issued a statement saying he was trying to provide support to a long-standing colleague and was in no way seeking to apportion responsibility for Mr Slorance's Covid infection to any particular person or group.  \nHe apologised sincerely for any distress that had been caused.\nProf Leitch said: \"Andrew Slorance was an outstanding public servant and he was pivotal in much of the work the Scottish government undertook in the early response to the pandemic. \n\"His loss is felt profoundly in the Scottish government, but this will only be a fraction of the loss that is being experienced by his family.\" \nMrs Slorance said the discovery that she had not been told the full details had \"put her grief in suspension\".\n\"I don't know what death I'm grieving,\" she said. \n\"It's not the one that you partially prepare for at the beginning of a treatment like this; it's not the one I was told about, the Covid.\n\"I'll never know if it was the aspergillus or the Covid, so I can't grieve a death I don't understand fully.\""

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,QAnon,United States",
      "text": "A prominent supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy has been sentenced to 41 months in prison for his involvement in the US Capitol riot.\nJacob Anthony Chansley was among the Trump supporters who tried to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election on 6 January.\nHe earlier pleaded guilty to one felony count of obstruction in an official proceeding.\nHis sentence is among the longest so far given in connection to the riots.\nIn addition to his prison sentence, Chansley was sentenced to 36 months of supervised release and must pay $100 (\u00a374) in restitution. \nThe 34-year-old became one of the most recognisable figures from the siege after being pictured wearing horns and a bearskin headdress, with a US flag painted on his face. He referred to himself as \"the QAnon Shaman\".\nFollowers of the QAnon conspiracy theory believe that former President Donald Trump was waging a secret war against a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media.\nFollowing his arrest, Chansley told the FBI that he came to DC in January \"at the request of the president\" that all \"patriots\" come to the city.\nIn court on Wednesday, Chansley said he wants to \"evolve\" and was \"wrong for entering the Capitol\".  \"I have no excuse,\" he said. \nHe also said has been asking himself \"what would Jesus do?\" and likened himself to Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, saying: \"What if we all judge Gandhi based on that he beat his wife before his spiritual awakening?\"\nHe has been in custody nearly 11 months since being arrested just days after the riot.\nPhotographs and videos taken during the riot show Chansley carrying a spear in the Capitol. Prosecutors also say he led other protesters in prayer at the dais - a raised platform - and left a note threatening former Vice-President Mike Pence.\n\"It's only a matter of time,\" the note read. \"Justice is coming!\"\nProsecutors had recommended a sentence of 51 months in prison, arguing that the government \"cannot overstate the serious\" of Chansley's conduct.\n\"His consistent rhetoric before and after the event, and his apparent ability to carry out his intentions of violently removing the 'traitors' in our government, is clear from the evidence in this case,\" prosecutors said.\nChansley now claims to have disavowed Mr Trump and QAnon.\nIn September, his attorney told the court that his client was \"non-violent, peaceful and possessed of genuine mental health issues\".\nHis 41-month sentence is one of the longest so far doled out to 6 January rioters.\nAnother participant, former mixed martial artist Scott Fairlam, was also sentenced to 41 months in prison earlier in November for assaulting a police officer and obstructing an official proceeding."

      "tags": "Liverpool hospital blast,Merseyside Police,Liverpool",
      "text": "A man who was killed outside Liverpool Women's Hospital on Remembrance Sunday when his homemade bomb went off has been identified as 32-year-old Emad Al Swealmeen. \nHe was an asylum seeker born in Iraq who is understood to have converted to Christianity in 2017. \nAl Swealmeen was the passenger of the taxi destroyed in the blast. The driver, David Perry, did not suffer life-threatening injuries.\nFour men were arrested under the Terrorism Act, but have since been released from police custody without charge. \nMerseyside Police were called at 10:59 GMT on 14 November to reports of a car explosion at Liverpool Women's Hospital.\nThe taxi carrying Al Swealmeen had pulled up to the hospital and exploded shortly afterwards. \nAl Swealmeen, who had been picked up from the Rutland Avenue area and asked to be taken to the hospital about 10 minutes away, died at the scene.\nOn Monday Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said the passenger appeared to have made an improvised device that caused the explosion. \nHe said officers investigating the incident could not \"at this time draw any connection\" with Remembrance Sunday events taking place near the hospital but he confirmed this was \"a line of inquiry\". \nTaxi driver David Perry has been discharged from hospital and his wife Rachel said it had been \"an utter miracle\" that he had escaped from the vehicle.\nMr Jackson said he could not confirm reports Mr Perry had locked the doors of the taxi before the explosion.\nHe said it appeared to have been an \"unremarkable journey\" to the hospital. \nAbout two hours after the blast, properties on Rutland Avenue near Sefton Park, in the south-east of the city, and in the Kensington area, east of the city centre, were raided by armed officers.\nThree arrests took place in Sutcliffe Street, in Kensington, where witnesses reported seeing armed officers approach a terraced house.\nThe second raid around Sutcliffe Street and the adjacent Boaler Street - about a mile from the hospital -  took place an hour later, at about 14:00 GMT. \nThere was a heavy police presence, including police negotiators, outside the house on Rutland Avenue overnight.\nPolice confirmed a controlled explosion had been carried out as a precaution in the Sefton Park area at about 16:00 GMT as part of the investigation but there was no wider risk to the public.\nMr Jackson said officers had made \"significant progress\" and had a \"much greater understanding of the component parts of the device, how they were obtained and how the parts are likely to have been assembled\". \nHe said following interviews with the arrested men, police were \"satisfied with the accounts they have provided\" and they were released from custody.\nThe wreckage of the taxi was removed on Wednesday and specialist officers were expected to continue searches at the hospital into Thursday, said Mr Jackson.\nA post mortem on Al Swealmeen found the cause of death to be \"injuries sustained from the fire and explosion\", he said.\nPolice have traced his next of kin who told them he was born in Iraq.\n\"Our inquiries have found that Al Swealmeen has had episodes of mental illness, this will form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand,\" said Mr Jackson.\nHe said they had not found any link to others in the Merseyside area but could not yet rule it out.\nNick Aldworth, a former counter terror co-ordinator, said investigators would be focused on what happened inside the vehicle.\n\"I have to say from what I've seen there is very little blast damage - a lot of fire damage but very little blast damage. So whatever was in that vehicle was either a low yield or didn't work properly or was possibly an incendiary.\"\nAl Swealmeen began making purchases for his attack in April, counter-terror police said.\nMr Jackson said the bomber had lived at a property in Sutcliffe Street for some time. And he began renting a property in Rutland Avenue in April. \nPolice recovered \"significant items\" from his latest address, where searches have been taking place since Sunday.\nAl Swealmeen is not believed to have been known to MI5, according to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera.\nOne of the members of his tribe in Jordan told the BBC that Al Swealmeen was Jordanian, but born in Iraq. His family settled in the United Arab Emirates in 1996. \nAl Swealmeen left for Syria 12 years ago, then headed to Turkey, eventually applying for asylum by claiming he was Syrian.\nThe tribe member - who knows Al Swealmeen's father - said the attacker had a history of mental illness.\nImmigration records seen by the BBC show Al Swealmeen was first refused asylum in the UK in 2014. He challenged the decision, but in April 2015 a judge ruled the Home Office had been correct. \nIn June 2015 he launched an attempt to overturn that decision, but that application was refused in August 2015 by the Upper Tier Tribunal - the court dedicated to immigration appeals.\nAt that stage the case appears to have been closed - and by 2017 friends of Al Swealmeen in Liverpool understood his legal avenues had been exhausted. \nWhether the Home Office ordered him to leave the UK is not clear. \nDuring this period he turned to Christianity and became known locally as Enzo Almeni, a name he adopted as part of his conversion. \nCourt records show that he then renewed his immigration appeal - under this alternative name - in January this year. His submissions were under review at the time of his death. \nA Christian couple, Elizabeth and Malcolm Hitchcott told ITV News that Al Swealmeen briefly lived with them at their Liverpool home after his conversion to Christianity.\nMr Hitchcott described him as a \"very quiet fellow\" who formally converted from Islam at a ceremony in Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral.  \nAl Swealmeen is believed to have been baptised in 2015 and confirmed in 2017 - before the cathedral lost contact with him in 2018, according to the Diocese of Liverpool's communication's director, Stuart Haynes.\nThe Reverend Mike Hindley said Al Swealmeen was involved in the Emmanuel Church in the Fazakerley area of Liverpool from 2017 to 2019, when they lost touch with him.\nA spokesman for the City of Liverpool College said Al Swealmeen was an adult cake decorating student at the college during the 2018-2019 academic year.\nIn the years before the attack, Al Swealmeen was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for about six months because of his behaviour with a knife, Mr Hitchcott said.\nAl Swealmeen was described as a \"lovely guy\" by Mrs Hitchcott, who told the BBC \"we just loved him\", adding she was saddened and \"very shocked\" by Sunday's incident.\nDid you witness what happened?

      "tags": "Asia,India",
      "text": "A five-day-old baby girl, who was rescued from a drain where she was left to die in the Indian city of Mumbai, is recovering in a local hospital. \nDoctors at the Rajawadi hospital told the BBC that she was \"doing fine\" and her health was being monitored.\nPolice said residents found the baby after a group of cats gathered at a spot along the road and began creating a ruckus - hissing, and purring loudly. \nOfficials are investigating how she ended up in the drain. \nPolice have not speculated on possible motives, but similar abandonments in the past have been blamed on India's preference for sons. Women are often discriminated against socially and girls are seen as a financial burden, particularly among poor communities. \nThe country's gender ratio is one of the worst in the world. And although most unwanted female foetuses are aborted with help from illegal sex determination clinics, cases of baby girls being killed or abandoned after birth are not uncommon either.\nIn the latest incident, the baby was rescued by a women-led police team from a suburban Mumbai neighbourhood on Sunday.\nWhen the police arrived, they found the infant lying inside the drain. They said the baby - dressed in a flimsy shirt and soaked in sewage water - was wailing in distress. \nTwo officers then scooped her out, wrapped her in a cloth and took her to the hospital. \n\"When we lifted the the baby out, she was freezing; her arms had turned blue. We asked for some warm water and cloth to clean the baby,\" police constable Sheetal Sonawane told the Times of India newspaper. \nDoctors at the Rajawadi hospital said the baby was \"stable\".\n\"Doctors are constantly monitoring her health. We will keep her under observation for the next few days,\" Dr Vidya Thakur, the medical superintendent of the hospital, told BBC Marathi. \nThe incident created a stir on social media. A photo shot by the Mumbai police at the scene showed officers cradling the newborn - wrapped in a white cloth - in their arms.\nSimilar incidents involving infant girls are routinely reported in India.\nTwo years back, a newborn baby was discovered buried alive in a clay pot in Bareilly town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\nIn the winter of 2016, an infant was found abandoned inside a plastic bag without any clothes in the capital, Delhi.\nAnd in June, a boatman in Uttar Pradesh state was praised after he rescued a baby girl found floating in a wooden box in the Ganges river.\nCampaigners say India's skewed preference for sons has resulted in millions of female foetuses being aborted over the past few decades.\nFormer Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described it as a \"national shame\" and called for a \"crusade\" to save girl babies. And soon after taking over in the summer of 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to Indians to stop killing their daughters."

She died in hospital on 8 July. \nTheir poisoning followed the attempted murder of Mr Skripal, his daughter and ex-police officer Nick Bailey in nearby Salisbury.\nThe attack was blamed on members of a Russian military intelligence squad who were believed to have smeared Novichok on Mr Skripal's door handle.\nAll three survived, as did Mr Rowley.\nThe inquiry is likely to be held in Salisbury Guildhall and at venues in London, and be established \"as soon as is reasonably possible in 2022\", Ms Patel said.\nIn a letter to coroner Baroness Heather Hallett, Ms Patel wrote: \"I am mindful of the time that has already passed since Ms Sturgess' death and her family's understandable wish for the investigation to be completed as soon as the circumstances of a highly complex and sensitive investigation allow.\n\"I support your view that the inquiry should be timely and hope that a proportionate, independent investigation will allow that to be met.\"\nShe said of Ms Sturgess' family: \"I hope this inquiry will bring comfort to them through a greater understanding of the circumstances of Ms Sturgess' death and recognise the bravery and resilience of those who responded.\" \nMs Sturgess's father, Stan Sturgess, said: \"We welcome the decision.\"\n\"Our legal team has worked tirelessly on our behalf and hopefully in the near future we will finally have closure.\"\nA further pre-inquest review is planned for next month.\nThe Metropolitan Police have identified three suspects wanted in connection with the poisonings: Denis Sergeev, Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga. \nWhile they were in the UK they used the aliases Sergey Fedotov, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.\nPolice have appealed to the public for any information about how the perfume bottle came to be found three months later eight miles (12.8km) from Salisbury. \nOfficers believe the three suspects identified so far are in Russia. \nThe UK has no extradition treaty with Russia meaning there is little prospect of the suspects being brought to the UK to face justice.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Transport,Rail travel,HS2,High Speed Rail,Northern Powerhouse Rail,Grant Shapps",
      "text": "A rail improvement programme will help transform services in the Midlands and northern England, the government has said ahead of the expected scrapping of part of the HS2 scheme.\nLocal service upgrades, bringing faster journeys, will happen up to 10 years earlier than planned, ministers say.\nThe plan will cost \u00a396bn, but only half of that is thought to be new money.\nIt comes as businesses reacted angrily to reports the East Midlands-Leeds HS2 high-speed line would not be built.\nHowever, campaigners against the HS2 have said they are \"elated\" by the reports.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil the plans this morning. \nSpeaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab denied that the government was rowing back on promises to \"level up\" the country with HS2. \nHe called the new plan \"good for the whole country\", adding: \"We are entirely delivering on the aspiration and ambition of the levelling up agenda.\"\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) says its Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) will improve journey times and capacity \"from London and across the Pennines\" and \"strengthen connections between major cities in the North and Midlands\". \nHS2 was originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. But sources have told the BBC that the eastern leg to Leeds is set to be scrapped.\nWriting in the Yorkshire Post, Mr Johnson appears to confirm reports that a shorter high-speed route will be created from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, with the HS2 trains then running up as far as Sheffield on mainline tracks. \nIn his article Mr Johnson wrote: \"HS2 will come to Sheffield, meaning a trip to or from London will take just one hour 27 minutes - precisely the same as under the old HS2 plans.\n\"We'll look at how to get HS2 to Leeds too, with a new study on the best way to make it happen.\n\"But high-speed rail is grindingly slow to build. Under the original blueprint, first drawn up more than a decade ago, Yorkshire would have not have seen the benefits of our investment until at least the 2040s. Levelling up can't wait that long.\"\nThe government is also expected to put money aside to explore setting up a tram service for Leeds and spend \u00a3360m on contactless ticketing across commuter rail networks.\nThe IRP was initiated after the 2020 Oakervee Review into major transport schemes including HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). \nBut the prime minister has come under pressure recently over claims the government intends to \"water down\" planned rail upgrades.\nThere has been outcry from some politicians and businesses in the north of England at reports that there will not be an entire new fast line between Leeds and Manchester, via Bradford. The improvements to the NPR east-west connections are likely to involve upgrades to existing infrastructure.\nTracy Brabin, Labour Mayor for West Yorkshire, told the BBC: \"If what we're hearing is true, it's a betrayal of the North and a betrayal of the people I represent.\n\"It's going to affect our potential and investment and opportunity, and it's just not good enough.\"\nHowever, earlier this week, Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 campaign group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was \"absolutely elated\", saying the proposed route would have brought \"untold devastation\" and \"heartbreak\" to communities along the line.\nNick Garthwaite, director of chemical manufacturer Christeyns Ltd in Bradford and vice chair of the West & North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, says he is disappointed by the reports that a new line between Manchester and Leeds may not be built.\n\"I feel the city and its people have been betrayed - we might not get the through railway station that Bradford so desperately needs and indeed was tacitly promised by government over a long period of time,\" he told the BBC.\nA key concern for businesses in Bradford is trying to attract more talent to come to work there, so not having good transport links is a problem.\n\"What I'm worried about is that these young talented people in Bradford will be thinking twice about staying in the city,\" he said.\nMr Garthwaite said it was likely that businesses would also consider locating new factories in other parts of England.\nHis concerns seem to be shared by others. A student told the BBC that many young people were now moving away from Bradford and Leeds to live in cities like Nottingham and Manchester, because the transport links were so poor. \n\"I'm definitely not going to be staying in Leeds or Bradford because it's not reliable enough,\" she said. \nSpeaking to the PA news agency on Tuesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"[People in the North] should definitely feel optimistic.\n\"Not only are we going to spend a huge amount of money doing this, we are going to deliver it decades before it would have otherwise happened.\"\nMr Shapps added that if he had been transport secretary 15 years ago with responsibility for HS2, then \"I would have started in the North and moved south, I think that would have made sense\".\nHe went on: \"The Northern Powerhouse Rail, the Midlands Connect - all of those did not exist when HS2 was first mooted, but we are where we are and it's being built and we need to make sure we connect it all up and that's what the Integrated Rail Plan intends to achieve.\"\nHowever, Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told the BBC's Today programme: \"I think we've got a real risk of disappointment across the North. \n\"The budget that's been promised, \u00a396bn, is about \u00a330bn less than the previous plans and what we were being offered. That means real cuts on the eastern leg, real cuts to the new line across the Pennines through Bradford.\" \nHe said it was now vital to ensure better connectivity between Leeds and Sheffield, as the North was \"going to lose on that connectivity to the West Midlands and London\".\nMick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, accused the government of using \"smoke and mirrors\" while breaking its promises.\n\"HS2 was meant to be a world-beater... instead, the Tories are letting us down,\" he said.\n\"This government is a government of broken promises. It has announced Northern Powerhouse Rail an incredible 60 times - and I know because we've counted - and now it puts the project in the bin.\"\nDo you live or work in Nottingham, Bradford or Leeds?

      "text": "Covid passes may be used over Christmas in order to keep pubs and restaurants open, the Welsh government has said.\nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford said no decision would be made on introducing the pass to the hospitality sector until early December.  \nMr Drakeford made the comments as he unveiled the latest 21-day review of Covid regulations. \nHe said there would be no rule changes in the next three weeks, following the latest review on Thursday. \nSome hospitality businesses said they needed \"time to react\" if Covid passes were going to be introduced and not a \"snap decision\".\nMr Drakeford said the government would be \"keeping the option of extending the use of the Covid pass\" to the hospitality sector, if case rates climbed and pandemic pressures on the NHS increased.\n\"We will continue to monitor the public health situation and we will work with the hospitality sector as we prepare for Christmas,\" he added.\nThe Conservatives said the passes were coercive, ineffective and anti-business, and demanded conditions for their removal.\nCovid passes are used to demonstrate if someone has been fully vaccinated or has tested negative in the past 48 hours. \nThey are already required for cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and large events. \nWales' Heath Minister Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast it's too early to say if Christmas will be \"normal\".\n\"The good news is that for this period we will not be introducing the Covid passes because the people of Wales have responded positively, they have really been respectful of the protection measures we have put in place.\n\"The last thing any of us want is to see the kind of crash-out Christmas that we saw last year and so we are obviously going to be keeping an eye on the situation.\"\nEmma Downey, the co-owner of Tides Kitchen and Wine Bar in Newport, Pembrokeshire, said she would be \"loathed to implement them\" in her business.\n\"In my opinion, Covid passports have no place in our industry or in society in general,\" she said. \n\"They have no place and it is already difficult with this uncertainty.\"\nShe said First Minister Mark Drakeford was bringing \"never-ending doom and gloom\" to the industry.\n\"We were looking forward to a more normal Christmas, which is how Mark Drakeford described it a few weeks ago, and now we are going into yet more uncertainty and it's just not good enough,\" she said. \n\"We are constantly taking the brunt of all these regulations... it's just too much for us now.\n\"I want to see the scientific evidence that Covid passes make any difference to the Covid cases because I don't think there is any out there.\"\nSimon Buckley, chairman of the Brewers of Wales, said the industry needed \"optimism\".\n\"We need the determination that we are going to be able to trade over Christmas and we will be able to do so unfettered and without undue influence,\" he said.\nHe claimed Covid passports had already had an adverse effect on nightclubs.\n\"We are in a position where the industry is on its knees and we are facing staff shortages, not caused by Brexit or anything else but by this constant fear,\" he said.\nIan Williams, the owner of Oxwich Bay Hotel on Gower, said \"what we don't want is what happened last year where something comes out of the bag and we have five hours to react\".\n\"The worst-case scenario for us is we would have to introduce a way of checking the Covid passes, whether that is something where people are able to go online like they did previously, I don't know, but I would have to manage it as we were informed,\" he said.\n\"The last thing we want is where it got to last year, when it went on and on, and then doing a snap decision, a decision that was made and pulled the rug from under us. \n\"If it keeps us open, the business going and customers who pre-booked are able to come, then fantastic, that's what we all want.\"\nWales remains at alert level zero so all businesses can stay open.\nAlthough Covid cases continue to rise in Wales, they are going up at a slower rate.\nThe seven-day rolling case rate per 100,000 people has risen again to 504.9, compared to 495.4 reported last week.\nGwynedd now has the highest case rate in Wales at 694.4, followed by the Vale of Glamorgan on 685.7 and Monmouthshire on 569.8.\nOn Thursday, Public Health Wales reported 20 further deaths with Covid and 2,576 new cases.\nIn the seven days to the 16 November, an average 6.8 people a day died with Covid in Wales.\nMr Drakeford added that pandemic \"hasn't gone away\", with many countries in Europe introducing tougher restrictions.\nThe Welsh government will have another review on 10 December.\nRussell George, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said: \"Vaccine passports are bad law: there is no evidence they work, whether that be limiting the spread of the virus or increasing uptake of the vaccine, and conditions for their withdrawal should be set out by the Labour government.\""

      "text": "Germany is in the grip of a \"dramatic\" fourth Covid wave, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said on the eve of a crisis meeting with regional leaders.\nDaily infections hit a new German record of 52,826 on Wednesday as European governments responded to a surge on much of the continent.\nBelgium announced a series of measures in an attempt to avoid a lockdown.\n\"All the alarm signals are red,\" said Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, as he told people to limit personal contact.\n\"Europe's map is quickly going red, and we are the same.\"\nChildren in Belgium will have to wear masks from the age of 10, rather than the current age of 12. Working from home will become compulsory from Saturday for four days a week. Passes known as Covid Safe Tickets will be required in theatres, cinemas and museums.\nA third booster vaccination will be rolled out for all Belgians by the end of April 2022.\nAustria which imposed a lockdown on an estimated two million unvaccinated people on Monday, reported record daily infections on Wednesday. The Netherlands, which also reported record cases, has already brought in a partial lockdown.\nSweden is introducing a Covid vaccination pass from 1 December for the first time for concerts and other indoor events involving more than 100 people. \"You who are unvaccinated cannot just carry on as normal; your most important contribution is to get vaccinated,\" said Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren, who accepted the measure was tough but said Sweden was not isolated from the rest of the world.\nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said anyone who had not been vaccinated (or could show they had had recovered from Covid-19) would be banned from accessing public events or services. From Monday, negative tests would no longer be enough.\nNeighbouring Slovakia, where a record 8,342 cases were reported on Wednesday, is planning similar measures: workplaces and non-essential shops will be accessible only to vaccinated staff or to people who could prove they have recovered, says Prime Minister Eduard Heger.\nVaccination rates vary across the continent. Slovak take-up is among the lowest in the EU at 44% while the Czech rate is 58%, in Austria it is 65% and in Germany 68%. \nBoth Germany and Austria have reported queues at vaccination centres, but they have some of the lowest take-up rates in Western Europe.\nAustria also has a very high incidence rate of 971.5 cases per 100,000 people, far higher than Germany's 319.5. \nAs well as its lockdown for the unvaccinated, some Austrian officials are calling for tighter restrictions for others too, such as a possible night-time curfew.\nAlthough Germany's overall death toll is far lower than that in the UK, 294 deaths have been recorded in 24 hours and Mrs Merkel spoke of an emergency with intensive care beds filling up in hospitals. The UK reported another 201 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for Covid on Wednesday, and a further 38,263 infections.\nMrs Merkel called for a faster booster drive, adding: \"It's not too late to decide to get a first vaccination.\"\nMany German regions are now only allowing vaccinated people access to most services, including bars, cafes, hairdressers and gyms.\nPolitically the situation is complicated as the outgoing Merkel government is set to be replaced by a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and pro-business liberals who aim to present planned Covid measures to parliament on Thursday.\nFrance is being hit by a fifth wave of Covid, according to government spokesperson Gabriel Attal, with more than 20,000 new cases reported on Wednesday for the first time since Augusts. But there are no plans beyond the current Covid passport as \"we are coping better than previously thanks to the vaccines and the health pass\".\nHe said France was light years away from the situation a year ago, and anyone aged 50-64 could now make an appointment for a third Covid vaccination.\nMore on Merkel: Germany's outgoing chancellor"

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Department of Health & Social Care,Social care,Liz Kendall",
      "text": "The financial help poorer people get to cover their care will not count towards a new cap on costs, the government has said.\nIt was announced in September that from 2023 no one in England would pay more than \u00a386,000 in care fees during their lifetime.\nNow it has been confirmed that support payments from local councils will not count towards this personal limit.\nLabour said it makes the cap \"an even bigger con than we initially thought\".\nCritics also argue it will make the cap harder to reach than under a previous version suggested by an official commission a decade ago.\nBut Boris Johnson has defended the government's plan, calling it a \"massive improvement\" on the current funding situation. \nMPs will vote on whether to support the plans next week.\nThe cap on personal care costs is a central element of the government's plans to change how adult social care in England is funded. \nFrom October 2023, the idea is that no one will pay more than \u00a386,000 over their lifetime for personal care, such as washing, dressing and eating.\nOnce people have reached this cap, ongoing costs for personal care will be paid for by local authorities.\nMoney spent on living costs - such as food, energy bills and accommodation - would not count towards the limit.\nThe threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will also be made more generous, with people with assets up to \u00a3100,000 able to qualify, rather than \u00a323,250 currently.\nThe government did not specify in September whether people receiving these payments would be able to put them towards reaching the cap.\nBut on Wednesday, it published guidance confirming that only payments people make out of their own pocket will count.\nThis contrasts with a previous blueprint for how the cap should work, made by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot in an official report in 2011. \nThis was put into law in the 2014 Care Act under the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, but delayed and then eventually ditched under David Cameron.\nUnder Sir Andrew's recommendations, payments from local authorities would be used to reach the cap.\nHe argued this was important to ensure poorer people receiving support for a long time did not just end up taking longer to reach the limit, rather than contributing less overall. \nGiving evidence to MPs on Thursday, Sir Andrew said he was \"very disappointed\" with the government plans announced on Wednesday.\nHe told them that it will mean poorer people will only hit the cap \"significantly later\" and won't end up benefiting as much. \n\"It will tend to hit people in regions of the country with lower house prices harder than it does those in regions with higher house prices,\" he added.\n\"So there is a sort of North-South axis to this, that people living in northern and other less high house price areas are likely to be hit harder by this on average.\"\nChief executive of the Resolution Foundation, Torsten Bell, also criticised the move, saying the new version of the cap \"will now offer little protection to poorer households' assets, while doing much more for those with significant assets - especially in the south of England.\"\nDirector of policy at charity The Kings Fund, Sally Warren, also called the change \"disappointing\".\nShe said those with low to moderate levels of wealth with be the worst affected, adding: \"They may well wonder why the prime minister's promise that no one need to sell their house to pay for care will benefit wealthier people but doesn't seem to apply to them.\"\nLiz Kendall, Labour's shadow social care minister, said it showed \"Boris Johnson's so-called cap on care costs is an even bigger con than we initially thought.\"\n\"It has now been revealed that the poorest pensioners will have to pay even more,\" she added.\n\"This Tory government has failed to be straight with those who've given so much to our country is a total disgrace, but utterly unsurprising. Our elderly people deserve better.\"\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the government's plans would be a \"massive improvement for everybody in the whole country\".\n\"What we're saying is for the first time in history we're stopping people having to pay unlimited quantities for their care,\" he added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow\nCovid case rates in England are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly surveillance figures reveal. The data, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) report shows 723 cases recorded per 100,000 among children aged five to nine. That's up week-on-week from 484.5 per 100,000. The rate for 10 to 19-year-olds is 694.2, up from 571.7. A further 46,807 coronavirus cases and 199 deaths were announced in the UK on Thursday. \nThe government has named 50 companies given fast-track \"VIP\" contracts to supply personal protective equipment (PPE) after the outbreak of Covid-19. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies that would usually be opened to competing bids. A \"high priority lane\" was set up, allowing MPs, ministers and senior officials to pass on offers of help to a special email inbox. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former Health Secretary Matt Hancock were among 18 Conservative politicians involved.\nNorthern Ireland's Covid-19 passport plan is a case of ministers serving a \"distraction dish\" that will not relieve the pressures on hospitals, the DUP has said. Stormont ministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introduced in December. People will have to provide a passport or proof of a Covid test result to access nightclubs, pubs or restaurants. Sinn F\u00e9in, SDLP, Alliance and UUP ministers backed the proposal but DUP ministers voted against it.\nA single vaccine dose is 56% effective at stopping children from catching coronavirus, data from Imperial College London suggests. The React Study processed samples from more than 100,000 volunteers of all ages between 19 October and 5 November. It suggests that 14 days after having one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, the risk of testing positive reduced by 56% in young people aged between 12 and 17 years old. The risk of developing a Covid infection with typical symptoms, such as a fever or loss of smell, was cut by an even greater amount - 68%.

      "text": "A minister has told MPs she has been \"unable to locate a formal note\" of a phone call between health minister Lord Bethell and Covid contractor Randox.\nLabour accused health minister Gillian Keegan of making \"ridiculous\" excuses to avoid transparency.\nIt wants to see minutes of the call and other details, amid controversy over \u00a3600m in contracts handed to Randox.\nOwen Paterson, who quit as an MP after being found to be a paid lobbyist for Randox, also sat in on the call.\nThe government has promised to publish the minutes - but when questioned about it in the Commons, Ms Keegan said she had not been able to find them.\nLabour's Dame Angela Eagle called it an \"astonishing revelation\".\nAnother Labour MP shouted: \"Staggering.\"\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he hoped the ministerial officials would look into this, adding: \"I would expect that government meetings that take place with people around would always be minuted.\"\nIn a statement, Randox said it would be \"pleased to co-operate fully in laying before the House all the material required\". \n\"Contrary to much of what has been written and broadcast, lobbying played no role in the awarding of these contracts.\" the company added. \nMr Paterson was found by the Commons standards watchdog to have engaged in paid lobbying of the government in his role as a \u00a3100,000 a year consultant for Randox.\nHe subsequently resigned as an MP and denies breaking Commons lobbying rules.\nDuring the pandemic, the diagnostics company was awarded nearly \u00a3600m in contracts without tender.\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said he was \"very happy to publish all the details of the Randox contracts, which have been investigated by the National Audit Office already\".\nBut opposition parties are attempting to force the government to release minutes of the telephone conference call between Randox executives, Mr Paterson and Lord Bethell that took place on 9 April 2020.\nLiberal Democrat former minister Alistair Carmichael asked Ms Keegan to publish the minutes of the call.\nShe replied: \"In terms of the minutes, I think we've said we will publish things here in the library.\"\nShe later added: \"We will review what information is held, that's in scope, and we will come back to Parliament and deposit them in the libraries of the House. We will commit to do that.\"\nPressed further by Labour MP Tony Lloyd on the Randox meeting, Ms Keegan said: \"The meeting he refers to was a courtesy call from the minister to Randox to discuss RNA extraction kits.\n\"That was declared on the ministerial register of calls and meetings, and we have been unable to locate a formal note of that meeting, but all the other notes that are available with regard to this - and that meeting, by the way, was after any contracts were let with Randox.\"\nLabour says a decision to award Randox a \u00a3347m contract \"having failed to deliver on a previous \u00a3133m contract\" was made after the conference call.\nThe party's chairman Anneliese Dodds challenged Ms Keegan to \"prove\" that no lobbying had taken place by publishing \"every dot and comma related to these deals\".\nShe also demanded an explanation for Lord Bethell's claim that he had accidentally deleted WhatsApp messages relating to Covid contracts, which she described as \"the 21st Century equivalent of 'the dog ate my homework'\".\nAnd she added: \"What's going on with these minutes about the phone call with Lord Bethell and Paterson?\"\nAccusing Ms Keegan of changing her story several times during the debate, the Labour MP said: \"Explain how many other meetings might not have been minuted. How many meetings might have minutes actually in reality but nobody knows where those minutes are? When are we going to see them?\n\"And explain why the government is so resistant to letting sunlight be the disinfectant that it needs to be on this process.\""

      "text": "Long delays outside hospitals are costing ambulance crews thousands of hours when they are unable to respond to other calls, a new report has found. \nIt found frequent delays were having a \"detrimental\" impact on the NHS's ability to care for patients.\nA Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) report looked at patient delays between April 2020 and March 2021.\nDuring this period, crews had to wait more than an hour to transfer patients on no fewer than 32,699 occasions.\n\"It's an entire system issue. I'm not under any illusion that's an easy fix for anyone, but we do need the system to work closely together,\" said Alun Jones, interim chief executive of HIW.  \nThey key findings of the report include:\nThe review was based on assessment, interviews and surveys with more than 400 NHS staff and more than 100 patients.\nHIW makes clear that handover delays are not directly an ambulance service problem, but symptomatic of problems across the entire health and social care system.\nA&Es become overcrowded when hospital wards are full and hospital wards become full when there are delays in discharging patients.\nThe report makes 20 recommendations and says the ambulance service, health boards and Welsh government need to work together to make improvements.\nClaire Roche of the Welsh Ambulance Service said: \"Our emergency ambulance service exists to deliver life-saving immediate care and to take patients promptly to hospital for the necessary treatment.\n\"For the Welsh Ambulance Service, this is about getting to the root cause of the issue in order to resolve it, rather than adapting to a situation so that it becomes the new normal.\n\"We welcome the fact that Health Inspectorate Wales is shining a light on this issue, and we will continue to work with colleagues in health boards and Welsh government to make improvements.\"\nDarren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation said the review \"demonstrates the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having\".\n\"The NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible,\" he added.\n\"Staff are doing all they can to continue delivering care for those who need it. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"Health boards are responsible for improving ambulance patient handover times and we expect to see them deliver improvement in this area.\n\"A broad range of actions are already in place, including recruitment of additional ambulance clinicians, creation of urgent primary care centres and a new national programme to support people to return home from hospital when ready.\"\n\"We will continue to work with the chief ambulance services commissioner, WAST and Wales' wider health and care system to improve quality of care, patient experience and staff wellbeing.\"\nChris Williams-Ellis was left with 45% burns after a car he was working beneath caught fire.\nHe waited an hour and 18 minutes for an ambulance despite eight 999 calls being made from his home in Brynsaithmarchog, Denbighshire, on 8 September last year. \nThe first was made at 14:51 by Mr Williams-Ellis's partner Catherine, followed by seven more from the fire service, the final one being at 16:04.\nAn air ambulance arrived at 16:17.\nHis mother, Philomene Williams-Ellis, said on Thursday: \"The ambulance was called and it didn't come.\n\"The time it took between when the call was made and when the helicopter landed at Liverpool was just a minute off three hours.\" \nAs he waited he was looked after by fire crews who were attending. \n\"The flesh was coming off his body, he was in absolute agony,\" Ms Williams-Ellis said. \n\"All the time Christopher waited he was fully aware of what was happening to him and what was happening around him.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service has met Ms Williams-Ellis to discuss what went wrong. \n\"There were 36 ambulances supposed to be on call that day,\" she said. \nFour were off \"for various reasons\", she said. \n\"Thirty-two were in car parks at various hospitals and they were there for hours and hours.\" \nThe reason, she said, was because patients were waiting in the vehicles until there was space for them to be seen in the hospitals. \n\"For almost an hour there was not one emergency vehicle available.\"\nShe said the NHS in Wales was \"not for purpose.\" \n\"The person who needs to answer is the minister for health in Wales and the trusts who are running the hospitals.\"\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service NHS trust offered a \"sincere apology\" last year for \"errors\" that contributed to an \"unacceptable\" delay.\nMs Williams-Ellis said her son was \"doing really well\". \n\"He has life-changing injuries but he is a very positive person with a good attitude.\n\"He gets on with it. But there is a lot of anger.\" "

      "text": "A cinema manager has refused to obey the Covid pass law, claiming it is an \"infringement of our human rights\".\nSince Monday, people must show an NHS Covid pass in Wales to legally enter cinemas, theatres and concert halls. \nBut Cinema & Co in Swansea will not be implementing the scheme, branding it \"nonsensical\" and \"unnecessary\". \nThe Welsh government said the law was to \"keep us all safe\", adding that it was down to local authorities to enforce the rules. \nIt comes as case rates in Wales continue to rise, up to 488.93 per 100,000 people on 11 November from a low point of 475.9 on 7 November.\nThe scheme, which applies to anyone over the age of 18, has been in place since 11 October for nightclubs and large-scale events. \nBut anyone wanting to go to the theatre, concert halls and cinemas must now also show the pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours.\nAnna Redfern, who manages the independent 56-seat cinema, said the \"unlawful\" law was \"a total infringement of our human rights\".\n\"I know a lot of businesses who are complying with this out of fear, I'm hoping by making a stand in this way it will give others courage to follow suit,\" she added.\nMs Redfern, who used to be a children's rights worker, said she was \"very aware of our rights\" and wanted \"everyone to be welcome\" at the cinema. \nIn a Facebook post, she noted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states \"all humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights\".\nShe said the Welsh government had \"discriminated against those exercising their right to bodily autonomy\". \n\"Covid passes do not give freedom, they take it away.\"\nShe added that it took her a lot of courage to put the post up on social media.\n\"I haven't been on social media since making the post but the amount of private messages I've had offering support and admiration for my courage. It's been really overwhelming.\"\nShe said the messages were from business owners and followers of the cinema. \n\"We should make these decisions for ourselves and not the government. They shouldn't be gatekeepers of culture.\" \nConcerns have previously been raised about the \"fairness\" of extending the law to other independent cinemas, which are smaller.\nThe Welsh government said: \"The use of the NHS covid pass for cinemas, theatres and concert halls is required by law in Wales - it is not optional for these venues.\n\"Cases of coronavirus in Wales remain very high. The NHS covid pass is another way we're strengthening the measures we have in place to keep us all safe.\"\nThe NHS covid pass is available digitally, but you need to register for an NHS login via the website."

This offers an injectable alternative for many people. \n\"The data and studies underpinning this recommendation are solid, and real-world experience suggests that patients that start injectable treatments prefer to stay on them.\"\nAlex Sparrowhawk, from Manchester, works for an HIV charity called the Terrence Higgins Trust. \nHe was diagnosed with HIV 12 years ago and has been on daily ART since. He says having a different treatment option available was exciting. \n\"This news is something a lot of people have been waiting for.\n\"The idea of having an injections six times in a year rather than taking daily medication certainly has some appeal. Remembering to take tablets each day is a constant reminder of HIV and it puts it front and centre. There is no getting away from it.\n\"Some people might live with other people who do not know their HIV status or have to work shifts or work in an industry that takes them around the world, making it more challenging to take daily medication.\"\nHe believes those most in need of the new treatment, such as those who are the most stigmatised, should be prioritised.

      "text": "A group of Afghan girl footballers have flown into the UK, the culmination of an extraordinary rescue effort that began after the Taliban seized power.\nThe costly operation brought together an unlikely cast of characters, from Muslim sports-people to spies, philanthropists, and a Hasidic rabbi.  \nThe girls - aged between 13 and 19 - arrived from Pakistan overnight. \nTheir flight was chartered by a Jewish aid organisation and was paid for by the US star, Kim Kardashian-West.\n\"It's Mission Accomplished,\" said Khalida Popal, former manager of Afghanistan's national women's team, who co-ordinated their rescue from Denmark. \"I'm so happy and so proud of these girls. They were traumatised. They've been through so much and managed to stay strong. Now they can start a new life and breathe freedom.\"\nRabbi Moshe Margaretten, President & Founder of the Jewish aid group, the Tzedek Association, expressed his relief. \"As the son and grandson of Holocaust survivors,  a time when righteous non-Jewish people stepped up to the plate to help save so many Jewish people, I know in my heart that we must be there for others in their time of need at a time when their very lives are at risk,\" he said.\nThe teenagers, mostly from the Afghan provinces, all feared for their lives when the Taliban captured their cities. Some of their families had received death threats.\n\"People were searching houses for them\" Ms Popal told the BBC. \nTerrified, they made their way to Kabul and were due to be evacuated to the Gulf state of Qatar at the end of August.\nThey were almost within sight of the airport when they were pulled off their buses because of security warnings. Two hours later, the airport was struck by a suicide bomb, killing more than 180 people.\nSo they went into hiding. \n10 days later, following intense lobbying on their behalf, they were given the personal permission of the Pakistani Prime Minister, Imran Khan, to cross the border. \nBut they only had temporary Pakistani visas. \nWith the clock ticking, a frantic effort to find them a new home began.\nThe girls had the support of Leeds United Football club chairman Andrea Radrizzani. They also had the ear of the UK government - through a chain of former interpreters for the British military and influential veterans. Last month, they were granted visas.\nBut they still needed funding to get them on a flight. Reality TV star Kim Kardashian-West and her shapewear company SKIMS agreed to cover the costs. \nA charter was organised, which flew the group of 130 people into Stansted airport last night. They are due to spend the next 10 days in quarantine.\n\"We've achieved our first goal,\" Khalida Popal told the BBC. \"The next goal is to work with footballing organisations to help them start new careers in football.\"  \n\"So many people were involved,\" Ms Popal said. \"It's the hardest thing I've done in my life.\"\nIn separate rescue missions, the women's national team was flown to Australia as part of the mass Western evacuation in August. And members of Afghanistan girls' team were given asylum in Portugal.\nBut dozens of young Afghan female footballers remain stuck in Afghanistan, desperate for a way out."

The government's \"keeping the option of extending the use of the Covid pass\", says First Minister Mark Drakeford, as it monitors infection rates and pressures on the NHS.\nSchool attendance in Northern Ireland is on the up with more pupils in lessons in the week of 8-12 November than at any point since the start of September.

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Conservative MPs he \"crashed the car\" in his handling of the case of the party's former MP Owen Paterson. \nIt comes after Tory MPs voted through a proposal that is expected to lead to a ban on them taking paid political consultancy work. \nLabour abstained from the vote, saying the government's plan was a watered down version of its own plan.\nNo 10 has faced weeks of political pressure over the Paterson row.\nMr Johnson has conceded publicly that he made a mistake in \"conflating\" changes to the Parliamentary standards system with the disciplinary process for Mr Paterson, who broke lobbying rules. \nBut the PM stopped short of apologising for the debacle, during a grilling by senior MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee.\nIn private, at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers on Wednesday night, he was even more candid - telling them he had \"crashed the car\" over the Paterson case. \nHis message was greeted with the traditional desk banging to show approval, but some MPs leaving the meeting had a more downbeat assessment.\nOne told the BBC the prime minister had looked and sounded \"weak\". Another, who backed him in the leadership campaign, said the meeting had been \"very flat\", with \"hostile questioning from all factions\".\nBBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt said one Brexit grandee told him \"it was awful - he's like an old rock star in need of new material\".\nLabour wanted the standards committee to draw up new rules by 31 January to implement the ban on MPs working as political consultants.\nBut the government ordered its MPs to vote against the opposition's motion, defeating it by 51 votes.\nThe government's amendment was passed by 297 to zero, after Labour ordered its MPs not to take part.\nUnder the government's plan any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be \"within reasonable limits\" and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents.\nThis is yet to be defined, but International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has suggested 15 hours a week would be a reasonable limit. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said limits could be placed on hours worked or the amount earned.\nLabour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said there was a lack of urgency in the government's plan, which has no timetable.\n\"People look at MPs and think it is just mired in sleaze. I think we need to sort this out quickly to restore the reputation of Parliament,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nIn a statement after the vote, the government said MPs had backed updating the code of conduct for MPs.\n\"This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents,\" it said.\n\"This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.\"\nThe Commons Committee on Standards is due to report its recommendations early next year. \nThe committee's chairman, Labour MP Chris Bryant, said it would then be up to ministers to find the necessary time to debate any planned changes.\nOn Wednesday night, MPs did vote to tighten up the rules on what they are allowed to do to earn money on the side.\nOr, at least, that when there are precise proposals, they will make decisions on it, at some not entirely precise date in the future...\nNo 10 hopes that it will be the end - or at least the beginning of the end - of the self-inflicted fortnight of bad headlines and claims of sleaze that have come, day after day after day.\nAnd, with that, allow the government to move on to make noise about what they are trying to get done, rather than the things that are going wrong.\nWill they get their way?\nRead more from Laura\nArguments over second jobs held by MPs outside of Westminster have intensified in recent weeks in the wake of the Owen Paterson case.\nThe Conservative MP was found to have broken Commons rules by using his position to lobby for two companies paying him.\nThe government tried to block his suspension from Parliament and get the whole disciplinary process for MPs reviewed.\nBut it abandoned the plan a day later, after an outcry from opposition MPs and some Tories. Mr Paterson then resigned as an MP.\nAppearing in front of the Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson said he believed the MP had broken the rules, saying it was \"extraordinary\" that some of his colleagues \"behave in these ways\".\nThere's nothing to stop MPs - other than ministers - doing extra work on top of the job they were elected to do.\nThe rules do not prohibit them earning money - in addition to their \u00a381,932 salary - or gaining greater experience of the world beyond Westminster.\nSo, MPs can continue to work in professions such as the law or medicine. Or they can work as consultants for companies, offering advice on strategy.\nBut they must not lobby - try to alter government policy - for firms, individuals or organisations who pay them, or use Commons facilities to do work on behalf of employers or clients.\nMPs have to register their outside earnings and if they take part in a debate or other parliamentary activities in which their employer or client is involved, they have to declare an interest.\nAny breaches of Parliament's code of conduct can result in punishment, including a suspension from the Commons."

      "text": "About 150 British army Royal Engineers will be sent to help reinforce Poland's border with Belarus, the defence secretary has said.\nThe border is seen as an entry point to the EU, and there have been tensions in recent weeks with Belarus being accused of pushing migrants towards it.\nBen Wallace said a small reconnaissance team of engineers had already been to the area to assess the situation.\nThey would not be combat troops but \"guys with diggers\", he added.\nBelarus's long-time authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, denies facilitating the arrival of migrants and sending them towards the border with Poland in revenge for EU sanctions imposed in June.\nThe crisis deepened on Tuesday when Polish forces used tear gas and water cannon to repel those trying to cross into the country.\nSome attempted to breach a heavily fortified crossing and threw missiles at the Polish forces, leaving several with injuries.\nMr Wallace said the engineers would be dispatched \"within days or weeks\" but said he would first inform parliament about the planned deployment.\nSpeaking to the BBC during a visit to Poland Mr Wallace said: \"What we will do is send some Royal Engineers - that is part of the Army designed for building or making fences or roads or putting in infrastructure. \n\"We are going to be using that part of our forces to help the Poles and potentially other Baltic states to secure their border.\" \nHe stressed the soldiers would not be combat troops but people with \"the ability to build roads and checkpoints and observation posts\", adding: \"This is not combat this is support to the Poles.\" \nOn the humanitarian situation, the defence secretary said: \"I'm particularly worried for the women and children and the vulnerable people who are being trafficked by the Belarusians into this game they seem to be playing. \n\"It's a horrendous thing to do to force migrants to be a tool in a game to try to destabilise their neighbours.\"\nDuring his visit Mr Wallace visited British troops already stationed in Poland as part of Nato's Enhanced Forward Presence. He also signed an agreement in principle to sell Poland air defence missiles.\nMigrants have been living in camps in freezing conditions and with little food or water just inside Belarus, stranded between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other.\nOn Wednesday, after more than a week of stalemate, Belarus said it had provided temporary shelter for about 1,000 people. \nPoland, with EU backing, is determined not to let the migrants into the bloc and has warned that the situation may go on for months.\nIt has also been accused of pushing people back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum.\nThe European Commission has accused Belarus of promising easy entry to the EU.\nBut Belarus has said it is trying to repatriate stranded migrants along the border, but that many have refused to return to their home countries."

      "text": "Covid passes may be used over Christmas in order to keep pubs and restaurants open, the Welsh government has said.\nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford said no decision would be made on introducing the pass to the hospitality sector until early December.  \nMr Drakeford made the comments as he unveiled the latest 21-day review of Covid regulations. \nHe said there would be no rule changes in the next three weeks, following the latest review on Thursday. \nSome hospitality businesses said they needed \"time to react\" if Covid passes were going to be introduced and not a \"snap decision\".\nMr Drakeford said the government would be \"keeping the option of extending the use of the Covid pass\" to the hospitality sector, if case rates climbed and pandemic pressures on the NHS increased.\n\"We will continue to monitor the public health situation and we will work with the hospitality sector as we prepare for Christmas,\" he added.\nThe Conservatives said the passes were coercive, ineffective and anti-business, and demanded conditions for their removal.\nCovid passes are used to demonstrate if someone has been fully vaccinated or has tested negative in the past 48 hours. \nThey are already required for cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and large events. \nWales' Heath Minister Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast it's too early to say if Christmas will be \"normal\".\n\"The good news is that for this period we will not be introducing the Covid passes because the people of Wales have responded positively, they have really been respectful of the protection measures we have put in place.\n\"The last thing any of us want is to see the kind of crash-out Christmas that we saw last year and so we are obviously going to be keeping an eye on the situation.\"\nEmma Downey, the co-owner of Tides Kitchen and Wine Bar in Newport, Pembrokeshire, said she would be \"loathed to implement them\" in her business.\n\"In my opinion, Covid passports have no place in our industry or in society in general,\" she said. \n\"They have no place and it is already difficult with this uncertainty.\"\nShe said First Minister Mark Drakeford was bringing \"never-ending doom and gloom\" to the industry.\n\"We were looking forward to a more normal Christmas, which is how Mark Drakeford described it a few weeks ago, and now we are going into yet more uncertainty and it's just not good enough,\" she said. \n\"We are constantly taking the brunt of all these regulations... it's just too much for us now.\n\"I want to see the scientific evidence that Covid passes make any difference to the Covid cases because I don't think there is any out there.\"\nSimon Buckley, chairman of the Brewers of Wales, said the industry needed \"optimism\".\n\"We need the determination that we are going to be able to trade over Christmas and we will be able to do so unfettered and without undue influence,\" he said.\nHe claimed Covid passports had already had an adverse effect on nightclubs.\n\"We are in a position where the industry is on its knees and we are facing staff shortages, not caused by Brexit or anything else but by this constant fear,\" he said.\nIan Williams, the owner of Oxwich Bay Hotel on Gower, said \"what we don't want is what happened last year where something comes out of the bag and we have five hours to react\".\n\"The worst-case scenario for us is we would have to introduce a way of checking the Covid passes, whether that is something where people are able to go online like they did previously, I don't know, but I would have to manage it as we were informed,\" he said.\n\"The last thing we want is where it got to last year, when it went on and on, and then doing a snap decision, a decision that was made and pulled the rug from under us. \n\"If it keeps us open, the business going and customers who pre-booked are able to come, then fantastic, that's what we all want.\"\nWales remains at alert level zero so all businesses can stay open.\nAlthough Covid cases continue to rise in Wales, they are going up at a slower rate.\nThe seven-day rolling case rate per 100,000 people has risen again to 504.9, compared to 495.4 reported last week.\nGwynedd now has the highest case rate in Wales at 694.4, followed by the Vale of Glamorgan on 685.7 and Monmouthshire on 569.8.\nOn Thursday, Public Health Wales reported 20 further deaths with Covid and 2,576 new cases.\nIn the seven days to the 16 November, an average 6.8 people a day died with Covid in Wales.\nMr Drakeford added that pandemic \"hasn't gone away\", with many countries in Europe introducing tougher restrictions.\nThe Welsh government will have another review on 10 December.\nRussell George, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said: \"Vaccine passports are bad law: there is no evidence they work, whether that be limiting the spread of the virus or increasing uptake of the vaccine, and conditions for their withdrawal should be set out by the Labour government.\""

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,David Frost,Ireland\u2013UK border,Brexit,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson",
      "text": "There is \"serious intent\" in the EU to solve post-Brexit difficulties over the Northern Ireland border, Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin has said.\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said the \"mood music\" surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal aims to avoid implementing border checks on the island of Ireland.\nIt keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nBut the protocol also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, meaning some goods such as meat and eggs are subject to checks when they enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain. \nThis has angered some Northern Irish politicians, including DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who said the protocol was disrupting businesses and harming trade. \nIn an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Martin admitted feeling \"frustrated\" that the issue had hindered the \"full flowering\" of the two sides' alliance.\nAnd he warned the UK against acting unilaterally, saying it would \"undermine\" relationships.\nThe Taoiseach's comments come ahead of a meeting between the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost and the EU Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d in Brussels on Friday aimed at resolving problems arising from the protocol. \nSpeaking immediately before his meeting with Lord Frost, Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d warned the post-Brexit trade deal was \"intrinsically linked\" to settling the protocol, adding: \"One cannot exist without the other\".\nHe ruled out a renegotiation of the protocol, insisting solutions were available within its framework, which could \"become reality if the UK plays its part\".\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d welcomed what he said was a \"change in tone\" from the UK during the negotiations, adding that he hoped \"actions will follow the words\".\nArriving for the talks, Lord Frost told reporters he was \"very much\" looking forward to seeing if progress could be made, adding that his preference was for a \"negotiated\" way through the problem, but if not, Article 16 of the protocol remained on the table.\nThe article allows either side to suspend any part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nIf the UK did trigger Article 16, the EU could respond by imposing tariffs on trade between the two sides. \nLord Frost warned there were still \"quite significant gaps\" between the two sides but welcomed the Taoiseach's comment about the EU's \"serious intent\" to resolve the difficulties.\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Martin insisted there was \"not an abundance of checks\" on the border and that Northern Ireland benefitted from having access to both the European and UK markets.\nHowever, he added that the EU \"sincerely\" wanted to engage with the problems, which he said could be \"resolved with goodwill on all sides\". \nHe acknowledged that \"there have been periods during these talks when they've dragged on with very little happening\" but added that \"now there's a bit of engagement, of serious intent\".\nMr Martin said the protocol was \"never going to be perfect\", adding: \"It's important that we don't allow perfect become the enemy of the good.\"\nHe also urged the prime minister to believe that Brussels' offer of compromise was genuine and urged him not to take too long to move towards a deal saying \"don't leave it to Christmas Eve this year\" - a reference to last year's Brexit deal which was agreed on 24 December.\nMr Martin is an affable kind of politician. \nUK ministers talk well of him in private. And clearly, like many leaders around the continent, and indeed like Downing Street, he would rather that a deal was done.  \nIt seems that he himself, having warned only a couple of weeks ago that the UK's threatened course of action would be \"reckless\" and \"unwise\", has concluded that it's wiser in contrast, to play down the tensions, to talk up the chances of a deal. \nBut there's still a rub. \nRead more from Laura\nEarlier this month, Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned that the whole post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU could collapse over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nBut, Mr Martin suggested the \"mood music\" had since changed.\n\"A number of weeks ago there was a different atmosphere governing the situation and there was all sorts of rumours and vibes... since then, that has calmed down somewhat,\" he said.\nBut he still warned the UK against acting \"unilaterally\", arguing it could \"undermine\" the two countries' relationship. \nThe full interview from BBC Newscast is available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds."

      "tags": "Northern Powerhouse,Transport,Rail travel,HS2,UK economy,High Speed Rail,Leeds",
      "text": "The government is set to scrap the eastern leg of HS2 between the Midlands and Leeds, sources have told the BBC.  \nThe Transport Department will instead announce a new rail plan on Thursday, involving \u00a396bn of funding for new routes in the North and Midlands. \nSources said the impact of scrapping the Leeds leg of HS2 would make journeys longer by 20 minutes.\nBut the government is set to argue the new plans will deliver comparable benefits more quickly and cheaply.\nA source told BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley they would show an \"enormous amount of common sense\".\nHigh Speed 2 is a planned new high-speed railway line, originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. \nBut Conservative MPs expressed concerns about the cost of the eastern leg connecting the West Midlands and Leeds, and there were rumours it would be scrapped. \nAccording to a report in the Sunday Times this weekend, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will announce two shorter high-speed routes created in part by upgrading existing lines. One will run between Leeds and Sheffield, another from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway.\nThe government is also expected to put money aside to explore setting up a tram service for Leeds. \nThe Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a group of northern local authorities and business leaders, said the decision to scrap the Leeds leg of HS2 was a mistake. \nDirector Henri Murison said: \"The reported loss of any of the new line on the eastern leg of HS2 is damaging, reducing the benefits of the section being built now between Birmingham and London. \n\"Without the benefits to areas such as Yorkshire and the North East, HS2's status as a project to drive the whole of the UK is undermined considerably.\"\nA proposed Northern Powerhouse route from Leeds to Manchester is now expected to be made up of some new line, but it will mostly consist of upgrades to the existing track.\nThe new track on the route will not allow high-speed rail travel.\nThe route is not expected to go via Bradford, a key request of many in the city and surrounding area.\nNaz Shah, the Labour MP for Bradford West, tweeted: \"This is Boris pulling the whole damn rug from under our feet and ripping up the floor behind him!\"\nby Katy Austin, BBC transport correspondent\nThe upcoming rail plan matters to many thousands of people and businesses. Whether they're taking a train for commuting, a business meeting or for leisure, what will their future options be? And how long will those journeys take?\nRumours that the eastern leg of HS2 could be scaled back or scrapped altogether have been swirling for months. It now looks likely that only part of the route linking the West Midlands with Yorkshire will get a new high-speed track.  \nThe government's view is that the alternative option for HS2 would still make journey times faster, but deliver benefits more quickly. There's clearly a cost element too. But it doesn't bring the same benefits when it comes to capacity.\nMeanwhile, there's disappointment in cities such as Bradford. They see the delivery of Northern Powerhouse Rail, including a new line from Leeds to Manchester via Bradford, as crucial to regeneration and creating opportunities for their residents.\nWe'll learn on Thursday what the final plans are. At the moment it looks like they will receive significantly more of a welcome in the East Midlands than the North of England.\nThe shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, accused the government of trying to back out of promises made on badly-needed major infrastructure projects, and described the reported plans as \"half-baked and repackaged\".\nConservative MP Kevin Hollinrake, who represents Thirsk and Malton in North Yorkshire, told the i newspaper the downsized plans indicated the government was \"not willing to put our money where our mouth is\".\nOf the \u00a396bn set aside for the new Integrated Rail Plan, \u00a340bn will be new money, the BBC understands."

      "text": "UK employers should stop asking jobseekers about their previous salaries, a campaign group is urging.\nThe Fawcett Society says asking about previous pay when recruiting contributes to the gender pay gap, by keeping women on lower wages.\nIts survey of 2,200 working adults found that 47% of people had been asked about past salaries.\nMeanwhile, 61% of women said the question had an impact on their confidence to negotiate better pay.\nThe Fawcett Society's chief executive Jemima Olchawski told the BBC that unless more is done, the gender pay gap will not be closed until at least 2050.\n\"We're calling on employers to make a simple change and stop asking potential employees about salary history,\" she said.\n\"Evidence shows that this will help to stamp out pay inequality, not only for women but for people of colour, and people with disabilities.\"\nThe campaign group warned that asking prospective candidates about their salary history meant companies could end up replicating gender pay gaps from other organisations.\nThe survey also found that 58% of women and 54% of men felt salary history questions meant they were offered a lower wage than they might otherwise have been paid.\nOnly a quarter of people feel that pay should be based on past salaries, compared to 80% of respondents, who felt that their pay should be based on their skill and responsibilities. \nThe campaign group also found that 77% of people felt their salaries should reflect the value of the work they do.\nThe report added that the pace of change to close the gender pay gap was \"glacial\". \nThe Fawcett Society stressed that more needed to be done by the government and employers to tackle its causes, such as stamping out discrimination.\nPeter Cheese, head of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), agrees that setting pay grades based on what people were paid in previous jobs can \"exacerbate the problem\".\nBut he believed questions about previous salaries were legitimate.\n\"I'm not convinced that employers should never ask about previous pay because it's not an unnatural question to ask,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Indeed, prospective employees will tend to raise their expectations about pay and that's a perfectly natural question in the recruitment process.\"\nHe said that the issue was becoming prominent now because the UK was in a tight labour market with \"upwards pressure\" on pay.\n\"We need to be honest about that - if we think we can get away with paying the absolute minimum, we might be disappointed about our ability to recruit,\" Mr Cheese added.\n\"What we want is to encourage employers to be transparent about how they pay; the basis under which they pay and how that reflects things like market dynamics; and that they communicate that to their own organisation, as well as to external recruits.\" "

They have conducted around 2,000 take-off and landings on board HMS Queen Elizabeth without any major incident over the past six months.\nThe aircraft are Britain's most advanced and expensive jets. Costing almost \u00a3100m, they can land vertically, similar to the Harrier Jump Jet, and combine radar-evading stealth technology with supersonic speeds.\nWith the pilot having ejected and now back on board, efforts now will be to recover the jet, each of which costs around \u00a3100m.\nThe F-35 is packed with highly sensitive technology and data. \nThe US-designed stealth jet - hard to detect on radar - is one of the most expensive defence projects undertaken by the American military. \nThis is the first time a UK F-35 has crashed, but there have been several involving US jets. \nIn 2018 the Pentagon briefly grounded its entire fleet of F-35s after the discovery of problems with the advanced fighter's fuel tubes. Those had been resolved.\nAn investigation is already under way into why the British jet came down.\nWith no other aircraft involved or hostile actions that investigation is likely to focus on a technical failure or potential human error.\nJets from HMS Queen Elizabeth previously participated in strikes against the remnants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\nThe 65,000-tonne Royal Navy flagship is returning to the UK from its maiden deployment, which included exercises with the Indian military.\nIt was part of the carrier strike group's deployment to the Indo-Pacific region amid heightened tensions with China.\nThe F-35s are operated by the renowned 617 Squadron, known as the \"Dambusters\".\nBuilt by the US firm Lockheed Martin, the UK's F-35s are the B variant of the jet and are flown by pilots from the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, based at RAF Marham in Norfolk.\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss spent time on board the vessel last month on the final day of her two-day visit to India."

      "text": "Northern Ireland ministers have voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports to be introduced from next month.\nUnder the measure, people have to provide a passport or proof of a Covid test result to access nightclubs, pubs or restaurants.\nDUP ministers voted against the proposal but Sinn F\u00e9in, SDLP, Alliance and UUP ministers backed it.\nSpeaking after the vote, Health Minister Robin Swann said ministers \"have to act\". \nHe said that the a Covid passport was not the only option for people wanting to enter hospitality premises under the scheme - people could also use a negative lateral flow test taken in the previous 48 hours or proof of a positive PCR test taken in the previous 30 to 180 days.\nMr Swann's plan would mean the regulations would take effect from 29 November but won't be legally enforced until 13 December, as there would be a 14-day grace period before fixed penalty notices could be issued. \nIt is understood the measure would apply for access to:\nMr Swann said: \"There's the three options there - it's not solely vaccination.\"\nHe added: \"Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress.\n\"We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.\"\nBut DUP First Minister Paul Givan said that this regulation should be put to a vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it takes effect.\nHe added: \"Whenever we ask questions around the economic impact assessment, none has been carried out.\n\"No equality impact assessment; no assessment in terms of human rights legislation and yet, other executive ministers felt they could support a policy that had flaws within that paper, even on the scientific evidence.\"\nDUP members have been outspoken in their opposition to the proposals.\nThe party's Paul Frew tweeted his vehement opposition to the mandatory Covid status plan.\nEast Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said it was a \"bad decision\" made in haste, which would cost the hospitality industry money it could not afford.\nHowever, SDLP minister Nichola Mallon challenged the DUP's decision to vote against the proposal, saying that \"the last thing people want is another Christmas apart from each other\". \n\"We need to use every tool in our toolbox\u2026 serious questions need to be asked of the DUP as to why they voted against it,\" she said. \nSinn F\u00e9in Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the Department of Health would now work on drafting a second paper that would look at other measures that can be introduced to manage the spread of Covid-19.\nColin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the executive's decision, and the lack of financial support, sent a signal that the hospitality industry is \"of no value or concern\".\n\"Evidence shows that this will negatively impact footfall and increase costs in the most important part of the year,\" he said.\n\"As the worst impacted industry, and the one singled out repeatedly for restrictions, we are facing an unknown future. Our industry will have to fight to retain staff and save businesses.\"\nPeople who have been vaccinated for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland can obtain certification by downloading the COVIDCert NI app.\nIt was released in July for use by people travelling abroad but was recently updated to allow users to hold a separate certificate for domestic use.\nPeople who have already downloaded their certification for international travel will be given an option to activate their domestic certificate.\nThat domestic certificate - in the form of a QR code - will scanned by venue staff using the separate COVIDCert Check NI app.\nIf the QR code is verified, the display will show a green screen containing a tick.\nIf the QR code is not verified, the display will show a red screen containing a cross.\nBoth apps can be downloaded for free from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.\nThe health department had warned that tougher Covid-19 restrictions could be required before Christmas even if proof of Covid status comes into force in Northern Ireland. \nIn its briefing paper for ministers, the department says evidence suggests that adherence to guidelines by the public is declining and that \"Covid certification on a voluntary basis by the hospitality sector\" has had low uptake.\nIt adds: \"We strongly advise that further immediate measures are required to increase adherence to continued mitigations, including use of face coverings, work from home, outdoor meetings, ventilation and limiting contacts.\"\n\"It is unlikely that this will be sufficient to reduce the R number (Rt) to less than 1 unless there is also widespread use of Covid certification across higher risk settings.\"\nThe paper says that in the past week the number of new positive cases has risen by 23% in Northern Ireland, hospital admissions have risen 19%, hospital occupancy is up 10% and the percentage of positive tests has also increased. \nIt added that although intensive care units occupancy and deaths have declined, those are described as \"lagging indicators in the context of increasing community transmission\".\nHigh-level discussions about introducing mandatory Covid passports for domestic use in Northern Ireland have been taking place since late summer.\nAt that stage, few of the political parties supported the idea. In September, the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Ms Mallon proposed the move to other executive colleagues.\nIt was voted down at that stage, with ministers instead opting to put in advice around vaccine certification mitigations but this was not legally enforceable.\nMs Mallon and the Alliance Party's Justice Minister Naomi Long both said they wanted to see compulsory vaccine passports being introduced ahead of the nightclub sector reopening in Northern Ireland on 31 October, when social distancing rules were also scrapped in hospitality venues.\nIn mid-October, Stormont ministers published a contingency plan which referred to the \"potential\" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in \"higher risk settings\" but said it would require agreement from the executive.\nOn 1 November, the Department of Health released the COVIDCert Check NI app to allow businesses to scan vaccine certificates \"voluntary use\" of vaccine checks in hospitality and entertainment venues."

      "text": "Bradford has the worst rail connections of any major British city, a report has found.\nDespite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located, it came bottom of the list due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections.\nThere are four trains to London - the best connected city - each day.\nLocal politicians said the findings proved Bradford needs a stop on the Northern Powerhouse Rail line.\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the data analysis, by the Be The Best Communications' People, Places, Policy and Data Unit, looked at more than 3,000 real-life train journeys between 20 cities and compared them with the same journey by road.\nThe report comes ahead of the publication of the government's Integrated Rail Plan, which will set out how major projects, including Northern Powerhouse Rail will be delivered.\nBradford Council and West Yorkshire Combined Authority has been campaigning for a Northern Powerhouse Rail station in Bradford city centre that would cut journey times to Manchester and Leeds.\nLeaders claim it would bring 6.7 million people and an area of more than \u00a3167 billion of annual economic output to within a 35-minute journey of central Bradford.\nAccording to Bradford Council the stop would boost the Bradford district economy by about \u00a330 billion over ten years, creating 27,000 new jobs.\nLeader Susan Hinchcliffe said: \"This new research shows that the city that would be the most improved by investing in better rail connections is Bradford.\"\nShe added it would \"transform the connectivity of three of Britain's largest cities [Bradford, Leeds and Manchester] using existing rail services, while also delivering a station able to handle Northern Powerhouse Rail services\" and \"cut around 44,000 daily car journeys between Leeds and Bradford, cutting congestion and delivering greener, more sustainable transport across the north [of England].\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Department of Health & Social Care,Social care,Liz Kendall",
      "text": "The financial help poorer people get to cover their care will not count towards a new cap on costs, the government has said.\nIt was announced in September that from 2023 no one in England would pay more than \u00a386,000 in care fees during their lifetime.\nNow it has been confirmed that support payments from local councils will not count towards this personal limit.\nLabour said it makes the cap \"an even bigger con than we initially thought\".\nCritics also argue it will make the cap harder to reach than under a previous version suggested by an official commission a decade ago.\nBut Boris Johnson has defended the government's plan, calling it a \"massive improvement\" on the current funding situation. \nMPs will vote on whether to support the plans next week.\nThe cap on personal care costs is a central element of the government's plans to change how adult social care in England is funded. \nFrom October 2023, the idea is that no one will pay more than \u00a386,000 over their lifetime for personal care, such as washing, dressing and eating.\nOnce people have reached this cap, ongoing costs for personal care will be paid for by local authorities.\nMoney spent on living costs - such as food, energy bills and accommodation - would not count towards the limit.\nThe threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will also be made more generous, with people with assets up to \u00a3100,000 able to qualify, rather than \u00a323,250 currently.\nThe government did not specify in September whether people receiving these payments would be able to put them towards reaching the cap.\nBut on Wednesday, it published guidance confirming that only payments people make out of their own pocket will count.\nThis contrasts with a previous blueprint for how the cap should work, made by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot in an official report in 2011. \nThis was put into law in the 2014 Care Act under the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, but delayed and then eventually ditched under David Cameron.\nUnder Sir Andrew's recommendations, payments from local authorities would be used to reach the cap.\nHe argued this was important to ensure poorer people receiving support for a long time did not just end up taking longer to reach the limit, rather than contributing less overall. \nGiving evidence to MPs on Thursday, Sir Andrew said he was \"very disappointed\" with the government plans announced on Wednesday.\nHe told them that it will mean poorer people will only hit the cap \"significantly later\" and won't end up benefiting as much. \n\"It will tend to hit people in regions of the country with lower house prices harder than it does those in regions with higher house prices,\" he added.\n\"So there is a sort of North-South axis to this, that people living in northern and other less high house price areas are likely to be hit harder by this on average.\"\nChief executive of the Resolution Foundation, Torsten Bell, also criticised the move, saying the new version of the cap \"will now offer little protection to poorer households' assets, while doing much more for those with significant assets - especially in the south of England.\"\nDirector of policy at charity The Kings Fund, Sally Warren, also called the change \"disappointing\".\nShe said those with low to moderate levels of wealth with be the worst affected, adding: \"They may well wonder why the prime minister's promise that no one need to sell their house to pay for care will benefit wealthier people but doesn't seem to apply to them.\"\nLiz Kendall, Labour's shadow social care minister, said it showed \"Boris Johnson's so-called cap on care costs is an even bigger con than we initially thought.\"\n\"It has now been revealed that the poorest pensioners will have to pay even more,\" she added.\n\"This Tory government has failed to be straight with those who've given so much to our country is a total disgrace, but utterly unsurprising. Our elderly people deserve better.\"\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the government's plans would be a \"massive improvement for everybody in the whole country\".\n\"What we're saying is for the first time in history we're stopping people having to pay unlimited quantities for their care,\" he added."

      "tags": "Transport,Rail travel,HS2,High Speed Rail,Northern Powerhouse Rail,Grant Shapps",
      "text": "A rail improvement programme will help transform services in the Midlands and northern England, the government has said ahead of the expected scrapping of part of the HS2 scheme.\nLocal service upgrades, bringing faster journeys, will happen up to 10 years earlier than planned, ministers say.\nThe plan will cost \u00a396bn, but only half of that is thought to be new money.\nIt comes as businesses reacted angrily to reports the East Midlands-Leeds HS2 high-speed line would not be built.\nHowever, campaigners against the HS2 have said they are \"elated\" by the reports.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil the plans this morning. \nSpeaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab denied that the government was rowing back on promises to \"level up\" the country with HS2. \nHe called the new plan \"good for the whole country\", adding: \"We are entirely delivering on the aspiration and ambition of the levelling up agenda.\"\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) says its Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) will improve journey times and capacity \"from London and across the Pennines\" and \"strengthen connections between major cities in the North and Midlands\". \nHS2 was originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. But sources have told the BBC that the eastern leg to Leeds is set to be scrapped.\nWriting in the Yorkshire Post, Mr Johnson appears to confirm reports that a shorter high-speed route will be created from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, with the HS2 trains then running up as far as Sheffield on mainline tracks. \nIn his article Mr Johnson wrote: \"HS2 will come to Sheffield, meaning a trip to or from London will take just one hour 27 minutes - precisely the same as under the old HS2 plans.\n\"We'll look at how to get HS2 to Leeds too, with a new study on the best way to make it happen.\n\"But high-speed rail is grindingly slow to build. Under the original blueprint, first drawn up more than a decade ago, Yorkshire would have not have seen the benefits of our investment until at least the 2040s. Levelling up can't wait that long.\"\nThe government is also expected to put money aside to explore setting up a tram service for Leeds and spend \u00a3360m on contactless ticketing across commuter rail networks.\nThe IRP was initiated after the 2020 Oakervee Review into major transport schemes including HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). \nBut the prime minister has come under pressure recently over claims the government intends to \"water down\" planned rail upgrades.\nThere has been outcry from some politicians and businesses in the north of England at reports that there will not be an entire new fast line between Leeds and Manchester, via Bradford. The improvements to the NPR east-west connections are likely to involve upgrades to existing infrastructure.\nTracy Brabin, Labour Mayor for West Yorkshire, told the BBC: \"If what we're hearing is true, it's a betrayal of the North and a betrayal of the people I represent.\n\"It's going to affect our potential and investment and opportunity, and it's just not good enough.\"\nHowever, earlier this week, Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 campaign group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was \"absolutely elated\", saying the proposed route would have brought \"untold devastation\" and \"heartbreak\" to communities along the line.\nNick Garthwaite, director of chemical manufacturer Christeyns Ltd in Bradford and vice chair of the West & North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, says he is disappointed by the reports that a new line between Manchester and Leeds may not be built.\n\"I feel the city and its people have been betrayed - we might not get the through railway station that Bradford so desperately needs and indeed was tacitly promised by government over a long period of time,\" he told the BBC.\nA key concern for businesses in Bradford is trying to attract more talent to come to work there, so not having good transport links is a problem.\n\"What I'm worried about is that these young talented people in Bradford will be thinking twice about staying in the city,\" he said.\nMr Garthwaite said it was likely that businesses would also consider locating new factories in other parts of England.\nHis concerns seem to be shared by others. A student told the BBC that many young people were now moving away from Bradford and Leeds to live in cities like Nottingham and Manchester, because the transport links were so poor. \n\"I'm definitely not going to be staying in Leeds or Bradford because it's not reliable enough,\" she said. \nSpeaking to the PA news agency on Tuesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"[People in the North] should definitely feel optimistic.\n\"Not only are we going to spend a huge amount of money doing this, we are going to deliver it decades before it would have otherwise happened.\"\nMr Shapps added that if he had been transport secretary 15 years ago with responsibility for HS2, then \"I would have started in the North and moved south, I think that would have made sense\".\nHe went on: \"The Northern Powerhouse Rail, the Midlands Connect - all of those did not exist when HS2 was first mooted, but we are where we are and it's being built and we need to make sure we connect it all up and that's what the Integrated Rail Plan intends to achieve.\"\nHowever, Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told the BBC's Today programme: \"I think we've got a real risk of disappointment across the North. \n\"The budget that's been promised, \u00a396bn, is about \u00a330bn less than the previous plans and what we were being offered. That means real cuts on the eastern leg, real cuts to the new line across the Pennines through Bradford.\" \nHe said it was now vital to ensure better connectivity between Leeds and Sheffield, as the North was \"going to lose on that connectivity to the West Midlands and London\".\nMick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, accused the government of using \"smoke and mirrors\" while breaking its promises.\n\"HS2 was meant to be a world-beater... instead, the Tories are letting us down,\" he said.\n\"This government is a government of broken promises. It has announced Northern Powerhouse Rail an incredible 60 times - and I know because we've counted - and now it puts the project in the bin.\"\nDo you live or work in Nottingham, Bradford or Leeds?

      "tags": "Liverpool hospital blast,Liverpool",
      "text": "A couple who were yards away from a bomb that exploded outside Liverpool Women's Hospital on Sunday say they have been left in \"shock\" and \"numb\".\nLiam Spencer and Stephanie Stitt, who were in their car at the time, told the BBC they felt a \"big impact\" and first thought there had been a crash. \nEmad Al Swealmeen was killed when his homemade device exploded inside a taxi. \nMr Spencer said he tried to pull Al Swealmeen from the burning wreckage of the taxi but the flames stopped him.\nThe 21-year-old, who used to work at the hospital, had been visiting with Ms Stitt to collect some of his possessions when the explosion happened just before 11:00 GMT. \nAfter grabbing Ms Stitt, 20, and taking her to the hospital's reception, Mr Spencer returned to the burning car.\nRealising that taxi driver David Perry was safe, and not knowing what had caused the explosion, Mr Spencer went to see if there were any passengers.\nSeeing a man in the back of the cab, Mr Spencer said: \"I went to go grab him but he became engulfed in flames very quickly and I couldn't reach hold of them without setting myself on fire.\"\nHe and Ms Stitt returned to get help and a fire extinguisher but the flames went up \"so, so quickly\". \nIt was only later the couple were told what had actually happened. \nMs Stitt said: \"At the time, I just couldn't stop shaking. I think it was just the adrenaline and the whole shock of everything. \n\"I haven't stopped crying because... I thought the car had been hit and then all this stuff had gone flying over the car and I'm just thinking that things could have been different, like my life could have been lost more than anything or I could be in a worse situation than I am now.\"\nTaxi driver David Perry escaped seconds before his car fully caught light and has since been discharged from hospital.\nHis wife has said he was lucky to be alive. \nIn the days after the explosion it emerged that 32-year-old Al Swealmeen, whose claims for asylum in the UK had been turned down, began making purchases for his attack in April.\nMr Spencer and Ms Stitt said they remained in shock at what they had witnessed. \n\"As much as I'm laughing and joking with everyone, like I would normally, there's just always that feeling in the back of my head,\" Mr Spencer said.\n\"Just what if things had gone different and I'm just constantly worried about 'what if?'.\"\nMs Stitt said: \"I think I'm the same really. I think at the minute I'm an emotional wreck.\n\"There's a lot of anger in a sense at times. Why did that have to happen to me, why did I have to be in that wrong place, wrong time?\"\nMr Spencer said Al Swealmeen was a \"coward\".\n\"I just think it's a selfish and cowardly thing to do.\"\nMs Stitt added that the couple wanted to thank the doctors and nurses at the hospital for \"helping us on that day and doing whatever they could to help\".\nDetails of Al Swealmeen's immigration legal history provided to the BBC by court officials show he had a long and complicated series of applications and appeals to remain in the UK.\nIt remains unclear whether the Home Office tried to remove him after his first failed application to stay, more than six years ago, and why his final appeal was unresolved. \nAccording to court records provided by officials, Al Swealmeen was first refused asylum in 2014 and lost further appeals in 2015.\nThe records show in August 2015 he began seeking to convert to Christianity and adopted a new name, Enzo Almeni.\nThey also document that he renewed his immigration appeal under this alternative name in January this year. \nHis submissions were under review at the time of his death and the Home Office has refused to discuss the case with BBC News.\nSheikh Salem Al-Suwailmieen, one of Al Swealmeen's extended family, said in a statement the suspected bomber's mother was from Iraq and confirmed he was born there.\nAl Swealmeen had suffered from periods of mental illness, which will \"form part of the investigation\", police said.\nOn Monday, the UK terror threat level was raised to severe after the Liverpool explosion - the second terrorist incident in a month following the death of Conservative MP Sir David Amess, who was stabbed multiple times during a meeting with his constituents in Essex on 15 October.\nAssistant Commissioner Matt Jukes, the most senior counter-terrorism policing officer in the UK, has urged the public to be vigilant in the run up to Christmas.\nAdditional reporting by Phil Kemp"

I travelled with the car and was on the bonnet for a few seconds.\"\nThe officer said he was aware his car was on the other side and feared he was going to be crushed.\nHe added: \"I felt myself propelling in the air and felt myself hitting the cobbles on the ground.\n\"My head and left shoulder smashed against the ground.

      "tags": "Rail travel,HS2,High Speed Rail,Northern Powerhouse Rail,Grant Shapps",
      "text": "The government has scrapped the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail line as part of a package that ministers promise will transform services.\nThe prime minister said the overhaul would mean faster travel up to 10 years earlier than planned, and said claims of broken promises are \"total rubbish\".\nThe package won support from some business leaders, and anti-HS2 groups.\nBut Boris Johnson faced criticism that he had reneged on investment promises to the Midlands and north of England.\nThe axing of a new East Midlands-Leeds high-speed line, with HS2 trains now to run on existing upgraded routes, and a scaling back of the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project, drew strong condemnation.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson had \"ripped up\" promises he made that HS2 would go all the way to Leeds and that there would be a new NPR line from Manchester to Leeds.\n\"This was the first test of 'levelling up' and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North. You can't believe a word the Prime Minister says,\" he said.\nThere was also criticism that a significant portion of the \u00a396bn pledged as new investment has already been announced, such as \u00a3360m to improve ticketing.\nOn a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, Mr Johnson dismissed the charges of broken promises as \"total rubbish\", insisting the government would deliver on them \"eventually\".\n\"Of course there are going to be people who always want everything at once. And there are lots of people who are [going to] say, look, what we should do is carve huge new railways through virgin territory, smashing through unspoilt countryside and villages and do it all at once,\" he said.\nAnd in a BBC interview later the prime minister said that laying new track through countryside would take decades to complete.\nMr Johnson said: \"You can wait decades and dig up virgin countryside and plough through villages, but you have to wait an awful lot longer and it costs an awful lot more. \n\"I'm afraid that we are going to be building a huge amount of new line but what we're doing is doing it in the most efficient possible way and to bring the maximum possible commuter benefits.\" \nIn addition to the HS2 changes, there is also a scaling back of a new Trans-Pennine rail route between Manchester and Leeds as part of the NPR project to improve links between major northern cities. \nThe route between Leeds and Manchester will now be a combination of new track and enhancements to existing infrastructure.\n\"We're cutting journey times from Manchester in half from 2 hours 9 min to 1 hour 11 min,\" said Mr Johnson.\n\"We're also cutting times from Manchester to Leeds from 55 min to 33 min and [creating] a crossrail for the Midlands for the first time.\"\nHe added that there would also be a new high-speed line taking the time needed to travel from the West Midlands to East Midlands, from 1 hour 14 min down to 26 min. \n\"What that means is you will be able to have HS2 trains all the way up to Sheffield, taking half an hour off the time up to Sheffield,\" Mr Johnson stressed.\n\"You will have a crossrail for the north, a crossrail for the Midlands and then the HS2.\"\nTory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the plan, which had \"completely short-changed\" his constituents.\nBradford had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains.\n\"We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,\" Mr Moore said.\nDelivering the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) in the Commons, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs it was an \"ambitious and unparalleled programme\" to overhaul inter-city links across the north and Midlands, and \"speed up the benefits for local areas and serves destinations people most want to reach\".\nWork has already started on the first phase of HS2, linking London and the West Midlands. The next section will extend the line to Crewe.\nThe final phase was to take HS2 to Manchester and Leeds.\nCommenting on plans for rail links between the East Midlands to Leeds, Mr Shapps said: \"We'll study how best to take HS2 trains into Leeds as well\".\nHowever, that is likely to be via upgrades to existing rail network, a move condemned by MPs and regional business leaders who said a high-speed line was vital to the economic growth of the Midlands and north England.\nLabour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said: \"Today that promise has been broken, and Leeds and the North have been betrayed.\"\nAndy Bagnall, director general of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: \"While millions of people will benefit from this major investment in boosting connectivity between major cities in the North of England and the Midlands, leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero.\"\nby Katy Austin, BBC transport correspondent\nThe government's argument is that faster delivery at lower cost is now the best approach. It also makes the case for putting cash towards better local services, not just high speed inter-city connections. \nThat won't wash with those who will accept nothing but the original proposals for both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail - with their full capacity benefits, as well as journey times. They feel a promise is being broken. \nBradford is one example of this; a city whose leaders view a new, full high-speed link to both Manchester and Leeds as essential to regeneration.\nOpponents of HS2 - a controversial project - will see today's news as a relief. Although the door has not been fully closed to the eastern leg being completed at some future date. \nHowever, businesses in Yorkshire who hoped HS2 would bring jobs, investment and confidence, albeit not for a while, feel that opportunity has just been diminished. \nLabour also point out that despite the \u00a396bn label, much of this money had already been earmarked for HS2.\n'Waste of money'\nNews that part of HS2 was being scrapped was met with \"elation\" by campaigners against the line.\nSandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was pleased, \"not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer. It's a complete waste of money\".\nShe said: \"The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain.\"\nHowever, business people warned about the economic loss from scrapping the HS2 line. James Greenhalgh, who runs the Flamingos Coffee House, in Leeds, told the BBC it would deter investment in the city.\n\"We want to encourage other businesses to move up from London, up to Leeds, get people moving around and coming to our city centre. It is really tough, it is stopping businesses from expanding,\" he said.\nThere was praise, though, from business leaders at regional trade body Midlands Connect.\nChairman Sir John Peace said: \"Although these plans are different in some respects to what we'd expected, there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about - a new high-speed connection between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway, direct links onto HS2 for Derby, Nottingham, and Chesterfield and a commitment to the Midlands Rail Hub.\""

The latest incident was in July this year, where an adult elephant was found decapitated with its tusks ripped off. "

The grey cloud is visible from five miles away.\nAsh and scorched paper from the recycling centre are falling onto the surrounding fields, I actually found a piece of someone's French homework on the ground.\nGrist Environmental serves communities from Swindon to Warminster and even into Somerset. Some of the site still seems to be operating as there are a handful of skip lorries coming in and out.\nPaul Mortimer, from Grist Environmental, said the fire was spotted by a company crew on patrol and was contained on a concrete floor with concrete walls and surrounded by a soil bund on two sides, which had prevented it from spreading.\nThe facility on Monument Hill consists of approximately 200-300 tonnes of residual waste that was destined for a Waste to Energy facility in Aylesbury.\nMr Mortimer said: \"Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue service were immediately notified and were very quickly in attendance to ensure that the fire was under control and not presenting any danger to people and property.\"\nFire appliances from Calne, Pewsey, Royal Wootton Bassett and Trowbridge were originally called to the scene, near the Fox and Hounds pub, along with local crews from Devizes.\nGroup manager Richard Coleman said: \"As this fire will be ongoing for a number of days we will update the public with any concerns regarding the smoke should they arise.\"\nThe Environment Agency has been notified and is liaising with the fire service.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Security forces in Uganda have shot dead a Muslim cleric accused of working with an armed group linked to suicide bombings in the capital Kampala.\nOfficials said Sheikh Muhammad Abas Kirevu had recruited for cells run by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) - rebels who have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. \nHe was killed just outside Kampala.\nAt least four people were killed by attackers on motorbikes who blew themselves up in the city on Tuesday. \nMore than 30 others were injured in the attack, which IS said it was behind and officials have blamed on the ADF.\nThe Islamist militant ADF was formed in Uganda in the 1990s but is now based in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since pledging allegiance to IS in 2019, it has increasingly carried out attacks in the group's name.  \nTwenty-one people have been arrested since Tuesday's attack, in what police have described as the dismantling of ADF terrorist cells in Kampala and across the country. \nPolice spokesperson Fred Enanga said 13 suspects, including several children, were intercepted while trying to cross the border into DR Congo. \nOn Wednesday, four suspected ADF operatives were killed near the border.\nA manhunt is also under way for another cleric, Sheikh Suleiman Nsubuga, who is accused of training terrorists, radicalising potential recruits, and providing materials to make improvised explosive devices.\nTuesday's attack was the latest in a number of recent bomb explosions in Kampala. \nLast month, a 20-year-old waitress was killed after a device, left in a shopping bag, detonated in a bar in the city. Days later several people were injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a bus near Kampala. Police say both were linked to the ADF.\nThe bombings on Tuesday marked the biggest attack the ADF has been linked to in Uganda since establishing relations with IS. "

      "text": "Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has banned trail hunting on its land. \nNRW, which manages 362,456 acres (146,681 hectares) of land, decided not to renew its agreement with the Masters of Foxhounds Association (MFHA).\nThe move comes after MFHA director Mark Hankinson was convicted of encouraging illegal fox hunting. \nTrail hunting was suspended on the NRW estate in November 2020 after a police probe into webinars involving hunters discussing the practice.\nThe MFHA was said it found the news \"disappointing\".\nTrail hunting involves hounds or beagles following a scent to replicate a traditional hunt without a fox being chased, injured or killed.\nNRW said it had \"lost confidence\" in the MFHA's \"ability to ensure its activities are carried out within the law and terms of its agreement\".\n\"In order to assure ourselves properly that trail hunting on our estate wasn't being used as a cover for illegal activity, we would have to invest in skills and resources that we currently don't have, to police it properly,\" said Dominic Driver, NRW's head of land stewardship.\n\"Given what has historically been a minor use of the land we manage, this does not represent good use of our limited resources.\"\nNRW's managed woodland alone covers more than 311,000 acres (126,000 hectares), almost 6% of the country, and about 40% of total Welsh forest. \nThis means it is the largest land manager in Wales, the organisation confirmed.\nThe move by NRW, which comes after the National Trust banned all trail hunts on its land last month, has been welcomed by the League Against Cruel Sports. \n\"For such a major landowner like Natural Resources Wales to permanently end trail hunting on its land is hugely significant,\" said deputy chief executive Chris Luffingham.\n\"The NRW board's robust condemnation of the hunts in the wake of the recent conviction is wholly appropriate, and other major landowners that had also suspended so-called trail hunting ahead of the trial must surely be in the process of ending this activity on their land. \n\"Trail hunting is a smokescreen for old-fashioned illegal hunting, and enough is enough.\"\nThe campaign group has renewed calls for other major landowners, including the Crown Estates, Duchy of Cornwall, local authorities and national park authorities, to end the practice on their land.\nThe Hunting Office is the executive arm of hunting's governing bodies, of which the MFHA is one. \nIt said: \"It is disappointing that NRW didn't consult with the MFHA before making this decision, however, we hope that further consultation may be possible following the review that we are currently conducting.\"\nCountryside Alliance Wales director Rachel Evans agreed it was \"disappointing\", adding she was concerned NRW's decision was politically motivated.\nShe said: \"This decision comes after a similar ban was implemented on game shooting, an activity which is incredibly important to the Welsh rural economy.\""

He maintains his innocence. \nHis case has attracted the support of celebrities including reality TV star Kim Kardashian and anti-death penalty activists.\nJones' execution by lethal injection was scheduled for 16:00 local time (2200 GMT) at the state penitentiary in McAlester.\nBut Gov Stitt, a Republican, said he intervened \"after prayerful consideration and reviewing materials presented by all sides of this case\".\nThe state's Pardon and Parole Board earlier recommended in a 3-1 majority vote that Jones' sentence be commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole.\nThe case has attracted widespread attention in recent years, partly due to the 2018 ABC documentary series \"The Last Defense\". \nMore than six million people have signed a Justice for Julius petition which states he was put on death row because of \"fundamental breakdowns in the system tasked with deciding\". \nJones was found guilty of fatally shooting Mr Howell, an insurance executive, during a 1999 carjacking on his driveway. \nIn October, he was among five people who won stays of execution from a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit US Court of Appeal.\n\"I did not kill Mr Howell,\" he wrote in a letter to the parole board in April, after exhausting his appeals. \n\"I did not participate in any way in his murder; and the first time I saw him was on television when his death was reported.\"\nBut Mr Howell's relatives have said Jones' calls for clemency have victimised them further.

      "text": "More than 500 excess deaths may have occurred in Northern Ireland's emergency departments between 2020 and 2021 due to crowding, a report has said.\nThe findings are from a Royal College of Emergency Medicine report.\nExcess deaths are a measure of how many more people died than would be expected based on figures from previous years.  \nThe Department of Health said it would study the report carefully, adding patient safety was its priority. \nThe UK-wide report, which looked at the harm crowding has on patients, calculated the Northern Ireland figure using a mathematical model. \nEmergency department overcrowding has made headlines recently as UK hospitals struggle to cope with rising numbers. \nThe report, which also examined the impact of prolonged waits, said that crowding has always been \"unconscionable\".\nIt said the figures for across the UK \"lay bare the reality that lives are being lost to an issue that could be eradicated for good\".\nIt calculated that as many as 566 excess deaths could have occurred in Northern Ireland between 2020 and 2021.\nWhile they cannot confirm at this stage the actual number, the report also suggested that, in time and with further research, the figure could prove to be higher.  \n2020 saw a huge and unexpected rise in deaths because of the pandemic.   \nThe president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Northern Ireland, Dr Paul Kerr, told BBC News NI that the findings should be \"treated with caution\". \n\"These figures are concerning,\" he said. \n\"However the calculation of the extra deaths associated with prolonged waits in emergency departments is complex and the methodology used in NHS England may not be directly applicable to Northern Ireland,\" he added.\n\"We hope this early work will lead to further work specifically for local hospitals, which we have been recommending for some time, to give a better insight into the harm caused by crowding and long waits for admission,\" he said. \nIn a statement, the Department of Health said emergency departments continue to face \"sustained and severe pressures\". \nIt said it had taken a range of actions to support them, including financial supports. \n\"The HSCB (Health and Social Care Board) is also working collaboratively with the Public Health Agency, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and the five provider Trusts to improve waiting times at our emergency departments, enhance flows through the system and facilitate timely discharge,\" the department said. \nThe report, which specifically examines hospitals in England, calls on the government to restore bed capacity to what it was pre-pandemic. \nIt said workforce planning is also essential, which must include actions to retain existing staff who are reaching burnout as well as efforts to recruit new staff.  \nBy applying mortality data and figures for those who waited between eight to 12 hours in an emergency department, the report estimated 303 excess deaths in Scotland, 709 in Wales and 4,519 in England.\nThe report also said that what these figures do not show is the harm that may come to those waiting even longer than 12 hours."

      "text": "Covid passes have been extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls in Wales.\nThe new rule comes into effect from Monday.\nPeople in Wales already required an NHS Covid pass to legally enter nightclubs and large events.\nAnyone aged over 18 is required to show the pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 24 hours.\nSo how do you get a Covid pass, how will they work and how does Wales compare with the rest of the UK?\nAnyone who is aged over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result in the previous 48 hours, can get a pass.\nHowever they are only compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter:\nPasses are also a way of proving you do not need to self-isolate, if you have been identified as a close contact of a positive Covid case and can be used when travelling abroad.\nThe Welsh government says any venue that can serve alcohol, is open between midnight and 05:00 and where music is provided for dancing will need to check for passes.\nThat means it could cover other venues not traditionally considered nightclubs that have a late licence.\nVenues can either apply the pass rules from when they open their doors, or when they open their dancefloor.\nThe NHS Covid Pass is available digitally but you need to register for an NHS login via the website.\nYou will need to upload a photo of your ID (passport, full UK driving licence, full European driving licence). \nThis will allow you to produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, a computer or laptop.\nYour NHS Covid Pass includes a barcode. The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status.\nIt's worth noting that in Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England. This is also different to the NHS Covid-19 app which alerts you if you've been close to someone with the virus.\nIf you do not have photographic ID you will need to request a paper NHS Covid certificate.\nCall 0300 303 5667 for a paper copy at least five days after your final dose.\nIt is an offence to deliberately use a fake Covid pass or produce a fake lateral flow test (LFT).\nPeople caught using fake LFTs or a fake Covid pass could be given a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) of \u00a360.\nThis can be reduced to \u00a330 if paid within 14 days, but if it's not a first offence the FPN would double to \u00a3120.\nIf there is any doubt about whether documents are real, the Welsh government said a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) should be contacted.\nIf venues do not follow the rules, they could receive an improvement or closure notice, FPN or be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nPasses have been freely available for some time and venues could already read it with existing technology.\nBut if they don't have the verifier app, they may judge them by sight.\nFestivals, such as Green Man in the Brecon Beacons, have already been using the system.\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"These measures are examples of what Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] calls low-cost interventions, which may be enough to prevent the need for tougher restrictions later on.\"\nCouncil enforcement teams will work with businesses to check they are following the rules.\nFor those people living close to the border, your GP may actually be in England.\nIn that case you may need to use the NHS App system for England.\nSince 1 October, people in Scotland have needed a Covid vaccination certificate to enter nightclubs, adult entertainment venues and large-scale events.\nThe UK government decided not to go ahead with vaccine passports in England, despite saying they would be introduced at the end of September.\nBut they might be considered again later, if there is a Covid surge over the winter.\nNorthern Ireland has not yet announced whether it will introduce a similar scheme.\nThe rules also apply to those coming to Wales. The idea is that visiting teams will let fans know.\nThere may be some flexibility on checks to avoid long queues outside stadiums. \nBut venues should be ready to work with the police and councils to decide when it is reasonable to relax checks.\nIt renews for 30 days every time you download it.\nThis has been a tricky one that the cabinet has been wrestling with, having met four times to debate the issue.\nThe first minister said they were \"acutely aware\" of the implications for civil liberties and were giving relevant sectors time to prepare before passes were introduced on 11 October.\nHowever, he added people also had rights to live in a society where everyone takes \"reasonable measures\" to keep each other safe.\nThe Welsh government also hopes introducing Covid passes will improve vaccination rates, particularly among younger people.\nJodie Beck, from human rights group Liberty, said: \"While we welcome the decision to not exclude those who have not received the vaccine from attending large events, the introduction of a vaccine pass in Wales still sets a dangerous precedent.\n\"Vaccine passports under any name mean more coercion and division, and risk creating a two-tier society where people who are already marginalised will see their rights and autonomy most affected.\"\nGenerally, no. The Welsh government wanted to avoid excluding those who have not had, or been able to have, a vaccine by including those with a recent negative test.\nHowever, workers, performers and so on, will not require a pass as there are already rules in place for employers to safeguard workers."

It will be lovely to have more, we would love to be able to kind of have a great amount of influence over the way that the LGBTQ stories are covered by everyone.\"\n\"We'd love to have more influence in the world, we want to grow more inclusive,\" she said. \nLast month, a Stephen Nolan investigation for BBC Sounds looked at the relationship between Stonewall and public organisations, including the Scottish government and the BBC.\nThere has also been controversy over a BBC online article, published last month, which asked: \"Is a lesbian transphobic if she does not want to have sex with trans women?\"\nThe BBC said at the time it must \"ensure debate and make sure a wide a range of voices are heard\".\nAsked about the example of Stonewall encouraging workplace staff to declare their pronouns at the same time as the BBC was trying to cover the debate around whether that should happen, Ms Kelley said that would have come down to editorial decision-making.\nShe acknowledged that, if the BBC was effectively being marked down on the charity's equality index for not following Stonewall's guidance, that could create a perception of being on one side or the other.\n\"Of course I understand how that would create the perception,\" she said.\n\"On the other side, what the BBC actually does in terms of its coverage, which I don't think does evidence any sign of being aggressively pro-trans rights. And in fact, some of the coverage has tilted a bit the other way recently.\""
