      "text": "Health minister Nadine Dorries wants women to feel they can demand different treatment, if they are unhappy with how medical staff are looking after them.\nMs Dorries, who deals with patient safety, suicide prevention and mental health, said she was \"very aware\" women faced inequalities in healthcare. \nShe said unconscious biases against women had \"always been an issue\". \nIt comes as the government calls for public views to inform England's first women's health strategy.\nMs Dorries said: \"I want women to be more confident and not to take no for an answer. \n\"And if you are still in pain and if you are not being taken seriously and if your GP is not referring you on for consultant treatment then ask for it - demand it - because it is your right to do so.\"\nAsked by BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour presenter Emma Barnett if she thought the NHS was \"sexist\", Ms Dorries said: \"I think sexist is a strong word to use, particularly about a system which has a predominate number of female doctors and nurses working within it.\n\"But I think the system gets into the people who are working within the system - and they become part of that system -  possibly sometimes unknowingly.\"\nShe added that women often told her they had not been listened to, and this had been a core theme of many inquires, reports and recommendations. \nMs Dorries said: \"I think there has been unconscious biases against women since the beginning of time. I'm going back to the whole connection between hysterectomy and hysteria for example.\" \nMeanwhile Elinor Cleghorn, medical historian and author, told the same programme she thought the NHS was systemically sexist. \nBut she said: \"I feel strongly that the responsibility for changing medical culture should not be on women\". \nShe said this was particularly the case when women's concerns had been dismissed. \nShe discussed her own diagnosis of lupus - an autoimmune disease - which she explained happened after many years of trying to get answers for her symptoms.\nMeanwhile Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said women's health was a major priority for the college. \nHe added: \"GPs want to work with their patients to make shared and mutually acceptable decisions about their health, based on their individual circumstances, taking into account benefits and risks, as well as patient need.\"\nIn the online call for public evidence to inform the women's health strategy, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \" For generations, women have lived with a health and care system that is mostly designed by men, for men.\n\"This has meant that not enough is known about conditions that only affect women, or about how conditions that affect both men and women impact women in different ways.\"\nHe added that this could lead to poorer advice, diagnoses and worse outcomes.  \nAbout 100,000 women, organisations, clinicians and carers have responded to the call for evidence so far. \nBut the government says its early findings show some groups are under-represented.\nMinisters are urging women from minority ethnic backgrounds, people living in the Midlands and east of England, women between the ages of 16 and 18 years old and those over 50, to respond.

      "text": "Masked gunmen have shot dead 10 mine clearers working for the Halo Trust in Afghanistan's northern province of Baghlan, and wounded more than a dozen.\nThe workers were killed when gunmen burst into their compound at 21:50 (17:20 GMT) on Tuesday, after they had spent a day removing mines from a nearby field.\nThe Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attack.\nAfghan officials had blamed the Taliban, who denied involvement.\nHalo Trust CEO James Cowan told the BBC that the local Taliban had, on the contrary, helped in the aftermath.\nIS made the claim in a statement via its channels on the messaging app Telegram.\nViolence has surged in Afghanistan since the US began to withdraw its last troops on 1 May.\nThe departure of international troops comes amid a deadlock in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.\nMr Cowan of the Halo Trust told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the attackers had gone \"bed to bed\" shooting the workers \"in cold blood\" - but that the local Taliban had helped the deminers.\n\"I think it's important to know that the Taliban have denied responsibility for this, and indeed the local Taliban group came to our aid and scared the assailants off,\" he said. \n\"I think we have the capacity as the Halo Trust to operate on both sides of the line in this awful conflict,\" he added.\nMr Cowan later told the BBC Afghan service that the attackers had specifically targeted members of the Hazara ethnic minority group.\nHazaras, Afghanistan's third-largest ethnic group, have faced long-term discrimination and persecution, primarily because of their Shia Muslim faith. In recent years, they have faced abductions and killings at the hands of IS and the Taliban, which are both Sunni Muslim.\n\"A group of armed men came to our camp and sought out members of the Hazara community, and then murdered them,\" Mr Cowan said. \"This was not expected. The broader security situation [in Afghanistan] is understood, but this kind of cold-blooded killing was not expected.\"\nAfter an interior ministry spokesman told reporters that the Taliban had carried out the attack, the militant group's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, tweeted that it condemned attacks on the defenceless.\n\"We have normal relations with NGOs [non-governmental organisations]. Our Mujahideen will never carry out such brutal attacks,\" he said.\nSeveral districts in Baghlan province have seen fierce fighting between the Taliban and government forces.\nAnalysis by Inayatulhaq Yasini, BBC Kabul bureau editor\nHalo Trust and other demining organisations have been working in Afghanistan for more than three decades, freely moving even near frontlines, a fact I have seen for myself.  \nHalo Trust has 3,000 staff in Afghanistan. Warring factions have been helpful to deminers in the past - however it has been rare for the Taliban or other groups to come forward to help victims of an attack. Halo Trust mostly hires local people, which also creates jobs for local communities. \nThe organisation's CEO, James Cowan, told the BBC the attackers had \"fled to an area which is not controlled by the Taliban\". The province of Baghlan where the attack happened has been the scene of fighting between the government and the Taliban for weeks. Anyone can exploit a situation where different local militias and warlords are also active in the province. \nThe aim of the attack is clear: to incite ethnic tension among Afghans, where 40 years of war has already widely affected unity in the country.\nIn a clip police in Baghlan shared with reporters, a survivor of the attack also said the gunmen had asked if any of them were from the Hazara minority community before opening fire.\n\"Five to six armed men came, they took us to a room,\" he said. \"First they took all our money and mobile phones, and then they asked who our leader was. They asked, 'Is any Hazara here among you?' We told them, 'We don't have any Hazara here.'\"\nHe added that he had been shot in the head, but managed to escape through a window.\nThe UK-based Halo Trust was founded in 1988 to remove ordnance left behind from the almost decade-long Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.\nIt was supported by Princess Diana, as well as by her son Prince Harry."

      "tags": "Medical research,Mosquitoes,Infection",
      "text": "Dengue fever cases have been cut by 77% in a \"groundbreaking\" trial that manipulates the mosquitoes that spread it, say scientists. \nThey used mosquitoes infected with \"miraculous\" bacteria that reduce the insect's ability to spread dengue. \nThe trial took place in Yogyakarta city, Indonesia, and is being expanded in the hope of eradicating the virus. \nThe World Mosquito Programme team says it could be a solution to a virus that has gone around the world. \nFew people had heard of dengue 50 years ago, but it has been a relentless slow-burning pandemic and cases have increased dramatically. \nIn 1970, only nine countries had faced severe dengue outbreaks, now there are up to 400 million infections a year. \nDengue is commonly known as \"break-bone fever\" because it causes severe pain in muscles and bones and explosive outbreaks can overwhelm hospitals. \nThe trial used mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria. One of the researchers, Dr Katie Anders, describes them as \"naturally miraculous\".\nWolbachia doesn't harm the mosquito, but it camps out in the same parts of its body that the dengue virus needs to get into. \nThe bacteria compete for resources and make it much harder for dengue virus to replicate, so the mosquito is less likely to cause an infection when it bites again. \nThe trial used five million mosquito eggs infected with Wolbachia. Eggs were placed in buckets of water in the city every two weeks and the process of building up an infected population of mosquitoes took nine months. \nYogyakarta was split into 24 zones and the mosquitoes were released only in half of them. \nThe results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed a 77% reduction in cases and an 86% reduction in people needing hospital care when the insects were released.\n\"It's very exciting, it's better than we could have hoped for to be honest,\" Dr Anders told the BBC. \nThe technique has been so successful the mosquitoes have been released across the whole city and the project is moving to surrounding areas with the aim of eradicating dengue in the region. \nDr Anders, who is also the director of impact assessment at the World Mosquito Programme, said: \"This result is groundbreaking.\n\"We think it can have an even greater impact when it is deployed at scale in large cities around the world, where dengue is a huge public health problem.\"\nWolbachia are also spectacularly manipulative and can alter the fertility of their hosts to ensure they are passed on to the next generation of mosquitoes. \nIt means once Wolbachia has been established, it should stick around for a long time and continue to protect against dengue infection. \nThis is in sharp contrast to other control methods - such as insecticides or releasing large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes - that need to be kept up in order to suppress the blood-suckers. \nDr Yudiria Amelia, the head of disease prevention in Yogyakarta City, said: \"We are delighted with the outcome of this trial. \n\"We hope this method can be implemented in all areas of Yogyakarta and further expanded in all cities in Indonesia.\"\nThe trial is a significant landmark after years of research as the species of mosquito that spreads dengue - Aedes aegypti - is not normally infected with Wolbachia.\nDisease modelling studies have also predicted Wolbachia could be enough to completely suppress dengue fever if it can be established.\nDavid Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, said the method had \"exciting potential\" for other diseases such as Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya; which are also spread by mosquito bites. \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "Joe began buying what he believed were genuine diazepam and Xanex pills from the internet to help with anxiety. \nBut he became addicted to the fake pills - which he continued to believe were real - and earlier this year they almost killed him. \nJoe had struggled with shyness in his late teens and, like many, he found moving away to university a challenge. \nBut when the 23-year-old returned home to rural mid Wales after his first year, mum Sarah was initially excited to see changes in him. \n\"I would say his personality had changed,\" said Sarah. \n\"He was much louder and almost like a little bit brash. Naively, I thought he'd just come out of his shell.\"\nWhat Sarah didn't know was Joe - not their real names - had begun to self-medicate with what he believed were genuine diazepam and Xanax pills bought online in an effort to help with his anxiety.\nIt wasn't long before his family noticed other changes in him too. \n\"He'd go through phases of sleep walking, mood changes, very dilated pupils,\" said 25-year-old Alex, Joe's older sister. \n\"I asked him to talk to me as a sibling, I said I wouldn't say anything to mum and dad, but he never did.\"\nWhen he returned to university for his second year, his mum began to get phone calls from him in the middle of the night. \n\"He said 'I've been using prescription drugs to try and help myself and I think it's getting out of control','\" said Sarah. \n\"I became aware he was buying them on the internet and that he was using them to address his mental health issues. He'd researched what he thought he needed to take - and in his mind he'd tackled the problem.\n\"But as things got worse I think he became very afraid that he was being overtaken by the addiction.\"\nWhen he was at home normal-looking packages would arrive for him - inside were what he believed to be prescription drugs. He eventually showed his mum them, hoping to reassure her. \nPrescription drugs have to be prescribed by your GP but many people, like Joe, are going online to buy pills that they believe are legitimate to avoid consulting with a doctor.\n\"It was mostly diazepam,\" she said. \"It was in fully printed and marked packaging with batch numbers, dates and the information leaflet inside. \n\"To me they were the genuine drugs - and to Joe they were the genuine drugs.\n\"He used to say to me 'I know not to take too many, I know how many I should take, I'm in control, don't worry mum.'\n\"It didn't for one minute enter my mind that it wasn't what it said on the tin.\"\nHowever the pills weren't what they claimed to be. \nAccording to drugs testing lab Wedinos, between 45% to 65% of benzodiazepines sent in for testing, which include diazepam and Xanax, are actually fakes. \nThese pills can use unregulated and much stronger ingredients, frequently leaving users with pills up to 10 times stronger than what they think they are taking. \nJoe had no idea the pills he was taking were fake. Earlier this year his mum went to wake him, only to find he had overdosed.\n\"I could see as soon as I approached the door that he was lying across his bed,\" recalled Sarah.\n\"The look of him, the feel of him, it just said to me 'he's dead, he's gone.'\n\"I just became hysterical. There was no-one in the house. I dialled the emergency services - and I couldn't speak - I was just shouting.\"\nThe paramedics battled to save Joe's life for hours. Eventually a decision was made to try to move him to hospital. \nSarah was told he could die on the way down the stairs, let alone the long journey to the nearest emergency department. \nJoe had suffered a cardiac arrest.  He survived, but suffered major brain damage.\n\"The prescription drugs that Joe had been buying on the internet were not legitimate,\" she said.\n\"It wasn't what he believed, and I believed, was in the tablets.\nSome drugs charities in Wales say referrals for benzodiazepines have gone up 150% in the past year, with many warning about the dangers of buying pills online.\n\"It is incredibly easy to be deceived,\" said Josie Smith, national lead for substance misuse at Public Health Wales.\n\"We're seeing very clever marketing of tablets that look exactly as you would find from a prescribed medication. Even in the blister packs, with the packaging, it can look really like a medication.\n\"Certainly in the past few years, not only in Wales but also right across in Europe, we know these drugs have become incredibly easy to obtain. They're highly available, even promoted through particular website or social media.\n\"I think that's the challenge that we need to address, to inform and to increase awareness around the risk of not knowing what it is that you're taking - even if it looks like something you've been prescribed in the past.\"\nFor Joe, just 23 and still - several months later - fighting for his life, it is too late.\nBut his family are speaking out in the hope of raising awareness.\n\"Joe's story is still unfolding,\" said his sister Alex.\n\"But if we can help even one family, to not go through what we're going through, then that would be job done.\"\nThe names of Joe and his family have been changed to protect their identities.\nIf you've been affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line can offer help and support."

      "text": "The Queen was not asked by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex about naming their daughter Lilibet, a Palace source has told the BBC.\nThe source disputed reports in the wake of the announcement of the name that Prince Harry and Meghan had spoken to the Queen before the birth.\nBut a Sussexes' spokesperson insisted they would not have used the name had the Queen not been supportive.\nThey said the monarch was the first family member the duke had called.\nThe spokesperson said: \"The duke spoke with his family in advance of the announcement - in fact his grandmother was the first family member he called. \n\"During that conversation, he shared their hope of naming their daughter Lilibet in her honour. Had she not been supportive, they would not have used the name.\"\nIn a letter to some news broadcasters and publishers, the law firm Schillings, which acts for Prince Harry and Meghan, said the BBC report that the Queen was not asked for permission to use the name Lilibet was false and defamatory and should not be repeated. \nLilibet has been the Queen's nickname among family since her childhood.\nThe relationship between the couple and the Royal Family has made headlines in recent months.\nEarlier this year, while the couple were expecting their daughter, they aired criticisms of the Royal Family and made an allegation of racism in an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey.\nAnd although Harry spoke about difficulties between him and his father, he said that he had a \"really good\" relationship with the Queen and they spoke regularly over video call.\nAt the weekend, the couple announced that Lilibet \"Lili\" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor had been born at a hospital in Santa Barbara in California on Friday morning.\nThe name \"Lilibet\" is heavy with personal history for Her Majesty.\nThe nickname was coined when then-Princess Elizabeth was just a toddler and couldn't pronounce her own name properly. Her grandfather King George V would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her  attempts to say her name. It stuck and came to be used by close relatives.\nShe signed her name as Lilibet on the funeral wreath for one of her closest friends Earl Mountbatten. The Queen's late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, also called her by the nickname.\nFollowing Lilibet's birth, it was widely presumed that Harry and Meghan had first spoken to the Queen about the choice of name.\nThere were subsequent stories in the press quoting \"friends\" of the couple who strongly suggested that Harry had sought permission from his grandmother. \nThe Times also reported that it understood the Queen had been informed by Harry about the name.\nAnd a source close to the Sussexes also told the BBC that Harry had spoken to the Queen before the birth and \"would have mentioned the name\" - claims a Palace source has since disputed.\nLilibet is the Queen's 11th great-grandchild and younger sister to Archie, who is now two years old.\nHer middle name, Diana, is a tribute to Prince Harry's late mother. Princess Charlotte, the daughter of Prince William and Catherine, also has Diana as one of her middle names, as well as Elizabeth.\nAfter her birth, Buckingham Palace said the Queen and other senior royals had been informed and were \"delighted with the news\".\nDuring the interview with Oprah in March, the couple said they would be done after baby number two - meaning they were not planning to have any more children.\nAdditional reporting by Francesca Gillett"

It's your problem.'\"\nTo make matters worse, the family are now due to fly out to Portugal in two weeks time - but given the government is still advising not to travel to amber destinations for leisure, they do not want to go. \n\"Ryanair still will not issue a refund,\" said Claire who lives in Edinburgh. \n\"So we are due to lose \u00a31,300 now and I am currently furloughed. Where is the justice here? I feel pretty despondent and angry to say the least.\"\nCustomers spoke out after a watchdog started an investigation into whether Ryanair and British Airways had broken the law in not offering refunds to customers who couldn't legally take flights due to Covid lockdowns.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the airlines' stance may have left customers out of pocket.\nThe airlines offered other options, but both refused refunds, it said.\nHowever, BA said it had acted lawfully and Ryanair said it had refunded customers in justified cases.\nAndy Watts, a sheet-metal worker from Nottingham, booked a holiday for his family of four to travel to Alicante for August 2020 with flights costing \u00a31,200.\nHowever, they then got a letter from their GP saying his eldest daughter, then 12, should shield for medical reasons.\n\"This cut no ice with Ryanair,\" he said. The family was \"forced\" to transfer the flights to August this year at a cost of \u00a3860.\n\"I now believe those flights for us are very unlikely to happen as Spain will remain an amber country,\" he said. \n\"We looked at transferring again, due to the uncertainty, to next year 2022 but can only transfer up until Christmas 2021 at an additional cost of \u00a3300.\"\nAndy now stands to be more than \u00a32,000 out of pocket and has the choice to either walk away from the trip or book more flights not knowing if he'll be able to use them.  \n\"It's pretty disgusting,\" Andy said. \"The government advice is that you shouldn't travel. It's poor customer service, and it's morally wrong.\"\nDuring the three UK lockdowns people were told to avoid all non-essential travel.\nThe CMA's investigation is looking at flights that weren't cancelled, but that people legally could not go on due to lockdown restrictions.\nThe watchdog said that while BA had offered vouchers and rebooking for flights that weren't cancelled, and Ryanair had offered rebooking, both had declined refunds.\nAndrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: \"While we understand that airlines have had a tough time during the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law.   \n\"Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back.\"\nThe watchdog is concerned that during lockdowns in the UK, when most people were legally unable to fly, the airlines failed to offer refunds.\nIt said it wanted to resolve those concerns, which might include the airlines offering affected customers refunds \"or other redress\".\nThe CMA has sent a letter to the companies outlining its concerns.\nUsually the watchdog tries to work with firms to address any issues. However, if the firms push back, it can seek a court order to compel them to refund customers and make changes to their practices.\nThe CMA cannot fine the firms if it is found they breached consumer law - which is different to its powers in competition cases, where it can levy fines.\nBut BA said it offered \"highly flexible booking policies at the same time as operating a vastly reduced schedule due to government-imposed travel restrictions, and we have acted lawfully at all times\".\nA spokesperson said: \"During this unprecedented crisis we have issued well over three million refunds and helped millions of our customers change their travel dates or destinations and we're grateful to them for their ongoing support.\n\"It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees, after prohibiting airlines from meaningful flying for well over a year now.\"\nRyanair said it had looked at refunds on a case-by-case basis and had paid money back \"in justified cases\".\n\"Since June 2020, all our customers have also had the ability to rebook their flights without paying a change fee and millions of our UK customers have availed of this option,\" it said.\nThe CMA has been investigating various parts of the travel industry, following complaints about refunds, cancellations and price rises during the pandemic.\nIt has received 148,000 complaints so far, with many thousands of those being about holiday refunds.\nIn April it threatened legal action against firms offering vouchers instead of refunds for accommodation.\nThen in May it warned travel companies that they needed to be ready to refund customers, and said that five big package holiday firms including Tui, Lastminute.com and Virgin Holidays had refunded a total of \u00a3200m."

      "text": "Millions of Covid vaccines could be wasted if rich countries send large amounts of leftover doses to poorer nations in one go, Unicef has warned.\nThe charity said there needed to be a steady supply throughout the year because poor countries do not have resources to use them all at once.\nThe UK and others have promised to donate their surplus doses - but they have been asked to give more earlier.\nStars including Billie Eilish and David Beckham are backing Unicef's plea.\nThe celebrities have signed a letter to the G7 group of rich countries - including the UK - asking them to donate 20% of their vaccines by August.\n\"The pandemic will not be over anywhere until it is over everywhere,\" said Beckham. \nThe other stars who have signed the letter include Andy Murray, Olivia Colman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Payne, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Orlando Bloom, Katy Perry, Gemma Chan, Whoopi Goldberg, Claudia Schiffer and Chris Hoy.\nUnicef's vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight that countries needed to vaccinate their own populations at the same time as the rest of the world.\n\"At some point, no doubt, we will need to vaccinate under-18s,\" she said. \"But the priority at this moment has to be making sure that all of the vulnerable and priority groups around the world get vaccines.\n\"So we're saying countries like the UK and the G7 need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home.\"\nBut last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said vaccinating children in the UK would take priority over sending doses abroad.\nUnlike other countries, the UK has not revealed how many doses it plans to donate to the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme, saying only that it will donate its excess doses. On Friday Mr Hancock said the UK did not currently have any spare doses.\nEarlier this week more than 100 former prime ministers, presidents and foreign ministers urged leaders of the G7 countries to pay two-thirds of the \u00a346.6bn needed to vaccinate low-income countries against Covid.\nEx-PM Tony Blair said the \"reality\" was that governments are \"obliged to look after [their] own people\" and so will always prioritise vaccinating their own country first.\nBut he said, \"you can't be absolutist about this, there may be some vaccine that we can ship out in advance\".\nAnother former UK PM, Gordon Brown, said the G7 and other wealthy nations \"should pay their share\" to help parts of Africa and Asia.\nHe said it should not be left to a \"whip round\" to deal with a \"disease that has got to be brought under control.\"\nUnicef's Ms Caprani called on G7 countries to start donating jabs now as well as throughout the summer and the rest of the year.\n\"Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers,\" she said.\n\"The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won't be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy.\" \nIn their letter, the celebrities said Unicef was already delivering vaccines in poor countries - but the charity was 190 million doses short.\nThe letter said the G7 countries  - the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - will soon have enough to donate 20% of their doses between June and August without significant delay to their own rollouts, and doing that would provide more than 150 million doses to Covax.\n\"The virus is still spreading in many countries and producing new variants with the potential to put us all back where we started,\" said the letter to the G7 group.\nSome of the celebrities such as tennis star Murray are also urging people in the UK to donate to Unicef's VaccinAid appeal.\nSome countries, like the UK which has ordered 400 million doses of various vaccines, have already vaccinated a large proportion of their citizens.\nBut other countries are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax.\nAt the G7 summit later this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is planning to urge setting a target to vaccinate the world by the end of 2022.\nCampaigners and critics - as well as a group of MPs - say action needs to be taken now and Britain should donate a dose for every jab imported into the UK.\nThe UK government has already donated \u00a3548m in aid money to the Covax scheme, and half a billion doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab have been ordered by other countries and sent abroad. \nThe leaders of the seven G7 countries are meeting in Cornwall for their annual summit this weekend. \nThe US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to Covax. Like the UK, Canada is yet to put a figure on their planned contribution."

      "tags": "Cardiff,Autism",
      "text": "Children with needs associated with autism were \"abused\" and mistreated at a children's home in Cardiff, four former employees have claimed. \nThey said children at Ty Coryton were restrained and locked up unnecessarily. \nThe whistleblowers also claimed one teenager was locked in her flat regularly because she was menstruating.\nOrbis Education and Care Ltd, who run the home, said they had investigated any incidents that were reported and they took allegations very seriously.\nKristy Edwards worked at Ty Coryton - a residential home and specialist school for children with needs associated with autism - between November 2019 and September 2020.\nShe said that on one occasion she thought a child \"was going to die\" while being restrained on the floor for almost 20 minutes. \nMs Edwards claimed the restraint was \"completely mismanaged\" and that she was running back and forth with water and cold compresses to cool him down as she was so worried for his health.\nShe also alleged she witnessed a staff member swearing and verbally abusing a child, saying they \"stank of shit\". \nMs Edwards said children were punished for engaging in autistic behaviour and the health and safety of staff and children was \"absolutely shocking\". \n\"I've been injured a few times,\" said Ms Edwards.\nMs Edwards claimed young people were \"mismanaged\" so behaved in challenging ways which led to them being locked away.\nShe alleged that the state of accommodation was poor and described the state of one young person's flat as a \"crack den\".\nShe added this child was locked away and was only allowed out in the car.\n\"This person really runs the risk of, as soon as they turn 18, their future in supported living is gone,\" said Ms Edwards.\n\"This person will likely become institutionalised, his support staff are already saying he needs to be sedated but he doesn't.\n\"He just needs correct therapeutic behavioural strategies and for somebody to work with him instead of working against him.\"\nMs Edwards claimed that one teenager's isolation was \"severe\".\n\"She was isolated anytime she was menstruating,\" she said. \"They didn't teach her how to use sanitary items.\"\nMs Edwards claimed people had to use incontinence pads longer than necessary because there was no toileting progression for children.\nShe also said there was a lack of pads and wipes, and on one occasion there were none available so a resident had to stand naked while another member of staff went and bought some more. \nFour former employees said there were regularly not enough pads and wipes.\nMs Edwards said she raised concerns to the person responsible for buying them and was told they were going to start limiting the amount of pads they were allowed to take. \nOne of the whistleblowers said they had to \"battle for resources\".\nShe described the environment of the home as \"high risk\" for both staff and the children living there.\nOne of the other whistleblowers said that on one occasion a 10-year-old boy was found running around the car park naked and when he was taken back to his flat, no-one had realised he had absconded. \nMs Edwards, who now works for a different company and is studying for a masters degree in behaviour analysis and therapy, said every incident she saw was \"a direct result of staff involvement or being ignored by staff\".\nShe said she raised concerns from the first week she worked for Orbis with at least three managers.\nProf Edwin Jones, from the British Institute of Learning Disabilities (BILD), said the allegations were shocking.\n\"The use of frequent restraint, taking people to the floor, is extremely dangerous,\" he said.\nHe said children with learning disabilities learn to behave in challenging ways if they are not in a therapeutic environment, not because they are \"naughty\".\n\"We need to improve their quality of life and give them other ways to have their needs met - that's called positive behavioural support.\" \nProf Jones said he believed it was likely the type of problems alleged at Ty Coryton could be happening elsewhere.\n\"I think this is a systematic problem in Wales, and a few things need to happen,\" he said.\n\"The most important thing that needs to happen now very, very quickly, is that Welsh government move forward and implement the Welsh reducing restrictive practice framework. \n\"It won't address everything but it will address an awful lot.\"\nCare Inspectorate Wales has been informed of the allegations and the Children's Commissioner for Wales has made a child protection referral after BBC Wales' investigation.\nA spokesperson for Orbis Education and Care Ltd said: \"We take any allegation against our staff or our services extremely seriously and where an alleged incident has previously been reported to us, we have thoroughly investigated. \n\"During the period since these alleged incidents took place, Ty Coryton had 21 inspections or visits (up until 17 May) by independent organisations and authorities who found no faults relating to any of the allegations, with the exception of staff shortages at certain points during the pandemic. \n\"We have received a draft Care Inspectorate Wales report on Ty Coryton which will be published in the coming weeks, which is complimentary of our staff and our service.\n\"Orbis Education and Care has a comprehensive range of established governance policies and procedures, supported by a well-resourced quality team, to work with home managers in the delivery of a safe and high-quality service.\n\"We are proud of the level of education and support we offer at Ty Coryton and our amazing staff who care for the children and young people we look after.\n\"Creating a warm, stimulating home for our children is what we strive to do every day at Orbis; this is the reason why the vast majority of colleagues choose to work with our unique young people, taking great pleasure and professional pride in the steps forward that we support them to take.\"\nA spokesperson for the Welsh government said: \"There is absolutely no place for the inappropriate treatment of children in any setting anywhere in Wales. \n\"We are aware that Cardiff Council's Children's Services are working to respond to the concerns raised by this case.  \n\"We will publish a framework to reduce restrictive practices to cover childcare, education, health and social care next month and will work with organisations across Wales to take an approach that actively promotes human rights and person centred support.\"\nThis article is the subject of a legal complaint from Orbis who dispute the accuracy of the allegations and say that this article is defamatory and false. \nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

      "tags": "Policing,Coronavirus vaccines,Police Federation,Priti Patel",
      "text": "Police officers feel a \"deep sense of betrayal\" that they were not prioritised for vaccination, the Police Federation chairman has said.\nJohn Apter said he pressed the home secretary to ensure officers were moved up the vaccine priority list.\nMinisters lobbied the vaccine advisory body but Priti Patel said the government had to accept its decision not to make police an exception.\nShe praised the police for \"not flinching\" in the face of the pandemic.\nMr Apter revealed at the annual conference of the federation - which represents officers in England and Wales - that he had held \"robust discussions\" about vaccinating officers with Ms Patel.\nHe said he had been told police could be prioritised during the rollout, but \"the government's warm words became lame actions\".\nHe told the conference \"the result is that my colleagues do feel a sense, a deep sense, of betrayal\".\nThe conference, taking place online, was shown a video of a Devon and Cornwall officer, called Leanne, who said she was 26 and concerned about working alongside officers from all over the country at the G7 meeting, despite not being vaccinated.\nIn her speech Ms Patel said: \"We absolutely had to prioritise the vaccine rollout in line with the overriding risk factors of age and clinical vulnerability.\"\nAnswering questions from officers she said: \"People were dying. We had terrible death rates in the country. We had the elderly and vulnerable who were in desperate need.\"\nBut she said the \"phenomenal\" vaccine rollout meant officers would be vaccinated.\nBack in January the home secretary had said there was \"a lot of work\" taking place to get police and other front-line workers moved up the priority list but the rollout continued on an age basis.\nThe order in which the vaccine programme has progressed has been based on the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nVaccination began with people aged 80 and over, as well as the clinically extremely vulnerable and some health and social care staff, as the JCVI deemed these groups were at greatest risk of death and serious illness.\nIn February, Prof Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 chair of the JCVI, said, as occupation was not well-recorded in GPs' records, running the vaccination programme by people's jobs may have slowed down the whole programme.\nPolicing minister Kit Malthouse told a conference panel discussion the government \"made the case strongly about police officers\".\nHe later added: \"We did repeatedly make the case and make the request but obviously the JCVI made the decision that they did.\n\"From my point of view it's a point of regret that we didn't manage to make our point strongly enough.\n\"Having said that, as was said earlier, quite a number of officers managed to get vaccinated with spare vaccines, hopefully now everybody is done or will be done shortly.\"\nMs Patel also told the conference the government was supporting the police by increasing sentences for attacks on emergency workers from 12 months to two years, allowing all officers to carry a Taser, and focusing on their health and well-being.\n\"Our country depends on you and I have got your backs,\" she said.\nMs Patel also reiterated her previous call for forces to be quicker to release body-worn footage to counter misleading clips from the public posted on social media.\nAdditional reporting by Doug Faulkner."

      "text": "Joe Biden has \"deep\" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland, his national security adviser has told the BBC.\nThe US president will tell fellow leaders at this week's G7 summit that gains since the Good Friday Agreement must be protected, Jake Sullivan said.\nThe UK and EU are at loggerheads over checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nIf no compromise is reached, there are fears of potential violence in NI.\nMr Sullivan's comments also come as the UK is trying to secure a free-trade deal with the US.\nHe insisted he was not trying to \"negotiate in public\" or issue a \"warning\" to Boris Johnson's government, but merely stating \"how the president feels about this issue\".\nThe UK and EU are in talks over simplifying the Northern Ireland Protocol, which set up a post-Brexit trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) in order to prevent goods checks along the Irish land border.\nSome checks are taking place on British goods going to Northern Ireland, causing some disruption to food supplies and online deliveries.\nUnionists are strongly opposed to these because they do not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nSinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP, and Alliance have said there are problems with the protocol but have argued that the UK and EU must ensure its \"rigorous implementation\".\nOne loyalist group has written to Mr Johnson to withdraw support for the Good Friday Agreement - signed in 1998 following heavy involvement by the US - which helped bring an end to the Troubles.\nIn an interview with BBC North America editor Jon Sopel, Mr Sullivan said the success or failure of the Northern Ireland Protocol was \"critical to ensuring that the spirit, promise and future of the Good Friday Agreement is protected\".\nHe urged the UK and EU to \"work out the specifics\" and \"find a way to proceed that works for both\", adding: \"But whatever way they find to proceed must at its core fundamentally protect the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and not imperil that.\"\nThat was the \"message President Biden will send\" at the G7 summit, which runs from Friday to Sunday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, Mr Sullivan said.\nThe conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles lasted almost 30 years from the late 1960s, and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people.\nNorthern Ireland was created in 1921 and remained part of the UK, while the rest of Ireland became an independent state.\nThis created a split in the population between the unionists - who were mainly Protestants and were happy to stay in the UK - and nationalists, who were predominantly Catholics and wanted to join the new Irish state.\nMany Catholics faced discrimination in jobs and housing and in the late 1960s began protests which were met with a crackdown from the Northern Ireland government.\nIn 1969, after violence across Northern Ireland, the UK government deployed troops to restore public order.\nThey were largely welcomed, but later armed groups from both sides, like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA), began carrying out bombings and shootings.\nPeace talks started in the early 1990s, and culminated in the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which ended the worst of the violence. \nIssues including climate change and post-pandemic recovery are set to dominate the meeting of leaders of most of the world's biggest economies.\nThe G7 summit also comes as the UK is keen to reach free-trade deals with other countries, including the US, as it readjusts its economy following Brexit.\n\"I'm not intending to send any warnings,\" Mr Sullivan said.\nBut he added: \"Our concern [on Northern Ireland] does run deep. That is simply a statement of principle. That's how the president feels about this issue.\n\"What it does to a US-UK free-trade agreement, I don't want to sit here and negotiate in public... or make some claim or threat,\" Mr Sullivan said.\n\"We want to make sure that the work that the US, UK, and Ireland have all done, in addition to the key parties in NI, has got to be honoured and respected and protected as we go forward,\" he added.\nA senior UK government source said the government was \"positive\" about President Biden's engagement with Northern Ireland and the peace process, saying: \"We welcome the balanced tone from the US.\"\nJake Sullivan was very keen to impress upon me that, if the administration were a rock-'n'-roll band, this would be the \"America is back\" tour.\nHe wants the world to know that the isolationist, poke-your-allies-in-the-eye Trump years are gone, that the familiar, multilateral America is returning.\nMr Sullivan argues that on climate change, the global economy and leading the world out of the pandemic, the US will play a leading role.\nThis will be welcomed by the other G7 nations after the bumpiness that came with his predecessor. But Mr Sullivan is aware that will be met with some scepticism too.\nAfter the scarring events of 6 January, when Washington's Capitol building was stormed, how can America be the role model of functioning liberal democracy? How reliable a partner will it be? Could the go-it-alone America re-emerge in four years' time? \nThe UK has pushed back the full implementation of checks on supermarket goods and parcels travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland to ease disruption to supplies.\nThis has prompted the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the Northern Ireland Protocol and begin legal action.\nThe next phase of controls, on chilled meat products including sausages and mince, is due to begin on 1 July.\nThe UK's Brexit minister, Lord Frost, is meeting his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in London to discuss ways to reduce trade disruption.\nHe has urged the EU to show \"common sense\", but Mr Sefcovic has warned against \"quick fixes\" to border issues."

      "text": "The operator of the Caledonian Sleeper has announced it will cancel all services during an 11-day strike by rail workers later this month.\nThe move by Serco comes after the RMT union confirmed strike action would take place between 15 and 26 June following a ballot of members.\nThe RMT claims that Serco attempted to \"impose a pay freeze\" on rail staff.\nHowever, the rail operator described the proposed action as \"both unjustified and very disappointing\".\nIt said it would cause \"significant disruption\" for people who had booked to travel on board the overnight rail service between London and Scotland.\nCaledonian Sleeper managing director Kathryn Darbandi said all staff had received full pay throughout the pandemic, despite a \"significant\" reduction in services.\nShe said: \"We have also been clear that we fully intend to resume pay talks next year, once the business is in a stronger position.\n\"We remain open to discussions aimed at resolving the dispute, but in the meantime, we have had no choice but to prepare for the strike to go ahead.\"\nShe added: \"We're sorry that guests will be affected by this strike action and are contacting them to arrange a full refund.\"\nAll staff grades were involved in the RMT ballot, which returned an 85% vote in favour of a strike.\nMembers have also been instructed not to work any overtime or work on their rest days from 26 June.\nRMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \"The company needs to get round the table for real so that we can negotiate a fair pay deal for our members who have kept the service running throughout the pandemic.\n\"This contempt towards a loyal and dedicated workforce is completely unacceptable and RMT will be backing them all the way.\n\"The union remains available for talks aimed at resolving this dispute.\""

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government acted unlawfully when it awarded a \u00a3560,000 contract to a firm run by former colleagues of Michael Gove and the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings, the High Court has ruled.\nMr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, denied any favouritism had been shown to market research agency Public First.\nBut the judge said a failure to consider other firms could be seen as suggesting a \"real danger\" of bias.\nPublic First looked into public understanding of coronavirus.\nCampaigners took legal action against Mr Gove over the Cabinet Office's decision to use the company following the start of the pandemic last year.\nThey also questioned the involvement of Mr Cummings, who worked in Downing Street until he quit as the prime minister's chief adviser last autumn.\nLawyers for the Good Law Project argued that Mr Cummings wanted focus group and communications support services work to be given to Public First, whose founding partners were Rachel Wolf and James Frayne.\nIn 2011, Mr Frayne became director of communications at the Department of Education, where he worked alongside Mr Cummings, who was a special adviser to Mr Gove, the then education secretary.\nMs Wolf formerly worked as an adviser to Mr Gove and for Mr Cummings, and co-wrote the Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto. \nThe government and Mr Cummings disputed the Good Law Project's claim.\nDelivering her ruling, Mrs Justice O'Farrell said: \"The claimant is entitled to a declaration that the decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful.\"\nShe said: \"The defendant's failure to consider any other research agency, by reference to experience, expertise, availability or capacity, would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility, or a real danger, that the decision-maker was biased.\"\nBut she also said: \"The fair-minded and informed observer would have appreciated that there was an urgent need or research through focus groups on effective communications in response to the Covid-19 crisis and that those research services were required immediately.\"\nMr Cummings had been \"uniquely placed, given his experience and expertise, to form a rapid view on which organisation might best be able to deliver those urgent requirements\", the judge said.\nThe High Court rejected two other claims made against the government by the Good Law Project.\nThe first was that the \"direct\" award of the contract to Public First was \"unnecessary\" because there were other firms who could potentially have done the work.\nThe second was that giving it a six-month contract was \"disproportionate\" for the government's \"immediate\" needs - and that a shorter arrangement could have been followed by a \"competitive process\" for a longer contract.\nIn his witness statement, Mr Cummings told the court: \"The country was facing an unprecedented national emergency. Thousands of lives were at stake, hundreds of billions of pounds were at stake.\n\"The extra money spent on doubling the focus groups and polling was essentially irrelevant in those circumstances.\n\"A few people did raise the question of how we could justify this as value for money. I responded that this was not the normal world, we were in a once-a-century pandemic and many thousands of pounds here was trivial if it helped us save lives and minimise economic destruction.\"\nAfter the High Court ruling, he tweeted: \"When it became clear [the Department of Health, Public Health England and the Cabinet Office] weren't gathering vital data, I acted urgently. This data immediately helped key decisions and saved lives.\"\nBut Good Law Project director Jo Maugham said: \"This is not government for the public good - it is government for the good of friends of the Conservative Party.\"\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the government of acting \"immorally and unethically\".\n\"In the middle of a deadly pandemic not only were those at the heart of government giving out taxpayers' money to their friends and associates, they have wasted even more trying to cover it up,\" she added.\nHowever, a Public First spokesman said the company was \"deeply proud of the work we did in the early stages of the pandemic, which helped save lives\".\nHe added: \"The judge rejected most of the Good Law Project's claims, not finding actual bias in the awarding of this work, nor any problems with the pace or scale of the award.\"\nAnd the Cabinet Office said: \"The judgement makes clear that there was no suggestion of actual bias and that the decision to award the contract was not due to any personal or professional connections.\""

      "text": "There is a campsite just beyond the American airbase at RAF Mildenhall. For the past few days, a throng of visitors have gathered awaiting the arrival of US President Joe Biden. But are they here for the man himself, or the aircraft that will bring him in?\nTracy Williams and her daughter Vanessa have been setting up their gazebo at The Nook Campsite in Mildenhall each day for three days straight.\nBut the pair, from Soham, Cambridgeshire, are not here to camp. They are here to see aircraft.\nAnd the president is due to arrive at Mildenhall on Wednesday evening, ahead of the G7 Summit which starts on Friday at Carbis Bay, Cornwall.\nThe Suffolk airbase will be the first place outside the United States that Joe Biden has visited since becoming president following his election victory over Donald Trump last November.\n\"It has been very busy for the past three days, seeing the [Lockheed] C-5 Galaxy and the [Boeing] C-17 Globemaster, it has been brilliant,\" says Mrs Williams. \"It is just, the size of it, how it gets off the floor is amazing. \n\"We've been doing it for years since the kids were little.\"\nAnd as for the arrival of the US President?\n\"That will be really great,\" says Mrs Williams.\nBut it is the chance to see Air Force One that she is especially excited about it.\nThe presidential fleet includes two identical jets, and whichever one the president is aboard is given the signal name Air Force One.\nThe current Boeing 747s have been in use for nearly three decades. The 4,000 sq/ft (1,220 sq/m) aircraft features three floors, armoured windows, medical offices and a kitchen that can feed 100 people at a time. A new version is expected to come into service in 2024.\n\"It is a once-in-a-lifetime type of thing. It is going to be great,\" says Mrs Williams.\n\"I've been coming over here since I was nine years old,\" says daughter Vanessa Hale, who has brought her own two-year-old girl Ricci-Leigh. \"It is amazing, it is in my blood.\n\"Now I've got a two-year-old and she is amazed by everything. I love it.\n\"I am really looking forward to seeing Air Force One come in and sitting on the base. \n\"It will be the first time I remember seeing it up close and personal. I've waited years for this.\"\nBut Mrs Williams and family have only come from just over the border in Cambridgeshire.\nPaul Darlow has travelled up all the way from Devon and has met up with his parents John and Janet Darlow, who have joined him at Mildenhall from Wiltshire.\nFor them too, the interest is more in the aircraft than the president himself.\n\"It keeps my husband happy and he loves the aircraft,\" says Mrs Darlow.\n\"We come together to sit read and watch the aircraft.\n\"It is a once-in-a-lifetime to see Air Force One and the other aircraft that go with it.\"\nAs for the senior Mr Darlow, there is a tinge of disappointment about the Biden visit.\n\"I would prefer to have seen his helicopter,\" he says, \"but it doesn't sound like that is going to happen.\n\"We are hopefully going to see the flying command post that flies with him [Joe Biden]. \n\"For me, that will be the star of the arrivals. There will probably some other VIP aircraft flying too.\"\nWhile it will not be Mr Darlow's first experience of Air Force One and its aerial entourage - he has seen them before at Fairford, Gloucestershire - this will be the first time \"in recent years\".\n\"It is a bit special,\" he says. \"I grew up just after the war and we were surrounded by military bases and there was aircraft everywhere, and I suppose [my interest] just grew from there.\n\"I really like the US Navy stuff that lands on carriers. I don't think I could pick out a favourite aircraft.\"\nAs for Mr Darlow (junior), he has come for what he describes as \"a free air show without all the crowds and the hassle\".\n\"I had nothing on, the sun is shining and its a unique opportunity to see some unusual planes,\" he says. \n\"The jumbo [Air Force One] is a nice aircraft but it is the stuff that accompanies him that is more interesting, such as the command post, like my dad says.\n\"I was taken with plane spotting when I was growing up. We used to do a lot of air shows. It is nice to pick it up again with my parents. Mildenhall is a wonderful place.\"\nWhat does the presidential visit mean for the town itself?\n\"We are very excited here in Mildenhall,\" says the mayor of Mildenhall Jane Busuttil.\n\"There's a huge buzz in the town about receiving the president of the United States and the First Lady, Dr Jill Biden.\n\"There's real excitement to have the president visit and perhaps stop over possibly on his way over to Newquay for the G7 Summit.\n\"It is a great opportunity for the president to meet the personnel and their families.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Camping",
      "text": "Rural businesses and landowners are urging the government to further relax regulations to enable more temporary campsites to pop up this summer. \nOne such pitch is behind the Devonshire Arms, in the heart of the Peak District. \nLandlady Fiona Kirby is offering pitches for \u00a315 a night in a small grassy meadow. \n\"We've got this big expanse that we don't really use to its best ability,\" she said.  \nThe facilities are basic, just a tap, but it meets two needs: the huge demand for UK breaks from holidaymakers and boosting the coffers of a struggling inn by enticing diners through the door. \nFor Fiona, it's been a no-brainer: \"I've been amazed. We've been full every night we've been open. And all I've had to do is mow the lawn.\" \nFrom last year, as the pandemic hit, landowners could set up a temporary site for 56 days without planning permission, rather than the usual 28. \nBut the campaign group Carry on Camping argues this just isn't enough to meet demand, nor the needs of rural businesses this year. \nThey are after a full six months, to make it worthwhile for businesses, to make the most of camping now in June, all the way up to October. \nDan Yates is managing director of PitchUp, and has been behind the campaign. \n\"This is all about making the most of the weather,\" he explained. \"We've had the 28-day rule a long time, and for most businesses it wasn't viable to plumb in toilets, train staff and take a chance on the forecast. Fifty-six is a whole different ball game - but we need longer.\" \nDan said many of the businesses looking to offer temporary pitches are wedding venues, or farmers who've lost subsidies. \"Landowners can earn up to \u00a350,000 a season in some cases,\" he said. \"And no other type of accommodation in Britain can scale up like this to meet customer demand.\" \nSome may feel less than enthused at the prospect of swapping the Algarve for The Dales or Dorset, but Dan said bookings at his business PitchUp are up 200% compared to 2019 and just continues to grow: \"It's unprecedented.\" \nHis campaign also highlights that families camping will spend, on average, \u00a346 a day in nearby pubs, cafes, shops or attractions, giving a much-needed boost to rural economies. The National Farmers Union, Historic Houses and Countryside Alliance has backed the calls too. \nBut back at the Devonshire Arms Fiona knows it's not been popular with everyone. Some locals have voiced their resentment at extra traffic, visitors and mess. \n\"But the money I can make in the summer will help me through the lean times in the winter,\" she added.  \nThe Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government is responsible for the regulation in England and Wales. \nA spokesperson said: \"We have doubled the number of days temporary campsites can operate as part of our support for businesses and local economies during the pandemic. These measures are in place until the end of the year and we are keeping them under review.\"\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, more relaxed camping rules are already in place. "

Mobile apps cost British people nearly \u00a32.45bn with most going on Tinder, Disney+, YouTube and Netflix.\nTikTok grew rapidly, Ofcom said, from three million adult visitors in September 2019 to 14 million by March this year. \nYoung adults aged 18-24 more than doubled the time they spent on the short-form video app each day, from 17 minutes to 38 minutes in September 2020.\nAnd, as the High Street was forced to close, online sales rose by almost half.\nHalf of adults said that news and information was a big reason they went online - but they often encountered misinformation. \nSome 46% of UK adults who looked for information about the pandemic said they had found misleading or untrue information.\nAmong the most commonly shared falsehoods in the first quarter of 2021 were that face masks offered no protection or caused harm, and that the number of deaths linked to coronavirus was much lower than reported.\nThe report found that \"adults are as likely to use social media to find information about the Covid-19 pandemic as they are to use news sites and apps\" with Facebook the main source. However, only 16% who used Facebook for information about Covid-19 said they trusted it as a source.\nAround one in eight online adults and more than one in five of those aged 15-34 said they used an online dating service before the first lockdown. \nBut the money lost to romance scams increased 12% to reach \u00a318.5m.\nNearly half (49%) of UK adults visited an adult website or app in September 2020. \nOfcom found the largest site, Pornhub, was visited by around half of all UK online men, but just over one in six of online women.\nIn December, the site removed millions of user-generated videos from view after the New York Times alleged it  was \"infested\" with illegal material, allegations its parent company Mindgeek denied.\nThe report notes that while many benefited from access to the net, it meant that in Ofcom's words \"lockdown had a greater effect on people who are digitally excluded\".\nIt noted nearly one in five over-64s and roughly one in 10 in lower socio-economic households did not have internet access, turning a digital divide into a social one.\nThe digital divide also extended to schoolchildren. It found that nearly all children had access to the internet, but 4% had access only by mobile phone. One in five children lacked a device that would be suitable for doing school work on.\nWhile children spent more time online, the report found nearly half reported \"negative experiences\" . On mobile phones, 30% of these negative experiences were being contacted online by someone they didn't know who wanted to be their \"friend\"."

On 24 May, the State Department had issued a warning against the country, citing a new wave of Covid-19 cases.\nThe CDC said it also expects more countries to get lower ratings in the coming weeks. \nIt comes after the bosses of all airlines that offer UK-US flights and Heathrow Airport issued a joint call for a trans-Atlantic travel \"corridor\" on Monday.\nThe group said it would be \"essential to igniting economic recovery\" in a statement and urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson and President Joe Biden to discuss the possibility at the upcoming G7 meeting.\nShai Weiss, the boss of Virgin Atlantic, said on Monday: \"There is no reason for the US to be absent from the UK green list. This overly cautious approach fails to reap the benefits of the successful vaccination programmes in both the UK and the US.\"\nAdding the US to the green list would remove the need for quarantine on return to the UK. Passengers would, however, still need to have proof of a negative Covid test result on departure.\n\"Customers, families and businesses need to book and travel with confidence. After 15 months of restrictions, the time to act is now,\" Mr Weiss added."

The BBC has contacted the students' group for comment. \nAccording to the minutes of Monday's MCR committee meeting, the motion was tabled in an effort to make the common room more welcoming and to recognise that \"for some students, depictions of the monarch and the British monarchy represent recent colonial history\".\nThe vote ended with 10 in favour of removing the portrait, two against and five abstentions.\nOne member, whose name was withheld in the minutes, said \"effectively 'cancelling' the Queen\" sent out a \"dire message that is sure to enrage\", while another said: \"We are not capable of cancelling the Queen. This is about our communal space and making people feel welcome.\"\nBarrister Dinah Rose, who was appointed president of Magdalen College last year, emphasised that the students were not representative of the college, but supported their right to \"free speech and political debate\".\nIn a series of tweets, she said: \"A few years ago, in about 2013, they bought a print of a photo of the Queen to decorate their common room.\n\"They recently voted to take it down. Both of these decisions are their own to take, not the college's.\"\nShe finished: \"Being a student is about more than studying. It's about exploring and debating ideas.

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Palestinian territories,Gaza,Hamas",
      "text": "Israel says a media building destroyed by one of its air strikes in the recent Gaza conflict was being used by the Hamas militant group to try to jam its Iron Dome missile defence system.\nThe Jala Tower housed the offices of Associated Press (AP) and Al Jazeera.\nAP news agency said it had not seen evidence to support Israeli allegations that militants were operating there.\nHamas, which controls Gaza, denied it had offices in the building and called its destruction \"a scheming war crime\".\n\"The Israeli occupation's repeated lies about the presence of Hamas offices in Jala Tower is a failed attempt to justify its crime by targeting a civilian tower that houses media offices and international television channels,\" spokesman Hazem Qassem told the BBC.\nThe recent conflict began after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. \nHamas began firing rockets into Israel after warning it to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes from Israel on Gaza targets.\nAt least 256 people were killed in Gaza, according to the UN, and 13 people were killed in Israel during 11 days of fierce fighting before a ceasefire was agreed on 21 May.\nThe UN said at least 128 of those killed in Gaza were civilians. Israel's military said 200 were militants; Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, put the number of fighters killed at 80.\nFollowing the attack on the tower block on 15 May, both AP and Al Jazeera demanded an explanation from the Israeli government.\nIsrael's envoy to the UN and ambassador to the US, Gilad Erdan, travelled to AP's offices in New York on Monday and the Israel Defense Forces also released a statement on Tuesday.\nMr Erdan told executives of the US news agency that the building housing its Gaza operation was being used by Hamas to develop an electronic jamming system against the Iron Dome.\nHe said Israel did not suspect AP employees \"were aware a covert Hamas unit was using the building in this way\".\nMr Erdan said Israel \"upholds the importance of press freedom,\" adding: \"Israel is willing to assist AP in rebuilding its offices and operations in Gaza.\"\nThe IDF statement said Hamas was using the building to carry out Sigint (signals intelligence), Elint (electronic signals intelligence), and EW (electronic warfare) operations.\nMore than 4,300 rockets were fired towards Israel from Gaza during the conflict, 680 of which fell short and landed in Gaza, according to the IDF. It says the Iron Dome intercepted about 90% of the rockets that crossed into Israeli territory and were headed for populated areas.\nAssociated Press told Haaretz it welcomed the meeting with Mr Erdan and the rebuilding offer, but added: \"Israeli authorities maintain that the building housing our bureau was destroyed because of a Hamas presence that posed an urgent threat. We have yet to receive evidence to support these claims.\n\"AP continues to call for the full release of any evidence the Israelis have so that the facts are public.\"\nShortly after the air strike, Sally Buzbee, AP's executive editor, said it had had offices in the building for 15 years and had never had any indication that Hamas might be there.\nQatar-based Al Jazeera strongly condemned the attack and said it would do all it could to \"hold the Israeli government responsible for its actions\".\nIt condemned what it called a \"clear act to stop journalists from conducting their sacred duty to inform the world and report events on the ground\".\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken was among those calling for an explanation.\nIsrael gave an hour's prior warning of the air strike on the 12-storey block, allowing evacuation.\nThe ceasefire in the region has since held, and the UN Human Rights Council has voted to investigate the violence, a move welcomed by the Palestinians.\nBut Israel said the move showed an \"anti-Israel obsession\" and the US said it would endanger progress in bringing calm to the region."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "A Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, is at the centre of a dispute between the UK and the European Union (EU).\nSince it came into force at the start of 2021 the protocol has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested it could suspend parts of the arrangement by triggering part of the protocol known as Article 16.\nThe protocol allows lorries to deliver goods without having paperwork and goods checked when they cross the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.\nThis arrangement was easy to maintain before Brexit. When both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, they automatically followed the same EU trade rules, which meant no checks were required.\nHowever, a new arrangement was needed after Northern Ireland (along with the rest of the UK) left the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods, such as milk and eggs, arrive from non-EU countries. Similar rules exist in other areas, such as medicine licensing. \nTo try to get round the problem the UK and the EU negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is now part of international law.\nRather than checks taking place along the Irish border, it was agreed any inspections and document checks would take place between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) instead.\nThis was allowed after it was agreed that Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on product standards (part of the EU's single market rules). \nChecks on GB goods take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, this has led to criticism that a new trade border has effectively been created in the Irish Sea. \nUnionists are strongly opposed to the checks because they don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nAlso, not all checks under the protocol have been fully implemented yet. For example, supermarkets had reduced paperwork required under a temporary \"grace period\". However, the UK decided to extend these periods - something the EU said was a breach of international law. \nDespite signing up to the agreement in 2019, the UK government now says the protocol represented a huge compromise by the UK and has accused the EU of applying it too rigidly.\nThe UK is calling for changes, which include:\nArticle 16 is a set of three paragraphs in the protocol that allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss - now the UK's lead Brexit negotiator - said she would trigger Article 16 if the UK failed to secure changes.\n\"I want a negotiated solution but if we have to use legitimate provisions, including Article 16, I am willing to do that,\" she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\nIf the UK went down this route, it could prompt the EU to respond with measures that would impose tariffs (or import taxes) on aspects of trade between the two sides.\nThe EU has warned that any such move would \"lead to instability and unpredictability\".\nThe EU has set out proposals, but says a renegotiation of the text of the Protocol is out of the question:\nIn return, the EU wants extra safeguards to prevent products from Great Britain crossing into the Republic of Ireland.\nThe border is a sensitive issue because of the history of Northern Ireland and the agreements made to bring peace, which included the removal of visible signs of the border.\nThe fear is that if any infrastructure were to be installed, such as cameras or border posts, it could become a target and lead to political instability.\nDuring negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "A man accused of killing two sisters \"promised to sacrifice\" women in order to win the lottery, a court has heard.\nDanyal Hussein, 19, repeatedly stabbed Nicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46, in a Wembley park on 6 June last year, the Old Bailey was told.\nPolice who searched his room found a note purporting to be an agreement between the teenager and a demon, the prosecution said.\nMr Hussein, of Blackheath, south-east London, denies murder.\nMs Henry was stabbed eight times while Ms Smallman was stabbed 28 times. They had been in Fryent Country Park with friends celebrating Ms Henry's birthday.\nOpening the case, prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC said of the defendant: \"He promised to sacrifice women in order to win the lottery and not to be suspected of the crimes he had committed. \n\"It would appear that the defendant had confidence that his plan would work since following the fatal attacks upon Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, the defendant purchased several lottery tickets and there were three lottery tickets folded up inside the note [found in his room]. \n\"As it turned out, the demon did not come good on the bargain, since not only did the defendant not win the lottery but the police identified all the evidence that links him to these two murders.\"\nThe sisters had enjoyed Ms Henry's birthday celebrations so much that they decided to stay on at the park after their friends had left, the trial heard. They lit fairy lights, listened to music and danced.\nJurors were shown pictures of Ms Smallman and Ms Henry dancing with the lights shortly before they were attacked. Several photographs were taken in a burst, the prosecutor said.\nThe last photo, taken at 01:13 BST, shows the women looking to their left as if distracted by something, Mr Glasgow said.\n\"Whether this was the defendant who had crept up on them is unclear, but there is no doubt that he was in the park that evening and that he attacked them,\" he added.\nWhen the sisters failed to come home, their loved ones became concerned and some of their friends went to the park to look for them.\nPolice were alerted after the women's glasses were discovered and soon after a knife was found lying in the grass.\nAdam Stone, a friend of the sisters, was still on the phone to the police when he found their bodies.\nMr Glasgow told the jury: \"He ran towards the trees, forced his way through the bushes and this was when he discovered the two bodies.\"\nMr Glasgow suggested Ms Henry was taken by surprise and overpowered first, then Ms Smallman tried to fight off her attacker.\n\"Once the two sisters had been brutally murdered, their killer dragged their bodies across the grass and concealed them in a hedgerow,\" he said.\nThe court heard that a combination of forensic evidence and CCTV footage led police to Mr Hussein.\nHis DNA was at the scene, on the bodies of the victims and on a bloodstained knife found nearby, the jury heard.\nThe teenager, who had bought a set of knives from Asda in the days before the attack, went to hospital the day after the killings, the Old Bailey was told. He had cuts to his hand from a knife.\nJurors were told more about the note found on a glass table in his bedroom when police searched his home. \nIn it, he expressed intentions to sacrifice six women every six months in exchange for winning the Mega Millions Super Jackpot, the court heard.\nMr Glasgow said Mr Hussein denied that he wrote the note.\n\"Given it was found in his bedroom, has his finger and thumbprints upon it, and is signed in his name and in his blood, the identity of the author may not prove difficult to discern,\" Mr Glasgow added.\nThe trial, which is set to last four weeks, continues."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson says it is clear that Covid cases are rising and hospitalisations increasing, as a decision on 21 June unlocking looms.\nOfficial figures show more than 1,000 people in the UK are currently in hospital with the disease.\nThe PM said he needed to assess the extent to which the vaccine rollout has built up protection in the population before progressing with the roadmap.\nAnd he said again that the decision for England would be \"driven by the data\".\nThe number of people in hospital with the virus has risen above 1,000 for the first time since mid-May.\nScientists believe this could be the start of the third wave, caused by the Delta variant.\nThe size of that wave depends on how effective vaccines are at protecting people  - and that is still uncertain.\nThe government is due to decide on 14 June whether to lift the last remaining restrictions in England. \nBut government sources are more downbeat about the prospect of the easing going ahead the following week.\nSpeaking in Cornwall ahead of the G7 summit, the prime minister said there are \"arguments being made one way or another\" as to whether all restrictions can be lifted as planned.\n\"What everybody can see very clearly is that cases are going up and, in some places, hospitalisations are going up.\n\"What we need to assess is the extent to which the vaccine rollout, which has been phenomenal, has built up enough protection in the population in order for us to go ahead to the next stage.\"\nMr Johnson added: \"The reason we've been doing the steps on the roadmap with five-week intervals is to give us time to look at all the data as it comes in and access the state of the pandemic before we go forward to the next step. \n\"So on Monday that four-week period will be up - and we'll look at where we are.\"\nIt comes as one million under 30s booked vaccine appointments in England on Tuesday - and data showed more than half the adult population is fully vaccinated.\nProf Neil Ferguson, virus modeller from Imperial College London whose predictions were key to the first lockdown in March 2020, has said that delaying unlocking would allow more people to be vaccinated. \nWhile a first dose gives some protection against the Delta variant, first detected in India, the second dose appears to give much more.\nAnother 7,540 people tested positive for the coronavirus in the UK on Wednesday - the highest daily number of cases since the end of February, the latest government figures show.\nThere were also a further six deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test. A week ago there were 4,330 cases and 12 deaths.\nA total of 1,024 people are now being treated in hospital in the UK, up 69 on the previous figure.\nTo date, most of those in hospital have not been vaccinated or had only one dose, with very few fully vaccinated.\nProf Ferguson said it was still not clear how the rise in cases would translate into hospitalisations and it would take a few more weeks to find out.\nIt was always expected cases would rise at this stage - indoor mixing is the move that allows the virus to spread most easily.\nBut what's concerning government scientists is how quickly cases are going up because of the Delta variant, and how that has begun to translate into hospitalisations.\nThe hope was the vaccination success would lead to a slower increase in infections and hospital admissions would be flatter.\nVaccines have weakened the link between the two. The rate of admission seems to be about half of what it was in September when infection levels were last climbing like this.\nBut that may not be enough. One hope is the rise in infections could fizzle out given the immunity that has built up in the population.\nAnd there are suggestions those admitted now are not as sick as those admitted last year. Patients appear to be younger and not needing as much treatment. \nBut the lack of certainty means government scientists are suggesting extra time may be needed before the complete unlocking of society.\nThis will have a double benefit - allowing more time to gather data and increasing the numbers vaccinated.\nExperts say there is still much about the Delta variant and how well vaccines work against it that is unknown.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock previously said the variant was 40% more transmissible than the Alpha (or Kent) variant, but Prof Ferguson's \"best estimate\" is 60%.\n\"Almost certainly I think deaths probably will be lower [than the second wave] - the vaccines are having a highly protective effect, cases in hospital now are milder - but it still could be quite worrying,\" Prof Ferguson said.\nThe rises in hospital cases are mainly driven by increases in Scotland and the north-west of England.\nThis is where cases have been rising for the longest in the UK in the early stages of this third wave. \nVaccines and tests are being offered more quickly to people in Greater Manchester and Lancashire in a bid to suppress cases of the new variant, as Bolton has been able to do.\nThe town saw a recent drop in infection rates and the government is now planning the same approach in other parts of the region.\nMeanwhile, a record million jabs were booked on Tuesday when those aged 25 to 29 became eligible for the vaccine in England, according to new figures.\nThe NHS in England said 100,000 appointments were being booked every hour at the height of the surge.\nSir Simon Stevens, its chief executive, said bookings reaching an all-time high showed enthusiasm for the vaccination programme \"remains strong\".\nHe added: \"The obvious enthusiasm of younger adults to get their jab has blown out of the water the suggestion that people in their 20s might not come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones.\""

      "tags": "Climate change,Renewable energy in the UK,Renewable energy",
      "text": "Sales of halogen lightbulbs are to be banned in the UK from September, with fluorescent lights to follow, under government climate change plans. \nThe move will cut 1.26 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year and deliver consumers savings, officials say. \nThe UK began phasing out the sale of higher-energy halogen lightbulbs in 2018 under EU-wide rules.\nNow retailers will no longer be able to sell most remaining halogen bulbs, such as kitchen spotlights.\nLegislation for the plans is being brought forward this month by the government. \nThe plan will help continue the shift to low-energy LED lightbulbs, which account for about two-thirds of lights now sold in Britain.\nIt is expected to mean LEDs will account for 85% of all bulbs sold by 2030, officials said.\nLED lights last five times longer than traditional halogen bulbs and produce the same amount of light, but use up to 80% less power.\nTo help people to choose the most efficient lightbulbs, changes to the energy labels that consumers see on bulb packaging are being brought in, with the A+, A++ and A+++ ratings abandoned and efficiency graded between A-G, with only the most efficient bulbs given an A rating.\nLED bulbs could be incorporated into the fluorescent light fittings as a more energy-efficient alternative, officials said. \nLegislation will also include moves to phase out high-energy fluorescent lightbulbs - such as strip lights commonly found in offices - with a view to bringing an end to their sale from September 2023.\nThere was a time when the humble light bulb became the centre of a political storm over \"green madness\".\nThe EU had announced a ban on old-fashioned incandescent bulbs - the ones that give off more heat than light and use a lot of electricity in the process.\nIt was a move that led to a campaign of resistance with one newspaper even giving away the bulbs to encourage their use.\nBut this latest move - the final step in ending sales of halogen lights - comes in very different times. \nMany types of halogen bulbs were already banned several years ago, so this is a tightening of the screw on energy waste rather than a massive upheaval.\nBut it does provide another signal that if the UK is to meet its promises to tackle the heating of the climate, every sector of the economy - in fact almost every aspect of our lives - will have to see some kind of change.  \nThe cut in carbon emissions as a result of the new rules is the equivalent of removing more than half a million cars from the UK's roads, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial strategy said. \nIt is part of a package of measures which it says will save consumers money and includes the right to get goods repaired, new energy labels and higher efficiency standards for white goods, TVs and other appliances.\nEnergy minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: \"We're phasing out old inefficient halogen bulbs for good, so we can move more quickly to longer-lasting LED bulbs, meaning less waste and a brighter and cleaner future for the UK.\n\"By helping ensure electrical appliances use less energy but perform just as well, we're saving households money on their bills and helping tackle climate change.\"\nStephen Rouatt, chief executive of Signify UK, which owns Philips lighting, said: \"Using energy-efficient LED equivalents for halogen and fluorescent lighting on an even broader scale will significantly help the UK on its journey to decarbonisation, as well as lowering the annual electricity bills for consumers.\""

      "text": "Recorded Covid infections among children are now the highest they have been during the outbreak in Scotland.\nWeekly infections in 0-14 year olds reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland.\nWhile there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill, growing numbers of pupils are off school.\nNicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the regulator.\nThe number of cases among the youngest age group is rising rapidly, having seen a near four-fold increase since early May.\nDespite the rise, medics have said children's wards are not seeing any significant rise in admissions due to Covid and said there is no reason for parents to worry.\nHowever, a number of schools have had to shut temporarily because of pupils testing positive, with St Peter's Primary in Galashiels among the latest to announce a short closure to allow contact tracing. \nWhile most schools are open, growing numbers of pupils have been asked to stay home because they are possible contacts of pupils who have tested positive.\nProvisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%, the lowest percentage since pupils returned after Easter. \nChildren under the age of 15 represent about quarter of the daily case numbers in recent weeks in terms of total numbers.\nHowever, when the size of the population in each age group is factored in, it is clear that infection rates are considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. \nOn 7 June, the weekly case rate among people in their early 20s was 277.2 per 100,000.\nOlder teenagers had the second highest rate, at 228.4, while for younger children it was 122.9.\nWhat is clear from the data is that infections among older age groups are relatively low during the latest outbreaks, possibly a reflection of the rollout of the vaccination programme.\nMore than half of Scotland's adult population has now had both doses of a Covid vaccine.\nThe UK regulator has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15.\nThe Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)  on whether it should begin vaccinating children.\nOn Tuesday the first minister said the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated but if the JCVI recommends vaccination of children, she said Scotland would \"move as quickly as possible to implement the advice\".\nScottish government adviser Prof Devi Sridhar has backed the rollout of the vaccine to those over the age of 12.\nSpeaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier this week, she said: \"If we want schools to continue without disruption in the autumn and lift restrictions so children can have a normal experience, we need to vaccinate them \u2014 if we wait and watch for the evidence it will be too late in the next few weeks.\n\"We have the supply. It's not a large amount, it's a couple of million doses to cover that population of 12-plus.\n\"Given that we know children can transmit, where we are going to see problems is not going to be in care homes, it's not going to be in hospitals, it's going to be in schools.\"\nAnother leading health expert, Prof Linda Bauld, has said she \"really welcomed\" plans to vaccinate teenagers but said completing the adult age groups must come first. \nShe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"They will be next in line after we have issued vaccinations to all the 18-29 year olds, as Wales has already done. I really welcome the vaccine programme for teenagers... it will make a difference but they will not be able to receive it until older groups have. \n\"Over two million teenagers in the US have already received the vaccine, the trials suggest it's safe, so let's hope this all goes well.\" \nWith world leaders facing calls to do more to share vaccines internationally, some have argued a greater priority should be driving down infections globally, which could be the source of new variants. \nChristine Tait-Burkhard, an infection expert from University of Edinburgh, said it was a complex issue because while vaccination might help school attendance, there is little evidence of children becoming seriously ill. \nShe told Drivetime with John Beattie: \"The last question is an ethical one. If we are starting to vaccinate children in this country yet other countries haven't got any vaccines or very little vaccines to vaccinate their most vulnerable.\n\"It is not only an ethical question, it's also a message that it sends to the world that says we don't care.\"\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has said that if enough immunity was built up through the adult vaccination programme then vaccinating children may not be justified.\nHe said: \"The issue is not that there's a problem doing it, it's just a question of whether we need to do it, given the very low incidence of serious illness in children and the fact that we're achieving so much with the adult programme at the moment with very high coverage.\n\"If indeed it turns out that children can be indirectly protected by the immunity that we induce in adults then there's clearly no justification for immunising - or at least immunising all of them.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nExtra testing and a push for vaccinations saw infection rates drop in Bolton, a Covid hotspot in north-west England. This approach is now being replicated elsewhere in the region where cases of the Delta variant are rising. The military will step in to carry out extra tests in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, which account for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data. \nHow often are you online every day? A survey of media habits carried out by regulator Ofcom found UK adults spent an average of three hours and 47 minutes online daily during the pandemic. Shoppers in the UK spent more than \u00a3110bn online in 2020 - a rise of almost half -  gaming increased and people were glued to their phones. However, the report noted the digital divide, saying \"lockdown had a greater effect on people who are digitally excluded\".\nThe US has eased travel restrictions for many countries - with 61 being lowered from a Level 4 \"avoid all travel\" rating. Its public health agency updated its criteria on Monday which means places such as France, Spain and Italy are now Level 3, allowing fully-vaccinated passengers to go to these areas. But most passengers from the UK are still banned from travelling to the US.\nGlobally more than 600 million people aged 15-24 are estimated to be out of work, with young women having been the most affected, according to the International Labour Organization. We've spoken to women in Lebanon, Kenya and the UK to hear their stories.\nFor years, people have stood on streets holding 'FREE HUGS' signs. Then the world was hit by the coronavirus pandemic which stopped the movement. BBC health reporter, Laura Foster, has spoken to some of them to find out what they think.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe government should be announcing its decision about England's reopening date in less than a week. While we wait for that, here\u00a0are four key numbers to watch out for in the coming days.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Amanda Bellwood, a part-time worker, has been on furlough since the UK's first coronavirus lockdown and fears she will never return to the company where she has worked for 20 years.\nThe 57-year-old, who is not using her real name, says she is \"certain\" she'll be made redundant in July, when the government will reduce the proportion of people's wages it pays to 70% and employers will have to pay 10% for hours not worked.\n\"I feel cast aside. No one has touched base with me or said even said 'hi' in over a year,\" says the grandmother-of-three, who works for a pen manufacturing and sales company.\n\"It seems to me that lots of businesses are getting rid of their part-timers, scaling down on more experienced personnel and keeping on to junior staff, to save costs.\"\nAccording to flexible working campaigners Timewise, Mrs Bellwood is not alone in fearing redundancy. The consultancy is warning that the UK's 7.8 million part-time workers, most of whom are women, will bear the brunt of job losses when the furlough scheme ends in September.\nA study commissioned by Timewise found that half of all part-time workers had been furloughed at one point during the pandemic, compared to a third of full-time employees.\nMeanwhile, part-time employment has fallen at its fastest rate in at least 30 years during the crisis, with the share of women working part-time at its lowest since records began.  \nEmma Stewart, Timewise's director of development, says employees feel like they are \"clinging on to jobs that will soon disappear\".\nShe says part-time workers could \"effectively be locked out of work\" after analysis of job adverts revealed just 8% of UK job vacancies are advertised as part-time.\nMrs Bellwood, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, says working part-time is \"crucial\" to her supporting her children by looking after and spending time with her grandchildren.\nShe says she has found searching for part-time roles \"demoralising\" and \"all very impersonal\" after sending off hundreds of applications with no reply.\n\"My husband was made redundant last October, he worked for a removal business for 35 years,\" she says.  \n\"Suddenly, we face an uncertain future and it's frightening. I know so many people like me. Over 50, who have lost their part-time jobs.\"\nTimewise says that in 2020, 44% of part-time workers who were classified as being \"away from work\" - or on furlough - during the first lockdown continued to be away between July and September. \nThat compares to about a third of full-time workers.\nTony Wilson, director of Institute for Employment Studies, says part-time workers have been \"hit harder\" by successive lockdowns and are taking on full-time jobs to \"make up for lost earnings\" - both factors driving the fall in part-time roles.\n\"Either way, the signs are that far from heralding a new era of flexible working, this recovery may see far fewer people getting the hours and the flexibility that they need,\" he says.\nOffice for National Statistics figures show 7.8 million people were employed part-time between January and March this year compared to 8.7 million in the same period last year.\nThe number of women employed part-time fell from 6.4 million to 5.7 million.\nKelly Burns, who does not want to use her real name, says it shocked her that it was so hard to find a part-time job after she was made redundant last July.\nThe 42-year-old from Hampshire says it is \"vital\" she can work flexible hours during school time so she can care for her two children as a single mother. \nShe had a job at as a personal assistant for a property company, but is looking for other work after being told she needed to be in the office every day.\n\"My current view of the jobs market is bleak, I am seeing very few part-time and flexible jobs,\" she says.\n\"Some job ads say they are flex but I don't feel convinced after what has just happened to me.\"\nMr Wilson says a new Employment Bill is needed to improve security for part-time workers and to \"strengthen people's rights to work flexibly\".\nA Department for Business spokeswoman said the government was \"wholeheartedly committed to protecting and enhancing workers' rights\".\nIt said it had set up the Flexible Working Taskforce to \"properly understand the changes in ways of working that are emerging as a result of the pandemic\".\n\"We are also taking forward plans to consult on making flexible work the default, unless employers have good reasons not to,\" she added."

      "tags": "Elon Musk,Amazon,Tax,Tax avoidance,Jeff Bezos,George Soros",
      "text": "Details claiming to reveal how little income tax US billionaires pay have been leaked to a news website. \nProPublica says it has seen the tax returns of some of the world's richest people, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett.\nThe website alleges Amazon's Mr Bezos paid no tax in 2007 and 2011, while Tesla's Mr Musk paid nothing in 2018.\nA White House spokeswoman called the leak \"illegal\", and the FBI and tax authorities are investigating. \nProPublica said it was analysing what it called a \"vast trove of Internal Revenue Service data\" on the taxes of the billionaires, and would release further details over coming weeks.\nWhile the BBC has not been able to confirm the claims, the alleged leak comes at a time of growing debate about the amount of tax paid by the wealthy and widening inequality.\nProPublica said the richest 25 Americans pay less in tax - an average of 15.8% of adjusted gross income - than most mainstream US workers.\nJesse Eisinger, senior reporter and editor at ProPublica, told the Today Programme: \"We were pretty astonished that you could get [tax] down to zero if you were a multi-billionaire. Actually paying zero in tax really floored us. Ultra-wealthy people can sidestep the system in an entirely legal way.\" \n\"They have enormous ability to find deductions, find credits and exploit loopholes in the system,\" he said.  \nSo while the value of their wealth grows enormously through their ownership of shares in their company, that's not recorded as income. \nBut there's more than that, he said: \"They also take aggressive tax deductions, often because they have borrowed to fund their lifestyle.\" \nHe said US billionaires buy an asset, build one or inherit a fortune, and then borrow against their wealth.  \nBecause they don't realise any gains or sell any stock, they're not taking any income, which could be taxed.  \n\"They then borrow from a bank at a relatively low interest rate, live off that and can use the interest expenses as deductions on their income,\" he said. \nThe website said that \"using perfectly legal tax strategies, many of the uber-rich are able to shrink their federal tax bills to nothing or close to it\" even as their wealth soared over the past few years.\nThe wealthy, as with many ordinary citizens, are able to reduce their income tax bills via such things as charitable donations and drawing money from investment income rather than wage income.\nProPublica, using data collected by Forbes magazine, said the wealth of the 25 richest Americans collectively jumped by $401bn from 2014 to 2018 - but they paid $13.6bn in income tax over those years. \nPresident Joe Biden has vowed to increase tax on the richest Americans as part of a mission to improve equality and raise money for his massive infrastructure investment programme.\nHe wants to raise the top rate of tax, double the tax on what high earners make from investments, and change inheritance tax.\nHowever, ProPublica's analysis concluded: \"While some wealthy Americans, such as hedge fund managers, would pay more taxes under the current Biden administration proposals, the vast majority of the top 25 would see little change.\"\nOne of the billionaires mentioned, the philanthropist George Soros, is also alleged to have paid minimal tax. His office had not replied to a BBC request for comment, but said in a statement to ProPublica that Mr Soros did not owe tax some years because of losses on investments.\nThe statement also pointed out that he had long supported higher taxes on America's wealthiest people.\nAccording to reports in the US, Michael Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York whose tax details were among the documents, said the disclosure raised privacy concerns and he would use \"legal means\" to uncover the source of the leak.\nProPublica, an investigative website, has written several articles about how budget cuts at the US Internal Revenue Service have hampered its ability to enforce tax rules on the wealthy and large corporations. The news organisation said it received the leaked documents in response to these articles. \nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that \"any unauthorised disclosure of confidential government information\" is illegal.\nTreasury Department spokeswoman Lily Adams said in an emailed statement to Reuters that the matter has been referred to the FBI, federal prosecutors and two internal Treasury Department watchdogs, \"all of whom have independent authority to investigate\".\nUS Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig said: \"I can't speak to anything with respect to specific taxpayers. I can confirm that there is an investigation, with respect to the allegations that the source of the information in that article came from the Internal Revenue Service.\"\nWhat's going wrong here? Let's take a very simplified analysis. If the shares I own in the company I founded are worth \u00a31bn at the beginning of the tax year and rise to a value of \u00a32bn by the end of the tax year - how much income tax do I owe? Easy - zero. Because while I am twice as rich, I received zero income.\nOn the other hand, if I have zero assets, and I make \u00a330,000 in income, I will pay roughly \u00a36,000 in income tax and national insurance. That's why the revelations that some of the richest Americans paid little or no income tax may provoke outrage but should not come as a surprise. It's not comparing apples with apples. \nThat's not to say these super rich folks have no money coming in to pay their yacht bills. There is a widespread tactic employed by the rich to borrow cash secured against their vast wealth - which again is not income - it's proceeds of a loan and here's the (perfectly legal) biscuit-taking bit. \nThe interest on that loan can be deducted from any other income to further reduce income tax liability. It sounds egregious - but it's legal. \nSmall wonder that many politicians around the world (Elizabeth Warren in the US and Jeremy Corbyn/John McDonnell in the UK) and academics such as Thomas Piketty have argued that we need a way to tax wealth, not income. \nThe billionaire in our example WILL pay capital gains, currently 20% in UK, the moment he or she sells those shares and realises a profit\nUNLESS, that is, the profit is sunk into another business, which the tax system as it stands is designed to encourage to promote economic growth and new jobs - jobs that will produce income and therefore tax.\nThat, say its defenders, is capitalism at work - but as with the new global consensus on taxing multinationals - the clamour for tax change is getting louder.

      "tags": "Bolton,Manchester,Coronavirus testing,Lancashire County Council,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire will receive extra help to tackle a rise in the Delta variant. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said a \"strengthened package of support\" would be provided to boost Covid vaccinations and testing. \nIt will include military support and supervised in-school testing in the areas hardest hit.\nPeople have also been advised to minimise travel in and out of the area and avoid meeting indoors.\nGreater Manchester and parts of Lancashire have been identified as places where the so-called Indian variant, now named the Delta variant by the World Health Organization, is spreading the fastest.\nAs part of the government guidance, residents are also being encouraged to get tested twice a week and continue to work from home if possible. \nSchools can also reintroduce face coverings in communal areas if advised to do so by directors of public health.\nMr Hancock said the package was based on \"what's working in Bolton\" which saw its infection rates drop after being offered enhanced support. \n\"We know that this approach can work, we've seen it work in south London and in Bolton in stopping a rise in the number of cases,\" he said.\n\"This is the next stage of tackling the pandemic in Manchester and in Lancashire, and of course it's vital that people in these areas - as everywhere else - come forward and get the jab as soon as they're eligible because that is our way out of this pandemic together.\" \nThe Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said people should be cautious and vigilant but should \"carry on living their lives\". \n\"This is guidance, it is advice to the public, it is not a lockdown, it is not a ban,\" he said. \n\"This is not about telling people to cancel their plans, it is asking them to be careful in setting any new ones, to minimise non-essential travel and that in our view is a sensible approach given the rise in cases.\" \nNHS North West medical director Dr David Levy said the vaccine rollout has had \"a tremendous impact\" on reducing the number of Covid cases.\nBut he urged anyone who is eligible for the vaccine to book their jab as \"things are very different this time\". \n\"What we are seeing is younger patients coming into our North West hospitals at the moment,\" he told BBC North West Tonight.\nThe tactics deployed in Bolton over the past month are now being seen as the template for how to curb the Delta variant. \nWhen infection rates took off in early May the area was flooded with testing, while there was a big push on getting people to come forward for vaccination - the numbers receiving their first jab more than trebled in the space of a few weeks.\nThe result has seen a drop in infection rates - they are down by more than a quarter in the past 10 days - without the need to impose extra restrictions.\nWith other parts of Greater Manchester seeing big rises, the hope now is that the tactics will work on a wider footprint.\nBut these tactics have their limitations. At the moment the rise in cases in England is largely being drive by what is happening in the North West - more than 40% of all cases over the past week were in this region.\nIf other parts of the country start to see more significant rises, the approach becomes more difficult to pull off as resources become more stretched.\nThe new support and advice has been issued to all 10 boroughs in Greater Manchester as well as places within the Lancashire County Council area. \nThose include Burnley, Chorley, Fylde, Hyndburn, Lancaster, Pendle, Preston, Ribble Valley, Rossendale, South Ribble, West Lancashire and Wyre.\nDr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health for Lancashire County Council, said Covid cases were \"continuing to rise at a worrying pace\". \nHe said the council had been pushing to extend the surge testing and vaccinations, which was already being rolled out in Burnley.\n\"The government has listened to our calls and has now agreed to provide Lancashire with enhanced support, which gives us more flexibility to fight this new wave of infections,\" he added. \nLatest government figures showed that 18 of the top 20 areas with the highest infection rates in England in the week leading up to 4 June were in Greater Manchester or Lancashire, with the neighbouring Cheshire East borough one of the other two.\nBlackburn with Darwen had the highest rate with 556.5 cases per 100,000 people, while in second-placed Bolton and third-placed Rossendale the rates dropped to 320.3 cases and 310.6 cases respectively over the same period.\nThe other areas in the top 10 - Hyndburn, Burnley, Ribble Valley, Preston and South Ribble in Lancashire and the Greater Manchester boroughs of Salford and Manchester - all also saw rates rise.\nA total of 5.7m people live in areas of England covered by the government's enhanced coronavirus guidance, which is the equivalent of 10% of the population.\nAcross the UK there have been a further 6,048 coronavirus cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to Tuesday's daily government figures.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nMore than a million coronavirus vaccine bookings were made on the NHS website yesterday for the first time - on the day all 25 to 29-year-olds were eligible to access it. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens labelled it a \"Glastonbury style\" rush - a reference to the traditional race to book tickets for the music festival. Meanwhile, another 7,540 people tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday - the highest daily number of cases since the end of February.\nFor the first time since the middle of May, the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 in the UK has risen above 1,000. It comes as scientists warn of the risks of a third wave, as cases of the Delta variant (first identified in India) rise. Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling was key to the first lockdown in March last year, told a media briefing that delaying the planned lifting of the last remaining restrictions on 21 June would allow more people to be vaccinated. He added that it was not clear how cases will translate into hospitalisations and it would take a few more weeks to find out.\nPolice officers feel a \"deep sense of betrayal\" that they were not prioritised for Covid-19 vaccinations, the Police Federation chairman has said. John Apter said he pressed the home secretary to ensure officers were moved up the vaccine priority list. The order of the rollout was based on the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and began with those most at risk of death and serious illness from Covid-19. Ministers lobbied the JCVI but Priti Patel said the government had to accept its decision not to make police an exception.\nA record number of fake online pharmacies were shut down in May as criminals sought to take advantage of the pandemic. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organization, led a global crackdown which saw more than 100,000 online marketplaces offering illicit drugs taken down. Between 18 and 25 May, there were 277 arrests involving 92 countries and in the UK, fake medicines worth more than $13m (\u00a39.17m) were seized as part of the efforts. Most of the illegal medical devices seized were fake or unauthorised Covid testing kits.\nPassing a driving test is a rite of passage for many people the world over, but learner drivers in Scotland are facing a 16-week wait to sit a theory test due to 2m social distancing requirements in testing centres. Scotland's learner drivers are waiting almost four times longer their their English and Welsh counterparts. South of the border only 1m physical distancing is required. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she will look at the situation to see how quickly capacity can be increased.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe government should be announcing its decision about England's reopening date in less than a week.

      "text": "The long-time host of hit US dating show The Bachelor is stepping down permanently after widespread criticism of his comments on race.\nChris Harrison, who also fronted the show's spin-offs, will not return to the ABC programmes, Deadline reported. \nControversy erupted in February after he excused past behaviour of a cast member who had been accused of racism, saying he was not the \"woke police\".\n\"By excusing historical racism, I defended it,\" he said at the time.\nHarrison hosted The Bachelor for 25 seasons, from the show's beginning in 2002. He also fronted The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise. \nThe Bachelor and The Bachelorette revolve around a single man or woman selecting a potential spouse from a pool of suitors. \nThe news of Harrison's permanent exit came a day after season 17 of The Bachelorette began without him. Former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe are the show's hosts instead.\nIn February, Harrison \"stepped aside\" and apologised for \"speaking in a manner that perpetuates racism\" during an interview with former Bachelorette Rachelle Lindsay. \nIn the interview, he commented on photos showing The Bachelor contestant Rachael Kirkconnell at a ball themed around a slavery-era plantation when she was 18.\nHarrison later issued a longer apology, saying: \"By excusing historical racism, I defended it. I invoked the term 'woke police', which is unacceptable. I am ashamed over how uninformed I was. I was so wrong.\"\nKirkconnell also apologised, saying: \"At one point, I didn't recognise how offensive and racist my actions were, but that doesn't excuse them.\n\"My age or when it happened does not excuse anything. They are not acceptable or okay in any sense. I was ignorant, but my ignorance was racist.\"\nIn June 2020, fans of the ABC show petitioned for it to address the unequal treatment of cast members of colour.\nAt the forefront of that initiative was Lindsay, who at the time was the only black lead to have ever served on The Bachelorette.\nThe show responded with a promise to address their race issues by casting more people of colour, and announced The Bachelor's first black lead, Matt James, for the series in which Kirkconnell was a contestant.\nShe ended up winning, and she and James are still in a relationship.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

On Monday, he pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to kidnapping and raping Ms Everard.\nHe also accepted responsibility for the advertising executive's death but did not enter a plea on the charge of murder.\nMs Everard, 33, visited a friend in the Clapham Junction area on 3 March and left at about 21:00 GMT to make what was roughly a 2.5-mile (4km) journey home.\nShe never arrived and was reported missing by her boyfriend the next day.\nHer body was found a week later inside a builder's bag in an area of woodland in Ashford, Kent, and was identified using dental records.\nPost-mortem examinations revealed Ms Everard died as a result of compression of the neck.\nCouzens, of Deal, is next due to appear at the Old Bailey for a plea hearing on 9 July."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Recorded Covid infections among children are now the highest they have been during the outbreak in Scotland.\nWeekly infections in 0-14 year olds reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland.\nWhile there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill, growing numbers of pupils are off school.\nNicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the regulator.\nThe number of cases among the youngest age group is rising rapidly, having seen a near four-fold increase since early May.\nDespite the rise, medics have said children's wards are not seeing any significant rise in admissions due to Covid and said there is no reason for parents to worry.\nHowever, a number of schools have had to shut temporarily because of pupils testing positive, with St Peter's Primary in Galashiels among the latest to announce a short closure to allow contact tracing. \nWhile most schools are open, growing numbers of pupils have been asked to stay home because they are possible contacts of pupils who have tested positive.\nProvisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%, the lowest percentage since pupils returned after Easter. \nChildren under the age of 15 represent about quarter of the daily case numbers in recent weeks in terms of total numbers.\nHowever, when the size of the population in each age group is factored in, it is clear that infection rates are considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. \nOn 7 June, the weekly case rate among people in their early 20s was 277.2 per 100,000.\nOlder teenagers had the second highest rate, at 228.4, while for younger children it was 122.9.\nWhat is clear from the data is that infections among older age groups are relatively low during the latest outbreaks, possibly a reflection of the rollout of the vaccination programme.\nMore than half of Scotland's adult population has now had both doses of a Covid vaccine.\nThe UK regulator has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15.\nThe Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)  on whether it should begin vaccinating children.\nOn Tuesday the first minister said the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated but if the JCVI recommends vaccination of children, she said Scotland would \"move as quickly as possible to implement the advice\".\nScottish government adviser Prof Devi Sridhar has backed the rollout of the vaccine to those over the age of 12.\nSpeaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier this week, she said: \"If we want schools to continue without disruption in the autumn and lift restrictions so children can have a normal experience, we need to vaccinate them \u2014 if we wait and watch for the evidence it will be too late in the next few weeks.\n\"We have the supply. It's not a large amount, it's a couple of million doses to cover that population of 12-plus.\n\"Given that we know children can transmit, where we are going to see problems is not going to be in care homes, it's not going to be in hospitals, it's going to be in schools.\"\nAnother leading health expert, Prof Linda Bauld, has said she \"really welcomed\" plans to vaccinate teenagers but said completing the adult age groups must come first. \nShe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"They will be next in line after we have issued vaccinations to all the 18-29 year olds, as Wales has already done. I really welcome the vaccine programme for teenagers... it will make a difference but they will not be able to receive it until older groups have. \n\"Over two million teenagers in the US have already received the vaccine, the trials suggest it's safe, so let's hope this all goes well.\" \nWith world leaders facing calls to do more to share vaccines internationally, some have argued a greater priority should be driving down infections globally, which could be the source of new variants. \nChristine Tait-Burkhard, an infection expert from University of Edinburgh, said it was a complex issue because while vaccination might help school attendance, there is little evidence of children becoming seriously ill. \nShe told Drivetime with John Beattie: \"The last question is an ethical one. If we are starting to vaccinate children in this country yet other countries haven't got any vaccines or very little vaccines to vaccinate their most vulnerable.\n\"It is not only an ethical question, it's also a message that it sends to the world that says we don't care.\"\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has said that if enough immunity was built up through the adult vaccination programme then vaccinating children may not be justified.\nHe said: \"The issue is not that there's a problem doing it, it's just a question of whether we need to do it, given the very low incidence of serious illness in children and the fact that we're achieving so much with the adult programme at the moment with very high coverage.\n\"If indeed it turns out that children can be indirectly protected by the immunity that we induce in adults then there's clearly no justification for immunising - or at least immunising all of them.\" "

      "text": "US President Joe Biden's administration will provide 500 million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to about 100 countries over the next two years, US media report.\nAbout 200 million doses will be distributed this year, with the remainder delivered in 2022.\nThe US has been under pressure to raise vaccination rates in poor countries.\nThe move comes as Mr Biden landed in the UK at the start of his first foreign trip as US president.\nThe White House is yet to officially comment on the plan to roll out 500 million doses worldwide.\nBut when asked if the US government had a vaccination strategy for the world, Mr Biden said: \"I have one, and I'll be announcing it,\" before boarding Air Force One. \nAn eager crowd awaited his arrival on Wednesday at the RAF Mildenhall airbase in Suffolk, keen to catch a glimpse of Air Force One when Mr Biden touched down on Wednesday evening.\nMr Biden addressed US troops stationed at the base, paying tribute to military families and remembering his late son, Beau, who served in the National Guard.\nHe praised US allies - \"like-minded nations\" - and added: \"The United States is back!\"\n\"Democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges and the issues that matter most to our future,\" he said.\nMr Biden later travelled on to Cornwall. The US president and Prime Minister Boris Johnson will meet for the first time on Thursday, ahead of the G7 summit in the south-western corner of England.\nAlso in his eight-day trip Mr Biden will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle and join his first Nato summit as president. He has said the visit is about \"America rallying the world's democracies\". \nThe US president is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, at the end of his travels in Europe.\nThe US government will donate the vaccines to 92 lower-income countries and the African Union, Reuters news agency reports. \nDistribution will go through the Covax scheme, which was set up last year to try to ensure fair access to vaccines among rich and poor nations. \nThe US had previously said it would donate 60m vaccine doses through Covax.\nPeople familiar with the deal told the New York Times that the US would pay for the doses at a \"not-for-profit\" price.\nAlbert Bourla, chief executive of Pfizer, is expected to appear with Mr Biden when he officially announces the initiative on Thursday.\nEarlier this week, Mr Johnson said he would urge G7 leaders to commit to vaccinating the world against Covid-19 by the end of next year.\nThe UK and Canada have not yet said how many doses they will provide to the Covax scheme.\nThe G7 (Group of Seven) is made up of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - plus the EU.\nOther G7 leaders will arrive in Cornwall on Friday, and meetings will get under way the following morning.\nThe main topic of conversation will be Covid recovery, including \"a stronger global health system that can protect us all from future pandemics\".\nThe agenda also includes climate change and trade.\nMr Biden is expected to warn that the ongoing UK-EU trade row could imperil peace in Northern Ireland. He will call on fellow leaders to protect the gains of the Good Friday agreement.\nAt the end of the summit, the UK - as the host nation - will publish a document outlining what has been agreed by the leaders.\nThe first US-Russia summit of the Biden presidency will take place in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June.\nIt comes at the tail end of Mr Biden's trip, giving the president plenty of time to hear from US allies beforehand.\nThe White House has indicated that he intends to cover a \"full range of pressing issues\" with his Russian counterpart, including arms control, climate change, Russian military involvement in Ukraine, Russia's cyber-hacking activities and the jailing of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny.\nThree organisations linked to Mr Navalny were outlawed by a Moscow court on Wednesday as \"extremist\".\nMr Putin threw cold water on the Biden meeting last week, saying he hoped to improve the \"extremely low level of relations\" between the two countries but expected no breakthroughs.\nSpeaking in Suffolk on Wednesday evening, Mr Biden said that the US was not seeking conflict with Russia but wanted a stable, predictable relationship.\n\"I've been clear: the United States will respond in a robust and meaningful way if the Russian government engages in harmful activities.\"\nHe said he would tell Mr Putin there were consequences for \"violating the sovereignty of democracies in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere\".\nThe transatlantic alliance (Nato) would remain a vital source of strength for the UK, Europe and the US, the president said.\nThe White House said Mr Biden's meeting with Mr Johnson ahead of the summit would \"affirm the enduring strength\" of the countries' \"special relationship\".\nBoth leaders took part in a virtual climate action summit hosted by the US in April but have not yet met in person.\nThe president and First Lady Jill Biden will also be received by the Queen at Windsor Castle.\nIt will be the 95-year-old monarch's first meeting with a foreign leader since the death of her husband Prince Philip.\nThe next leg of Mr Biden's trip takes him to Brussels, where he will meet leaders of other Nato countries.\nUS relations with Nato were strained under his predecessor Donald Trump, but Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg - in a White House visit on Monday - hailed Mr Biden's \"powerful commitment\" to US allies."

      "text": "Travel industry figures have dismissed the latest moves by the US and UK to reopen travel.\nA new taskforce will be set up to make recommendations on easing restrictions as part of an \"Atlantic Charter\", set to be agreed on Thursday.\nA Number 10 statement said the prime minister and president would \"work to relaunch UK-US travel as soon as possible\".\nBut the boss of Virgin Atlantic said the announcement \"falls short\".\nChief executive Shai Weiss said: \"The creation of the Atlantic Taskforce is positive recognition of the importance of the UK-US travel corridor and a first step towards reopening the skies.\"\nBut he said the lack of a specific time frame for reopening travel meant airlines, businesses and passengers faced a lack of certainty.\nAhead of the start of the G7 summit in Cornwall, Mr Weiss urged Mr Biden and Mr Johnson to allow trans-Atlantic travel no later than 4 July.\nNearly all passengers from the UK are currently banned from travelling to the US.\nUnder a presidential decree introduced last March, non-US citizens who have been in the UK in the last 14 days cannot enter the country unless a specific exemption applies.\nMeanwhile, travellers from the US to the UK must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival as the country is on the \"amber list\".\nRead more on restrictions when travelling to Amber list countries here.\nClive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, also called for a firm commitment on a date.\n\"We welcome the formation of the Atlantic Charter 2021 as a step in the right direction for transatlantic travel. \n\"However, this is the latest in a long line of travel taskforces which so far have only wreaked further devastation on our industry. Jobs won't be saved, nor livelihoods protected, until we are given a certainty on dates for the resumption of international travel.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Association of British Travel Agents said that \"steps to get travel restarted are very welcome\". But she also pointed out the lack of detail in the announcement.\nShe added: \"Consideration should also be given to capitalising on the success of the UK vaccine rollout by relaxing rules for fully vaccinated individuals when travelling between low-risk areas, as the US, and many other countries, are already doing.\"\nThe taskforce will be overseen in the UK by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and will be chaired by senior officials in the US and UK.\nIt will \"work to explore options for resuming US-UK travel and ensure that the UK and US closely share thinking and expertise on international travel policy going forward\", Downing Street said in a statement.\nIt added: \"Links between the UK and US are not only crucial for our people, they create and sustain jobs across and throughout our two countries.\"\nIn a letter calling for trans-Atlantic travel to reopen on Monday, airline bosses and Heathrow Airport estimated that UK businesses are losing \u00a323m each day that the route remains closed.\nBoris Johnson and Joe Biden will also agree to work together on issues such as the post-pandemic recovery, climate change and security as part of Atlantic Charter, which is expected to be agreed when they meet on Thursday in Cornwall.\nThe original Atlantic Charter was a joint statement made by Winston Churchill and Franklin D Roosevelt in 1941, setting out joint goals in the wake of the Second World War."

      "text": "World leaders are gathering in the Cornish resort of Carbis Bay, for face-to-face meetings at the summit of G7 nations.\nAmong them are Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and President Biden, who is making his first foreign visit since taking office.\nThe G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. \nRussia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014 for its takeover of Crimea.\nChina has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's biggest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are.\nRepresentatives from the European Union are present while India, South Korea and Australia have also been invited this year.\nThe G7's Cornwall meeting takes place from Friday 11 to Sunday 13 June.\nThe UK is holding the G7 presidency for 2021 so this is where the summit is taking place. \nThe meeting is taking place at the Carbis Bay Hotel near St Ives in Cornwall.\nThe region is seen as central to the UK's green technology sector. Showing off the country's green credentials is important to the government ahead of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November. \nIt is not the first time the world leaders have met in a beach resort. The last G7 summit, in 2019, was held in the French seaside town of Biarritz.\nDay-to-day life for locals and tourists in Cornwall is affected, including road and path closures.\nIn some areas of St Ives, residents have to provide proof of address in order to access their homes. \nThe UK government said it was important for world leaders to meet in person and regular Covid testing would take place.\nThroughout the year ministers and officials from the member countries hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events.\nAhead of this year's summit, the G7 finance ministers agreed to make multinational companies pay more tax.\nThe main event is when the G7 leaders come together to talk about the biggest issues of the day.\nThe agenda starts with a dinner at the Eden Project on Friday night, attended by the Queen and members of the Royal Family.\nThe main topic of conversation for the rest of the summit is Covid recovery, including \"a stronger global health system that can protect us all from future pandemics\".\nThe agenda also includes climate change and trade.\nBoris Johnson held talks with President Biden on Thursday afternoon. They covered topics including the President's concerns over the peace in Northern Ireland.\nMost of the conversations take place behind closed doors, but there are set-piece moments on camera - including the obligatory leaders' photo.\nAt the end of the summit, the UK - as the host nation - will publish a document called a communique. This outlines what has been agreed by the leaders.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds a press conference on Sunday.\nProtesting and policing are both more difficult this year because of Covid restrictions.\nMore than 5,000 extra officers - on top of 1,500 from Devon and Cornwall - will police the summit.\nA cruise ship has docked in nearby Falmouth to accommodate all the extra security officers.\nDemonstrators have been told they can gather in four approved protesting sites, including one in Exeter - more than 100 miles away.\nPolice have said they are \"not na\u00efve enough to expect that every protest will take place solely in those four sites\".\nClimate activist group Extinction Rebellion planned a number of demonstrations, including a march from Plymouth to Carbis Bay.\nIt can't pass any laws because it is made up of separate nations with their own democratic processes.\nHowever, some decisions can have global effects.\nFor example, the G7 played crucial role in setting up a global fund to fight malaria and Aids in 2002.\nHowever, the G7 has been criticised as being an \"outdated group of countries\", partly because it does not include two of the largest countries in the world - India and China.

      "text": "Andrew Lloyd Webber has said he is determined to open his theatres on 21 June, even if he risks being arrested.\nThe impresario's West End production of Cinderella is scheduled to begin previews on 25 June, four days after so-called \"freedom day\".\n\"We are going to open, come hell or high water,\" he told the Telegraph.\nThe government has said it will make a judgement soon on whether to proceed with the lifting of lockdown restrictions on 21 June.\nAccording to reports, that date may be pushed back by the government due to concerns over the impact of Covid-19 variant.\nTheatres are currently able to operate with with reduced capacities and socially distanced audiences.\nLord Lloyd-Webber has previously insisted that productions like his large-scale musicals are \"impossible\" under those restrictions.\nThe 73-year-old told the Telegraph he is prepared to be arrested if authorities try to intervene in his reopening plans.\n\"We will say 'come to the theatre and arrest us,'\" the Evita and Phantom of the Opera composer is quoted as saying.\nThe theatre mogul said he may have to sell his six West End venues if the government does not relax its restrictions.\nThe pandemic has had a catastrophic financial impact on the theatre industry and many have remained closed despite the ease in Covid-19 measures.\n\"If the government ignore their own science, we have the mother of all legal cases against them,\" Lord Lloyd-Webber continued.\n\"If Cinderella couldn't open we'd go, 'look, either we go to law about it or you'll have to compensate us.\"'\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday, he called on the government to stop \"penalising\" the live music and theatre sector.\n\"We can open safely,\" the impresario insisted. \"Please, please let us get open.\"\nHe claimed that recent pilot events had shown there was \"no chance of infection being passed... provided certain protocols are maintained\".\nThe government has yet to publish the results of its test event programme, which included having a live audience at last month's Brit Awards.\nAudience members at the Brits, held at London's O2 arena, were not required to wear masks or socially distance as they had all been required to take a Covid test.\nLord Lloyd-Webber said he was happy for his audiences to wear masks at his shows and for so-called vaccine passports to be used.\nHe said he had spoken to \"leading counsel\" who had told him it would be \"neither rational nor proportionate\" for the government to \"stop us from going forward.\"\n\"My feeling is I've gone through everything with the counsel,\" he continued. \"I've gone through [everything] about the theatre itself, which has no recirculated air, the incoming air passes through filters completely.\n\"There are 30 places in the theatre where the spread of air comes from. I'm not a mechanic, but we have the CO2 [carbon dioxide] monitoring that shows that the air is purer in there than it is outside.\"\nAn organisation representing venues that open at night, such as pubs, nightclubs and live music venues, has said it is also considering taking action should the government delay its lockdown relaxing measures.\n\"The decision to delay will leave us no other option but to challenge the government aggressively,\" said Michael Kill, CEO of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA).\nCinderella was due to open last August but is now scheduled to have its opening night at the Gillian Lynne Theatre on 14 July.\nLord Lloyd-Webber also has plans to re-launch his West End productions of The Phantom of the Opera and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\nCommunities secretary Robert Jenrick said on Wednesday he \"completely sympathised\" with the impresario and those in the theatre sector.\n\"We want to get them open, we are doing pilots,\" he told Sky News. \"We want to get those theatres open so great new productions like Cinderella can open.\n\"But you have just got a few more days to wait until the judgment that the Prime Minister is going to make on the basis of the data.\"\nWhen asked if Lord Lloyd-Webber should be arrested if he does open theatres without restrictions relaxing, Mr Jenrick said: \"We all have to abide by the rules.\"\nJulian Knight, the chair of the DCMS (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) Committee said: \"It is very frustrating for the live events industry as we can see from Lord Lloyd-Webber's comments though clearly I wouldn't support anyone breaking the law.\n\"With the 21 June reopening on a knife edge the government needs to be absolutely upfront about the results of its pilot events and how they feed into decision-making.\"\nLord Lloyd-Webber is the owner of seven London theatres, one of which he is currently in the process of selling.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Kamala Harris,Immigration,Guatemala,Mexico,US politics,United States",
      "text": "Vice-President Kamala Harris has faced pressure to visit the US-Mexico border, as she tries to tackle a record migration spike.\nMs Harris had a testy exchange with a journalist who asked why she had not gone to the US southern boundary.\nMembers of Ms Harris's own Democratic party meanwhile criticised her after she warned against illegal immigration.\nOn a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, she said Washington aimed to boost economic development in the region.\nShe and Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said it was in the interests of both countries to address the root causes of migration.\nAbout 178,000 undocumented migrants arrived at the US southern border this April, the highest total in more than two decades.\nThe vice-president's staff initially said the border was part of Ms Harris's portfolio when US President Joe Biden assigned her in March to stem migration from Latin America. But aides have recently been seeking to distance her from the politically toxic crisis.\nWhile recent public polling suggests a generally favourable view of the Biden administration's policies on the economy and pandemic, its handling of the immigration crisis has proven less popular.\nAsked in an interview with NBC News aired on Tuesday morning whether she had any plans to visit the border, Ms Harris threw up her arms and responded: \"At some point. You know... we are going to the border. We have been to the border.\"\nWhen the host pointed out that she had not herself visited the region, she said with a laugh: \"And I haven't been to Europe. I don't understand the point you're making.\" \nMs Harris again brushed off questions about why she had not gone to the border as she spoke to reporters on Tuesday in Mexico.\n\"It would be very easy to say,\" she said, \"we'll travel to one place and therefore it's solved. I don't think anybody thinks that that would be the solution.\"\nPressed on why she would not visit the border, Ms Harris said she had done so when she was a senator for California.\nMs Harris's remarks came at the end of a two-day visit to Guatemala and Mexico, where she met both countries' leaders in a bid to bolster diplomatic ties and help stem undocumented migration to the US.\nCapping off her trip on Tuesday, Ms Harris met President L\u00f3pez Obrador privately for more than an hour, said the vice-president's aides.\nIt is unclear whether she pushed Mexico's president to do more to detain migrants en route to the US. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador, a left-wing leader, has previously blamed the Biden administration for causing the record surge in undocumented migration.\nAn aide to Ms Harris later said she had pledged $130m (\u00a392m) in US aid to support Mexican workers' rights. She has already promised $310m to alleviate the impact of the pandemic and hurricanes last year in Central America.\nBack at the White House daily briefing on Tuesday, Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked why Ms Harris had not visited the US-Mexico boundary.\n\"I think that at some point she may go to the border,\" Ms Psaki said. \"We'll see.\" \nFor as much as she may be coming under pressure to visit the border back at home, it's what she said earlier on this trip which is causing dismay in Central America. Specifically her stark warning that would-be migrants \"do not come\" - three words she repeated for added emphasis.\nA wide array of activists, human rights lawyers and journalists have pointed out the inconsistency in such a message. First, they say, it fails to take into account the reality on the ground for so many millions of the poorest in Central America. Battered by hurricanes, hunger, natural disaster, climate change and coronavirus, the economic downturn in the region could last for many years. That's to mention nothing of the rampant gang violence and forced recruitment of vulnerable young people in the region.\nAdded to that, her statement appeared to ignore the fact that requesting asylum is a legal right, one which Ms Harris had berated the Trump administration for undermining while she was a candidate. More than one observer has commented on how it was particularly jarring to hear it from the vice-president, as the daughter of immigrants herself.\nIn Mexico, the focus shifted to broader bilateral issues: the economy, security co-operation, development plans for southern Mexico and Central America. Yet immigration remains the overriding concern for the Biden administration in this part of the world. For as much as both countries spoke at length of \"orderly, safe and regular migration flows\" or tackling the \"root causes of migration\", most people will remember Vice-President Harris's first international trip for those three short words: \"Do not come\".\nCritics across the political spectrum said Ms Harris's remarks in Guatemala on Monday contradicted the Biden administration's promise to usher in a more humane approach on migration.\n\"Do not come. Do not come,\" the vice-president warned illegal immigrants, adding: \"If you come to our border, you will be turned back.\"\nWhile running for the presidency in 2019, Ms Harris lambasted then-President Donald Trump for turning away undocumented immigrants at the border.\n\"What does Donald Trump do?\" she said. \"He says, 'go back where you came from.' That is not reflective of our America and our values and it's got to end.\"\nMs Harris's remarks on Monday provided fodder for her regular Republican critics, but they also provoked rare rebukes from left-wing members of her own party.\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the influential New York City Democratic congresswoman, called the remark \"disappointing\".\n\"First, seeking asylum at any US border is a 100% legal method of arrival,\" she tweeted.\n\"Second, the US spent decades contributing to regime change and destabilisation in Latin America. We can't help set someone's house on fire and then blame them for fleeing.\"\nFellow members of her ultraliberal group known as the Squad also criticised Ms Harris, who is herself the daughter of migrants - an Indian-born mother and a Jamaican-born father.\n\"The right to seek asylum is not just legally protected. It is a foundational universal human right,\" tweeted Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who was born in Somalia.\nMichigan's Rashida Tlaib also hit out at Ms Harris, writing: \"This whole 'stay there and die' approach is not how our country will promote a more humane and just immigration system.\"\nAsked later about the criticism, Ms Harris said: \"I'm really clear. We have to deal with the root causes and that is my hope. Period.\""

Gyms and indoor swimming pools are also only able to admit half of their maximum capacity.\nOutdoor terraces, which were allowed to open with restrictions last month, will now be able to operate at full capacity.\nRenowned bistro chef Yves Camdeborde told French radio \"we feel happy and a little relieved after the months we've just gone through which have been psychologically hard and financially catastrophic\".\n\"It's almost strange to hear a client say 'a coffee inside please',\" Christophe Guedes, who owns a bar in the suburbs of Paris, told the AFP news agency.\nAn overnight curfew will also be delayed by two hours, meaning that people will be able to remain outside until 23:00 local time. The curfew could be scrapped altogether on 30 June if infection rates remain low.\nOther changes include an end to rules on working from home, although employers will have to agree the number of days staff come into the office in advance.\nVisitors from the EU and a number of other countries - including Australia, Israel, Lebanon and South Korea - can now visit France from without a PCR test, as long as they have completed the full course of an EU-approved vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson). \nFully vaccinated people from other areas, including the UK and the US, will still have to provide a negative test, but will no longer have to provide a compelling reason for travel. UK visitors have to quarantine on their return home. The rules will remain in place until the EU's green pass comes into effect in early July. \nWhile promoting the easing of restrictions on Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron was slapped during a visit to a hotel school in the south east of France.\nPresident Macron later called it an \"isolated event\", while politicians from across the political divide condemned the incident.\nTwo 28-year-old men were detained after the incident in the town of Tain-l'Hermitage. French media said firearms and a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf were found during a search of one of the pair, Arthur C, who is suspected of filming the slap.\nA similar roll-back of restrictions is taking place in Belgium from Wednesday, with cafes and restaurants allowing up to four customers per table indoors.\nIndoor events of no more than 200 people, or 75% capacity, are also being permitted.\nWorking from home rules remain in place, although workers can now request to spend one day per week in the office as long as larger offices keep to a daily capacity of 20% of the workforce.\nBelgians can now visit each other at home, with up to four visitors permitted.\nThe European Parliament voted on Wednesday to enshrine into law an EU-wide travel document known as the digital Covid certificate.\nSeveral EU countries have already started issuing the free certificates. EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said on Tuesday that a million certificates had already been issued to EU citizens.\nThey will allow people who have been vaccinated, tested negative or who have recently recovered from a coronavirus infection to travel across the bloc."

      "tags": "Michael Gove,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Mayor of Greater Manchester,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Rishi Sunak,NHS England,Coronavirus pandemic,Andy Burnham",
      "text": "Coronavirus vaccines and tests are being stepped up in areas of north-west England to try to deal with the rise in cases of the Delta variant.\nSimilar tactics to those successfully used in Bolton will be implemented across the whole of Greater Manchester and Lancashire. \nBut local leaders have asked for extra jabs to vaccinate everyone even faster.\nIt comes as debate continues about whether England's next lockdown easing will go ahead as planned on 21 June.\nThere is less than a week until the government is due to announce its decision about the reopening date.\nAt the weekend, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Delta variant - first discovered in India - was 40% more transmissible than the previously-dominant Alpha variant, first discovered in Kent.\nAfter Covid hotspot Bolton saw a drop in infection rates through a vaccine push and extra testing, the government is now doing the same elsewhere in the region where cases are rising. \nBut the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has called on the government to go further and said vaccine supplies should be given to the area earlier than planned.\n\"The need is now,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \"It is spreading again in places like this, so the vaccination programme can have the most impact right now.\"\n\"It's not about asking for more supplies than we are entitled to, it's about bringing forward our supplies so we can make a bigger difference,\" he added. \nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the government would continue to follow the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's advice, with the vaccine programme based on age rather than geography.\nHe said there was a \"significant rise\" in Covid cases and the government was doing things to help people get vaccinated as quickly as possible in the region, including using the military for logistics and vaccine buses.\nSome health officials in the area have already urged over-18s to book jabs - ahead of England's current timetable.\nAcross England, there was a surge in demand for vaccines on Tuesday morning as people aged 25 to 29 were invited to book jabs, NHS England said.\nIt was a \"Glastonbury-style rush for appointments\", said NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens - with more than 1,600 jabs being booked every minute.\nIt was always expected cases would rise at this stage - allowing indoor mixing is the move that allows the virus to spread most easily.\nBut what is concerning government scientists is how quickly cases are going up - and how that has begun to translate into hospital admissions.\nThe increase in hospital admissions is only really apparent in the north-west so far - more than a third of admissions since the start of June have been in that region.\nThe hope was the vaccination programme would lead to a slower increase in infections and hospital admissions would be flatter. But the Delta variant appears to have complicated matters - and so the alarm bells are beginning to ring.\nBut it is still early days. There is hope this rise could tail off - given the immunity that has built up in the population - and what has been seen in the north-west does not translate to other parts of the country.\nAs painful as it is, the message from scientists is that a delay in fully opening up allows more time to gather data and understand what is happening and to vaccinate more.\nA slowing of the progress on the roadmap - rather than the ending of it.\nMr Burnham urged people to take up their second Covid jab, as he said it doubled the protection against the Delta variant, while Mr Jenrick said the second dose was \"very important\".\nLancashire's public health director Dr Sakthi Karunanithi told BBC Breakfast the proportion of people double-vaccinated could vary from 20% to 70% depending on the area.\nHe said the focus locally was to make testing become \"part of our normal routine\", as well as \"bringing vaccines closer to people\" through walk-in centres and pop-up clinics.\nGreater Manchester and Lancashire accounts for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data.\nPeople in those areas are also being advised to meet outside rather than inside and avoid travelling in and out of affected areas. \nLocal health directors can also reintroduce face coverings in school communal areas if they want to.\nAlthough the government is issuing guidance \"to ask people to conduct themselves sensibly\" in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was no plan to introduce local lockdowns, saying: \"We don't have any plan to return to the regional or the tiered approach that we saw last autumn.\"\nMr Burnham said that while people did not have to cancel their plans, they should be sensible and take precautions, such as socialising outside where possible and minimising travel.\nThe next big date of lockdown easing in England is scheduled for 21 June. It would see all remaining rules lifted, meaning an end to mask wearing and working from home guidance, nightclubs reopening and no limits on numbers at weddings, concerts and other large events.\nAccording to the Guardian on Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is willing to accept a delay of up to four weeks to the reopening.\nThe paper cites a Whitehall source saying Mr Sunak was more concerned that when rules are lifted, it will be irreversible. \nA source in the Treasury pointed out to the BBC that the government's support packages for workers - such as the furlough scheme - already extended beyond the June date in case there needed to be a delay.\nBut the Huff Post UK reported earlier that Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove had told colleagues that if he were a betting man, he would bet on a relaxation of rules on 21 June.\nThe government has repeatedly said it would look carefully at the data before it came to a final decision on 14 June.\nConservative MP Sir Charles Walker, a lockdown sceptic, has warned there will be a \"huge wave of disappointment\" if the country did not open up on 21 June.\nHe told BBC Newsnight: \"The delay could be two weeks, a month, but I think the real issue here is if we can't open up the economy at the height of summer then I think we are facing the very real prospect of more forced lockdowns in the autumn - I just don't see how we can avoid that.\n\"The goalposts - as we've always said, it's a well-worn cliche - are moving.\" \nIt is not just in the north-west that the Army has been providing support, with personnel helping with the vaccination programme in Lothian and Lanarkshire in Scotland.\nMeanwhile surge testing has been implemented in several areas where rises in cases are being driven by the Delta variant - including Kingston in south-west London, Kirklees and Calderdale in west Yorkshire, and Reading and Wokingham in Berkshire.\nOn Tuesday, another 6,048 new cases in the UK were announced, and a further 13 deaths. More than 53% of adults have had two vaccine doses, meaning they are fully vaccinated."

      "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron has been slapped in the face on an official visit to the south-east of France. \nIn a video circulating on social media, Mr Macron is seen walking up to a barrier on a trip to Tain-l'Hermitage outside the city of Valence.\nA man in a green T-shirt slaps Mr Macron in the face before officers quickly move in. The president, meanwhile, is pulled away.\nTwo men have been arrested following the incident, French media report. \nPresident Macron later called it an \"isolated event\". \n\"We must not let ultra-violent people take over the public debate: they do not deserve it,\" he told French newspaper Le Dauphin\u00e9.\nThe man reportedly shouted \"Down with Macron-ism\" as he slapped the president, as well as \"Montjoie, Saint-Denis\" - the battle-cry of the old Kingdom of France, in reference to the banner of King Charlemagne.\nIn the video Mr Macron briefly returned to the barrier after the incident and once again interacted with the crowd.\n\"I continued and I will continue,\" he later told Le Dauphin\u00e9. \"Nothing will stop me.\"\nAs yet the identity and motive of the man are unclear. The local prefecture said he and another individual are being questioned by the gendarmerie, in a statement reported by AFP news agency.\nOfficers were out in force on the streets of Valence shortly after the slap, according to one French journalist's tweet. \nFrench presidents are protected by the Security Group for the Presidency of the Republic, known as GSPR. \nIt was set up in 1983 and is reportedly composed of 77 men and women to protect Mr Macron during events. \nAccording to French TV channel BFM, officers scout locations before a presidential visit. Armed personnel are then assigned to closely guard the president on the trip itself. \nThe channel reports that 10 members of the GSPR were with Mr Macron on Tuesday's trip. \nPoliticians have swiftly denounced the incident. \nPrime Minister Jean Castex told the National Assembly shortly afterwards that while democracy meant debate and legitimate disagreement \"it must never in any case mean violence, verbal aggression and even less physical attack\".\nFar-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon tweeted his \"solidarity with the president\" immediately after the slap.\nAnd far-right leader Marine Le Pen posted her own condemnation, saying that \"while democratic debate can be bitter, it can never tolerate physical violence\".\nPresident Macron is currently on a tour of France and had just visited a hotel school in Tain-l'Hermitage. His visit to the area was set to continue on Tuesday, officials said, with a trip to a vocational institute for 25-30 year-olds.\nThe president's visit comes on the eve of a major step for French bars and restaurants, which will be able to reopen to indoor customers after seven months of closure. France's overnight curfew is also being pushed back from 21:00 to 23:00 on Wednesday.\n\"Tomorrow, a new step will be taken,\" Mr Macron tweeted after his visit to the hotel school. \"Life will resume in all our territories!\""

      "text": "Passengers on a cruise ship touring the UK have been told they will not be allowed to disembark in Scotland.\nThe MSC Virtuosa's operator says Scottish government Covid rules block it from entering the port of Greenock.\nThe government has said domestic cruises can only restart when restrictions in all of Scotland reach level one.\nIt insisted the decision was based on the risks \"between both cruises and the wider travel context\".\nThe MSC Virtuosa left Liverpool earlier this week for a seven-night cruise, with planned stops in Greenock in Inverclyde, as well as Belfast, Southampton and the Isle of Portland.\nIt was then due to stop in Greenock again on the return journey.\nIt can carry more than 6,000 passengers but has just under 900 currently on board to allow for social-distancing measures.\nThe Scottish Passenger Agents Association (SPAA) confirmed that Wednesday's scheduled stop in Greenock had been cancelled. The ship was due to dock in Greenock at about 09:30, departing at 20:00 the same day.\nThe industry body said the situation meant Scots on board the vessel were effectively \"barred from setting foot in their own country\". Passengers will not be able to get on the ship at Greenock either.\nThe SPAA said it understood 75% of passengers on board were fully vaccinated, and had recently tested negative.\nThe organisation's president, Joanne Dooey, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme she believed the decision was \"ludicrous\" when people can travel into Scotland by train or car unhindered.\nShe said: \"We had the Northern Belle in last week to Edinburgh from Manchester which had lots of tourists on it with no testing at all.\n\"What's the difference between a cruise ship coming in and football taking place in Glasgow with no testing being put in place?\n\"And when are we ever going to have confidence in the vaccination progress? We are going to have to live with new variants coming in and we have to get on with our lives.\"\nThe SPAA has seen a copy of an email sent to current passengers by the cruise operator.\nIt says: \"Due to the latest Scottish government Covid 19 restrictions and regulations... we are sorry to inform you that the port call of Greenock has been cancelled.\n\"No guests are allowed to embark or disembark... This decision has been made by the Scottish government and is out of our control.\"\nScottish passengers were due to join the cruise in Greenock and the SPAA anticipated that a third of those currently on board were expected to go ashore for excursions on Wednesday.\nMichele Lister, who works for Glasgow-based Glen Travel, is one of those who boarded the ship in Liverpool.\nShe said: \"We were expecting to go into Greenock tomorrow morning for the full day... and we're not allowed to go into my own country which is really disappointing.\n\"There's about half a dozen people that I'm aware of on board that are Scottish and they want to show off to the English customers what Scotland's all about and they want to spend the money in the area as well, which is badly needed.\"\nLinda Hill, who owns LAH Travel in West Kilbride, described the decision as \"another nail in the coffin for the travel industry\".\nShe told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme: \"The cruise industry has obviously been very hard hit over the past 18 months.\n\"But we had seen a way to start, very safely, some UK cruises with lots of very safe protocols including limited numbers on board.\n\"This is a brand new cruise ship which was coming to Greenock tomorrow and there was great excitement to see such a fabulous cruise liner in our own waters.\n\"Sadly, the Scottish government has said passengers cannot embark or disembark at Greenock. The sailing is still going ahead - it's just missing out Scotland.\"\nIn a statement, the Scottish government said it fully understood \"the impact of the current restrictions on domestic cruises\". \nIt added: \"We explained our concerns about the transmission risks posed by cruise vessels in an update to industry on the 24 May and confirmed that we would clarify the position in June. \n\"Following extensive engagement with stakeholders, we have now confirmed that domestic cruises can restart when all of Scotland reaches level one and we have made industry, including the operator, aware of this.\"\nAn MSC spokeswoman said: \"In light of recent information received, we are now awaiting further clarification from the relevant authorities in Scotland about the situation for cruising which regrettably means that we have had to cancel our proposed visit to Greenock tomorrow.\n\"We hope that our calls to Scotland with our special cruises can commence soon considering how much we were looking forward to welcoming our Scottish guests onboard MSC Virtuosa and how we are aware of the important and widespread contribution that the cruise industry makes to Scotland.\"\nAffected passengers have been advised to contact the operator for further information."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Department for Education",
      "text": "The education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, has resigned in a row over the lack of \"credible\" Covid catch-up funding.\nSir Kevan took on the role as catch-up tsar in February to develop a long-term plan to help pupils make up for lost learning during the pandemic.\nBut on Wednesday he stepped down saying the government's funding for the plan \"falls far short of what is needed\".\nHead teachers labelled the \u00a31.4bn cash over three years as a \"damp squib\".\nThe Education Policy Institute had calculated that a catch-up funding recovery would need \u00a313.5bn - and Sir Kevan was reported as having put forward plans costing \u00a315bn.\nThe government's proposal represents \u00a350 per pupil per year - and Sir Kevan wrote to the prime minister saying: \"I do not believe it is credible that a successful recovery can be achieved with a programme of support of this size.\"\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister is hugely grateful to Sir Kevan for his work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic.\n\"The government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning, with over \u00a33bn committed for catch up so far.\"\nEarlier on Wednesday, the government announced an extra \u00a31.4bn over three years for education recovery, in addition to the \u00a31.7bn already announced. \nThis included \u00a31bn for 100 million hours of tutoring, aimed at disadvantaged pupils, and \u00a3250m for teacher training and development.\nThe resignation statement from Sir Kevan, reported by The TES, said: \"A half-hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of pupils. \n\"The support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge and is why I have no option but to resign from my post.\"\nHis resignation letter to Boris Johnson said: \"When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support than the government has to date indicated it intends to provide.\"\nThis was a chaotic end to what should have been a showcase of the catch-up plan for England's schools.\nThe widely-respected adviser brought in to deliver the plans walked out in protest - turning a story that should have been about extra money into an awkward debate about the lack of it.\nThe resignation letter from Sir Kevan Collins to the prime minister makes plain that this should not have come as a surprise.\n\"When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support,\" wrote Sir Kevan.\nBoris Johnson and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had spent the day trying to keep the plans afloat, presenting them as a \"next step\" with more to follow - after strong criticism that the funding was only a tenth of what was required.\nBut Sir Kevan's resignation has fired a torpedo at the government's contention that school recovery is one of its top priorities.\nEarlier, head teachers had said they were \"hugely disappointed\" by the announcement after expectations of a much bigger set of proposals.\nPaul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, described it as a \"damp squib\" and said \"education recovery cannot be done on the cheap\".\nAs such, he said: \"It is completely understandable that Sir Kevan chose not to become a pawn in whatever game the government is playing.\"\nMr Johnson then reassured schools and parents that more funding would be \"coming down the track\".\nSir Kevan had been responsible for overseeing efforts to help schools in England recover from the disruption of the pandemic and lockdowns, which has seen pupils studying from home and exams cancelled over two academic years.\nHe had reportedly called for funding for 100 extra hours of teaching per pupil - including for sports, music and the arts.\nBut any extra teaching time, or longer school days, will now depend on getting further funding from the spending review.\nIn a statement, Sir Kevan said a \"sustained and comprehensive programme of support\" would be needed and that \"more will be needed to meet the scale of the challenge\".\nGeoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"We are sad but not surprised that Sir Kevan Collins is standing down.\n\"We know that Sir Kevan had much bolder and broader plans but that these required substantially more investment than the government was willing to provide.\n\"He's tried his hardest on behalf of children and young people, but, in the final analysis, the political will just wasn't there to support him.\"\nLabour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the resignation was a \"damning indictment of the Conservatives' education catch-up plan\".\n\"He was brought in by Boris Johnson because of his experience and expertise in education, but the government have thrown out his ideas as soon as it came to stumping up the money needed to deliver them.\"\nBefore taking up his post as tsar, Sir Kevan was head of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), which examines evidence for what works in education.\nAs EEF chief executive, he ran an organisation that examined ideas for raising achievement, with the aim of breaking the link between deprivation and poor outcomes in school.\nSir Kevan has had a long career in education, as a former teacher who went on to be the director of children's services and chief executive of Tower Hamlets, east London."

      "tags": "Bolton,Manchester,Coronavirus testing,Lancashire County Council,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire will receive extra help to tackle a rise in the Delta variant. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said a \"strengthened package of support\" would be provided to boost Covid vaccinations and testing. \nIt will include military support and supervised in-school testing in the areas hardest hit.\nPeople have also been advised to minimise travel in and out of the area and avoid meeting indoors.\nGreater Manchester and parts of Lancashire have been identified as places where the so-called Indian variant, now named the Delta variant by the World Health Organization, is spreading the fastest.\nAs part of the government guidance, residents are also being encouraged to get tested twice a week and continue to work from home if possible. \nSchools can also reintroduce face coverings in communal areas if advised to do so by directors of public health.\nMr Hancock said the package was based on \"what's working in Bolton\" which saw its infection rates drop after being offered enhanced support. \n\"We know that this approach can work, we've seen it work in south London and in Bolton in stopping a rise in the number of cases,\" he said.\n\"This is the next stage of tackling the pandemic in Manchester and in Lancashire, and of course it's vital that people in these areas - as everywhere else - come forward and get the jab as soon as they're eligible because that is our way out of this pandemic together.\" \nThe Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said people should be cautious and vigilant but should \"carry on living their lives\". \n\"This is guidance, it is advice to the public, it is not a lockdown, it is not a ban,\" he said. \n\"This is not about telling people to cancel their plans, it is asking them to be careful in setting any new ones, to minimise non-essential travel and that in our view is a sensible approach given the rise in cases.\" \nNHS North West medical director Dr David Levy said the vaccine rollout has had \"a tremendous impact\" on reducing the number of Covid cases.\nBut he urged anyone who is eligible for the vaccine to book their jab as \"things are very different this time\". \n\"What we are seeing is younger patients coming into our North West hospitals at the moment,\" he told BBC North West Tonight.\nThe tactics deployed in Bolton over the past month are now being seen as the template for how to curb the Delta variant. \nWhen infection rates took off in early May the area was flooded with testing, while there was a big push on getting people to come forward for vaccination - the numbers receiving their first jab more than trebled in the space of a few weeks.\nThe result has seen a drop in infection rates - they are down by more than a quarter in the past 10 days - without the need to impose extra restrictions.\nWith other parts of Greater Manchester seeing big rises, the hope now is that the tactics will work on a wider footprint.\nBut these tactics have their limitations. At the moment the rise in cases in England is largely being drive by what is happening in the North West - more than 40% of all cases over the past week were in this region.\nIf other parts of the country start to see more significant rises, the approach becomes more difficult to pull off as resources become more stretched.\nThe new support and advice has been issued to all 10 boroughs in Greater Manchester as well as places within the Lancashire County Council area. \nThose include Burnley, Chorley, Fylde, Hyndburn, Lancaster, Pendle, Preston, Ribble Valley, Rossendale, South Ribble, West Lancashire and Wyre.\nDr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health for Lancashire County Council, said Covid cases were \"continuing to rise at a worrying pace\". \nHe said the council had been pushing to extend the surge testing and vaccinations, which was already being rolled out in Burnley.\n\"The government has listened to our calls and has now agreed to provide Lancashire with enhanced support, which gives us more flexibility to fight this new wave of infections,\" he added. \nLatest government figures showed that 18 of the top 20 areas with the highest infection rates in England in the week leading up to 4 June were in Greater Manchester or Lancashire, with the neighbouring Cheshire East borough one of the other two.\nBlackburn with Darwen had the highest rate with 556.5 cases per 100,000 people, while in second-placed Bolton and third-placed Rossendale the rates dropped to 320.3 cases and 310.6 cases respectively over the same period.\nThe other areas in the top 10 - Hyndburn, Burnley, Ribble Valley, Preston and South Ribble in Lancashire and the Greater Manchester boroughs of Salford and Manchester - all also saw rates rise.\nA total of 5.7m people live in areas of England covered by the government's enhanced coronavirus guidance, which is the equivalent of 10% of the population.\nAcross the UK there have been a further 6,048 coronavirus cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to Tuesday's daily government figures.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Coronavirus vaccines and tests are being stepped up in areas of north-west England to try to deal with the rise in cases of the Delta variant.\nSimilar tactics to those successfully used in Bolton will be implemented across the whole of Greater Manchester and Lancashire. \nBut local leaders have asked for extra jabs to vaccinate everyone even faster.\nIt comes as debate continues about whether England's next lockdown easing will go ahead as planned on 21 June.\nThere is less than a week until the government is due to announce its decision about the reopening date.\nAt the weekend, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Delta variant - first discovered in India - was 40% more transmissible than the previously-dominant Alpha variant, first discovered in Kent.\nAfter Covid hotspot Bolton saw a drop in infection rates through a vaccine push and extra testing, the government is now doing the same elsewhere in the region where cases are rising. \nBut the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has called on the government to go further and said vaccine supplies should be given to the area earlier than planned.\n\"The need is now,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \"It is spreading again in places like this, so the vaccination programme can have the most impact right now.\"\n\"It's not about asking for more supplies than we are entitled to, it's about bringing forward our supplies so we can make a bigger difference,\" he added. \nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the government would continue to follow the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's advice, with the vaccine programme based on age rather than geography.\nHe said there was a \"significant rise\" in Covid cases and the government was doing things to help people get vaccinated as quickly as possible in the region, including using the military for logistics and vaccine buses.\nSome health officials in the area have already urged over-18s to book jabs - ahead of England's current timetable.\nAcross England, there was a surge in demand for vaccines on Tuesday morning as people aged 25 to 29 were invited to book jabs, NHS England said.\nIt was a \"Glastonbury-style rush for appointments\", said NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens - with more than 1,600 jabs being booked every minute.\nIt was always expected cases would rise at this stage - allowing indoor mixing is the move that allows the virus to spread most easily.\nBut what is concerning government scientists is how quickly cases are going up - and how that has begun to translate into hospital admissions.\nThe increase in hospital admissions is only really apparent in the north-west so far - more than a third of admissions since the start of June have been in that region.\nThe hope was the vaccination programme would lead to a slower increase in infections and hospital admissions would be flatter. But the Delta variant appears to have complicated matters - and so the alarm bells are beginning to ring.\nBut it is still early days. There is hope this rise could tail off - given the immunity that has built up in the population - and what has been seen in the north-west does not translate to other parts of the country.\nAs painful as it is, the message from scientists is that a delay in fully opening up allows more time to gather data and understand what is happening and to vaccinate more.\nA slowing of the progress on the roadmap - rather than the ending of it.\nMr Burnham urged people to take up their second Covid jab, as he said it doubled the protection against the Delta variant, while Mr Jenrick said the second dose was \"very important\".\nLancashire's public health director Dr Sakthi Karunanithi told BBC Breakfast the proportion of people double-vaccinated could vary from 20% to 70% depending on the area.\nHe said the focus locally was to make testing become \"part of our normal routine\", as well as \"bringing vaccines closer to people\" through walk-in centres and pop-up clinics.\nGreater Manchester and Lancashire accounts for 90% of the areas with the highest infection rates in England, according to last week's data.\nPeople in those areas are also being advised to meet outside rather than inside and avoid travelling in and out of affected areas. \nLocal health directors can also reintroduce face coverings in school communal areas if they want to.\nAlthough the government is issuing guidance \"to ask people to conduct themselves sensibly\" in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was no plan to introduce local lockdowns, saying: \"We don't have any plan to return to the regional or the tiered approach that we saw last autumn.\"\nMr Burnham said that while people did not have to cancel their plans, they should be sensible and take precautions, such as socialising outside where possible and minimising travel.\nThe next big date of lockdown easing in England is scheduled for 21 June. It would see all remaining rules lifted, meaning an end to mask wearing and working from home guidance, nightclubs reopening and no limits on numbers at weddings, concerts and other large events.\nAccording to the Guardian on Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is willing to accept a delay of up to four weeks to the reopening.\nThe paper cites a Whitehall source saying Mr Sunak was more concerned that when rules are lifted, it will be irreversible. \nA source in the Treasury pointed out to the BBC that the government's support packages for workers - such as the furlough scheme - already extended beyond the June date in case there needed to be a delay.\nBut the Huff Post UK reported earlier that Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove had told colleagues that if he were a betting man, he would bet on a relaxation of rules on 21 June.\nThe government has repeatedly said it would look carefully at the data before it came to a final decision on 14 June.\nConservative MP Sir Charles Walker, a lockdown sceptic, has warned there will be a \"huge wave of disappointment\" if the country did not open up on 21 June.\nHe told BBC Newsnight: \"The delay could be two weeks, a month, but I think the real issue here is if we can't open up the economy at the height of summer then I think we are facing the very real prospect of more forced lockdowns in the autumn - I just don't see how we can avoid that.\n\"The goalposts - as we've always said, it's a well-worn cliche - are moving.\" \nIt is not just in the north-west that the Army has been providing support, with personnel helping with the vaccination programme in Lothian and Lanarkshire in Scotland.\nMeanwhile surge testing has been implemented in several areas where rises in cases are being driven by the Delta variant - including Kingston in south-west London, Kirklees and Calderdale in west Yorkshire, and Reading and Wokingham in Berkshire.\nOn Tuesday, another 6,048 new cases in the UK were announced, and a further 13 deaths. More than 53% of adults have had two vaccine doses, meaning they are fully vaccinated."

      "text": "International travel for non-essential reasons like going on holiday has been legal since 17 May, but with so few countries on the green list, the destinations where travellers can go without quarantining are few in number. \nWhile the government has always said that international travel would be limited, the travel industry had not foreseen that the list would be as limited as it is, particularly now that Portugal has been moved to the amber list.\nSo what could get travel going again and what are the roadblocks?\nWhile the government is concerned about importing new cases into the UK, the biggest concern is that tourists could bring in a vaccine-resistant variant that would render vaccination efforts useless and endanger public health. \nThe difficulty is working out when a variant - or in Portugal's case - a mutation, is significant enough to change a country's traffic light status.\nIs it when it is classified as being \"of concern\", \"of interest\" or just when it's identified in the first place?\n\"The move from variant of interest, to variant of concern, has never been properly identified as the parameters to look at,\" Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at University of Exeter's Medical School tells the BBC.\n\"They mostly all start off as variants of interest and become variants of concern when displaying activities and properties of being more infectious, severe disease causing and bypassing the current vaccines.\"\nBut where that line is drawn is important, particularly if the identification of a variant or mutation is enough to move a country from one level to another. \nSome in the industry think the government is becoming too risk-averse.\n\"There's talk of a new variant and everything shuts down,\" says budget airline Jet2's boss Steve Heapy. \"Is that how it's going to be going forward?\"\n\"If it is, then they're trying to defeat mother nature - virus do have variants all the time.\"\nTim Alderslade, the chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the sector isn't calling a reopening of travel everywhere.\n\"But if the government is going to have this kind of risk appetite...then it's going to be really difficult to see how we can have a summer season,\" he says. \nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"We have always been clear that protecting public health is our priority and that if decisive action was needed, it would be swiftly taken.\"\nThe industry had hoped that while mainland Greece and Spain might not yet be on the green list, at least some of the Spanish and Greek islands would be.\nThe island policy was used last year and Transport secretary Grant Shapps said in April that it was something his department wanted to consider.\nBut there are difficulties with looking at individual islands, partly because of their size.\n\"Healthcare facilities are limited and they can provide what they can and no more,\" says Dr Pankhania. \n\"There could come a time when a British holidaymaker is told, wait - we have Spanish people here who are sick and they could take priority, leaving holidaymakers stuck.\"\nThere are also worries that while coronavirus testing is showing infection rates for island residents, it isn't including the test results for tourists, who might still spread it amongst one another.\nHowever, others argue that including smaller regions on the green list would helpful keep travel flowing where the risk is low.\nThis is a sore point with the travel industry, which says it doesn't understand what tips a country between the different colours. \nWhile the government has laid out criteria like vaccination rates, virus levels, variants and the quality of genomic sequencing offered by a country, it hasn't set out exactly what level of each leads to a move up or down the list.  \n\"We can't plan what we're doing,' says Mr Heapy. \"We've either got to assume all the destinations will be green, none of the destinations will be green or use a lottery machine and try to work it out in the absence of a structured methodology.\"\nUltimately, this isn't just a decision about other countries' data. \nWhile ministers are given recommendations by the Joint Biosecurity Centre about other countries' positions, they also weigh up other issues too, like the UK's health situation, or the practicalities of putting a country on the red, amber or green list. This is still a political decision.\nThere's nothing in the government's guidelines about international business travel, or taking what other nations are doing into account when deciding whether to put a country on the green list.\nYesterday, transatlantic airline bosses came together to put pressure on UK and US politicians to reopen flights between the UK and USA for business and leisure travel. \nThey want to see US President Joe Biden and Boris Johnson commit to announcing a travel corridor at this weekend's G7 meeting in Cornwall.\nThere is no doubt that time is of the essence for airlines, whose finances have been stripped by a year with minimal passengers. \nDelta Airline boss Ed Bastion said it was rare to see all his aviation competitors come together, but that they were \"speaking in one voice\". \nHe warned that as Europe begins to open up to US travellers, the UK could be left behind, missing out on lucrative tourist income.\nThe European Commission has announced that its EU Digital Covid-19 Passport will begin on 1 July, and may also be issued to non-European travellers, including visitors from the UK and the US.\nHowever, European nations are already beginning to welcome travellers.\nSpain, which is on the amber list, started allowing British travellers to enter without the need for a Covid test or vaccination certificate from Monday. \nSo you could visit Spain, but you'd still have to quarantine on your return. \n\"It just beggars belief,\" Travel Trade Gazette editor Sophie Griffiths tells the BBC. \"Especially as countries are opening up and Britain is closing down. People are just confused and frustrated about why that's happening.\"\nEasyJet boss Johan Lundgren agrees: \"This decision has cut Britain off from Europe and from the world for that matter - it's utterly confusing for the British people.\"\nIt is becoming a fine and delicate dance to find the equilibrium between the demands of travel bosses and governments. \n\"I can see where [travel bosses] are coming from,\" says Dr Pankhania.\n\"But from an infection control point of view we are finely balanced now. We are nearly there - it would be better to be completely certain before opening the gates to all, [as] once opened, it is difficult to close them again.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing",
      "text": "There are still \"serious problems\" among private Covid testing firms, with rogue operators making misleading claims, says consumer group Which?.\nMost travellers to the UK are required to pre-book tests for day two and day eight after their return.\nBut several test providers on a government approved list are offering misleading information about pricing and availability, Which? found.\nThe Department for Health said it was carefully monitoring test providers.\nProblems with private test providers first came to light in April when there was an increase in the number of people travelling. Several firms, listed by the government as approved providers, failed to deliver test kits on time, or failed to return results.\nTravellers were left quarantining at home unsure how to meet government testing requirements and in many cases unable to reach the testing companies online or by phone.\nSome didn't receive test kits at all, despite having paid hundreds of pounds. A few received results for tests they hadn't taken. \nSince 17 May the rules on international travel have been eased, and the vast majority of countries are on the government's \"amber\" list meaning travellers, including UK nationals, must pre-book a two-test package before they are allowed into the UK.\nNow, Which? has found some providers are quoting headline prices for one test, when two are required. Others are marketing tests although they aren't ready to deliver them.\n\"Weeks on from some international travel being allowed to resume, it's very concerning to still be uncovering such serious problems with the government's testing system for travellers - problems that could have easily been ironed out well ahead of travel restarting, had proper regulatory oversight been ensured early on,\" said Rory Boland, travel editor at Which?\n\"As it stands, travellers risk being left at the mercy of rogue operators who, at best, attempt to profiteer off of those looking for testing services to allow them to travel, and at worst, risk leaving them out of pocket for services that don't even exist.\"\nHe said the government needed to sort out problems at testing firms before mass travel resumes, to avoid \"chaos for travellers\". \nConfused pricing\nIn late May, Which? investigated the three cheapest offers, that appeared on the list of approved providers from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).\nThe prices offered by Biograd Diagnostics, Screen 4 and Book A Travel Test were between \u00a360 and \u00a398. However, when Which? investigated further it found the quoted prices were for a single test, not the compulsory two-test package.\nThe firms involved said the problem lay with how the DHSC recorded price information.\n\"A number of companies including ourselves were initially confused by the government listing forms,\" said a Book A Travel Test spokesperson.\n\"We have gone to great lengths to support travellers, however, we are not immune to costs and have had to navigate fluctuating charges from labs. We remain committed to doing all we can to deliver an excellent service to travellers during this difficult time.''\nA Screen 4 spokesperson said the problem lay in \"differences in terminology\".\n\"We do not and have never tried to manipulate the listings and we have tried to provide a competitive and reliable service with clearly stated capacity of tests available,\" Screen 4 said.\nFollowing Which's enquiries the headline listed prices of several firms rose.\nHowever Which? said the underlying problem had not been corrected, as subsequently other firms were still quoting prices for a single test, making it appear that tests are available at half the true cost.\nWhich? also found that among the DHSC's accredited providers, several were not yet able to provide tests. Following Which?'s enquiries three firms were removed from the list.\nThe consumer group said taken together the problems suggested a lack of regulatory oversight and called for the government to explore options for reducing the cost of testing and to ensure providers were offering accurate information.\nA DHSC spokesperson said: \"The government regularly evaluates all providers' performance, including their delivery and test turnaround times.\n\"Providers who do not meet the minimum standards set by DHSC and reviewed by the independent United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS), or where our monitoring highlights concerns about their customer service performance, are removed from the gov.uk travel test list. Additionally, providers may not appear on the list where they are temporarily out of stock.\""

      "text": "A British woman who was saved by her twin sister when a crocodile attacked her now has sepsis from her wounds.\nMelissa and Georgia Laurie, 28, were swimming in a lagoon near Puerto Escondido, Mexico, when Melissa was dragged underwater by the reptile.\nGeorgia punched the crocodile and saved her sister, who is now in a medically-induced coma in hospital.\nBut their older sister says Melissa's situation is \"still really serious\" and \"we're not relaxing just yet\".\nHana Laurie told BBC Breakfast that bite wounds to Melissa's stomach and legs had become infected.\n\"She has now developed sepsis,\" she added.\nCrocodiles try to drown their prey so Melissa also had \"a lot of water and grass and things in her lungs,\" Hana said.\nSepsis occurs due to an over-reaction by the body's immune system.\nWhen an infection manages to spread quickly round the body, the immune system kicks in and launches a massive immune response to fight it.\nBut this can have a terrible effect on the body - leading to septic shock, organ failure and even death. \nThe twins, from Berkshire, had been in Mexico to volunteer, work in animal sanctuaries and travel.\nHana previously told Newsbeat that they'd been swimming in a lagoon on Sunday when the crocodile grabbed Melissa and she disappeared under the water.\n\"Georgia found her unresponsive and started to drag her back to the safety of a boat,\" said Hana, 33.\n\"The crocodile kept coming back for more - so she just started hitting it. She'd heard that with with some animals, that's what you've got to do.\" \nHana says Melissa was thrown about like a \"rag doll\" by the reptile.\n\"Luckily, her super-badass twin sister was there to punch it repeatedly - as it came back about three times - to try and save her.\"\nThe family set up a crowdfunding page with a goal of reaching \u00a335,000 to help pay for medical bills and fly the twins' parents to Mexico.\nThat target was reached on Wednesday and Hana says her dad will fly out to Mexico in the next few days.\n\"We have been very lucky and appreciative of the community efforts to find us solutions to some of the logistical issues we're facing,\" she said.\nMelissa's condition remains \"delicate\" but they've now been linked with a \"fantastic\" doctor who's helping the family communicate with the hospital she's at, Hana added. \nThe twins had booked the lagoon trip through a hostel they'd been staying at and had been told the water was safe to swim in - which was \"evidently not the case\", Hana said on Wednesday. \nShe said she was proud of her \"feisty\" sister Georgia, who has now been released from hospital after being treated for the injuries she got while saving Melissa.\nGeorgia is doing \"much better\" but is \"really frightened\" and is finding it \"really difficult\" seeing Melissa in a coma, Hana said.\n\"We're still not out the woods - we're hoping that she has saved her life,\" she added.\n\"It remains to be seen how Melissa is when she wakes up, which she will.\""

      "text": "The phrase \"build back better\" used to be stuck in every government statement like an irritating ring tone you couldn't escape.\nAnd helping schools in England to recover after so much disruption caused by the pandemic was one of the top priorities.\nBut the chief architect of the recovery plan, Sir Kevan Collins, has walked out over a lack of \"credible\" funding, suggesting that he wouldn't put his name to building on the cheap.\nIf not a poundshop, then a \u00a322 shop, which he said would be the amount of catch-up cash the average primary school would receive per pupil per year.\n\"The support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge, and is why I have no option but to resign from my post,\" said Sir Kevan, as he quit his high-profile role.\nIt was a damning response from someone highly respected and with decades of experience. The only thing not straightforward about Sir Kevan is how he spells Kevan.\nSo what happens next? Does that scupper the government's recovery plan in one of its key areas?\nAs Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said, the \u00a31.4bn promised over three years is a \"pretty hefty amount\". So what was wrong with that? Weren't the head teachers who called it a \"damp squib\" expecting far too much?\nThe tutoring plan announced will presumably go ahead. Sir Kevan has continued to back it - but he saw the tutoring cash as an appetising starter rather than the nourishing main course.\nIt will be aimed at disadvantaged children who are most likely to have fallen behind, but it will not be available for all pupils. Many will not get any tutoring from this.\n\"It is not a panacea,\" Sir Kevan said.\nThe much bigger what-happens-next question is about the much wider, more expensive investment in schools that Sir Kevan had proposed.\n\"The stakes here are very high. Namely the future prosperity and health of our children,\" said Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust social mobility charity.\nHe said that Sir Kevan was right to walk away \"given the derisory amount\" being offered for catch-up.\nThe much bigger plan, which failed to turn up on Wednesday, was about extra hours in school.\nThere were some mixed messages about this - with the education secretary talking about a longer day, such as for schools which might finish at 14:45.\nBut Sir Kevan's plan called for a major injection of cash to extend the school day by 30 minutes, in a flexible and fully-funded way, which might be for extra lessons or for sports or arts clubs or other \"enrichment\" activities.\nThis was the big ticket part of the plan and would have run for three years, with the aim of recovering lost learning and stopping the disruption of the pandemic becoming a long-term disadvantage.\nIt would give schools funding for extra staffing and services, without putting extra pressure on their teachers.\nIt had echoes of the \"extended schools\" scheme, rolled out under Tony Blair's Labour government.\nWith Sir Kevan's resignation, the government will now have to decide what to do with the blueprint left on their desks as the door slammed. \nApart from the core questions of helping children to catch up, there will be other factors to consider. Like money. And it will become part of the arm-wrestling over the next spending review.\nThe prime minister promised more funding would be \"coming down the track\", but without any specific commitment.\nAs well as this possible \u00a315bn bid for catch-up cash, the Treasury will also be thinking about another big education project - the funding of student finance for people on vocational courses.\nThere are still many big questions about how this expanded loan system is going to operate and how much it will cost.\nThere's also the issue of timing and changing moods. The school catch-up tsar was appointed in February, when many pupils were studying at home, and there was huge pressure to show a pathway to a recovery.\nIn the autumn, when funding plans are next considered, the biggest recent education issue is likely to have been another round of arguments over replacement exam results. \nWill the political heat have left the catch-up debate? Will there be more appetite to get back to normal rather than push for more upheaval and new initiatives? Parents might also have reservations about longer school days.\nRobert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, argues that education recovery has to remain a top priority - and the government needs to \"find the money from the back of the sofa\".\nThis has to be more than a patch-up effort, he argues.\n\"We need some radical thinking, some thinking out of the box, a proper long-term plan,\" he said.\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister is hugely grateful to Sir Kevan for his work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic.\n\"The government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning, with over \u00a33bn committed for catch-up so far.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic,Shirley-Anne Somerville",
      "text": "Scotland's new education secretary has made a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that no young person will be further disadvantaged by this year's assessments. \nShirley-Anne Somerville promised pupils \"If your teacher thinks you deserve an A, you will get an A\". \nShe said she still had full confidence in the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA).\nBut she said lessons had to be learned from the Covid experience. \nAsked by the BBC if she could give a cast-iron guarantee that the situation pupils faced last year - when grades were subject to an algorithm and were weighted by a school's past performance or postcode - would not happen again, she said: \"Absolutely\".\nShe said: \"This year a teacher's judgement is based on an individual's demonstrated attainment. So if your teacher thinks you deserve an A, you will get an A. \n\"The assessment process is judged by your teacher and they will submit the grade. No-one is coming in to overrule that or second guess it. Your teacher will decide your grade, if you don't agree you have direct right of free appeal. No-one is coming in to second guess them or their teacher.\"\nTwo weeks from the end of a second turbulent school year, teachers, pupils and parents remain wary of qualification arrangements. \nNo formal exams have taken place since 2019 and after a disastrous 2020 results day, all eyes are on the 2021 solution.\nThe replacement has again drawn criticism for its numerous assessments and an unpopular appeals process.\nLast week, Ms Somerville announced a reform of the SQA and Education Scotland, just hours after Nicola Sturgeon gave the SQA her full confidence.\n\"We do have full confidence in the SQA,\" she said. \"But we also know that we need to learn lessons from the experience of Covid and also with the report coming up from the OECD, we, as a government, need to be open to reform, open to challenge and to suggestions of how we should change.\n\"The qualifications the SQA are delivering this year for young people are sound and they are credible, but that doesn't mean we should stop and we can't and shouldn't look at change and that's what we are determined to deliver.\"\nJust one month into her new post, the new cabinet secretary said she had seen the anticipated international OECD report into the entire Scottish education system.\nAhead of its publication this month, she said the Scottish government was \"open to reform\".\n\"It is very important that we demonstrate a direction of travel for the government and demonstrate an openness for change,\" she said.\n\"We know this big report is coming, we know the OECD has looked at education in the round and if the OECD is recommending change to us I think its quite right that early on in my time as education secretary say I am open to that change, I am open to that challenge, so is the whole of the Scottish government.\n\"That gives people at least a little time before that OECD report is published to take part in that conversation, have a think about what they want - because I hear a lot of people saying we should scrap the SQA or make dramatic changes but what I don't often hear is a solution to what can be replacements or what people want to change.\"\nLooking ahead to the new school year in August, the education secretary said she would like to see schools return to normal, but that contingency arrangements were in place if schools needed to move to a different way of working. \nShe gave parents and pupils reassurance that plans had been made. \nHowever, she said decisions had not yet been taken over next year's exams.\nIt's certainly planting her flag firmly in the ground. \nGiven the outcry that there was last year and the criticism about how things have been working this year, Shirley-Anne Somerville obviously doesn't expect to be in the same position her predecessor John Swinney was in last year when he had to make that U-turn on results.\nShe mentioned the OECD report a few times, particularly when talking about her decision to reform  the SQA and Education Scotland, so that potentially hints that the report might include something about that.\nComing into the new role, Ms Somerville said she believed the government had a very good record on education and that she was seeing progress in closing the attainment gap, and that empowerment in schools was making a difference. But she admitted there was more to do.\nShe said: \"When you look at context of Covid and reports coming out, the OECD, we know we can do more.\n\"We know we still have work to do, and Covid accentuated the need even more.\"\nIn response, Oliver Mundell, the Scottish Conservatives education spokesman, said he wanted to see the government to go further than reform.\n\"Rather than reforming the SQA I think they should be talking about axing it, scrapping it and starting from the beginning again, asking what kind of qualifications body do we want in Scotland, not shifting existing people around, and tinkering around the edges. The SQA has let young people down,\" he said."

      "title": "G7 summit: Why does it matter?",
      "text": "Do summits like this matter? \"Occasionally!\" comes the answer from a former government insider who worked for years at the very top. \nThey warn that global get-togethers - however glamorous the location, however acute any particular political emergency, however good the freebies for the thousands of attendees - can descend into 'waffelage'. \nAs the most powerful elected people in the world prepare to occupy a tiny Cornish bay for a few days, will this be an occasion that makes a difference to any of our lives or will it be waffle in the end? \nA senior diplomat closely involved in the preparation is confident, \"this will be very meaningful.\"\nIt is the first time the new American president will have met the relatively new British prime minister in person - a big moment by any measure. \nAnd it's the first time that the leaders of the world's biggest democracies have gathered like this since their countries were hit by a genuine emergency - Covid. \nThis current cast of leaders, particularly with a new boss in the White House, has given the impression in the run up to this meeting that they want genuinely to work together as the pandemic, while still with us, begins to fade. \nThe next few days will show whether they really mean it or not.  \nEven in the age of video calls and instant messages pinging their way around the world, summits do matter, because leaders and their officials can talk face to face. \nReal business can get done during \"the hallway conversations, the drinks at the bar\", the diplomat says.  \nHuge public attention puts the pressure on, and the moment where they all wave goodbye and climb back into their limos or helicopters provides a deadline to decide.   \nWithout doubt, real life contact makes a difference to what is decided. \nOne former senior figure in Theresa May's administration recalls a moment of jeopardy at a summit with President Trump. \nHe was planning to leave early, without signing up to the form of words that the other nations wanted. \nThe former official told me he was ushered into what was described as a \"secure broom cupboard\" with the then Australian leader, Malcolm Turnbull and the French President, Emmanuel Macron. \nIt's said they remained locked in argument in the tiny room, until Mr Trump agreed. \nAt a different G7 meeting in 2018, again the other nations were struggling to get Mr Trump and his officials to agree on the principles the others wanted to publish. \nThe dispute was over if and how the final document would refer to the \"international rules based order\" - the loose jargon for how democracies agree to behave and work with each other through shared institutions like the UN. \nWithout a specific definition of what the \"rules based order\" really meant though, the US was reluctant.  \nSo a small group of leaders themselves and a few key officials haggled face-to-face with the president and his powerful adviser, John Bolton, outside the formal meetings to do a deal. \nThe compromise was that the document would refer to \"a\" rules based order, not \"the\" when referring to the \"international rules based order\". \nAt a summit, leaders of the free world, and a few of their close aides, spent precious time arguing over the use of the definite or indefinite article...\nAnd some of the broader tensions during that meeting were captured in a classic photograph.\nSummits are the product of months and months of work by the hosts, and are carefully planned to within an inch of their lives and are huge opportunities for countries to show off. \nCovering the meetings over the years I've witnessed astonishing firework displays in China, the Argentine first lady hosting an elaborate tea party for leaders' spouses where even the air kissing seemed to be choreographed, parades, concerts, and plenty of the events themselves that are designed to show the leaders' interactions to the world. \nSummits have their own language too - the 'family photos' - the moments where the leaders have to take pre-appointed places for official snaps to be taken. \nThe 'bilats' or 'trilats' - one-to-one, or one-to-two meetings where the bond, or lack of, between the politicians is so blindingly obvious. \nThe 'communique' - the final document that leaders sign up to that's published at the end; prepared for months in advance by the 'sherpas', senior officials for each country, but the final version agreed only by the leaders themselves at the last minute. \nBut when the most senior politicians in the world and their most senior staff are in essence locked down together for a few days it is those unscripted moments that stick in the mind. \nBumping into a European prime minister who was wandering around a corridor in Brussels, who seemed lost, but said yes to an interview then and there in the dingy basement, filmed on a phone - that made the news.\nOne very early morning in a hot, foreign clime when trying to get some sea air to wake up after only a couple of hours of sleep, I encountered a very prominent official on the beach who rather mysteriously had company at that time of day. \nOne of their colleagues, seconds later, came leaping out of the sea having been confronted by some jellyfish - ending the need for a longer, awkward conversation. \nWhen a tense European summit dragged on with David Cameron, while we hacks were still hanging around inside waiting for news, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel had had enough and popped out with her team for chips. \nAnd at the prime minister's own first summit in charge in Biarritz he went for his own swim off the French Atlantic coast. \nOf course, Boris Johnson being Boris Johnson, he didn't keep it to himself, but in classic style he used his swim out to a large rock as a metaphor for supporters for his hoped for heroics on Brexit.\nOne diplomat expressed concern at the notion of the leaders taking a dip this time round worrying about the all important 'optics'.  \nBut alongside the very serious hoped for progress on vaccines, on Covid recovery, on the climate, on reaffirming the links between the most powerful democracies in the world after the Trump Presidency, the events that have not been planned might be the ones that stay in the mind. \nThe next few days will also see the first official public engagements of the new Mrs Carrie Johnson. \nLike it or not, always nicknamed the \"leaders' wives\" summit, the \"spousal programme\" as it's officially termed is a universe all of its own. \nThis time, without question, this G7 should be an occasion that matters, for the serious discussions that are due to take place. \nThe government hopes for strong confirmation of the relationship between the UK and the US, commitments to help get vaccines to the developing world, and for progress on climate change. \nThey plan also for convincing conversations with the other nations that have been invited, what the prime minister is terming the \"football team\" - the \"D 11\" - the G7 plus India (attending virtually), South Korea, South Africa and Australia too, forging links ever more important among democracies in the face of growing influence from China. \nBut this summit will also matter for the glimpses of our leaders, and snapshots of the vital relationships they forge.

      "text": "The majority of new coronavirus cases in the UK are the so-called Indian variant - named the Delta variant by the World Health Organization.\nThis version - or mutation - was first spotted in India last October.\nViruses mutate all the time. Most variants are insignificant, but some can make a virus more contagious. \nUK scientists say the Delta variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is spreading more quickly than the Kent or Alpha variant, which was behind a surge in cases over the winter.\nThere have been almost 18,000 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant in England, just under 3,000 in Scotland, 189 in Wales and 37 in Northern Ireland. \nThe latest Public Health England figures up to 2 June showed the worst-hit areas were:\nHowever, just because it's the most common strain doesn't always mean there's lots of it about. \nIn West Lancashire and East Hertfordshire, for example, in the two weeks to 29 May the variant accounted for 100% of the cases analysed for variants. But this amounted to only nine individual infections each.\nNot all cases are analysed and a higher proportion are in areas with lots of the Delta variant, potentially skewing the figures. \nBut random swabbing carried out by the Office for National Statistics, which is not skewed in this way, also found a growing proportion of cases looked like they were the Delta variant. \nIt does appear to spread more easily than the Kent variant (B.1.1.7). \nTransmission rates for the Indian strain have been put at anywhere between 30 and 100% higher than for the Kent or Alpha variant. \nRoughly 12% of contacts of people with the Indian variant went on to develop coronavirus, compared with 8% of those who had the so-called Kent variant, according to Public Health England analysis - suggesting it is roughly 50% more transmissible. \nBut some of that could be the behaviour of humans, rather than the virus itself. \nWhen a variant spreads faster than others, it could be driven by the strain being more infectious, by differences in how close people get, or by different vaccination rates. \nFor instance, it's been pointed out some of the worst-affected areas have very low proportions of residents working from home.\nDespite fears over the Indian variant, most of the UK went ahead with easing restrictions on 17 May.\nHowever, the government has issued new guidance for people in eight areas of England with high numbers of cases\nPeople have been advised to minimise travelling in and out of Kirklees, Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside.\nIn addition, residents have been advised - wherever possible - to meet people outside, maintain social distancing of 2m (6ft) from people not in their household and work from home if they can. \nIt is not clear whether the next stage of easing in England will happen on 21 June, as was set out in the government's roadmap. \nThe prime minister and health secretary have indicated they will wait for another week's data before making a decision.\nMany countries already have bans on people from the UK and elsewhere entering. \nFrance has brought a ban on non-essential travel from the UK back into force in direct response to the spread of the India variant.

      "text": "Joe Biden has said he will not allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a \"casualty of Brexit\" if he is elected US President in November.\nThe Democratic candidate said any UK-US trade deal had to be \"contingent\" on respect for the Good Friday Agreement.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has been trying to reassure US politicians about the latest Brexit developments during a trip to Washington.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he trusted the UK to \"get this right\".\nBut US Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there was \"no chance\" of a UK-US trade deal getting through the US Congress if the UK violated international agreements, undermining the Good Friday Agreement.\nAfter a meeting with Mr Raab, the Speaker of the House of Representatives said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to \"imperil\" peace in Northern Ireland.\nShe said the lower house of Congress, which is currently controlled by her party, would defend the 1998 Good Friday Agreement as a \"beacon of hope for peace-loving people throughout the whole world\".\nAnd Mr Biden, who is going up against US President Donald Trump in November's election, tweeted.\nBrexit is high on the agenda at the Washington meetings, after the Internal Market Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle earlier this week. \nThe proposed law would give the UK government the power to override part of the Brexit withdrawal deal - which Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed with the EU last October.\nIt now faces further scrutiny in the House of Commons, and also needs to be passed by the House of Lords.\nIf the law comes into force, it would breach international law - a prospect that prompted an angry response from senior figures in the US last week. \nBy BBC Northern Ireland Dublin Correspondent Shane Harrison\nJoe Biden is a proud Irish American with roots in counties Louth and Londonderry on his mother's side.\nHe takes a keen interest in Irish affairs and frequently peppers his speeches with quotes from Irish poets.\nWhen he was Barack Obama's Vice President he hosted successive Irish prime ministers during the St Patrick's day festivities and has been known to holiday and play golf in Ireland with some of the republic's leaders.\nSo his comments about the Good Friday Agreement should come as no surprise.\nIndeed they largely echo concerns expressed by senior Democrat politicians in Congress to British ministers about the impact Brexit may have on the peace process.\nThe only difference is Joe Biden may soon be elected President of the United States - still the most powerful country in the world.\nOn Tuesday, four senior congressmen also issued a similar warning, saying a UK-US trade deal would be blocked if the UK failed to preserve the gains of the Good Friday Agreement.\nThe letter was signed by Democratic congressmen Eliot Engel, Richard Neal, and Bill Keating, who all chair committees in the US House of Representatives, as well as Republican Congressman Peter King. \nHowever, asked about the bill at a joint UK-US press conference Mr Pompeo said: \"We trust the UK, we know the complexities of the situation, I have great confidence they will get this right.\"\nMr Raab said \"the threat to the Good Friday Agreement comes from the EU's politicisation of the issue\".\nHe defended the bill as \"precautionary and proportionate\" adding \"what we can't have is the EU seeking to erect a border down the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Britain\". \nAsked earlier about the letter from US politicians, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"I think when they understand what we are trying to do they will share our ambition and concern which is to protect the peace process.\"\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, said the \"rhetoric coming from Washington is growing increasingly ridiculous\".\nHe said if a post-Brexit trade deal were allowed to lead to new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, this would \"drive a coach and horses\" through the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement. \n\"Do unionist voices not matter in [Washington ] DC, or is it just about the Irish-American vote rather than peace in Belfast?,\" he added. \nBy BBC Northern Ireland political reporter Jayne McCormack\nThis is not the first time that Brexit and the peace accord's paths have crossed.\nDuring negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, some claimed a hard border between NI and the Republic of Ireland would breach the Good Friday Agreement. \nBut critics of that argument point out that the text does not contain an explicit commitment never to harden the border, and there is nothing about customs posts or regulatory controls.\nThe only place in which it alludes to infrastructure at the border is in the section on security, which cites \"the removal of security installations\".\nUnionists say the real breach of the deal is the NI Protocol, which instead places an economic border in the Irish Sea. \nThey claim it breaks the Good Friday Agreement, as it does not have the consent of both communities.\nWhat this latest argument is really about is whether the government's new Brexit plans for Northern Ireland breach the \"spirit\" of the peace deal.\nThat in itself is open to interpretation - but is widely understood to be a spirit of non-violence, consent and partnership.\nThat's what has prompted the intervention from several prominent US politicians, and debate over this is likely to deepen as Brexit talks move towards a conclusion.\nIn his talks on Wednesday, Mr Raab argued that the government's plans are precautionary and proportionate - and in response to what ministers describe as threats from the EU to block food imports. \nMr Raab also met Mr Pompeo, amid continuing transatlantic tensions over Iran. \nThe US secretary of state recently accused the UK and its European allies of \"siding with the Ayatollahs\" for blocking further United Nations sanctions on Iran."

Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased.

The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "The EU has warned the UK not to take any further unilateral action to delay post-Brexit checks on products entering Northern Ireland from Britain.\nThe warning came from the European Commission's vice president.\nMaros Sefcovic said the EU \"will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations\".\nIt comes as the two sides prepare to meet to assess possible simplifications of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that created a trade border in the Irish Sea, in order to prevent goods checks along the Irish land border.\nThe 2019 deal kept Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are now enforced at its ports.\nIt was agreed that the checks would be phased in through the use of so-called \"grace periods\".\nBut earlier this year the UK unilaterally extended and enhanced some of these grace periods.\nThe EU started legal action as a result.\nThe next phase of new controls, affecting chilled meat products like sausages and mince, are due to begin next month after the grace period overseeing them ends.\nBy 1 July, the products will be prohibited from moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, or the grace period will be extended either by agreement or unilaterally by the UK. \nIn an article for the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Mr Sefcovic writes: 'If the UK takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations.\"\nThe sausage and the chicken nugget have long enjoyed the right to roam around the UK; their legal passage from Great Britain to Northern Ireland assured. \nBut this is due to end in a little over three weeks. \nThe Brexit deal included an agreement that some products would be checked within the UK - when moved from Britain to Northern Ireland - as an alternative to a hard border with the Republic. \nAnd the movement of some goods, including chilled meats, would be banned, albeit after a grace period - that expires at the end of this month. \nThe government regards the prospect of blocking the free movement of the sausage within the UK as ridiculous and has claimed the European Union is acting with what it called \"legal purism\". \nThe EU is threatening to act \"swiftly, firmly and resolutely\" to ensure the UK abides by its \"obligations under international law\" as Brussels sees them. \nThe British government agreed to the protocol in late 2019 but there have been some problems since it came into operation in January this year, and the UK is now seeking changes. \nGeorge Eustice, the UK's Agriculture Minister, described the chilled meats issue as \"bonkers\" on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday.\nOn Monday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost admitted the UK had \"underestimated\" the effect of the protocol on goods movements to Northern Ireland. \nIn an article in the Financial Times, he accused the EU of \"legal purism\" and called for \"pragmatic solutions between friends, not the imposition of one side's rules on the other\". \nHowever, in his Daily Telegraph article on Tuesday, Mr Sefcovic denied that the EU had been intransigent over the protocol.\n\"Far from being inflexible, the EU has shown from the very beginning that we are willing to find creative solutions when required,\" the European Commission vice president wrote.\n\"The continued availability of medicines to Northern Ireland is among those tailor-made flexible solutions - something I personally take very seriously in this time of pandemic.\"\nMr Sefcovic added that the EU team was \"working hard to find ways to ensure that the protocol is implemented in a way that both facilitates the everyday life of Northern Ireland's communities and preserves the integrity of the EU's Single Market\".\nHe stressed the need for UK-EU cooperation to implement the existing 2019 deal, saying \"we should not waste time turning the tables and washing our hands of an agreement that we shaped, agreed and signed jointly\".\nThe EU-UK Joint Committee is due to meet in London on Wednesday to review progress on technical talks that have been examining ways to simplify the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nOfficials have been holding intensive talks, but there is little expectation of a major breakthrough at the meeting.\nIt is understood UK officials believe there has been significant progress in only two of about 30 problem areas and each side has accused the other of a lack of real engagement\nHowever, the EU is preparing to offer a number of concessions, that would include: \nBut an EU official said the EU's patience with the UK was \"wearing thin\" and warned that there could be trade sanctions if there is no breakthrough on implementing the protocol by next month. \nAhead of Wednesday's meeting, Northern Ireland business groups urged the UK and EU to find \"immediate solutions\" to Irish Sea border trading problems.\n\"We cannot afford another missed opportunity at the joint committee,\" said the Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group - a coalition of organisations and companies.\n\"We continue to hear that the EU and UK are committed to their assertion in the preamble to the protocol that they are 'determined that the application of this protocol should impact as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland'.\n\"But it undoubtedly is having an impact and will increasingly do so as more stringent requirements come in from October.\"\nIt added: \"We are heartened by the increased level of engagement that we have had in the past few weeks and months, however, we need to see that our faith in this process is justified by the delivery of solutions.\"\nThe working group added that there will be opportunities under the protocol, given the access it gives to both the UK and EU markets, but trade frictions need to be removed for the economy as a whole.\nMeanwhile, the Northern Ireland trade union representative body, NIC ICTU, said \"a space has to be created that acknowledges the practical problems with the protocol while also respecting the integrity of EU single market\".\nIt added that it is \"not acceptable or credible that those who demanded a hard Brexit now say the 'protocol must go!' This simplistic rhetoric misleads and abuses the electorate and encourages division.\"\nBut it said: \"The concerns of many within the unionist community around the practical issues with the protocol need to be respected, considered and addressed.\""
