      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),South Africa,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "South Africa has complained it is being punished - instead of applauded - for discovering Omicron, a concerning new variant of Covid-19.\nThe foreign ministry made the statement as countries around the world restricted travel from southern Africa as details of the spread emerged.\nEarly evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday that the new variant was \"of concern\".\nSeveral cases have now been identified in Europe - two in the UK, two in Germany, one in Belgium and another one in Italy, while a suspected case was found in the Czech Republic. \nIsrael, where the new variant has been confirmed, has decided to ban all foreigners from entering the country from midnight Sunday.\nThe measure will last for 14 days, according to the Times of Israel.\nOmicron cases have also been detected in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel. \nHundreds of passengers arriving in the Netherlands from South Africa are being tested for the new variant.\nSome 61 people on two KLM flights were positive for Covid-19 and have been quarantined at a hotel near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport while they have further tests, Dutch officials said.\nThe Netherlands is currently struggling with a record-breaking surge in cases. An extended partial lockdown comes into force there on Sunday evening.\nThe new Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November.\nA statement by the South African foreign ministry on Saturday strongly criticised the travel bans.\n\"Excellent science should be applauded and not punished,\" it said.\nThe bans were \"akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker\".\nThe statement added that the reaction had been completely different when new variants were discovered elsewhere in the world.\nAn African Union official told the BBC developed countries were to blame for the emergence of the variant.\n\"What is going on right now is inevitable, it's a result of the world's failure to vaccinate in an equitable, urgent and speedy manner. It is as a result of hoarding [of vaccines] by high-income countries of the world, and quite frankly it is unacceptable,\" said AU vaccine delivery alliance co-chair Ayoade Alakija.\n\"These travel bans are based in politics, and not in science. It is wrong... Why are we locking away Africa when this virus is already on three continents?\" \nOn Friday and Saturday, a number of countries announced new measures:\nThe WHO said the number of cases\u00a0of this variant, initially named B.1.1.529, appeared to\u00a0be increasing\u00a0in almost all of South Africa's provinces.\u00a0\n\"This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning,\" the UN public health body said in a statement on Friday.\nIt said \"the first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November\". \nThe WHO said it would take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as scientists worked to determine how transmissible it was.\nA top UK health official warned that vaccines would \"almost certainly\" be less effective against the new variant.\nBut Professor James Naismith, a structural biologist from the University of Oxford, added: \"It is bad news but it's not doomsday.\"\nThe head of the South African Medical Association\u00a0told the BBC that the cases found so far in South Africa - where only about 24% of the population is fully vaccinated - were not severe,\u00a0but said investigations into the variant were still at a very early stage. \n\"The patients are mostly complaining about a sore body and tiredness, extreme tiredness and we see it in the younger generation, it's not the older people... We're not talking about patients that might go straight to a hospital and be admitted,\" Dr Angelique Coetzee said.\u00a0\nUS infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said that while the reports on the new variant threw up a \"red flag\", it was possible that vaccines might still work to prevent serious illness.\nThe WHO has warned against countries hastily imposing travel restrictions, saying they should look to a \"risk-based and scientific approach\"."

      "text": "Continuing Tube strikes will disrupt plans to partially reopen the Night Tube this weekend. \nAbout 160,000 people have signed a petition calling for its return in the wake of Sarah Everard's murder.\nThe service was due to resume on Saturday night but staff have walked out in a dispute over driver rotas.\nA union says changes to rotas will ruin members' work-life balance but transport bosses called the strike \"unnecessary action\".\nCustomers are advised to check before they travel and use buses to complete their journeys where required. \nThe Tube strike started across six services on Friday, when Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union staff began demonstrating at 04:30 GMT. \nTwo of these, Central and Victoria, were set to reopen their Night Tube services this weekend.\nIt is the first strike on more than one Tube line since 2018, with the other four affected lines being Piccadilly, Northern, Waterloo & City and Jubilee. \nFurther disruptions for all six lines are expected over the next three weekends on 3-5 December, 10-12 December and 17-18 December. \nTonight's much lauded and hyped relaunch of the night tube is meant to another step in London's rebuilding. \nIt's particularly important to the night time economy and the West End in particular. \nSo a half-cocked launch with a reduced service is pretty embarrassing both for London Underground and the Mayor. \nUltimately they couldn't get the RMT Union on board with the new conditions and went ahead anyway. \nBusinesses will hope a resolution is quick and this doesn't hang over the whole a Christmas period. \nA petition to reinstate the Night Tube was started by Ella Watson, who is continuing her campaign to re-open the service in full.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, responded to the petition, thanking Ms Watson for highlighting the issue of women's safety.\nHe agreed the Night Tube has \"a clear role to play in helping women feel safer in our city\", particularly after a string of \"shocking murders\", including Nicole Smallman, Bibaa Henry, Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa.\nAndy Lord, London Underground's managing director, said TfL had invested in additional British Transport Police officers, both in plain clothes and in uniform to assist customers and staff on the Night Tube.\nHe said: \"I am very sorry for the inconvenience that this strike action is causing. \n\"We understand that our customers will be frustrated by the RMT's strike action, which is timed to cause maximum disruption to London. \n\"This action is the last thing London needs as it recovers from the pandemic, which is why we have done everything we can to get this action called off.\"\nOn Friday, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said strikes were happening because TfL had \"ripped up\" an agreement on Night Tube driving by changing rosters.\nHe said: \"The Tube strike action is rock solid in all depots and the widespread impact on services is solely down to management failure to recognise and address the anger of their staff at the imposition of damaging and unacceptable working practices.\n\"This action was wholly avoidable if LU bosses hadn't attempted to bulldoze through arrangements that abolished the Night Tube driver grade, lumping everyone into a central pool where they can be shunted about at will in a drive to cut costs.\""

We are taking the action on international travel on a precautionary basis, while we await further evidence on the spread of this variant in South Africa and understand more about it.\n\"The need for further measures will be kept under constant review and we will continue to liaise closely with public health colleagues in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.\n \"It is not possible at this stage to accurately assess the potential for this new variant to impact on vaccine effectiveness.\n\"This should in no way dissuade people from coming forward for their first and second doses and boosters.\n\"The Delta variant is currently dominant in Northern Ireland and the threat it poses to our citizens is very real.\nIn the Republic of Ireland the public are also being advised not to travel to southern Africa due to concerns over the new Omicron variant. \nThe Irish Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, said residents of Ireland who are currently in southern Africa should return as soon as possible and follow public health protection measures upon arrival."

We are entirely prepared for an escalation.\"\nA large part of the Russian force is in Crimea, the peninsula which Russia annexed from Ukraine in March 2014.

My actions confirm this,\" he added in a statement published in Ukrainian media.\nThe Ukrainian leader did not directly accuse the Russian government over the alleged plan, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded almost immediately by saying Russia \"never does such things at all\"."

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation.

This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment.

      "title": "Omicron: How worried should we be?",
      "tags": "Public health,South Africa,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "We're back in familiar territory - growing concern about a new variant of coronavirus.  \nIt has been named Omicron by the World Health Organization, following the pattern of Greek code-names like the Alpha and Delta variants.\nOmicron has such a long list of mutations that it was described by one scientist as \"horrific\", while another told me it was the worst variant they'd seen. \nIt has now been detected in more than 30 countries and there are signs it may be able to bypass some of our immunity. \nBut there are also claims that it could be milder than earlier versions of Covid, such as Delta.\nThere is a lot of speculation. Here's what we know. \nOmicron is the most heavily mutated version of coronavirus found so far. \nProf Tulio de Oliveira, the director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation in South Africa, said there was an \"unusual constellation of mutations\" and that it was \"very different\" to other variants that have circulated. \n\"This variant did surprise us, it has a big jump on evolution [and] many more mutations that we expected,\" he said.\nHe said there 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of most vaccines and the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. \nZooming in even further to the receptor binding domain (that's the part of the virus that makes first contact with our body's cells), it has 10 mutations compared to just two for the Delta variant that swept the world. \nIt is not certain where Omicron came from, but it is thought it evolved in a single patient who was unable to beat the virus.\nA lot of mutation doesn't automatically mean: bad. It is important to know what those mutations are actually doing.\nThe vaccines have all been based on the original form of the virus that was first detected in Wuhan, in China. The concern is Omicron is now so different to the original that vaccines may not be as effective. \nSome of the mutations have been seen before in other variants, which gives some insight into their likely role in this variant. \nFor example N501Y seems to make it easier for a coronavirus to spread. There are some in there that make it harder for antibodies to recognise the virus and might make vaccines less effective, but there are others that are completely new. \nThere have been many examples of variants that have seemed scary on paper, but came to nothing. The Beta variant was at the top of people's concerns at the beginning of the year because it was the best at escaping the immune system. But in the end it was the faster-spreading Delta that took over the world. \nScientists in South Africa have reported early evidence that Omicron can evade some of our immunity. \nThey have detected a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times, which had not been seen with previous variants. However, the scientists stressed they did not know what this meant for vaccines. \nLaboratory experiments are underway to see how effective the antibodies in people's blood are at stopping the new variant. \nProf Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, said: \"Beta was all immune escape and nothing else, Delta had infectivity and modest immune escape, this potentially has both to high degrees.\"\nThe Omicron variant is being blamed for a surge in cases in South Africa. In mid-November there were around 250 cases recorded every day. This has now topped 8,000 daily cases in a country that has already seen large waves of other variants. \nExperts have warned the same could happen around the world, including in the UK. \n\"The early signs are it will probably spread quite quickly and probably start outcompeting Delta, and become the dominant variant probably within the next weeks,\" said Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia.\nThe jury is still out on the severity of an Omicron infection. \nAnecdotal accounts from South Africa have argued symptoms tend to be mild and data on just 40 patients in one hospital hinted that fewer were becoming severely ill. However, it will take weeks to know for sure as there is a long delay between catching the virus and becoming seriously ill. South Africa also has a relatively young population and younger people tend to have milder Covid.\nAnd any difference in severity could have more to do with the amount of immunity in the country than anything the virus is inherently doing differently. \nSo, for now, we are left with a variant that raises significant concerns despite huge holes in our knowledge. It is one that needs to be watched closely and asks deep questions about what to do and when. The lesson of the pandemic is you can't always wait until you have all the answers. \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "Secondary schools in England have been asked to prepare to test pupils on-site after Christmas.\nOn Friday, the Department for Education told schools that testing pupils upon their return in January \"will help reduce transmission after a period of social mixing\" during the holidays.\nThe Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said the DfE's plans were \"not reasonable\".\nJulie McCulloch, director of policy at ASCL, criticised the \"short timeframe\".\nIn light of the new Covid variant, Omicron, the DfE sent an email to secondary schools in England on Friday. In its email, the department urged secondary schools to be prepared to test pupils when they return in January. \nIt recognised that the request was \"a significant additional ask\". However, it stressed that \"testing continues to play a vital role in keeping Covid-19 out of schools\".\nThe DfE added: \"Testing all pupils in school boosts testing participation and will help reduce transmission after a period of social mixing over the school holidays.\n\"Tests, PPE and funding to support your workforce will be provided as before. After this test on return, pupils should continue to test in line with Government guidelines.\"\nThroughout the Covid pandemic, schools have faced several disruptions and have been at the heart of lockdown measures, because they provide the potential for prolonged close-up interactions between people from many different households.\nSpeaking on behalf of the ASLC, Ms McCulloch said that the education sector recognises the importance of Covid-19 testing as a mechanism to reduce the levels of transmission. However, she says that \"it is not reasonable for the government to once again impose this considerable public health task on schools with minimal support\". \nShe added that the government \"seems to have forgotten that school leaders are educators rather than an ad hoc branch of the NHS\".\nMs McCulloch said that the main goal for teachers at the moment is to provide the teaching and learning required by their pupils, which is \"particularly important\" following the disruptions experienced due to the pandemic. \nThe government said that introducing on-site testing is part of their commitment to protect face-to-face education and they are asking secondary school pupils to take one test at school when they return in January.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Saturday morning. We'll have another update for you tomorrow. \nCountries around the world are racing to introduce travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the new Omicron variant. Omicron has many mutations and early evidence suggested an increased reinfection risk, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. Hundreds of passengers arriving in Amsterdam from South Africa were tested for the new variant. Some 61 people on two KLM flights tested positive for Covid and have been quarantined at a hotel near the airport while they have further tests, Dutch officials said. Omicron was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on Wednesday, and has also been identified in Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel. Travellers from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini will not be able to enter the UK unless they are UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents. You can read more about Omicron here.\nEngland's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has said his \"greatest worry\" is whether people will accept fresh curbs on activities to tackle new Covid variants. Prof Whitty questioned whether \"we could take people with us\" if restrictions had to be imposed. He said: \"Obviously, we want to avoid having to do those at all if we can, and to do the minimum ones necessary, but will we be able to maintain public support? My overall view is, I think we will.\"\nThe US will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other southern African countries to try to contain the spread of Omicron. From Monday, only US citizens and residents will be allowed to travel from the region. This follows a similar flight ban imposed by the EU and the UK. US officials said flights from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi will be blocked. South African Health Minister Joe Phaahla, meanwhile, said nations imposing travel bans were trying to find \"scapegoats\".\nSecondary schools in England have been asked to prepare to test pupils on-site after Christmas. On Friday, the Department for Education told schools that testing pupils upon their return in January \"will help reduce transmission after a period of social mixing\" during the holidays. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said the DfE's plans were \"not reasonable\" and criticised the \"short timeframe\". The DfE recognised that the request was \"a significant additional ask\". However, it stressed that \"testing continues to play a vital role in keeping Covid-19 out of schools\".\nWith just under two-thirds of the population fully vaccinated, the Swiss have one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe. Now, Covid case numbers are rising by 40% to 50% each week. So is Health Minister Alain Berset planning new restrictions, like neighbouring Germany, or even making vaccination mandatory, like Austria? Not a bit of it. In fact, on Sunday, Switzerland votes on getting rid of some Covid restrictions altogether. Once today's votes are counted, the health minister will return to the grim business of counting the rising Covid cases.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWondering how the UK's reaction to the new variant affects travel rules?

      "tags": "Chris Whitty,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty has said his \"greatest worry\" is whether people will accept fresh curbs on activities to tackle Covid variants.\nHis comments came after the government announced quarantines on travellers from some African countries following the emergence of a new strain.\nProf Whitty said he questioned whether \"we could take people with us\" if restrictions had to be imposed.\nBut he added that \"my overall view is, I think we will\".\nEngland has been through three national lockdowns since Covid first struck. There have also been many local restrictions imposed at various points during the past 20 months.\nProf Whitty told a panel discussion hosted by the Local Government Association: \"My greatest worry at the moment is that people... if we need to do something more muscular at some point, whether it's for the current new variant or at some later stage, can we still take people with us?\"\nHe admitted that some of the changes the public has had to make have been \"very destructive\" to society and the economy. However, despite his worries, Prof Whitty struck a positive note, saying he believed the government will be able to maintain public support for coronavirus measures.\n\"I think the extraordinary thing has been the ability of the UK population, with very, very small exceptions, to just accept that there are things we collectively have to do to protect one another and do collectively, including things that have been very destructive to social and economic situations for individuals and families,\" he said.\n\"Obviously, we want to avoid having to do those at all if we can, and to do the minimum ones necessary, but will we be able to maintain public support? \n\"And I think my overall view is, I think we will.\"\nThere have been a further 50,091 Covid cases in the UK and another 160 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the latest government figures show. \nBoth deaths and the number of people admitted to hospital continue to trend lower despite the rise in cases. It is likely we're seeing the impact of the booster campaign protecting the most vulnerable people and keeping them out of hospital.\nOn Friday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the House of Commons it was \"highly likely\" the B.1.1.529 variant - which has been named Omicron by the World Health Organization - had already spread from South Africa and Botswana. No cases have yet been detected in the UK.\nTravellers from these countries, as well as Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini, will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with those arriving in England after 04:00 GMT on Sunday having to quarantine in a hotel.\nFormer Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"The government are right to be cautious and they've moved very swiftly to bring these travel restrictions in, and that's the right thing to do, especially as there's so much uncertainty about this new variant.\"\nHe added: \"I hope very much that we can avoid further restrictions here, not least because of the breadth of the vaccination programme.\"\nBut there are fears the new variant might be more transmissible, that vaccines might be less effective against it and that it might affect one of the UK's major treatments, Ronapreve.\nBelgium has become the first European country to confirm a case of the new variant. The European Union is already struggling to cope with fresh waves of coronavirus, and several countries have re-imposed lockdowns and restrictions.\nSince Thursday a number of countries have placed restrictions on travel from southern Africa amid concerns about the variant.\nThe EU has agreed to ban flights from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, following a call to do so from the European Commission on Friday.\nThe US has also banned visitors from those countries, and from Malawi."

Officials said the cases were linked and connected to travel in southern Africa.\nThe new variant was first reported from South Africa on Wednesday, with early evidence suggesting it has a higher reinfection risk.\nMr Johnson said: \"Our scientists are learning more hour by hour, and it does appear that Omicron spreads very rapidly and can be spread between people who are double vaccinated.\"\nHe added: \"We need to slow down the spread of this variant here in the UK, because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new variant rather than stop it all together.\"\nThe prime minister said the new measures would be reviewed in three weeks, by which time they should have better information about the \"continuing effectiveness\" of vaccines.\nThe prime minister said the \"tightening up\" of the mask rules will be outlined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid \"in the next day or so\". He did not indicate when PCR tests would begin and in a press release the Department of Health only said it was among the measures being \"introduced from next week\".\nCovid restrictions were tightened across the UK days before Christmas last year amid a surge in cases.\nAsked by the BBC's Iain Watson if the prime minister could say with any confidence whether or not people could keep their Christmas plans this year, Mr Johnson replied: \"We continue to be in a strong position largely thanks to the speed of the vaccine rollout, another booster rollout, and... I'm pretty confident to absolutely confident this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas.\" \nCountries around the world are introducing travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread.\nUnder the plans: \nThe UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said there was a \"reasonable chance\" that vaccines could be less effective against the new variant but stressed people who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill.\nHe said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation would now need to decide whether to extend the booster vaccine down to adults age 18, and whether a second dose should be offered to children aged 12-15.\nThe reintroduction of masks in shops and public transport brings England back into line with the other UK nations.\nPaddy Lillis from the shopworkers' union Usdaw accused ministers of \"flip-flopping on basic and sensible Covid measures\" and said the face covering rules should have been kept in place when restrictions were relaxed in July.\n\"Retail staff working with the public every day are deeply worried about catching Covid-19 and the arrival of the Omicron variant is a further concern,\" he said.\nCarol Popplestone, chairwoman of the Royal College of Nursing, said face coverings were \"something we have already called for and it should not have been a new variant that forced the prime minister to act\".\nThis is a moment the government had wanted to avoid. \nWe've got used to restrictions in England being lifted. But for the first time in months, they're now being re-imposed in response to the new variant. \nAnd these restrictions could have a significant impact.\nFor example, anyone who goes on holiday will now need to pay for a PCR test and self-isolate until they get a negative result. If Omicron spreads quickly, there could be a lot of people forced to self-isolate for 10 days as close contacts.\nBut the government hasn't gone for its full plan B. Masks won't be mandatory in hospitality settings in England like they are in Scotland and Wales. \nPeople aren't being told to work from home - and there still aren't plans for vaccine passports. \nBut it's a sign of the uncertainty and concern in Whitehall that Boris Johnson felt he had to announce these measures. \nBoth the UK cases of the Omicron variant and their households are self-isolating.  Additional testing is being carried out at locations where those people were likely to have been infectious.\n\"Confirmed cases and contacts are being followed up and requested to isolate and get tested as necessary,\" the Department of Health said.\nTen countries - South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia - are now on the UK's travel red list meaning, from Sunday at 04:00 GMT, all arrivals will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days.\nOther countries are also introducing travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread.\nThe average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. A further 39,567 confirmed cases were announced on Saturday.\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "Many pupils who have run up meal debts of more than \u00a31,800 at a school have the capacity to pay but have not done so, its head teacher has said.\nNeil Foden, of Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle, in Penygroes, Gwynedd, said he had spoken to parents who \"admit openly that they simply forget to top up their children's accounts\".\nIt comes as Canadian children are among those fundraising to erase the debts.\nBut Mr Foden said it was possible donors \"misunderstood\" the situation.\nGwynedd council and the school are set to discuss how to respond to the donations, but Mr Foden suggested anyone wishing to donate immediately to give to a food bank instead.\nA letter to parents at the secondary school had said pupils would not be allowed school meals if they are more than a penny in debt.\nGwynedd council has since apologised for concern caused by the letter and school governors have announced a review of its payment system.\nMr Foden, the Gwynedd school's strategic head teacher, said: \"Unfortunately, we believe that many of those in arrears do have the capacity to pay but have not done so.\"\nCoverage of the school's letter prompted three Canadian children, Merlin, Kit and Noah, more than 2,500 miles (4,023km) away from the school, to fundraise to help pay off the meal debts.\nEleven-year-old Merlin, whose great-grandmother was Welsh, said he and his brothers felt sad for the children.\nTogether with former Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle student Tamara Owen's fundraiser, they have raised more than \u00a3600.\nMerlin, who lives in Novia Scotia in Halifax with his two brothers and family, said the pupils' debts reminded him of Tiny Tim and Ebenezer Scrooge, from Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.\nHe wrote that it was \"super unfair\" for children to go without over the debts, in their fundraiser page.\n\"It made me think about all those kids who aren't going to get lunches and are going to be hungry in school and not have the energy to do anything,\" he said.\n\"Families aren't going to have enough money to pay for the lunches, so I thought if we did a fundraiser... people would be able to have the money and still be happy.\"\nMerlin said his message to pupils at the school was that they \"don't need to feel guilty and can still be happy\" because doing this fundraising was \"for them\".\n\"If you don't have lunch at school you're going to feel really tired. With math like science, you're not going to be able to really think.\"\n\"We like to think of ourselves as a little bit Welsh, a little bit British and a little bit from Bangladesh,\" his mother Natalie said.\nTheir great-great-grandfather Joseph Martin was born in Rhyl in 1879 and died in World War One.\nHis daughter and Merlin's great-grandmother Ethel Martin, who was born in 1906, \"always said she was from Wales\", Natalie added.\nMerlin added that having Welsh ancestry made him happy and his trips to Wales when he was younger were fun.\n\"I find that having more ancestors means I have more culture and I can learn more about Welsh people,\" he said.\nFormer Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle student Tamara Owen said she was contacted by the Canadian family after commenting on a Marcus Rashford tweet about the story.\nThe Manchester United footballer and anti-poverty campaigner has tweeted twice in response to articles on the school's letter to parents.\nThe 21-year-old student, from Llanllyfni near Penygroes, set up a fundraiser because she felt there \"wasn't much being done\" to get rid of the children's school meal debts.\nBut she was surprised that the Canadian family had done the same.\n\"It's really heart-warming to think that someone that far away has taken an interest and really wanted to help our school,\" she said.\n\"I was absolutely taken aback, even to think that people from that far away knew where the area was.\n\"It's a tiny, tiny community, it's a small village and we all kind of know each other. \n\"So for someone that far away to do as much as they've done... it's really nice,\" she said.\nMs Owen, who is currently in her third year studying at Manchester Metropolitan University, said the reception to their fundraising efforts had been \"overwhelming\" with \"so much kindness\".\nResponding to the donation offers, Mr Foden said it was possible that \"generous individuals have misunderstood how the school arrived in that situation\".\nHe said the school had received \"considerable correspondence\" following coverage of the letter to parents, with \"some of these being abusive and in a small number of cases threatening\", alongside many donation offers.\n\"Pupils entitled to free school meals have their accounts topped up daily and have no reason to run up arrears,\" he said.\n\"Thus, the most disadvantaged should still be being fed on a daily basis.\n\"Those just above the threshold for free school meals but who are still encountering, possibly short-term, difficulties can access vouchers from the school for the local foodbank or could discuss with the school a phased programme to reduce the arrears.\"\nHe added that charitable donations \"may not reach the most disadvantaged\", but may simply \"write off the debts of some of those who are actually able to pay\". \nMr Foden said that the school would discuss with the education authority how to resolve the issue and how to respond to the donation offers.\nHowever, he added that anyone wishing to make an immediate donation \"may wish to consider the food bank covering the Dyffryn Nantlle area\".\nGwynedd council said it was \"aware of the generous offers that have been made\" and will discuss with the school about \"the best way to respond\"."

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Construction industry,Grenfell Tower Inquiry,UK fire safety",
      "text": "A fire safety expert is demanding ministers reveal whether \"highly dangerous\" cladding, secretly tested in the early 2000s, was the product used at Grenfell Tower. \nIn September, the BBC uncovered details of cladding products that failed safety tests some 13 years before the blaze. \nDr Jonathan Evans believes among these was the aluminium and plastic cladding that spread the 2017 London fire. \nThe government says a planned new law will improve building safety.  \nIndustry expert Dr Evans, a member of the British Standard 8414 committee set up to review the standards of testing, has written to Housing Secretary Michael Gove, demanding confirmation of his conclusions.\n\"There couldn't have been a clearer warning,\" he wrote.\nA document dated 2004 and leaked to the BBC detailed tests carried out in about 2002, on five unnamed cladding systems, all of which failed to meet the required standard.\nDr Evans says the third system tested, produced results \"strikingly similar\" to the tests carried out on the Grenfell cladding after the fire in June 2017, as the government scrambled to understand the scale of the building safety crisis. \nThe leaked document describes the system as \"aluminium\". Dr Evans notes that the Grenfell cladding was aluminium with a layer of plastic which was highly flammable. \nThe supplier of the cladding panels used at Grenfell was Arconic (formerly Alcoa), a multinational metals manufacturer. The product name was Reynobond 55PE.\nDr Evans points to the similar pattern in graphs of the way the temperatures rose in each test, suggesting they were conducted on the same product.   \nIn September, the Conservative government described the 2002 tests, carried out when Labour was in power, as \"experiments\" that were not designed to test the intrinsic safety of the products, but the criteria for the tests themselves.\nIn his letter to Mr Gove, Dr Evans said the tests \"show that the State was specifically aware of how deadly cladding materials such as ACM [aluminium composite material] can be\". \n\"It was a clear forewarning of what would happen at Grenfell 15 years later, killing 72 people. It should have been avoided - there couldn't have been a clearer warning.\n\"Firefighters and residents have been in peril for many years due to the failure to heed the warnings of this test.\" \nDr Evans said there should never have been a policy of telling residents to \"stay put\" when fires broke out, if they were living in buildings with this sort of flammable aluminium cladding. \nGrenfell's \"stay put\" advice has been partially blamed for the high loss of life in the disaster.\nThe Grenfell Tower public inquiry is expected to examine the earlier tests closely, and ask the Building Research Establishment, which carried them out, what was tested. \nDr Evans said if the government had evidence of the risks of aluminium composite cladding, and did not take action to prevent it being used, the government should now fully fund the cost of removing it from buildings. \nThe government has announced \u00a35bn in funding to make buildings safe, but experts believe far more is needed. \n\"Without doubt,\" Dr Evans wrote to Michael Gove, \"observing this 2002 test would have been a shocking experience\", and the fact the third system tested allowed flames to spread \"should have been obvious\" to people watching the test, and those receiving the report of it. \nThis document - dated 2004 and passed to the BBC in Sept 2021 - was marked \"commercial in confidence\" and never made public.\nThe report's significance was \"either missed completely, or deliberately ignored... in a culture which permitted the use of cheaper materials,\" Dr Evans wrote. \nThe leaked document was passed to the Grenfell Tower public inquiry following the BBC's story. \nIn response, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said its Building Safety Bill would make the biggest improvements to building safety in 40 years, \"where successive governments have failed... with more rights and protections for residents and a \u00a35bn investment to remove unsafe cladding.\n\"The new Building Safety Regulator will enforce a more stringent regulatory regime for buildings over 18m and oversee the safety and performance of all buildings, ensuring products are removed from the market if they do not meet regulation.\""

My body is on the mend and I am here.\"\n\"It's a huge testament to the skill and knowledge and level of care at the NHS. They're amazing. I owe them my life.\"\n\"I can't thank them enough,\" she added.\nRoberts, who took a month off to recuperate, spoke candidly about her diagnosis and recovery as she opened the radio show on Saturday.\n\"I can't believe it - it's a month since I had my surgery and I've got goosebumps. A month on, it's incredible what the body is capable of.\n\"I feel amazing. I'm lucky, I'm happy, and I'm buzzing to be back.\"\nThe former Big Brother star, from Southport, Merseyside, sought medical advice in October after struggling with her digestion \"for a while\".\nOn Saturday's show, she urged listeners to her show not to \"suffer in silence\" but to seek help if they had any health concerns.\n\"Go and see your GP, that's what I did and I think that's why I am here today. And I am just so grateful.\"\nThe DJ, who appeared on TV reality show I'm a Celebrity in 2019, has chronicled her convalescence on Instagram, including a selfie of her stoma post surgery, admitting the \"rollercoaster\" prognosis and subsequent treatment had been \"overwhelming at times\".\n\"Never underestimate the power of positivity and well wishes - it makes a difference, I promise you,\" she told listeners on Saturday.\nShe said she had nicknamed her stoma 'Audrey': \"While my body heals from the surgery, I've got a new little friend,\" said Roberts. \n\"She's kind of like a front bum; while my old bottom heals, I now go to the toilet on the front,\" the DJ explained.\n\"But don't worry it's all wrapped up today!\" she reassured fans.\nRoberts rose to fame after appearing on the third series of Channel 4's Big Brother in 2002. \nShe joined the BBC in 2012 as part of the Radio 1Xtra team, before moving to Radio 1 in 2015 to host the Early Breakfast Show.

      "text": "Two people in the UK have been found to be infected with the new Covid variant, Omicron, the health secretary has said.\nSajid Javid said the cases in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham were confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency after genomic sequencing.\nThey are linked and connected to travel in southern Africa, and both cases and their households were self-isolating.\nThe new variant has also been identified in South Africa, Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is holding a press conference at Downing Street with the chief scientific adviser to the government, Sir Patrick Vallance, and the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty.\nThe new Omicron variant was first reported to the World Health Organization from South Africa on Wednesday.  Early evidence suggests it has a higher re-infection risk.\nCountries around the world are currently racing to introduce travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread.\nTen countries are now on the UK's travel red list meaning, from Sunday at 04:00 GMT, all arrivals will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days.\nOn Friday, the UK placed South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini on the list.\nIn his announcement on Saturday, the health secretary said Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia would be added.\nMr Javid said: \"If anyone has travelled to these four countries or any of the other red-listed countries in the last 10 days then they must self isolate and take PCR tests.\"\nHe said: \"We've always been very clear that we won't hesitate to take further action if that is what is required. \n\"Today I can announce one thing that we are doing immediately is carrying out targeted testing and sequencing of positive cases in the two areas that are affected.\" \nThe Department of Health says testing is being carried out at locations where the positive cases were likely to have been infectious.\n\"Confirmed cases and contacts are being followed up and requested to isolate and get tested as necessary,\" it said.\nA spokesperson for Essex County Council said the case identified in Brentwood was \"linked to a single case from Nottingham involving international travel to South Africa\".\nA \"variant of concern\" is the World Health Organization's top category of worrying Covid variants.\nThe decision adds weight to the mounting scientific worry about the potential of this new variant, but it doesn't change any of the facts.\nThe variant has an astounding collection of mutations which are thought to increase its ability to spread and bypass some, but not all, of the protection from vaccines.\nHowever, we still don't have the clear real-world data.\nWe don't know for sure that it spreads faster, makes vaccines or drugs less effective or whether it leads to more severe disease.\nProf Lawrence Young, a virologist from the University of Warwick, said the UK cases were \"no surprise\" as \"once a variant is identified, particularly one that is likely to be more infectious, it will have spread beyond the few original cases and countries\".\nBut he said it was \"very likely that current vaccines will protect against severe disease with Omicron as they do for all the previously identified virus variants\".  \nThe health secretary said the UK vaccine rollout programme was now \"even more important\".\n\"We know there's this new variant out there. We don't know enough about it yet but from what we do know, the protections that we have - especially the vaccines - are hugely important,\" he said.\nAsked about potential changes in Covid restrictions, Mr Javid said: \"We will do whatever is necessary to protect the progress we have made as a country. We've come a long way since the summer and we keep all of this under review and if we need to take further action, we will.\"\nThe chief medical adviser said the UK would be working closely with the international community to understand any possible increase in transmissibility or resistance to vaccines.  \nProf Whitty said: \"It is important that everyone takes sensible precautions - get a PCR test if you have symptoms, isolate when asked, wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces, ventilate rooms, get your vaccine and boosters as soon as you can.\" \nThe average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November.

      "text": "South Africans have responded sharply to the news that the UK, and a growing list of other countries, have reacted to the emergence of a new Covid variant with red-listings and travel bans. \nWhile there is genuine pride here in the country's scientific expertise, and the speed with which South Africa has been able to identify and share information about new variants, there is also a strong sense that the nation is being unfairly punished for its successes. \n\"The world should provide support to South Africa and Africa and not discriminate or isolate it,\" said Prof Tulio de Oliveira, the Durban-based scientist leading efforts to understand the new variant. \nIn a series of tweets, he pointed out that South Africa has been \"very transparent with scientific information. We did this to protect our country and the world in spite of potentially suffering massive discrimination.\" \nSouth Africa has a sophisticated monitoring infrastructure that allows it to do the sequencing work effectively. \nProf de Oliveira urged \"billionaires and financial institutions\" to help the country cope with the economic damage caused by new travel restrictions. \nSouth Africa's Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor was also quick to condemn the UK's travel ban, describing it as \"rushed\" and damaging to tourism and business, and urging the UK government \"to reconsider this decision\". \nNews of the flight bans has caused inevitable frustration among many South Africans who had hoped to see visiting friends and family over the southern hemisphere summer holidays in December. \nSouth Africa was one of the last countries to have previously been removed from the red list last month. \n\"It's absolutely ridiculous that they've imposed it again so quickly without investigating this new variant,\" said one woman waiting for arrivals from London at Cape Town's international airport this morning.\n\"My sister just got on the flight [from London] but I think she'll be staying here for a long time. We were just getting on our feet again with tourism, and this is going to just kill it.\"  \n\"The new ban is a knee-jerk reaction of the UK government that puts airlines, hotels, travel businesses and travellers in a very difficult situation,'' said Otto de Vries, CEO of South Africa's travel agents' association, Asata. \nOne industry analysis estimated that South Africa lost 26 million rand ($1.6m; \u00a31.2m) for every day it spent on the UK's red list. \n\"The UK being our largest inbound international market, last night's news by the British government has caused widespread disbelief and disappointment amongst our hospitality industry as we enter our peak festive season period,\" said Rosemary Anderson, national chairperson of the Federated Hospitality Association of South Africa.\nOverall, tourism employs 2.8 million people and in 2018 it earned the country about $8bn (\u00a36bn). \nThe variant was first sequenced in neighbouring Botswana, and then in South Africa's capital, Pretoria. That was where a group of students, exactly how many is not known, took PCR tests which all contained an anomaly that prompted experts to send their samples to Prof de Oliviera's Durban laboratory for genome sequencing.  \n\"His team then found all these mutations. So we've only know about it for a few days, and because it's a new variant we have no idea how it will actually behave,\" said Prof Salim Karim, former chair of the South African government's Covid advisory committee.\n\"All we can do is extrapolate some of the likely behaviour based on previous similar mutations. But we do know that it spreads fast - we've seen how rapidly it spread in Pretoria. It sky-rocketed.\"  \nFrom a relatively low base, the numbers of confirmed cases in South Africa have shot up this week - from less than 700 on Sunday to almost 2,500 on Thursday. It is believed the increase is largely down to the new variant.\nSouth Africa's vaccination programme has slowed in recent months - not because of a lack of supplies, but due to public indifference. \nAn estimated 42% of the population has had at least one jab. But roughly two-thirds of those aged over 60 have been vaccinated. \nExperts are hopeful that the variant may help encourage more people to get jabbed.\nThe government has urged people to come forward, saying: \"Let us crush the power of the new variant by vaccinating to limit the number of mutations.\" \n\"It's going to be a shock to the system. I think it can have a positive effect [on vaccination rates],\" said Stavros Nicolaou, senior executive at Aspen Pharmacare Group.\n\"We know this variant is more contagious. My sense is that the current vaccines are likely to reduce morbidity. They might not be as effective in terms of preventing people getting infected. All the more reason, if you've got a more contagious variant, that you should go out and get vaccinated.\"\nThe bigger concern is the potential impact of the variant if it spreads to other parts of the continent where, on average, roughly 3% of the population has been vaccinated.

We look forward to having Motsi back with us next weekend.\"\nOther stars to have missed episodes of Strictly due to Covid this year include celebrity contestants Tom Fletcher and Judi Love.\nWriting on Instagram, Mabuse said she was \"gutted\" to have to miss Strictly. \n\"I was contacted by NHS Test and Trace as being in close contact with someone on Sunday 21 Nov who has since tested positive,\" she explained.\n\"Being double vaccinated and booster as I am, would normally mean exemption from isolation under the close contact rules, but unfortunately German EU vaccines are not recognised and neither is my booster in this instance, so I must follow UK Government guidance and can only return after 30 November to UK.\"\nThe government website states that the EU Digital Covid Certificate (EUDCC) is not recognised as proof of vaccination for passengers travelling to the UK from Germany.\nWhile the UK recognises the certificate for passengers travelling from some European countries, for those travelling from Germany the guidelines state: \"You cannot currently use your EUDCC to verify your vaccination status via the UK passenger locator form.\"\nIt adds that people whose EUDCC was issued in Germany can use it to prove vaccination status within the UK, however it does not apply for travel.\nMabuse said: \"Our health is the most important thing and luckily I have been tested multiple times this week and am negative.

      "tags": "Broadway theatre,Musical Theatre,United States",
      "text": "Legendary US composer and songwriter Stephen Sondheim has died aged 91.\nHis lawyer told the New York Times that Sondheim passed away on Friday at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut.\nHe was a titan of musical theatre who turned the unlikeliest of subjects into entertainment landmarks.\nDuring his illustrious career, he wrote the scores of some of Broadway's best known shows including Company, Follies and A Little Night Music. Sondheim also wrote the lyrics for West Side Story.\nThe New-York born composer won eight Grammy awards, nine Tony awards  - including the special Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre - and one Academy Award. He also received a Pulitzer Prize. \nHis ballad Send in the Clowns - from the 1973 musical A Little Night Music - has been recorded hundreds of times, including by Frank Sinatra and Judy Collins.\nIn 2015, US President Barack Obama bestowed Sondheim the Presidential Medal of Freedom - the highest civilian award - for his work.\nSondheim's lawyer said the composer had celebrated Thanksgiving with friends a day before his death.\nTributes have started pouring to one of musical theatre's most revered composers.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"Stephen Sondheim created fantastic worlds and characters, but at the heart of every story he told was a kid from New York City. And that kid was a legend. One of the brightest lights of Broadway is dark tonight. May he rest in peace.\"\nUS actress and singer Anna Kendrick said that performing Sondheim's work \"has been among the greatest privileges of my career\", adding that the composer's death was \"a devastating loss\".\nJournalist Fae O'Toole, posted on Twitter a letter she received from Sondheim in 2011, when she was \"theatre-mad  16-year-old\". \nShe said it \"made me cry for weeks and propelled me towards a career of art and writing. Thank you for everything. Rest easy.\"\nBorn on 22 March 1930, Sondheim saw his first Broadway musical at the age of nine.\nThe following year he met Oscar Hammerstein II, of The King and I and Oklahoma! fame, who became his mentor as he made his first forays into musical theatre.\nAfter some adolescent experiments with the form, he was commissioned to turn Front Porch in Flatbush, a play by twin brothers Julius and Philip Epstein, into a musical.\nThe resulting piece, called Saturday Night, did not open on Broadway in 1954 as planned, following the death of its producer, Lemuel Ayers. Indeed, it would be 43 years before it received its professional premiere in London.\nSondheim's big break instead came through an invitation to pen lyrics for West Side Story, Leonard Bernstein's contemporary retelling of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.\nWest Side Story opened on Broadway in 1957 and ran for more than 700 performances. A 1961 film version won 10 Oscars.\nIn 2010, the year Sondheim turned 80, a Broadway theatre was renamed in his honour.\nTen years later, he received the same accolade in London when the Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue was rechristened the Sondheim.\nSondheim is survived by his husband, Jeffrey Scott Romley, who is almost 50 years his junior, whom he married in 2017.\n\"You have to work on something that makes you uncertain - something that makes you doubt yourself,\" Sondheim said in 2017.\n\"If you know where you're going, you've gone, as the poet says. And that's death.\" "

      "title": "Covid: Swiss back government on Covid pass as cases surge",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Switzerland",
      "text": "Swiss voters have backed the government's measures to tackle Covid, according to preliminary results.\nMore than 60% opposed moves to remove some restrictions, including the Covid vaccination pass.\nSunday's referendum came after organisers said the pass was an unnecessary restriction of freedoms.\nWith just under two-thirds of the population fully vaccinated, the Swiss have one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe. \nNow, Covid-19 infections are rising exponentially, with case numbers up by 40-50% each week. \nFrom the start of the pandemic the Swiss government has performed a tricky balancing act, trying to introduce measures to control the spread of Covid while still staying true to Switzerland's system of direct democracy, in which the government has little formal power and the people have the final say.\nSwitzerland's lockdowns were never as strict as its neighbours'. People were allowed outside for exercise whenever they wanted and the schools only closed for a few weeks.\nBut last summer, with cases falling dramatically, Switzerland didn't have a celebratory, UK-style \"freedom\" day either.\nInstead, a Covid certificate was introduced with proof of vaccination, negative test, or immunity through having had the virus. In September it became obligatory in order to enter bars, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sporting events, and face-to-face university classes.\nBut not everyone agrees.\nVaccination has long been a sensitive issue here, especially in German-speaking Switzerland. A belief that natural immunity is best led to a drop in childhood measles vaccinations that sparked a surge in measles cases across Europe. \nMeanwhile, in the alpine communities, a historic pride in their own independence rooted, some say, in the time when the mountain villages were cut off from the world each winter, means there is resistance to the government issuing orders.\nAnd so, when the certificate was introduced and Covid tests stopped being free, life for the unvaccinated became difficult and even going out for a beer was suddenly expensive.\nThe government hoped the measures would encourage people to get vaccinated. Instead, many took to the streets and others gathered enough signatures to challenge the Covid certificate in Sunday's referendum. \nFor weeks there have been demonstrations. Some have turned violent, with police using water cannons and rubber bullets against protesters trying to storm parliament. \nAt a rally in Bern this month, thousands turned out to hear speakers, including renowned anti-vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr, who hailed Switzerland as Europe's last great hope against what he claimed were sinister powers forcing people to get vaccinated, while at the same time, via the Covid certificate, introducing a draconian mass surveillance system.\nThe crowd, huddled together, all mask-less, roared their approval. \nSome wore the insignia of the far right, others the far left. Health minister Alain Berset was depicted, complete with red horns, as the devil.\nAmong the crowds was part-time student Manuela. She refuses to get vaccinated because, she says, she is \"a healthy young woman\" for whom getting the virus poses little risk. \nIn fact, the World Health Organization advises that, while young people are less likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19, they are still susceptible to infection, and with it the risk of serious and long term health consequences. \nAnd so, for fear of increasing opposition to the Covid certificate, the health minister was loath to introduce any new restrictions ahead of Sunday's crucial vote. \nAlain Berset and his science taskforce are convinced Switzerland needs infection control measures during this increasingly bleak Covid winter. Abolishing the certificate, they believe, could be a huge risk, especially as booster vaccinations have scarcely begun.\nInstead, as cases rise, the government has advised hospitals to increase their intensive care capacity. This has brought a bitter laugh from Switzerland's nurses, who point out that extra beds won't help when there aren't enough staff to look after the patients in them.\nIt's estimated 10% of Swiss nurses and care workers have left the profession since the start of the pandemic.\n\"Everywhere we have too few staff,\" says Mich\u00e8le Giroud, a nurse who's also president of the Swiss Federation of Nurse Anaesthetists. \"We are constantly working without breaks, doing overtime, extra shifts. A third of us have burn-out symptoms: anxiety or insomnia.\"\nBut unlike in other European countries going through similar health sector shortages, Swiss nurses have the power to change things. They have gathered the signatures for a nationwide referendum demanding more investment and better working conditions. \nOn Sunday, Swiss voters backed them.\nSo now the health minister will return to the grim business of counting the rising Covid cases, and he is likely to start thinking about what new restrictions might be necessary. He may also have to count out around CHF8bn (\u00a36bn) for Switzerland's nurses.\nBut the anger, fear and social division born of the pandemic cannot be solved by a referendum or two, and the demonstrations are sure to continue, in Switzerland and across Europe."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Omicron coronavirus variant is \"not a disaster\" and some people may be \"hugely overstating the situation\", a scientist advising the government says.\nOmicron has been labelled \"of concern\" by the World Health Organization, and is causing alarm among some scientists.\nBut microbiologist Prof Calum Semple says vaccines are \"still likely to protect you from severe disease\".\nProf Semple does, however, support the new UK travel restrictions, saying they will allow more people to get jabbed.\nAsked whether people should be fearful of the new variant, Prof Semple - who sits on the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - told BBC Breakfast: \"This is not a disaster, and the headlines from some of my colleagues saying 'this is horrendous' I think are hugely overstating the situation. \n\"Immunity from the vaccination is still likely to protect you from severe disease. You might get a snuffle or a headache or a filthy cold but your chance of coming into hospital or intensive care or sadly dying are greatly diminished by the vaccine and still will be going into the future.\"\nSo far, more than 50 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. More than 42 million have had two doses while almost 17 million have had a third or booster jab.\nA \"variant of concern\" is the World Health Organization's top category of worrying Covid variants.\nThe decision adds weight to the mounting scientific worry about the potential of this new variant, but it doesn't change any of the facts.\nThe variant has an astounding collection of mutations which are thought to increase its ability to spread and bypass some, but not all, of the protection from vaccines.\nHowever, we still don't have the clear real-world data.\nWe don't know for sure that it spreads faster, makes vaccines or drugs less effective or whether it leads to more severe disease.\nThe new Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November and has also been identified in Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel.\nCountries around the world are currently racing to introduce travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain Omicron's spread.\nThe UK has placed South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini on its travel red list, meaning, from Sunday at 04:00 GMT, all arrivals will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. \nProf Semple said that while it may not be possible to stop the variant coming to the UK, it is still important to delay its arrival.\n\"If you can slow the virus coming into your country it gives you more time for your booster campaign to get ahead of it,\" he said.\n\"It also gives the scientists longer to understand more about the virus in case there is anything we really should be worrying about.\"\nAsked what other measures he thought were advisable in the face of a new variant and the 50,091 new UK cases reported on Friday, Prof Semple said he was in favour of mask wearing in shops and on public transport, and hand washing.\nLike Prof Semple, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, expressed cautious optimism that existing vaccines could be effective at preventing serious disease from the Omicron variant.\nHe told the Today programme that while it would still be weeks until scientists properly understood the effects of Omicron's mutations, most of them were similar to those seen in other variants.\n\"Despite those mutations existing in other variants, the vaccines have continued to prevent serious disease as we've moved through Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta,\" he said.\n\"At least from a speculative point of view, we have some optimism that the vaccine should still work against a new variant for serious disease but really we need to wait several weeks to have that confirmed.\n\"It's extremely unlikely that a reboot of a pandemic in a vaccinated population like we saw last year is going to happen.\" \nAsked whether it was possible to update the vaccines if deemed necessary, Prof Pollard added: \"The processes of how one goes about developing a new vaccine are increasingly well oiled. So, if it's needed, that is something that could be moved very rapidly.\"\nThe UK currently has no known cases of the Omicron variant.\nThe travel ban for southern African countries is designed to maintain that for as long as possible, and Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the government \"won't hesitate to act\" if further measures are needed.\n\"One of the lessons of this pandemic has been that we must move quickly, and at the earliest possible moment,\" he told MPs on Friday. \"We're heading into winter and our booster programme is still ongoing, so we must act with caution.\"\nBut asked whether the government could switch from its current, minimal Covid restrictions to its Plan B for winter, Mr Javid said the current rules \"remain the policies that I think we need at this time\".\nThe Labour Party, meanwhile, is calling on the government to reduce the amount of time people need to wait between their second vaccine dose and their booster. \nAt present, people can book a booster after five months but must wait until six months to have it. Labour says the gap should be reduced to five months before people get a third dose.\nShadow health minister Alex Norris said: \"This new variant is a wake-up call. The pandemic is not over, we need to urgently bolster our defences to keep the virus at bay.\""

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

We all share in [her family's] unimaginable grief.\"\nPosting on Twitter, Dame Rachel de Souza, children's commissioner for England, said: \"This kind of violence involving a child and with such tragic consequences is shocking at any time, but when the victim is 12 it's particularly so.\"\nMary Katilius, 65, from Limerick, said she had been nearby with her granddaughter when Ava was attacked.   \n\"We heard screams and someone said to call an ambulance. We rushed over straight away but there was already a man helping her,\" she said.\nDet Supt Coombs said a lot of the witnesses were young and would be given special treatment when being interviewed.\nFloral tributes have been left near the scene, with one message saying: \"Rest in peace angel.\"\nLacey, 17, who came to lay flowers and a balloon, said her younger sister had been close friends with Ava.\n\"She was just a bubbly character, so loving and caring,\" she added.\nBy Andy Gill, BBC North West Tonight reporter\nThere is a massive police presence in Liverpool with several of the city's main shopping streets taped off. \nDozens of police vehicles are parked close to the scene where 12-year-old Ava was fatally attacked. \nMany shoppers and tourists are having to ask officers how they can get to their destinations as many are unaware of the tragedy which lies behind the disruption to their usual routine. \nAva died on what is called White Ribbon Day, a worldwide campaign to end violence against women and girls. \nCivic leaders came together yesterday to mark it and start 16 days of activity to highlight the issue. \nThe death of a girl, not yet in her teens, throws the need for the campaign into the starkest relief. \nThe four boys - a 13-year-old, two 14-year-olds and a 15-year-old - remain in custody for questioning. \nThey were arrested at different locations during Thursday evening and into the early hours of Friday, police said.   \nA police cordon was in place surrounding Williamson Square, Tarleton Street, Church Street, Church Alley and School Lane crossing over Hanover Street on to Fleet Street.\nSeveral shops on Church Street, one of the city's main shopping streets, remained closed on Black Friday due to the cordon.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Boris Johnson secretly wants to take back powers from the UK's devolved parliaments, Scotland's deputy first minister has told the SNP conference.\nJohn Swinney urged delegates to \"stand up and be counted before it's too late\" to defend devolution.\nHis comments were dismissed as \"simply nonsense\" by the UK government.\nThe conference, which is being held online, started on Friday and will end with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's speech on Monday.\nIn his virtual speech on Saturday afternoon, Mr Swinney told members that the UK government wanted \"unfettered Westminster control on Scotland\" and was using Brexit to undermine devolution.\nHe argued that \"the only way to keep the gains of devolution is by becoming independent\" and suggested that decisions made at Holyrood \"can be routinely undermined at a whim by the Tories\".\nMr Swinney said: \"We are now seeing a concerted attack on our parliament, from the very people who fought tooth and nail against it being established in the first place.\n\"In a grotesque irony, the Tories are using something that the people of Scotland voted overwhelmingly against - Brexit - to undermine something they voted overwhelmingly for - the Scottish Parliament.\n\"Through the Internal Market Act, the Tories have given themselves unfettered power to decide the rules of the internal market - and to completely ignore the devolution settlement if they want to.\"\nClaiming that the prime minister could wish to reverse devolution, Mr Swinney added: \"There will be no sudden Big Bang moment, Boris Johnson is not going to stand up and announce to the cheering Tory faithful that he is dismantling the devolution settlement - much as I am sure he would like to.\n\"But make no mistake - piece by piece, devolution is quietly being filleted, hollowed out from the inside by a Tory Party which has always opposed the idea of anything other than unfettered Westminster control on Scotland.\n\"Much like the climate emergency, which is slowly creeping up on us every single day - we need to issue a code red for devolution.\n\"All of us who care so deeply about the Scottish Parliament and its role in Scottish public life need to stand up and be counted before it is too late.\"\nThe conference featured debates on issues including children's rights, street harassment against women and an independent Scottish civil service on Saturday. \nResponding to Ms Swinney's remarks, a UK government spokeswoman said: \"This is simply nonsense.\n\"The Internal Market Bill ensures that vital trade can continue seamlessly between all four corners of the UK.\n\"Now more than ever, people in Scotland want to see the UK and Scottish governments working together to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\"The pandemic, and our collective response - from the furlough scheme to vaccine procurement and the backing of our military personnel - has shown that we are at our strongest when we work together.\" "

      "title": "Obituary: Stephen Sondheim",
      "tags": "Obituaries",
      "text": "The American composer and songwriter Stephen Sondheim has died at his home in Connecticut aged 91, according to the New York Times. He was a titan of musical theatre who turned the unlikeliest of subjects into entertainment landmarks.\nFrom Sweeney Todd and the president killers of Assassins to the fairy tale-based Into the Woods, his works boasted an audacity, complexity and linguistic dexterity that few of his peers could rival.\nBorn in New York in March 1930, the composer and lyricist saw his first Broadway musical at the age of nine.\nThe following year he met Oscar Hammerstein II, of The King and I and Oklahoma! fame, who became his mentor as he made his first forays into musical theatre.\nAfter some adolescent experiments with the form, he was commissioned to turn Front Porch in Flatbush, a play by twin brothers Julius and Philip Epstein, into a musical.\nThe resulting piece, called Saturday Night, did not open on Broadway in 1954 as planned, following the death of its producer, Lemuel Ayers. Indeed, it would be 43 years before it received its professional premiere in London.\nSondheim's big break instead came through an invitation to pen lyrics for West Side Story, Leonard Bernstein's contemporary retelling of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.\nIn 2012, producer Hal Prince recalled the first time he heard the score for the show.\n\"It was a Sunday evening at Lenny Bernstein's apartment with Lenny playing the piano very loudly because he was nervous,\" he told the BBC. \"Steve sang the words. By the time they'd finished, I knew we were producing. We raised the money in 24 hours.\"\nWest Side Story opened on Broadway in 1957 and ran for more than 700 performances. A 1961 film version won 10 Oscars.\nYet Sondheim was dissatisfied with his contribution and later described his lyrics as \"embarrassing\".\n\"It's very hard for me to listen to some of those songs,\" he told ABC News in 2010.\n\"Bernstein wanted the songs to be heavy, what he called 'poetic', and my idea of poetry and his idea of poetry are polar opposites.\"\nSondheim had further success as a lyricist with the 1959 musical Gypsy, about striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee and her domineering mother, Rose.\nThat was followed in 1962 by A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, an adaptation of farces by ancient Roman playwright Plautus, for which he wrote both music and lyrics.\nThe show won a Tony for best musical and was later filmed with original lead, Zero Mostel, reprising his role as wily slave Pseudolus.\nSondheim's next shows - Anyone Can Whistle, from 1964, and Do I Hear A Waltz? the following year - were not successes.\nNeither was a reunion with Bernstein and West Side Story director Jerome Robbins on a project that was eventually abandoned.\nOver the following decade, though, he worked with Prince on a series of acclaimed shows that are now regarded as modern masterpieces.\nCompany (1970) told of a single New Yorker, called Bobby, whose married friends teach him the value of commitment.\nThe original production was nominated for 14 Tonys and won six, with Sondheim receiving one apiece for his music and lyrics.\nA 2018 revival in London made the lead character female - with Sondheim\u2019s blessing.\nFollies (1971) imagined the reunion of a group of ageing vaudevillians who relive their youth in a Broadway theatre scheduled for demolition.\nIts score included the song Losing My Mind, which became a UK top-10 single when covered by Liza Minnelli in 1989.\nA Little Night Music (1973) saw Sondheim nimbly adapt the 1955 Ingmar Bergman film Smiles of a Summer Night into a sprightly operetta.\nThe score, written primarily in waltz time, included the poignant ballad Send in the Clowns, arguably his best-known song. A Little Night Music later became a film, starring Elizabeth Taylor.\nThe composer's golden decade concluded with Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1979), a bold, baroque and very bloody account of the throat-slitting barber's nefarious adventures.\nThe \"musical thriller\" was filmed in 2007 by director Tim Burton, with Johnny Depp as Todd and Helena Bonham Carter as his pie-making accomplice, Mrs Lovett.\nIn contrast, Merrily We Roll Along (1981) was a disappointment, opening to sniffy reviews and closing after just 16 performances.\nBut the show, which follows two decades in the lives of a group of friends in reverse chronological order, has been more warmly appraised in recent years.\nIn 2019, director Richard Linklater began work on a film version, to be assembled in stages, in real time, over 20 years.\nSunday in the Park with George (1984) took the painting of Georges Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte 100 years earlier as the cue for a lyrical contemplation on \"the art of making art\".\nThe musical won Sondheim and librettist James Lapine the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\nInto the Woods (1987) combined such Grimms' fairy tale characters as Cinderella, Rapunzel and Little Red Riding Hood within a single narrative.\nIt, too, was filmed, in 2014, with an all-star cast, headed by Meryl Streep.\nAssassins (1990) used a similar conceit, combining John Wilkes Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald and others together in a dark meditation on presidential assassination attempts.\nThe following year Sondheim won an Oscar for Sooner or Later, sung by Madonna in the film Dick Tracy.\nIn Sondheim's later years he produced fewer musicals directly for the stage.\nBut he continued to create regardless, producing the non-musical play Getting Away with Murder (1996) and two volumes of annotated lyrics - Finishing the Hat (2010) and Look, I Made a Hat (2011).\nIn 2010, the year he turned 80, a Broadway theatre was renamed in his honour.\nTen years later, he received the same accolade in London when the Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue was rechristened the Sondheim.\nSondheim's many other honours include a special Tony in 2008, a special Olivier in 2011, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015.\nHe is survived by his husband, Jeffrey Scott Romley, who is almost 50 years his junior, whom he married in 2017.\n\"You have to work on something that makes you uncertain - something that makes you doubt yourself,\" Sondheim said in 2017.\n\"If you know where you're going, you've gone, as the poet says. And that's death.\" "

      "tags": "Calais migrant crisis,English Channel,Europe migrant crisis,Migration",
      "text": "Usually tragedies bring people together but the deaths in the Channel seem to have highlighted the differences between the UK and French governments \nThe prime minister is under pressure from many of his own MPs - who in turn are under pressure from a substantial number of their voters - to do more to stop the small boats coming to our shores.\nSo it was perhaps unsurprising that Boris Johnson made his letter to the French president public, portraying himself as offering potential solutions.\nDowning Street insiders say they were genuinely surprised at what they regarded as a disproportionate response from France. \nAnd they point out that it is not unknown for French ministers to use social media to criticise UK positions, or indeed to denounce the prime minister personally for \"populism\".\nDowning Street is emphasising that everything Mr Johnson asked for publicly in his letter - for example, joint patrols or an agreement on returning refugees - had already been asked for privately, but to no avail.\nAnd those close to discussions with the French government say that many of the arguments that are now out in the open had persisted for some time behind closed doors.\nIt had been thought that the events of this week might have led to a willingness to revisit some of the more contentious issues.\nThe atmosphere, though, has instead turned more negative.\nBut while the sound of megaphone diplomacy has dominated much of the coverage today, there are quieter attempts to get the UK/French relationship on an even keel.\nThere is a move to try to get Home Secretary Priti Patel's invitation to meet her French counterpart, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, reinstated.\nI'm told that amid rocky relations with France over fishing and the Northern Ireland protocol, the entente between the Home Office and the French interior ministry is usually relatively cordiale.\nSo while she is currently not on this weekend's guest list in France, Ms Patel did speak to Mr Darmanin this afternoon.\nHome Office officials are already in France tonight to try to discuss closer co-operation.\nAnd the UK government is still paying by instalments the \u00a354m promised to France to help bolster patrols and surveillance on the other side of the Channel.\nBut Labour realises what a potentially toxic issue this is for Boris Johnson.\nIn his attack today, the shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds has targeted the prime minister's vulnerabilities.\nHe deliberately echoed concerns of Mr Johnson's backbenchers by accusing him of \"losing control of the situation in the Channel\".\nBut he has also picked at another political sore.\nWith concerns about how Downing Street has handled some difficult issues in recent weeks, the Labour MP has accused the prime minister of \"a gross error of judgment\" over his diplomacy by Twitter. \nIt's well known in Whitehall that Boris Johnson has been frustrated at the continuation of the migrant crisis.\nHis critics say he has focused too much on small boats, while not doing enough to tackle the underlying factors driving migration.\nLives remain at risk, but the longer the crisis persists, the greater the political risks for the prime minister too.
