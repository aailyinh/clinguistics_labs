      "text": "Viral videos of people having full-face \"hot wax\" treatments on TikTok have led to warnings from skin experts.\nThey show softened resin covering subjects' face, mouth and neck - and partially penetrating their ears and nose - before being removed.\nA barber posting some of the most watched examples says it is beneficial.\nBut the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) said: \"Attempting to wax inside your nose or ears is not recommended.\"\nA UK-based skin specialist has also raised safety concerns about the risk of obstructed breathing.\nAnd one expert has suggested TikTok should add a warning.\nBut it has indicated the videos are excluded from its community guidelines on dangerous behaviour because they show skilled professionals.\nThey have gained barbershop Kapsalon Freedom, in the Netherlands, a following more than 800,000 TikTok users.\nOne of its first attempts, posted in November, attracted nearly 84 million views, after Dutch media reports.\nIt left the bottom portion of the customer's face exposed.\nBut a more recent example, with more than 19 million views, shows the wax resin coming down over a man's chin and on to his neck. \nSections pulled out of his ears and nose are held up to the camera to show dozens of hairs poking out of the now hardened substance.\nIn this case, the wax runs around but not over his mouth. \nBut other clips show fully covered faces, with cotton swabs used to create air passages.\nStrips of paper are also used to protect eyelashes and eyebrows. \nBarber Renaz Ismael has said face-waxing is common in the Middle East, where he was born.\nBut he has taken it to a new level.\n\"I am the first person in the world who has done whole waxing,\" he told BBC News.\n\"It's not bad for your skin.\"\nMr Ismael is now using the hashtag #viral to promote the clips.\nAnd some have been set to music. \nHe has also posted examples on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.\nBut they have attracted much smaller audiences.\nAlex Echeverri, who works at John and Ginger salon, in West Sussex, raised safety concerns about others attempting the process.\n\"Our first consideration would be that it could cause suffocation,\" the beautician, who has more than two decades of experience in the industry, said.\n\"There's no control element to smothering the face with wax.\n\"And wax hardens.\n\"So it could harden in the airways and have to be surgically removed.\"\nLondon-based Turkish barbershop Adam Grooming Atelier said: \"To wax such a large area of delicate skin is very irresponsible.\"\nThe BAD also raised concern the videos could lead to copycat incidents.\n\"Social-media platforms have the ability of quickly spreading health and beauty trends,\" Dr Anjali Mahto said.\n\"Waxing is a traumatic process for the skin, especially sensitive areas such as those found around the eyes.\n\"These areas can become inflamed and irritated.\n\"In some cases, tiny pimples or pus-filled bumps could develop as a result.\n\"This is known as folliculitis.\"\nThe British Skin Foundation also raised concern some of the clips showed the wax being used on what appear to be primary-school-age youngsters.\n\"Personally I would not recommend treating children,\" consultant dermatologist Dr Emma Wedgeworth said.\n\"It seems sensible to have a warning.\n\"There is a lot of misinformation and potentially harmful DIY beauty practices on TikTok and other social-media channels.\n\"And it would be good to see these more tightly regulated.\""

      "text": "A white woman who called police on a black man bird watching in New York's Central Park has had the criminal case against her dismissed.\nProsecutors say Amy Cooper completed a therapy course addressing racial bias and asked for her charge to be dropped. \nA video of Ms Cooper went viral in 2020 and sparked outrage across the US.\nIn it she was seen threatening Christian Cooper, no relation, with the police after he reportedly asked her to put her dog on a lead.\nThe incident happened the same day that unarmed black man George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis, triggering weeks of national and global anti-racism protests. \nMs Cooper apologised after the video went viral but lost her job and was later charged with filing a false police report. \nChristian Cooper, who is prominent in the New York bird watching community, posted the encounter on Facebook and said it came after he had asked her to put her dog on a lead in an area where it was required. \nThe video showed her telling Mr Cooper that she would tell police \"there's an African-American man threatening my life\" before she is seen calling emergency services in a distressed tone to say an \"African American man\" was \"threatening me and my dog\" and asked dispatchers to \"please send the cops immediately!\" \nProsecutors later said that Ms Cooper had repeated the claim and accused Mr Cooper of trying to assault her during a second call. \nAt the time, District Attorney Cyrus Vance said Ms Cooper had \"engaged in racist criminal conduct\" and said it was \"fortunate\" that \"no one was injured or killed in the police response to Ms Cooper's hoax\".\nBut on Tuesday the single misdemeanour charge against her was dropped on the basis that Ms Cooper had completed a five-session educational therapy programme.\nAssistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said the sessions were \"designed for introspection and progress\" and focused \"on the ways in which Ms Cooper could appreciate that racial identities shape our lives but we cannot use them to harm ourselves or others\".\nShe was offered the programme as part of a restorative justice initiative in part because of her lack of criminal background, the prosecutor said. \nIn a tweeted statement, Ms Cooper's lawyer Robert Barnes thanked officials for the decision and suggested she might seek further legal action over the incident. \nMr Cooper has not publicly responded to news of the charge being dropped.

      "text": "Research is underway to discover whether delivery drivers are witnessing domestic abuse during the Covid outbreak - and how they can help.\nLockdown has given rise to concerns violence at home has become a \"shadow pandemic\".\nThe Wales Violence Prevention Unit wants \"to make domestic abuse everybody's business\".\nThey and public health experts say lockdown means colleagues in virtual meetings could help.\nPeople like drivers could also be witnesses. \n\"One of the things that's often said is that it's people's private business,\" said Jo Hopkins, who oversees violence prevention for Public Health Wales.\n\"Or people are concerned that doing something will either make the situation worse, or put themselves in danger.\n\"And so an attitudinal shift needs to be made. We're keen to better understand what we need to do, so people understand that domestic abuse is everybody's business.\"\nThis week an anonymous survey has been launched for those who have seen or suspected abuse.\nIt will ask what has stopped people from helping, and what is needed for more people to act.\n\"We're not necessarily talking about huge interventions,\" said Ms Hopkins. \nShe said anyone could call the Live Fear Free helpline if they are concerned for someone they know.\n\"But if someone makes that leap and asks for help, it really needs to be responded to in the right way,\" she said.\nPart of the work will question whether assumptions are made about what abuse looks like, and who it affects.\n\"It's really about just understanding that this could happen to anybody,\" Ms Hopkins said.\nNikesh Patel owns two pharmacies - one in Cardiff, and one in Barry - and said his drivers had been\u00a0trained spot when customers\u00a0could be in danger.\nHe told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: \"We've been doing deliveries for a lot more patients but even before lockdown we've always had the procedure and training programmes because [the delivery drivers] also work as dispensers within the pharmacy.\n\"They're trained in protection of vulnerable adults and level-one child protection.\u00a0\n\"If they see any concerns or they feel that something is not right they usually bring it back to the pharmacy, tell the pharmacist and the pharmacist will then make the judgement whether or not to intervene and possibly somebody's family member who can go in and check with them.\"\nDebanjali Bhattercharjee is an \"Ask Me\" ambassador with Welsh Women's Aid.\n\"Statistics say on average there are up to 35 incidents that would have taken place before a person discloses domestic abuse,\" she said. \n\"So if someone thinks 'I think I might be able to trust this person' it's crucial that the first response is appropriate.\n\"If we provide the safe space - the respectful, non-judgemental kind of space and signpost them appropriately, that could mean the difference between the person going through a traumatic experience, or coming out of it. \n\"We don't know what's going on behind closed doors, but we can all keep an eye on what's happening outside my door, my window, or my back garden, and do something about it.\""

He is unfit to give evidence.\"\nHe said his client did not believe he would be treated fairly by the inquiry, adding that he had been legally advised \"in the strongest possible terms\" to exercise his right to silence.\nPete Weatherby QC, representing some of the families, said Abdallah had crucial evidence to give the inquiry about the radicalisation of Abedi and \"whether the plot went further than the Abedi brothers themselves\".\nHe said Abdallah was an \"important\" witness who should be called to give evidence and the medical reports were \"central\" to whether he should be excused from going into the witness box.\nThe inquiry chairman Sir John Saunders will publish his decision on whether the reports should be disclosed at a later date to be confirmed.\nAny argument about whether Abdallah will be called as a witness to the inquiry will take place at a later date.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Princess Latifa,United Arab Emirates,Mohammed Al Maktoum,Dubai",
      "text": "The daughter of Dubai's ruler who tried to flee the country in 2018 later sent secret video messages to friends accusing her father of holding her \"hostage\" as she feared for her life.\nIn footage shared with BBC Panorama, Princess Latifa Al Maktoum says commandos drugged her as she fled by boat and flew her back to detention.\nThe secret messages have stopped - and friends are urging the UN to step in.\nDubai and the UAE have previously said she is safe in the care of family.\nEx-UN rights envoy Mary Robinson, who had described Latifa as a \"troubled young woman\" after meeting her in 2018, now says she was \"horribly tricked\" by the princess's family.\nThe former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and president of Ireland has joined calls for international action to establish Latifa's current condition and whereabouts.\n\"I continue to be very worried about Latifa. Things have moved on. And so I think it should be investigated,\" she said.\nLatifa's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is one of the richest heads of state in the world, the ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nThe videos were recorded over several months on a phone Latifa was secretly given about a year after her capture and return to Dubai. She recorded them in a bathroom as it had the only door she could lock. \nIn the messages, she detailed how:\nLatifa's account of her capture and detention was revealed to Panorama by her close friend Tiina Jauhiainen, maternal cousin Marcus Essabri and campaigner David Haigh, who are all behind the Free Latifa campaign.\nThey say they have taken the difficult decision to release the messages now out of concern for Latifa's safety.\nIt was they who managed to establish contact with Latifa as she was held in a Dubai \"villa\", which she said had barred windows and police guards.\nPanorama has independently verified the details of where Latifa was held.  \nThe Missing Princess is on BBC One in the UK on Tuesday at 20:30, or watch it later on BBC iPlayer\nSheikh Mohammed has built a hugely successful city but rights activists say there is no tolerance of dissent and the judicial system can discriminate against women.\nHe has a vast horse-racing enterprise and frequently attends major events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II.\nBut he has faced severe criticism over Princess Latifa and also her stepmother, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussain, who fled to London in 2019 with her two children.\nLatifa, now 35, first tried to flee at 16 but it was only after contacting French businessman Herve Jaubert in 2011 that a long-planned escape was put into motion. This was done with the help of Ms Jauhiainen, initially her instructor for capoeira, a Brazilian martial art.\nOn 24 February 2018, Latifa and Ms Jauhiainen took an inflatable boat and jet ski to international waters, where Mr Jaubert was waiting in a US flagged yacht. \nBut eight days later, off India, the boat was boarded by commandos. Ms Jauhiainen says smoke grenades forced her and Latifa out of hiding in the bathroom below deck and they were held at gunpoint.\nLatifa was returned to Dubai, and hadn't been heard from since until now. \nMs Jauhiainen and the crew on the boat were freed after two weeks of detention in Dubai. The Indian government has never commented on its role.\nBefore her 2018 escape attempt, Latifa recorded another video which was posted on YouTube after her capture. \"If you are watching this video, it's not such a good thing, either I'm dead or I'm in a very, very, very bad situation,\" she said.\nIt was this that sparked huge international concern and calls for her release. The UAE came under intense pressure to account for her and a meeting was arranged with Ms Robinson.\nShe flew to Dubai in December 2018 at the request of her friend, Princess Haya, for a lunch at which Latifa was also present.  \nMs Robinson told Panorama she and Princess Haya had earlier been presented with details of Latifa's bipolar disorder, a condition she does not have.\nShe said she did not ask Latifa about her situation because she did not want to \"increase the trauma\" of Latifa's \"condition\".\nNine days after the lunch, the UAE's foreign ministry published photographs of Ms Robinson with Latifa, which it said was proof that the princess was safe and well.\nMs Robinson said: \"I was particularly tricked when the photographs went public. That was a total surprise... I was absolutely stunned.\"\nIn 2019, the tensions within Dubai's ruling family were laid bare before England's High Court after one of the sheikh's wives, Princess Haya, fled to the UK with two of her children and applied for a protection order and non-molestation order against the sheikh. \nLast year, the High Court issued a series of fact-finding judgments that said Sheikh Mohammed had ordered and orchestrated the forcible return of Latifa in 2002 and 2018, as well as the unlawful abduction from the UK in 2000 of her older sister Princess Shamsa, who had also tried to escape.\nThe court found Sheikh Mohammed \"continues to maintain a regime whereby both these two young women are deprived of their liberty\".\nLatifa's friends had hoped that the court case in March last year that ruled against Sheikh Mohammed, calling him \"not honest\" and in favour of Princess Haya, might help.\nOn the decision to release the messages now, Ms Jauhiainen just says that \"a lot of time has passed\" since contact was lost.\nShe says she thought hard about releasing the video messages now, but adds: \"I feel that she would want us to fight for her, and not give up.\"\nThe governments of Dubai and the UAE have failed to respond to requests for comment from the BBC about Latifa's current condition."

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar,Yangon",
      "text": "Myanmar's detained opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been handed a second criminal charge on the day she appeared in court via video link.\nMs Suu Kyi, who was earlier charged with possessing illegal walkie-talkies, is now also alleged to have violated the country's Natural Disaster Law.\nIt is not clear what the new charge, issued on Tuesday, relates to.\nMyanmar's military earlier repeated its promise to hold fresh elections and relinquish power as protests continue.\nAnti-coup demonstrators are demanding the release of their elected leaders, including Ms Suu Kyi, following the military coup on 1 February.\nIn the military's first news conference since toppling the government, spokesman Brig Gen Zaw Min Tun said the armed forces would not remain in power for long, and promised to \"hand power back to the winning party\" following a planned election.\nHowever, he did not provide a date for the vote.\nSpeaking in Nay Pyi Taw on Tuesday, Zaw Min Tun also repeated the claim - without providing evidence - of fraud in last November's election. \n Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won a resounding victory in the poll. The military has claimed fraud as a justification for its coup. \nBritain and the US have criticised the charges. PM Boris Johnson said they were \"fabricated\" and \"a clear violation of her human rights\", while a spokesperson for the US state department called them \"disturbing.\"\nMs Suu Kyi made a brief virtual appearance at a court in the capital Nay Pyi Taw on Tuesday. She reportedly answered questions about legal arrangements and representation. \nHer next court appearance is scheduled to take place on 1 March. \nZaw Min Tun said that Ms Suu Kyi had been confined to her home for her own safety, and that she was \"comfortable and healthy\".\nHe used the news conference to accuse anti-coup protesters of violence and intimidation against the security forces. \nA police officer had been wounded by \"lawless actions\" and had later died from his injuries, he said.\nProtesters have clashed with security officers and there have been recent reports of police using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. \nOne protester remains in a critical condition after being shot in the head on 9 February.\nMya Thwe Thwe Khaing, 19, was hurt while taking part in a protest - though it is not clear exactly what she was hit by. Rights groups say her wound is consistent with one from live ammunition. \nZaw Min Tun said some measures taken to control crowds of protesters were in response to bricks being thrown at police. \nThe UN has warned Myanmar's military - which on Monday announced penalties of up to 20 years in prison for those opposing the coup leaders - that there would be \"severe consequences\" for any brutal suppression of the ongoing anti-coup protests there.\nMeanwhile, access to the internet in Myanmar was restored on Tuesday morning after it had been cut off for a second night.\nThe junta has been regularly blocking the web to try to stifle dissent since the coup began.\nOn Saturday, the military gave itself the power to make arrests, carry out searches and hold people for more than 24 hours without a court ruling, while telling journalists not to describe the military's takeover as a coup.\nProtesters were out again early on Tuesday, with crowds gathering in cities including Yangon and Mandalay. BBC Burmese reports monks were seen heading out onto the streets of Yangon in a mostly peaceful scene. \nHuge queues have formed at banks running out of cash as people fearing further instability rush to withdraw money, reports the BBC's Jonathan Head.\nTesting for Covid-19 has also collapsed because health workers are staying away from hospitals.\nOutside Yangon, protesters were pictured lying down on rail tracks in an attempt to disrupt services. According to Reuters, train services between Yangon and the southern city of Mawlamyine were blocked as a result. \nThe turnout at recent protests appeared to have grown smaller than at the ones seen last week, which saw tens of thousands of people in attendance, as the military has stepped up its presence. \nWith the reports of violent clashes, residents in several cities are reported to have formed night-watch groups to deter mobs rumoured to have been dispatched by the military to cause unrest."

      "text": "England's vaccination programme is starting to pay off, with the over-80s age group now the most likely to test positive for coronavirus antibodies, Office for National Statistics testing suggests.\nBlood tests reveal more over-80s than any other age group in England are showing signs of some immunity against Covid infection.\nThis comes as Covid deaths have fallen.\nBut overall, deaths are still 40% above the five-year average. \nPeople have antibodies to Covid if they've had an infection in the last few months or if they have been vaccinated. \nPreviously, younger age groups who were more likely to be exposed to the virus were the most likely to test positive for antibodies.\nIn England, 41% of over-80s tested positive for antibodies, which the ONS said was \"most likely due to the high vaccination rate in this group\". \nTwo weeks ago that figure was 26%.\nIt takes two to three weeks for immunity to build after vaccination.\nThe next most likely to have antibodies against Covid in England were people aged 16-24 years - 26% of this age group had them, due to infection rather than vaccination. \nThis percentage has only increased a small amount in the past fortnight.\nIn the other three UK nations, which have jabbed a smaller proportion of their older people, antibody detection remained highest in younger groups. \nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have not published data for week-on-week comparisons.\nFalls in deaths are likely due to lockdown, but rising antibody levels offer hope of even better news to come. \nThese figures cover deaths registered in the first week of February, probably reflecting infections early in January. \nBack then, far fewer people had been vaccinated and, since it takes few weeks for the jab to yield antibodies, even fewer had been vaccinated early enough to get protection from Covid-19. \nSo lockdown was probably doing the heavy lifting. \nSince the first week of February, the news has improved further. Back then, the daily death toll was just under 1,000 a day. Now it's down to around 650. \nAnd there are hints, but only hints, that vaccination is starting to take some of the strain.  \nMore and more people, especially over 80, are showing antibodies - a quarter by the middle of January and 40% by the start of February. \nThat figure will only rise. And some analyses suggest that deaths are falling fastest in older people.  \nEven it's too soon to be sure that's a vaccination effect, it's not too soon to be hopeful that it might be. \nMeanwhile, there were 7,820 Covid deaths registered in the UK in the week to 5 February - a fall of more than a tenth from the previous week (9,010).\nThat puts all deaths for any reason 38% higher than the average for the same week over the past five years. \nThis is the first time there has been a real fall in deaths in the ONS data since the last lockdown, although it refers to a fortnight ago.  The government figures published each day already show significant falls in deaths.\nDeaths involving Covid accounted for 43% of all mortality in England and Wales in the week to 5 February.\nThis means a doctor has judged it to be a factor and written it on a patient's death certificate. \nFor 90% of these deaths, Covid was the main underlying cause.

      "text": "There is to be a large expansion of the number of people being asked to shield in England.\nAn extra 1.7 million people are expected to be added to the 2.3 million already on the list.\nHalf of the group have not yet been vaccinated so will now be prioritised urgently by their local GPs.\nIt comes after a new model was developed that takes into account extra factors rather than just health.\nThis calculation includes things such as ethnicity, deprivation (by postcode) and weight to work out a person's risk of becoming seriously ill if they were to catch Covid.\nIt also looks at age, underlying health issues and prescribed medications.\nProf Andrew Hayward, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which has been involved in the modelling, said it considered a \"combination of factors\" such as age, ethnicity and chronic illness and put them together to reach a score.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that this score could \"more or less order people in the population according to their level of risk\" and \"identify those at the top of that range to say, 'you should be prioritised for vaccine and you have a level of risk that is similar to those on the shielding list'\".\nUntil now, only those with specific conditions or undergoing certain types of treatment have been advised to shield until 31 March.\nThey include adults with Down's Syndrome, organ donor recipients and people with severe respiratory conditions.\nThe new model was developed following work by Oxford University which looked at the characteristics of people who died in the first wave to better understand risk.\nMedical records have been searched to identify high-risk patients, based on their combined risk factors. \nThey are now being sent letters by the NHS informing of them of their new status, which means they are entitled to statutory sick pay, prioritisation for online shopping slots and help collecting medicines.\nSome local authorities with areas of high deprivation will now have a major task in contacting people to check what support they need, according to the BBC's health editor Hugh Pym.\nCllr Neil Nerva, public health lead at Brent Council, in north-west London, told BBC News: \"We've got 17,000 people who are shielding. The news today means that over the next two weeks we're going to be shielding another 12,000 people who are over 70 and another 12,000 who are under 70.\"\nHe added: \"That, I think, shows in very graphic terms the health inequalities which exist in a borough like Brent.\"\nHave you been added to the shielding list? You can get in touch with us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nOf the 1.7 million people newly added to the list, around 900,000 have already received an offer of a vaccination because they were over 70.\nThe remainder are all thought to fall into one of the priority groups for vaccination that are being invited for vaccination next.\nThey will be bumped up the list first for a jab, the government said.\nIt means they will receive the offer a few weeks later than if they had been in the shielding group originally.\nShielding was re-introduced in tier four areas from mid-December, before being expanded nationally once the third lockdown was announced in early January.\nUnlike in the first lockdown, people who are shielding are being advised they can leave their homes for exercise.\nGovernment guidelines strongly advise clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home at all times, apart from going out to exercise or to attend a medical appointment.  \nThey should also try to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people within their household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate.\nPeople on the list are still advised to shield even if they have had two doses of the vaccine.\nHigh risk categories include: \nThe list does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to do social distancing.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: \"All of these people who are identified for the first time, are those who have not had an individual clinical condition that we've previously been able to identify through the clinically extremely vulnerable group, but they are people who have multiple personal risk factors and underlying health conditions which move them into a higher risk group.\"\nShe said adding people to the shielding list ensured \"those most vulnerable to Covid can benefit from both the protection that vaccines provide and from enhanced advice and support should they choose it\".\nThe approach was \"risk averse\" to \"protect as many people as possible\", she added.\nPhillip Anderson, of the MS Society, said some people with multiple sclerosis were being added to the shielding list.\nHe said it would come as a \"huge shock\" to people who would potentially have to make \"drastic changes\" to their lives.\nThe Westminster government said the model had been shared with the other nations of the UK, who would decide individually how to use it.\nThere are no current plans to formally expand the shielding list in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the same way as in England.\nThe Welsh government said the same computer model had already been used to add those with chronic kidney disease and adults with Down's Syndrome to its list of those who are extremely clinically vulnerable.\nIn Northern Ireland, GPs and hospital doctors can add individual patients to the shielding list if they are assessed as extremely vulnerable based on a range of factors.

It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October.\nA further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded.

      "text": "More than half a billion pounds could be needed to ensure the safety of 2,000 old coal tips in Wales over the next 10 years, the chancellor has been warned.\nIt follows calls for urgent action, following a 60,000 tonne landslide earlier this year in Rhondda. \nGeologists said Wales was more prone to these incidents and climate change \"may make that worse\".\nUK officials said they were working with the Welsh Government on flood relief, including funding for tips.\nThe incident above the village of Tylorstown followed heavy rain caused by Storm Dennis in February, which led to widespread flooding across areas including Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nOne historian said the landslide had evoked \"visceral\" emotions linked to the Aberfan disaster of 1966, which claimed the lives of 116 children and 28 adults.\nA letter from Chris Bryant MP and Labour colleagues to Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed unpublished details from a review led by the Welsh Government, with the co-operation of the Coal Authority, councils and Natural Resources Wales.\nThe review is compiling a list of all sites in Wales and their risk status. \nIn October, the UK government provided \u00a32.5m to help clean up and secure the Tylorstown site. \nThe Welsh Government said the cost of clear-ups and making Wales' coal tips safe was \"significantly more\".\nRepair work in Rhondda Cynon Taf is estimated at \u00a382.5m in total. \nMr Bryant and fellow Welsh Labour MPs Beth Winter, Chris Elmore and Alex Davies-Jones said it would be \"unfair\" for the \"poorest communities in the UK to bear the full costs of this work\".\nThey fear another Tylorstown-like incident if the framework for funding the work is not done soon.\nThe letter also calls for the UK government to provide financial assistance to Rhondda Cynon Taf for urgent repair work to bridges, roads and culverts following Storm Dennis.\nThe UK government has previously said it is up to the Welsh Government to remediate the coal tips and \"get on\" with flood defence work. \nBut in a new statement, officials added: \"Ever since parts of Wales were hit by devastating flooding earlier this year, the UK government has been working with the Welsh Government and local authorities to provide extra support for flood relief and protection to the communities which were so badly affected. \n\"Responsibility for flood defences and flood management is devolved but, while all claims need to meet certain criteria, we expect to provide funding from the UK reserve for 2020-21.\"\nIt added: \"This would include funds for coal tip repairs which we know are of particular concern to communities.\"\nThe Labour Member of the Senedd for Pontypridd, Mick Antoniw, said clearing coal tips \"goes way beyond any responsibilities of the Welsh Government\".\n\"The film of the coal sliding down brought back many, many traumatic memories for the population of Wales.\n\"And I think the wake-up call for us all is that the risk may be a bit greater than we thought it was, particularly if we're going to have more adverse weather like this.\"\nBen Curtis, a historian of the south Wales coalfields at Wolverhampton University, said incidents like the one at Tylorstown had a powerful impact.\n\"I visited the Tylorstown tip in the aftermath.\n\"Just struck by the scale of the landslip. It's really quite awe inspiring and not in a good way.\n\"These register so prominently with people because on a visceral level people in the valleys see a tip slide, and you think about the Aberfan disaster of course.\"\nAshley Patton, from the British Geological Survey, said the conditions in Wales made it more prone to these types of landslips. \n\"In south Wales we have the added pressure of a lot of coal waste sitting on top of those slopes which is unconsolidated material and can easily slip. Climate change may only make that worse.\n\"With increased storms like the ones we saw at the beginning of this year, landslides, which is what you'd expect with climate change, is going to be a real problem.\"\nThe Welsh Government said the safe management of coal tips \"remains a priority\".\n\"While we welcome recent announcements by UK government, along with their recognition that the longer-term costs will be significant, no further funds have been forthcoming, and we continue to press them for the full amount of funding needed, as promised by the prime minister,\" said a spokesman."

The rules were extended to March in anticipation of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut the Resolution Foundation also wants the government to offer loans to tenants to ease a \"rent-arrears crisis\" it expects to worsen in the months ahead.\nMeera Chindooroy, from the National Residential Landlords Association, said loans would help tackle the rent debts owed to property owners.\n\"Simply banning repossessions is doing nothing to address this underlying problem which renters and landlords are struggling to cope with,\" she said.\nA government spokeswoman said: \"Robust protections put in place by the government remain - with the vast majority of renters still subject to six months' notice periods, while the ban on bailiff evictions in all but the most serious circumstances will stay in place until at least 31 March.\""

A small number of children, including those whose parents have key worker status, are allowed to attend.\nAt her daily Covid-19 briefing on Monday, Ms Sturgeon said she was \"very, very, very keen to go ahead\" with plans for a phased return to the classroom.\nHowever, she said only between 5% and 8% of any school's roll should return.\nIt had previously been indicated that children in P1 to P3 years and a limited number of secondary pupils who need practical resources to complete qualifications would return to schools from next Monday.\nMinisters will take a final decision about this, based on the latest data, at a meeting of the Scottish government's cabinet on Tuesday morning.\nThey will also consider an \"indicative timetable\" for other pupils returning.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that it was unlikely that other lockdown restrictions would start to be eased, with schools the top priority.\nShe said: \"What is really important is that that's not seen as a trigger for people who are currently able to work from home to go back to work, or parents deciding to meet up with each other more.\n\"What was often the risk factor around schools is not transmission inside schools, its all the activity that takes place around schools.\"\nThe first minister also said there would be \"trade-offs\" over the coming months as the country eases out of lockdown, with schools and care home visiting \"the kind of things we focus on first as we try to get things back to normal\".\nMSPs will have the chance to question Ms Sturgeon following the statement, with opposition leaders pressing for more details on the government's future plans.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was understandable that there were not \"specific dates set in stone\" for easing restrictions, but said it was important ministers provided more of a \"route map\" out of lockdown.\nHe said: \"We need to know the triggers that will be in place for all school pupils to go back, for businesses to reopen - will we have a tiered approach or a national approach?\n\"These are the crucial points that businesses really need to be aware of so we can see our way out of this crisis.\"\nScottish Green MSP Ross Greer said there was \"no point in setting dates\" for lifting lockdown due to uncertainty about vaccine supplies and new variants.\nHe said: \"What the government can do is list the policies they want to bring in, the safety measures they want to bring in, and as those measures come in it can be easier for us to ease some restrictions and return back to normal.\"\nScottish Labour, meanwhile, has called for supply teachers to be given a greater role in delivering online learning, saying they had been \"forgotten\" in Education Secretary John Swinney's latest plans.\nEducation spokesman Iain Gray said: \"Many supply teachers face financial hardship and are unable to rely on furlough funds - this is unacceptable.

      "text": "Hospital admissions of nine to 12-year-olds because of self-injury across the UK are averaging 10 a week, according to data analysed by a BBC File on 4 investigation.\nThe rate has doubled in six years, the latest annual figures indicate.\nOne leading expert says the rise is \"concerning\", and that self-harm \"seems to be spreading down the age range\".\nHealth departments from the UK's four nations say they are committed to children's mental wellbeing. \nAs a result of the BBC's investigation, the National Association of Headteachers and the Royal Colleges of Emergency Medicine and GPs are backing calls for primary school teachers to be given training to help spot the signs of pupils who may be hurting themselves.\nEighteen-year-old Sarah (not her real name) told File on 4 she first started cutting herself when she was 11.\n\"One of my closest friends introduced me to the concept because they were going through a very tough time personally, told me about it, and I was suffering with bullying and home issues.\"\nShe says she remembers sitting in her bedroom \"in tears, going at my left arm till it started to bleed\u2026 but then it was the immediate guilt and like, oh, what do I do? How do I hide it from my parents?\"\nSarah's self-harm wasn't spotted until more than a year later when a teacher noticed scars on her arm. \"I got referred to CAMHS [Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services] and there was a long wait, which is quite typical, and then I spiralled.\n\"And the moment I saw CAMHS for the first time, I got discharged because I wasn't severe enough at the time,\" she says.\nAll the people we spoke to for our investigation said CAMHS are under pressure because of growing demand.\nSarah tried to kill herself on two occasions before a combination of cognitive behavioural therapy, art therapy, dog therapy, and music therapy helped her gradually reduce her self-harm.\nLast spring, an online peer-support course called Alumina led to her stopping completely and she has not hurt herself for eight months.\nThe term \"self-harm\" when used by doctors includes:\nParents trying to support children who self-harm can be left with difficult dilemmas.\nFile on 4 heard from Louise (not her real name), the mother of a 17-year-old who started self-harming when she was 11. Louise said she gives her daughter clean blades with which to cut herself to minimise the risk of infection.\nShe says her daughter would otherwise have used \"anything she could have got her hands on\".\n\"I have in her room a whole array of first aid equipment,\" Louise says, \"from Steri-strips to alcoholic-based wipes, to bandages and dressings. They're all there for her, available. And I always have clean blades available for her.\"\nLouise, who works as a specialist nurse in her local hospital's A&E department, accepts that it's a \"hugely controversial\" thing to do and has had to defend her approach with friends and with other parents of children who self-harm.\nShe says it is \"not something any mum wants to do\", but that if her daughter is going to injure herself, then she wants it to be \"in the cleanest way possible\". Her daughter has now gone five months without self-harming.\nIn 2019-20, before the coronavirus pandemic, there were 16 hospital admissions per 100,000 nine to 12-year-olds, up from eight in 2013-14. Self-injury admissions for girls in this age group were twice as high as for boys.  \nThere has also been an increase in the rate of admissions for 13 to 17-year-olds, doubling in seven years, the data collated from NHS Digital, ONS and health departments of NI, Wales and Scotland showed.\nProf Keith Hawton, one of the UK's leading experts on self-harm, with more than 40 years' experience, said while there are limitations to admissions data, the File on 4 analysis was backed up by his research and the problem is \"spreading down the age range\".\n\"We don't know precisely why this is,\" he said. \"Social media can be a very important source of support for individuals, particularly young people. But we do also know that self-harm is often discussed in social media - images of self-harm are quite common and may lead to contagion.\n\"It can also lead to what we call a normalisation of self-harm so that it may become a more accepted way of dealing with problems.\n\"We also know that there's been an increase in mental health problems in young people and there's been a particular increase in anxiety disorders, particularly in females, and also eating disorders, which are quite closely associated with self-harm, including self-injury.\"\nYou can find more information and support via the BBC Action Line website.\nSurviving Self-Harm is on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 16 February at 20:00 GMT and afterwards on BBC Sounds."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nadhim Zahawi,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A combination of rapid testing and the Covid vaccination programme will help entertainment venues to reopen in England, the vaccines minister says.\nNadhim Zahawi said it was those measures which would get \"our economy back on its feet\".\nHis comments come after the PM said \"rapid\" lateral flow tests could be used by \"those parts of the economy we couldn't get open last year\".\nIndustry bosses have queried whether using rapid tests would be practical. \nSome venues such as nightclubs have been unable to open since March 2020, while others like theatres and cinemas have struggled to make social distancing work.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Zahawi said: \"It's a combination of rapid testing as well as a national vaccination programme that will get our economy back on its feet and venues open again.\"\nHe said that the government favoured testing over vaccine passports as a means to reopening the economy, since it was not yet clear whether a vaccinated individual could still transmit the virus.\nMr Zahawi described preliminary evidence on the effect of vaccines on coronavirus transmission as \"really encouraging\", but said the full data might not be available for weeks.\n\"We have a couple of very large-scale studies related to giving us better data on the vaccines,\" he said. \"We should be able to see really good data in the next few weeks from those studies.\"\nHe added that the government would be \"data driven, rather than date driven\" when it comes to relaxing lockdown measures. \nBoris Johnson is due to set out a road map on 22 February for easing the lockdown in England.\nAt Monday's Downing Street briefing, the prime minister said lateral flow tests, along with vaccination, would \"probably be the route forward\" to reopening the economy.\nLateral flow tests give a result in 20-30 minutes - unlike the more expensive PCR tests used by NHS Test and Trace which need to be taken to a lab to be processed.\nThe UK Cinema Association said asking all customers to have a rapid test and then to wait 30 minutes for a result would be \"impractical\" and in many instances add a \"50% uplift on their cinema ticket\".\nIts chief executive, Phil Clapp, said he was not aware of any of its members considering rapid testing or vaccine passports \"as a viable way forward for the return to cinema\".\nHe added that he believed cinemas offered a \"materially different environment than nightclubs or music venues\".\nKate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade association UKHospitality, said the organisation would be \"keen to understand\" the government's plans for mass lateral flow testing in the community and workplaces.\nShe also said the industry body stood ready to work with ministers on \"a risk-assessed approach to be applied on a voluntary basis where proportionate, pragmatic and necessary\".\nMichael Kill, the boss of the Night Time Industries Association, welcomed the PM's comments, saying: \"Finally we have some acknowledgement from the prime minister and government on the existence of late-night economy businesses, including nightclubs, theatres, casinos and late bars, particularly as they are some of the hardest hit since the start of the pandemic.\"\nHowever, he told the BBC that administering rapid tests would not be straightforward.\nHe said professionals would be required to administer swab tests outside the venue, which would force venues to stagger admissions and have procedures in place to deal with positive cases and those who they came into contact with.\nSacha Lord, who co-founded Manchester's Parklife Festival, said the events sector had been calling for on-site rapid testing for more than five months, and any further delay to implementing such initiatives would do \"irreversible\" damage to the UK's cultural sector. \n\"My fear is that they take another five months to get moving, which the industry simply doesn't have,\" he said.\nThe UK recorded a further 10,625 new infections on Tuesday, down 14% from 12,364 last Tuesday. There were also another 799 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - down 24% from 1,052 last Tuesday. \nMeanwhile, people arriving in England who are required to quarantine in a hotel face an additional \u00a31,200 bill if they test positive for coronavirus, the government has said.This is on top of the \u00a31,750 cost for the entering the quarantine hotel programme and will apply to guests forced to extend their stay beyond the initial 11 nights. \nThe information was published on the government's website on Monday, the day the new rules came into force for arrivals who have been in a high-risk Covid country.\nWest Midlands Police have fined four passengers \u00a310,000 for failing to declare they had travelled from a \"red-list\" country."

      "tags": "Social media,Apps",
      "text": "Controversial social-media app Parler has come back online after more than a month without service. \nThe Twitter-like app was a favourite among supporters of former US President Donald Trump and right-wing conservatives. \nIt was banned from Google and Apple's app stores and Amazon's web-hosting service, after an armed mob broke into the US Capitol building on 6 January.\nBut now, the self-styled free-speech platform says it is \"here to stay\". \nThe app was not available for all users immediately, however.\nAnd users reported their posts from the previous version had vanished from their profiles. \nParler said the plan was to bring the service back online for existing users first, with new users able to sign up in a week's time.\nAnd it was no longer working with a \"big-tech\" provider but was \"built on sustainable, independent technology\". \nDuring its gap in service, the company also sacked vocal chief executive John Matze, replacing him with interim boss Mark Meckler.\n\"We will thrive as the premier social-media platform dedicated to free speech, privacy, and civil dialogue,\" Mr Meckler said.\nAnd the decision of other technology companies to cut ties with Parler had been taken \"by those who desire to silence tens of millions of Americans\". \nWhile users who already have the app downloaded can log in, it is more difficult to install onto phones that did not have it before.\nAndroid users must \"sideload\" the software, meaning it has to be sourced and installed without using Google's Play Store. \nAnd iPhone users trying to reinstall the app or download it for the first time from Apple's App Store are told it is \"not currently available\".\nLate last year, as Twitter banned some Trump supporters and then President Trump himself, Parler soared up the app charts. It had what every fledgling online business seeks, momentum - until it was stopped in its tracks.\nNow it is back, but in a very limited form. It is still unavailable on app stores and with no way yet for new users to sign up. It feels as though its moment has passed - even if its old members do manage to get back online they may find Parler just a little dull. \nThe past - and the evidence of its use to plan the invasion of Congress - has been wiped clean. \nTrue, the Trump acolyte and Fox firebrand Sean Hannity is back, already posting half a dozen Parleys in the first couple of hours. But while he has over five million followers on Twitter, on Parler he's bellowing into a mostly empty space where a few like-minded people nod quietly in agreement. \nWhere's the fun in that?\nThere's probably only one person who could give Parler its mojo back - Donald J Trump. But so far he seems reluctant to show up at a party which feels like it's over.           \nThe app's popularity was in part fuelled by President Trump's supporters, who often claimed \"censorship\" by the largest online platforms. \nThe former president had allegedly been offered a significant stake in the company if he joined, Buzzfeed News reported earlier this month - something rival politicians are now investigating. \nBut he never joined Parler while in power and does not appear to have joined the relaunched version. \nIts main selling point had been light-touch moderation, which it said was to encourage free speech. \nBut Google and Apple banned the app for failing to remove posts they felt had incited violence.\nAnd Amazon pulled its web-hosting service days later for similar reasons.  \nBefore the app was knocked offline, however, hackers said they had managed to access an archive of posts and downloads - more than one million videos and images, including some from the 6 January riots.  \nCarolyn Maloney, who chairs the House oversight committee, has asked the FBI to investigate the role of Parler in the violence at the Capitol.

      "tags": "United Arab Emirates,Mohammed Al Maktoum,Long Reads,Dubai",
      "text": "Dramatic new details have come to light about the extraordinary kidnapping and secretive detention of Princess Latifa.\nIt has been many months since Tiina Jauhiainen last heard from her friend.\nPrincess Latifa, imprisoned in Dubai after attempting a daring escape, had kept in touch with her for some time using a secret phone.\nBut all of a sudden, the contact stopped.\nWhen Tiina last saw Latifa, they had lain on the deck of a yacht gazing at the stars, travelling across the Indian Ocean.\nIt was February 2018, and they had embarked on a risky plan to get Latifa out of Dubai and start a new life abroad.\nThe princess is one of 25 children of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. \nThe sheikh has transformed the emirate into a glittering city, a place people flock to for business, and the playground of the region. But for Emirati women, the laws and customs can make life very restrictive.\n\"I'm not allowed to drive, I'm not allowed to travel or leave Dubai at all,\" Latifa said in a video recorded just before her escape.\n\"I haven't left the country since 2000. I've been asking a lot to just go travelling, to study, to do anything normal. They don't let me. I need to leave.\"\nSitting in Tiina's apartment, Latifa spoke cheerfully of what was to come.\n\"I'm feeling positive about the future. I don't know how I'll feel just waking up in the morning and thinking I can do whatever I want today. I'm really looking forward to that.\"\nThe princess had no access to her passport and was under surveillance, so they had to slip out of Dubai and drive to the coast of Oman. It took hours for them to get out to international waters, riding a dinghy and jet ski. By the evening they reached the yacht which was supposed to carry them to freedom. \nIn a Whatsapp message to a friend, Latifa declared: \"I'm free\".\nThey planned to sail across the Indian Ocean, and then fly to the United States where Latifa could try to claim political asylum.\nBut eight days later, as the coast of India neared, the escape went horribly wrong.\nArmed men boarded the boat. The friends hid in the bathroom until smoke grenades forced them up to the deck. \n\"Latifa was screaming and kicking. She kept saying 'don't take me back to the UAE. Just shoot me here',\" Tiina said. It was the last time she saw her friend.\nIn her later videos, released only now, Latifa gives a vivid account of the storming of the yacht.\n\"I was fighting, and this guy came with a small pouch and he took out the needle and he injected me in my arm.\"\nLatifa says she was then transferred to an Indian military ship.\n\"The commandos carried me through this corridor, and to a big room, and there was in front of me like maybe four or five generals. \n\"I'm repeating to them 'my name's Latifa al Maktoum'.\n\"I don't want to go Dubai, I want to get asylum. I was in international waters, you should let me go.\"\nHer pleas fell on deaf ears, and she says she was then manhandled by an Emirati commando.\n\"He grabs me. Lifts me up. Kicking and fighting, he's much bigger than me. So I see that his sleeve is rolled up and arm exposed. I had one shot. Bit as hard as I can, and shake my head. And he screamed.\"\nShe says she was tranquilised and flown back to Dubai.\n\"I just felt really sad at that point. I felt everything I was working on for so many years to get my freedom was gone. And I've been here ever since, by myself, so solitary confinement.  No access to medical help, no trial, no charge, nothing.\"\nTiina was taken back to the UAE with the yacht's crew, where she was detained for two weeks. Then she began telling the story to the international media. She formed the campaign group Free Latifa and took the princess's case to the United Nations.\nBut as the months passed, she heard nothing from Latifa.\nThen one day in early 2019, while she was visiting family in Finland, she got a message from a stranger.\nFirst she had to answer security questions. Years earlier, Tiina had taught Latifa capoeira, a Brazilian martial art. Now the stranger wanted to know Latifa's capoeira nickname.\nSoon Tiina was able to get a phone to the princess directly.  \n\"When I first heard her voice, I was crying. I couldn't help it. It was very, very emotional.\"\nLatifa was able to start recording video messages. What they reveal is shocking.\nThe princess, now 35, appears in the corner of her bathroom, speaking in a fragile whisper.\n\"I'm doing this video from a bathroom, because this is the only room with a door I can lock. I'm a hostage. I am not free. I'm enslaved in this jail. My life is not in my hands.\"\nPale and puffy, she has spent three years with little access to sunlight.\n\"I am in a villa, and this villa has been converted into jail. All the windows are barred shut. There's five policemen outside and two policewomen inside the house. And I can't even go outside to get any fresh air.\"\nThe villa is just metres from the beach, in a luxury neighbourhood.  \n\"We shouldn't pretend that just because it's a villa, it's fine\", the executive director of Human Rights Watch, Ken Roth, says. \n\"This woman is imprisoned. It's basically solitary confinement except for her jailers. Solitary confinement of that sort is broadly considered to be a form of torture, as it becomes prolonged in the way this has right now.\"\nThe fear is palpable in Latifa's videos. There is a constant urgency and a desperation in her voice.\n\"Every day I am worried about my safety and my life. I don't really know if I'm going to survive this situation. The police threatened me that I'll be in prison my whole life and I'll never see the sun again. So I'm not safe here.\"\nBut despite the risk that she would be caught with the secret phone, she began to calmly and methodically document her extraordinary story.\nWatch Panorama's The Missing Princess on BBC iPlayer\n\"For me it's simple, it's like, am I free or am I not free? So ok, the world is going to know that I'm not free. Anybody who cares is going to know that I'm not free, and I'm not going to go along with their propaganda. That's just how I am.\"\nThe sheikh has said that he considers Latifa's return to Dubai a rescue mission.\nIn December 2018, after Latifa had been missing for nine months, the UAE was facing pressure. The United Nations had requested proof of life - or it would go public with concerns that the princess might have died.\nLatifa received a visit from her stepmother Princess Haya.\nHaya asked her to lunch. \n\"She said to me it would be like a test, to see how you will react around people after being in prison for so long,\" says Latifa in one video. \"And if you act well, you react well, you're going to be out in a few days.\"\nUnbeknown to Latifa, Princess Haya had been spun an elaborate lie, that Latifa had bipolar disorder and was vulnerable to exploitation. To help prove to the UN that all was well with Latifa, Haya called a friend, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson.\nOn 15 December 2018, Mary Robinson flew to Dubai where she says Haya and her officials briefed her about Latifa's supposed \"medical condition\". She agreed to help contact the UN.\nLatifa, meanwhile, was kept in the dark. Over the lunch they discussed the environment, skydiving, and Mary Robinson's upcoming book.\n\"We never discussed me. We never discussed my case,\" Latifa says. She had no idea that Robinson was a former UN Human Rights Commissioner.\nMary Robinson told us that she did not question Latifa about the video or her escape, or ask to meet with her one-on-one.\n\"I didn't know how to address somebody who was bipolar. I really didn't actually want to talk to her and increase the trauma over a nice lunch.\"\nBut Robinson did allow photographs to be taken of Latifa which she agreed to send on to the UN. Robinson says she believed these were private photographs and that she was stunned when the UAE released them to the world nine days later.  \nAfter the lunch Latifa was taken back to her prison villa. \"It was all a set up. It was like they tricked me,\" Latifa says. Nothing changed for the missing princess.\nBut for her stepmother Princess Haya, there was an extraordinary development.\n\"Relatively shortly afterwards,\" recalls Robinson, \"I got a call from Haya, saying 'Mary, I am in London. I have just come to London with my two children. I have come in the clothes we were in because I am so fearful. We were wrong. I have found out a lot.'\"\nHaya later said that the sheikh did not welcome her interest in Latifa and that he became progressively more hostile to her. By April 2019, she says that she believed her position in Dubai was unsafe. On 15 April, she fled to the UK.\nNow confronted with the escape of one of his wives as well as two more children, the Sheikh began a High Court battle to have the children returned to Dubai. But he got more than he bargained for.\nIn March 2020, a High Court judgement revealed further details about his treatment of his adult daughters. Eighteen years earlier, a second daughter, Shamsa, had been abducted in the UK and returned to Dubai, where she has been captive ever since. The judgement laid out the full story, for the first time, of how the sheikh's agents had tracked her down in Cambridge, and flown her back.\nThe judge also found that Haya had been intimidated and Latifa had been abducted and imprisoned - and that the sheikh had not been honest and open with the court.\nFor Tiina, this was a breakthrough. \"I thought that would have been something that could have quickly led to her release.\"\nBut once again, little changed for Latifa in her prison in Dubai.\n\"It's almost like, what do we need to get her free? It's sad. It's very very sad,\" says Tiina.\nAlone in her villa in Dubai, Latifa followed the case and maintained daily contact with her friend, along with her UK-based maternal cousin Marcus and Free Latifa co-founder David Haigh.  What had begun as concise, factual video recordings evidencing her situation had turned into lengthy text chats.\n\"The phone meant a lot, it was a lifeline,\" says Marcus.\nLatifa was now in her third year of imprisonment and solitary confinement.\n\"Every day was a struggle for her, and you could hear that in her voice. I know she was tired, I know her health was not the best,\" says Marcus.\nBut then one day, the contact stopped just as dramatically as it had begun.\nNow, many months later, Tiina, David and Marcus have taken the decision to release some of Latifa's videos in the hope they will help pressure the sheikh to release her.\n\"We haven't taken this decision lightly, there's been some sleepless nights thinking about this\", Tiina says.\n\"But it's time to do something. I feel that she would want us to fight for her, and not give up.\nThe governments of Dubai and the UAE have said that Latifa is safe in the loving care of her family.\nTiina is consumed by fear for her friend.\n\"Initially, I thought maybe she had problems with her phone. I was hoping she would reappear. I didn't want to believe it,\" says Tiina. \nBut then it dawned on her that Latifa was not coming back. \n\"We are extremely worried about her well-being,\" she says. \"If we assume that she was caught with the phone, her conditions now are probably a lot worse.\""

      "tags": "South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scientists have identified another new variant of coronavirus in the UK with some potentially troubling mutations. \nB.1.525 appears similar to the South African variant which prompted door-to-door tests in areas where it has been found. \nResearchers from Edinburgh University have found 38 cases so far - 2 in Wales and 36 in England - in samples dating back to December. \nIt has been seen in other countries, including Denmark, Nigeria and the US. \nUK experts are studying it to understand what risk it poses. \nIt is too soon to say if it should be added to the UK's list of \"variants of concern\" and whether mass testing for it should happen. So, for now, it is a \"variant under investigation\".\nProf Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, is one of the scientists advising the government on new and emerging virus threats. \nHe said B.1.525 appeared to have \"significant mutations\" already seen in some of the other new variants. \n\"That is partly reassuring because we can predict what their likely effect is.\"\nProf Yvonne Doyle from Public Health England (PHE) said: \"PHE is monitoring data about emerging variants very closely and where necessary public health interventions are being undertaken, such as extra testing and enhanced contact tracing.\n\"There is currently no evidence that this set of mutations causes more severe illness or increased transmissibility.\"\nOne of these changes B.1.525 has is a mutation called E484K - also found in the Brazil and South African variants - that may help the virus evade some of the body's immune system defences.\nOther alterations make it similar to the UK 'Kent' variant that experts say is more contagious than the original version of coronavirus that started the pandemic. \nThe concern is that the virus is changing in ways that could let it easily spread and escape from the vaccines that we already have to fight Covid. \nCurrent ones were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work against the new variants being seen now, although perhaps not quite as well.\nProf Gupta and colleagues have been running tests in the lab and say mutations like E484K do represent a threat to vaccines. \nScientists are already working on new vaccines that are a better match for new variants, in case they are needed ahead of next winter.  \nProf Andrew Hayward, an expert in epidemiology at University College London, said: \"Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be spreading any faster than other strains and it's still at very, very low levels. \n\"With all of these variants, we really need to be keeping a very close eye on them because we don't know what they will do.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The youngest pupils are to return to Scotland's classrooms for face-to-face teaching from next week.\nThe move will see all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school returning from Monday 22 February.\nOther age groups will continue to learn from home, apart from some secondary pupils who need to complete coursework.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was unlikely that any other pupils would return to school before 15 March at the earliest.\nAll other existing lockdown measures will all remain in place until at least the end of this month, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the country remains in a precarious position. \nThe EIS teaching union said it still had significant concerns over school safety which had not yet been addressed, and a blended learning model - with around half of pupils in classes at any one time - would have more appropriate. \nThe union's general secretary, Larry Flanagan, said: \"Everyone is supportive of face-to-face teaching returning as soon as possible - that should not override safety concerns, however, and teachers will be understandably nervous around today's announcement.\"\nThe Scottish government will draw up a \"revised strategic framework\" - to be published next week - to set out how Scotland can exit lockdown and what conditions will need to be met before restrictions can be eased.\nWill your child be returning to school on Monday?  Share your stories. \nMs Sturgeon said it was unlikely that hotels and holiday accommodation would be open again in time for people to book any sort of Easter break, but \"staycations\" may be possible by summer.\nIn an update at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said she had \"more reason to be hopeful now than we did a few weeks ago\" that the race against the virus could be won, with the vaccination programme picking up pace while lockdown contains the spread of new cases.\nShe said she was \"very hopeful that vaccination will start to have a significant impact in reducing the number of people who die from Covid\", saying there was already evidence of this in care homes.\nHowever, the first minister warned that \"our situation is still very fragile\", saying: \"Even a slight easing of restrictions could cause cases to start rising rapidly again\".\nWhile she said it would continue to be \"extremely cautious\", the government is focused on a \"gradual, phased return to as much normality as possible\".\nThis is to begin with schools, with the youngest pupils to return to classrooms as soon as next week.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said there would be trade-offs, adding: \"We are choosing to use the very limited headroom we have right now to get at least some children back to school - because children's education and wellbeing is such a priority.\n\"But being able to get children back to education may mean the rest of us living with some other restrictions for longer.\"\nCareful, cautious, gradual are the watchwords for the easing of lockdown in Scotland.\nThat is to say we're not going to get back the everyday freedoms we once took for granted, quickly.\nThe stay at home instruction will remain in place into March, possibly longer, with the anniversary of the first lockdown drawing nearer.\nA further reopening of schools is a priority but will not happen before 15 March. \nEaster holidays are unlikely to be allowed at home or abroad. The same will probably apply to overseas holidays this summer.\nWhy all this caution when the vaccination programme is now progressing at pace?\nBecause, at this stage, ministers remain nervous that opening up too quickly could mean losing control of the virus again in the wider population.\nThey are desperate to avoid a third lockdown later in the year. \nA return to local protection levels should form part of the exit plan to be announced next week.\nBut expect the restrictions associated with each level to be tighter than before, given this system was overwhelmed as autumn turned to winter last year.\nThe first pupils to return to schools will be those in preschools, those in P1, P2 and P3, and \"a limited number of senior phase students who need access to school for essential practical work\".\nMinisters hope to set out second phase of schools reopening in two weeks time, but Ms Sturgeon said there was \"unlikely to be any further return to school before 15 March\" so that the impact of the initial changes can be assessed.\nShe said at-home testing sets would be provided to senior phase pupils, teachers and school staff once they do return, and that secondary pupils would have to maintain a 2m distance in school buildings.\nPlans for the \"gradual\" easing of the strict stay at home lockdown are set to include a return to a regional levels system.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"caution will be necessary\", and that she would be clear about what will not be possible in the immediate future - including holidays.\nShe said: \"We are likely to advise against booking Easter holidays, either overseas or within Scotland, as it is highly unlikely that we will have been able to fully open hotels of self-catering accommodation by then.\n\"However, for the summer, while it is still highly unlikely that overseas holidays will be possible or advisable, staycations might be - but this will depend on the data nearer the time.\"\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said it was \"very welcome news\" that schools could start opening again safely.\nHowever she said that \"to get us even closer to normality, we need to get all key workers vaccinated as early as we can\", saying government plans were \"short on detail\".\nAnd she urged the Scottish government to publish its plans for helping pupils to catch-up with the schooling they have missed, which she said should be built around a tutoring service to stop the attainment gap growing. \nScottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie also challenged Ms Sturgeon over the vaccine rollout, urging the first minister to commit to more ambitious targets for completing priority groups."

Don't you love the sound of that?\" Robinson asked. \"Worryingly, Susie and Rachel are not only very smart but younger, prettier and thinner than me.\n\"Sadly, there's no time for another facelift so I'll have to make do with this old one,\" she joked in response to previous speculation over her plastic surgery. \n\"I am a crossword nut so the Countdown's conundrums I can make sense of. But the adding up and taking away - I can't go much further than working out the fee once my agent takes his cut.\n\"I'm slightly scared of those brains but I think the three of us will transform things, it will be Countdown goes chic, won't it?\"\nIn response to the news, Dent posted congratulations on Twitter.\nRobinson cemented her presence on TV screens by fronting BBC shows Watchdog and Points Of View during the 1980s, 90s and 00s.\nBut she became perhaps most famous for her put-downs to contestants on The Weakest Link, which she hosted from 2000 until 2012. \nThis included the catchphrase \"You are the weakest link, goodbye\" said to each contestant as they were voted off after each round.\nDiscussing the iconic saying, Robinson told Steph's Packed Lunch she is planning to \"tone down my nastiness\".\n\"The catchphrase just came about on the pilot when I got really cheesed off with a contestant and I added the goodbye,\" she told host Steph McGovern.\n\"These things are best developed just as they happen.\"\nRobinson appeared in Countdown's Dictionary Corner for a week in 1987, when the show was led by the late Richard Whiteley.\nShe recalled: \"I was so in awe of the great Richard Whiteley. I think I only said 'Good afternoon' and 'Goodbye'. Who thought I'd have the chance to follow in his giant footsteps?\"\nJo Street, head of daytime at Channel 4, said: \"I am a huge fan of Anne and her quick wit. I am immensely proud that this ferociously smart woman will be joining the show as host alongside the brilliant Rachel Riley and Susie Dent.\"\nCountdown executive producer Peter Gwyn said viewers will \"relish Anne's unique style at the helm of this much-loved institution.\"\nCountdown was the first programme to be broadcast on Channel 4 and has been on air since its launch in November 1982, making it one of the longest-running quiz shows in the world.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Scientists have identified another new variant of coronavirus in the UK with some potentially troubling mutations. \nB.1.525 appears similar to the South African variant which prompted door-to-door tests in areas where it has been found. \nResearchers from Edinburgh University have found 38 cases so far - 2 in Wales and 36 in England - in samples dating back to December. \nIt has been seen in other countries, including Denmark, Nigeria and the US. \nUK experts are studying it to understand what risk it poses. \nIt is too soon to say if it should be added to the UK's list of \"variants of concern\" and whether mass testing for it should happen. So, for now, it is a \"variant under investigation\".\nProf Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, is one of the scientists advising the government on new and emerging virus threats. \nHe said B.1.525 appeared to have \"significant mutations\" already seen in some of the other new variants. \n\"That is partly reassuring because we can predict what their likely effect is.\"\nProf Yvonne Doyle from Public Health England (PHE) said: \"PHE is monitoring data about emerging variants very closely and where necessary public health interventions are being undertaken, such as extra testing and enhanced contact tracing.\n\"There is currently no evidence that this set of mutations causes more severe illness or increased transmissibility.\"\nOne of these changes B.1.525 has is a mutation called E484K - also found in the Brazil and South African variants - that may help the virus evade some of the body's immune system defences.\nOther alterations make it similar to the UK 'Kent' variant that experts say is more contagious than the original version of coronavirus that started the pandemic. \nThe concern is that the virus is changing in ways that could let it easily spread and escape from the vaccines that we already have to fight Covid. \nCurrent ones were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work against the new variants being seen now, although perhaps not quite as well.\nProf Gupta and colleagues have been running tests in the lab and say mutations like E484K do represent a threat to vaccines. \nScientists are already working on new vaccines that are a better match for new variants, in case they are needed ahead of next winter.  \nProf Andrew Hayward, an expert in epidemiology at University College London, said: \"Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be spreading any faster than other strains and it's still at very, very low levels. \n\"With all of these variants, we really need to be keeping a very close eye on them because we don't know what they will do.\""

      "text": "England's vaccination programme is starting to pay off, with the over-80s age group now the most likely to test positive for coronavirus antibodies, Office for National Statistics testing suggests.\nBlood tests reveal more over-80s than any other age group in England are showing signs of some immunity against Covid infection.\nThis comes as Covid deaths have fallen.\nBut overall, deaths are still 40% above the five-year average. \nPeople have antibodies to Covid if they've had an infection in the last few months or if they have been vaccinated. \nPreviously, younger age groups who were more likely to be exposed to the virus were the most likely to test positive for antibodies.\nIn England, 41% of over-80s tested positive for antibodies, which the ONS said was \"most likely due to the high vaccination rate in this group\". \nTwo weeks ago that figure was 26%.\nIt takes two to three weeks for immunity to build after vaccination.\nThe next most likely to have antibodies against Covid in England were people aged 16-24 years - 26% of this age group had them, due to infection rather than vaccination. \nThis percentage has only increased a small amount in the past fortnight.\nIn the other three UK nations, which have jabbed a smaller proportion of their older people, antibody detection remained highest in younger groups. \nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have not published data for week-on-week comparisons.\nFalls in deaths are likely due to lockdown, but rising antibody levels offer hope of even better news to come. \nThese figures cover deaths registered in the first week of February, probably reflecting infections early in January. \nBack then, far fewer people had been vaccinated and, since it takes few weeks for the jab to yield antibodies, even fewer had been vaccinated early enough to get protection from Covid-19. \nSo lockdown was probably doing the heavy lifting. \nSince the first week of February, the news has improved further. Back then, the daily death toll was just under 1,000 a day. Now it's down to around 650. \nAnd there are hints, but only hints, that vaccination is starting to take some of the strain.  \nMore and more people, especially over 80, are showing antibodies - a quarter by the middle of January and 40% by the start of February. \nThat figure will only rise. And some analyses suggest that deaths are falling fastest in older people.  \nEven it's too soon to be sure that's a vaccination effect, it's not too soon to be hopeful that it might be. \nMeanwhile, there were 7,820 Covid deaths registered in the UK in the week to 5 February - a fall of more than a tenth from the previous week (9,010).\nThat puts all deaths for any reason 38% higher than the average for the same week over the past five years. \nThis is the first time there has been a real fall in deaths in the ONS data since the last lockdown, although it refers to a fortnight ago.  The government figures published each day already show significant falls in deaths.\nDeaths involving Covid accounted for 43% of all mortality in England and Wales in the week to 5 February.\nThis means a doctor has judged it to be a factor and written it on a patient's death certificate. \nFor 90% of these deaths, Covid was the main underlying cause.

      "text": "A winter storm in the US has brought deadly freezing winds, ice and snow to many regions that rarely see such frigid conditions.\nIn Texas, a surge in demand for electricity has led to widespread power cuts. The state is bracing for another icy storm later on Tuesday.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) said more than 150 million Americans were now under winter storm warnings.\nAt least 21 deaths have been blamed on the widespread storm.\nDeaths have been reported in Tennessee, Texas, Kentucky and Louisiana.\nIn North Carolina, a tornado spawned by the same storm left three dead and 10 injured early on Tuesday morning. Officials there say rescues are ongoing.\nOn Tuesday, the National Weather Service reported that over 73% of the US is currently covered by snow.\nThe freezing storm has even reached northern and central parts of Mexico where millions of people have experienced a second day of intermittent power cuts.\nMexico's electricity operator has introduced rotating blackouts in at least 12 states, including around the capital, Mexico City. Frozen pipelines have also disrupted the supply of natural gas from the US.\nUS President Joe Biden has approved  a state of emergency in Texas, which has seen some of its coldest temperatures in more than 30 years - some areas hit 0F (-18C) on Sunday. \nThe high demand for electricity in the state has caused the power grid to fail. Rolling blackouts have been imposed in some areas to conserve power for hospitals, police and fire stations, leaving over 4.3 million people without electricity.\nThe crisis was worsened when nearly half the state's wind power generation was knocked out by the storm on Sunday. Wind power is the state's second-largest source of electricity.\nIcy roads have also led to a spate of traffic accidents and people have been advised to avoid travel where possible. \nIn Houston, nearly 120 road crashes were reported on Sunday alone. A pile-up on a major highway near Oklahoma City during a snowstorm on Sunday left several lorries on fire.\nThe George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston and the city's Hobby Airport were both closed until at least Tuesday afternoon.\nThe Texas state legislature closed down on Tuesday due to the storm. House Speaker Dade Phelan told lawmakers to stay away from the Austin statehouse because the \"extreme winter weather Texans experienced this week caused the lights to go off across the Lone Star State\".\nTexas Governor Gregg Abbott has urged \"all Texans to remain vigilant against the extremely harsh weather\".\nHomes in Texas are not normally insulated for cold weather, meaning that indoor temperatures in homes quickly dropped to freezing after heat systems failed. Frozen pipes also burst, despite attempts by some homeowners to insulate them from the cold using blankets.\nIn Houston, authorities say two family members died from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning after they ran their car in an enclosed garage to keep warm. \nIn Fort Worth, members of another family were taken to hospital in a critical condition for suspected carbon monoxide poisoning.\nAn official in the city of Galveston said they had requested a refrigerated morgue lorry to deal with an expected influx of people who may die due to the cold.\nThe Houston Chronicle was unable to print its daily newspaper due to power cuts. In a note to readers, the paper said that it had still been able to print an edition in 2017 during Hurricane Harvey, which left 75 dead.\nThe city of Abilene, home to about 125,000 residents, shut off water services after all of the city's treatment plants lost power.\nA medical facility in Houston, where over 8,000 coronavirus vaccine doses were being kept, lost power forcing officials to send the doses to other facilities before they spoiled.\nTemperatures in the city of Dallas have been colder than in Anchorage, Alaska, CBS News reported.\nThe NWS said unusual meteorological conditions had allowed an \"Arctic outbreak\" that originated just above the US-Canada border to spill out into and across the US.\nA native Texan and his family of four spent the night under every blanket they own\nChuck Hairston, who lives in a suburb of Fort Worth, had been without electricity for about 31 hours when he spoke to BBC News on Tuesday.\nThe 48-year-old Texas native says he has seen some days get nearly this cold, but never before accompanied by such snowy weather.\nHis fireplace, which runs on gas, has continued working through the storm but the electric fan that distributes the heat through the house is out. So on Monday night, Mr Hairston, his wife, two children and two dogs slept beside the fireplace, covered in \"every blanket and pillow we could find in the house\".\nHe says that if power has not been restored by Tuesday night, he and his family may evacuate to a temporary warming shelter. He's already tried the local hotels, which are either fully booked or do not have electricity.\n\"I have not seen any indication that the state's leadership is doing much of anything about this,\" he says. \"I think everybody has sort of thrown up their hands and said 'wait until it gets warmer'.\"\nMillions of Americans still remain under some form of winter storm warning, with record low temperatures still to come.\n\"Hundreds of daily low maximum and minimum temperatures have been/will be broken during this prolonged 'polar plunge',\" the agency said.\nIn Louisiana, some local authorities have imposed curfews to keep people off the icy roads. The state is also suffering power cuts and traffic disruption.\nOregon, which was hit by an ice storm, saw nearly 250,000 people and businesses without power on Tuesday.\nThe governor of Illinois issued a state of emergency on Tuesday after snow blanketed the state.\nMore snow, coupled with freezing rain, is forecast for the southern US on Tuesday. Weather officials say that as the storm departs, frigid low temperatures will be seen across the central and eastern US."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is to announce whether some pupils will start to return to Scottish classrooms from next week in a statement at Holyrood. \nThis could include children aged four to seven and secondary pupils required to carry out practical assignments.\nThe first minister has said she was \"very keen\" to begin the phased return of younger pupils to schools.\nHowever, she warned this would not mark the start of a broader easing of the Covid-19 restrictions.\nThe devolved nations have the powers to set their own coronavirus rules, and while they have made similar decisions during the crisis, they have moved at different speeds.\nIn England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to set out a roadmap on 22 February for easing lockdown there - including the date schools can reopen to all pupils.\nHe warned on Monday people must be \"optimistic but patient\" about the end of national restrictions, and that now was not the time to \"relax\".\nPrimary schools in Wales begin the process of reopening next Monday, while in Northern Ireland, schools remain closed to most pupils until at least 8 March.\nIn Scotland, ministers will examine the latest data and scientific advice on Tuesday morning, before their decision is announced to MSPs in the afternoon.\nOpposition parties have called for the Scottish government to set out more detail about its approach to eventually easing restrictions and lifting lockdown.\nMost school pupils have been learning remotely during 2021 as part of Scotland's \"stay at home\" lockdown. A small number of children, including those whose parents have key worker status, are allowed to attend.\nAt her daily Covid-19 briefing on Monday, Ms Sturgeon said she was \"very, very, very keen to go ahead\" with plans for a phased return to the classroom.\nHowever, she said only between 5% and 8% of any school's roll should return.\nIt had previously been indicated that children in P1 to P3 years and a limited number of secondary pupils who need practical resources to complete qualifications would return to schools from next Monday.\nMinisters will take a final decision about this, based on the latest data, at a meeting of the Scottish government's cabinet on Tuesday morning.\nThey will also consider an \"indicative timetable\" for other pupils returning.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that it was unlikely that other lockdown restrictions would start to be eased, with schools the top priority.\nShe said: \"What is really important is that that's not seen as a trigger for people who are currently able to work from home to go back to work, or parents deciding to meet up with each other more.\n\"What was often the risk factor around schools is not transmission inside schools, its all the activity that takes place around schools.\"\nThe first minister also said there would be \"trade-offs\" over the coming months as the country eases out of lockdown, with schools and care home visiting \"the kind of things we focus on first as we try to get things back to normal\".\nMSPs will have the chance to question Ms Sturgeon following the statement, with opposition leaders pressing for more details on the government's future plans.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was understandable that there were not \"specific dates set in stone\" for easing restrictions, but said it was important ministers provided more of a \"route map\" out of lockdown.\nHe said: \"We need to know the triggers that will be in place for all school pupils to go back, for businesses to reopen - will we have a tiered approach or a national approach?\n\"These are the crucial points that businesses really need to be aware of so we can see our way out of this crisis.\"\nScottish Green MSP Ross Greer said there was \"no point in setting dates\" for lifting lockdown due to uncertainty about vaccine supplies and new variants.\nHe said: \"What the government can do is list the policies they want to bring in, the safety measures they want to bring in, and as those measures come in it can be easier for us to ease some restrictions and return back to normal.\"\nScottish Labour, meanwhile, has called for supply teachers to be given a greater role in delivering online learning, saying they had been \"forgotten\" in Education Secretary John Swinney's latest plans.\nEducation spokesman Iain Gray said: \"Many supply teachers face financial hardship and are unable to rely on furlough funds - this is unacceptable. It's time for John Swinney to bring our supply teachers in from the cold and get them to work.\"\nAre your children or pupils returning to school next week?

It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October.\nA further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend."

      "tags": "Shielding,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is to be a large expansion of the number of people being asked to shield in England.\nAn extra 1.7 million people are expected to be added to the 2.3 million already on the list.\nHalf of the group have not yet been vaccinated so will now be prioritised urgently by their local GPs.\nIt comes after a new model was developed that takes into account extra factors rather than just health.\nThis calculation includes things such as ethnicity, deprivation (by postcode) and weight to work out a person's risk of becoming seriously ill if they were to catch Covid.\nIt also looks at age, underlying health issues and prescribed medications.\nProf Andrew Hayward, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which has been involved in the modelling, said it considered a \"combination of factors\" such as age, ethnicity and chronic illness and put them together to reach a score.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that this score could \"more or less order people in the population according to their level of risk\" and \"identify those at the top of that range to say, 'you should be prioritised for vaccine and you have a level of risk that is similar to those on the shielding list'\".\nUntil now, only those with specific conditions or undergoing certain types of treatment have been advised to shield until 31 March.\nThey include adults with Down's Syndrome, organ donor recipients and people with severe respiratory conditions.\nThe new model was developed following work by Oxford University which looked at the characteristics of people who died in the first wave to better understand risk.\nMedical records have been searched to identify high-risk patients, based on their combined risk factors. \nThey are now being sent letters by the NHS informing of them of their new status, which means they are entitled to statutory sick pay, prioritisation for online shopping slots and help collecting medicines.\nSome local authorities with areas of high deprivation will now have a major task in contacting people to check what support they need, according to the BBC's health editor Hugh Pym.\nCllr Neil Nerva, public health lead at Brent Council, in north-west London, told BBC News: \"We've got 17,000 people who are shielding. The news today means that over the next two weeks we're going to be shielding another 12,000 people who are over 70 and another 12,000 who are under 70.\"\nHe added: \"That, I think, shows in very graphic terms the health inequalities which exist in a borough like Brent.\"\nHave you been added to the shielding list? You can get in touch with us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nOf the 1.7 million people newly added to the list, around 900,000 have already received an offer of a vaccination because they were over 70.\nThe remainder are all thought to fall into one of the priority groups for vaccination that are being invited for vaccination next.\nThey will be bumped up the list first for a jab, the government said.\nIt means they will receive the offer a few weeks later than if they had been in the shielding group originally.\nShielding was re-introduced in tier four areas from mid-December, before being expanded nationally once the third lockdown was announced in early January.\nUnlike in the first lockdown, people who are shielding are being advised they can leave their homes for exercise.\nGovernment guidelines strongly advise clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home at all times, apart from going out to exercise or to attend a medical appointment.  \nThey should also try to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people within their household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate.\nPeople on the list are still advised to shield even if they have had two doses of the vaccine.\nHigh risk categories include: \nThe list does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to do social distancing.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: \"All of these people who are identified for the first time, are those who have not had an individual clinical condition that we've previously been able to identify through the clinically extremely vulnerable group, but they are people who have multiple personal risk factors and underlying health conditions which move them into a higher risk group.\"\nShe said adding people to the shielding list ensured \"those most vulnerable to Covid can benefit from both the protection that vaccines provide and from enhanced advice and support should they choose it\".\nThe approach was \"risk averse\" to \"protect as many people as possible\", she added.\nPhillip Anderson, of the MS Society, said some people with multiple sclerosis were being added to the shielding list.\nHe said it would come as a \"huge shock\" to people who would potentially have to make \"drastic changes\" to their lives.\nThe Westminster government said the model had been shared with the other nations of the UK, who would decide individually how to use it.\nThere are no current plans to formally expand the shielding list in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the same way as in England.\nThe Welsh government said the same computer model had already been used to add those with chronic kidney disease and adults with Down's Syndrome to its list of those who are extremely clinically vulnerable.\nIn Northern Ireland, GPs and hospital doctors can add individual patients to the shielding list if they are assessed as extremely vulnerable based on a range of factors.

      "text": "Digital currency Bitcoin has risen to a new record high of more than $50,000 (\u00a336,000).\nThe so-called cryptocurrency, which was created by an unknown inventor, has risen about 72% this year.\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are generated by computers. Part of its supposed value comes from the finite number that can be computed.\nBut regulators have warned that they are risky, since their value can change fast, both downwards and upwards.\nMuch of this year's gain for Bitcoin came after Elon Musk's Tesla bought $1.5bn of them and said it would accept them as payment for its cars.\nSupporters say Bitcoin can act as a store of value, like a digital version of gold. \n\"If that narrative comes to fruition, then the growth potential is off the charts as $50,000 per bitcoin equates to a market cap of roughly $931bn, which is almost 9% of gold,\" said John Wu, president at blockchain company Ava Labs.\n\"If BTC meets gold's market cap, then that would be at least $500,000 per bitcoin.\"\nValuing Bitcoin is difficult, and pricing is susceptible to large swings because of the limited number which are traded. Many supporters are holding on to them in anticipation of higher valuations. Should they all sell at once, the price could tumble.\nWith no intrinsic value, unlike a physical asset such as land, and no ability to generate an income, unlike a company or bond, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and can crash as fast as they rise.\nCritics point out that while Bitcoin may have a finite supply of units - 21 million - the number of cryptocurrencies is ever-growing and potentially limitless.\nPeople have lost large amounts of money in steep drops in the value of cryptocurrencies and in hacks and scams associated with them.\nBritain's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), opened 52 investigations into suspected cryptocurrency frauds in the year to 30 June 2020, according to a Freedom of Information request from law firm RPC.\nThat was fewer than the 59 opened in the previous 12 months, sparking speculation that the regulator was short of resources to tackle cryptocurrency frauds. \n\"Given explosive growth in high-risk cryptocurrency and related frauds, we would expect the number of FCA investigations to jump up and not fall away,\" said Sam Tate, partner at RPC.\n\"The sheen of respectability now being given to cryptocurrencies is being taken advantage of by cyber-criminals and online fraudsters.\"\nThe FCA declined to comment on the figures.\nBitcoin's value dropped by $5,000 on 4 January to about $29,000 before recovering the lost ground. On 11 Jan, it dropped $9,000 to $32,000.\nBecause cryptocurrencies can pass international borders quickly and are not regulated in the same way as cash or regular investments, investigating thefts is hard.\nLast month, the FCA issued a stark warning to investors in so-called cryptoassets.\nThe financial watchdog said investors should be \"prepared to lose all their money\" should their investment's value collapse."

      "text": "Almost 300 old coal tips in Wales have been classed as \"high-risk\" a year on from a 60,000 tonne landslip caused by Storm Dennis.\nThe matter was discussed at a Welsh Government summit on mine safety on Tuesday.\nWales has more than 2,000 coal tips. Most are on private land and most are around the south Wales valleys.\nOf those, 294 are categorised as \"high-risk\", meaning they could endanger life or property.\nSeventy are in Caerphilly, 64 in Rhondda Cynon Taf, 59 in Merthyr Tydfil, 42 in Bridgend, 35 in Neath Port Talbot, 16 in Blaenau Gwent and eight in Swansea.\nThe landslip last year was at Tylorstown, in Rhondda. Since it happened, work has been done to map tips and assess their stability. \nThe Welsh and UK governments, the Coal Authority, local councils and other bodies have been examining the problem.\nTheir investigation has concluded current legislation surrounding tips is \"neither sufficiently robust or fit for purpose in relation to inspection and maintenance\".\nCoal Authority chief executive, Lisa Pinney, said managing tips on hillsides was key to reducing risk to communities.\n\"Just under 300 are higher-risk sites but that really just means that they needed much more regular attention and inspection to make sure they stay safe,\" she said.\nShe said when there were concerns, action would be taken. \n\"Any tip which is old mining material sitting on a hillside can pose a risk, obviously, but the key thing to their safety is to manage water and keep it away,\" said Ms Pinney.\n\"And that's why these inspections and maintenance are so important.\"\nNo-one was hurt in the Tylorstown landslip and work is under way to secure the hillside.\nRhondda MP Chris Bryant said funding was essential.\n\"It's shocking that no proper register of disused coal tips was made when the mines closed, so this work is long overdue,\" he said. \n\"With so many on private land this is going to be a massive and complex piece of work in which Parliament and Senedd must work together.\n\"My biggest fear is [Chancellor] Rishi Sunak will demand that local councils pay for this out of their council tax but the poorest communities in the UK should not be forced to pay for tidying up our national industrial heritage.\"\nPlaid Cymru Member of the Senedd for Rhondda Leanne Wood said the UK government should foot the full bill for making the tips safe and anything less would be \"unacceptable\".\n\"When the profits from coal mining were not seen in Rhondda, nor in many other coalfield areas across Wales, coupled with the high cost to health and lives of the workers and their families, that funding and more is owed to us,\" she said.\nWelsh Conservative Janet Finch-Saunders said long-term work to make the tips safe could only be done in partnership with the UK government.\nCoalfield historian Ben Curtis said some tips were removed or made safe after the Aberfan disaster in 1966. \n\"But it is a potential problem that continues to remain for some of these tips to become unsafe over time, perhaps [because of] factors like the effects of climate change and increased rainfall,\" he said.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"Ever since the devastating storms of early 2020, the UK government has been working with the Welsh Government on its devolved responsibility to provide extra support for flood relief and protection to the communities which were so badly affected.\n\"In December we confirmed that \u00a331m would be provided for this vital work, of which \u00a39m was to repair vulnerable coal tips.\n\"We also provided the Welsh Government with an additional \u00a31.3bn for next year at the recent spending review so they are well placed to continue this work\"\nThe summit - which was held virtually - was also due to discuss wider issues of mine safety after water escaped after building up in a mine shaft in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, flooding nearby homes in January.\n\"The coal tip is made up of what we call unconsolidated materials so this is loose material like grains of sugar, all stacked up on top of each other,\" Ashley Patton, an engineering geologist from the British Geological Survey said. \nShe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"When it gets to a certain angle it can make it unsafe and then when you get triggering factors, such as water from a spring line or from heavy rain that we've seen quite a lot of in south Wales, it can just make it destabilise.\n\"The main problem with south Wales is you've got lots of steep-sided valleys and then if you're going to put coal spoil on top of those steep slopes that's just going to make it more likely that it's going to fail...\n\"The most important thing is to take what we call the angle of friction so you're looking at what is the perfect angle for that material - so if you can cut it back to a shallower angle... generally speaking, it could be quite stable, and of course the other important thing is to make sure that the slopes are not sited on any spring lines or areas where farmers are putting water onto the slopes.\""

It's been really, really difficult.\"\n\"And then ironically I got a message to say that I was due to have my vaccine before my sister, who's got learning disabilities and underlying health conditions,\" she said. \nThe DJ added that she didn't know why she had been invited to get the jab, but said it was possibly because she was deemed a carer for her sister, who is 53 and has the rare Cri du Chat genetic syndrome. \nUnpaid carers for the elderly and people with disabilities are in priority group six. \n\"I would give up my vaccine in a heartbeat, if I could, for my sister and any of the residents in her house to have their vaccine\u2026 it does not feel right,\" she said. \nWhiley said she wanted to speak up for people like her sister \"who have been overlooked\". \n\"This happens so often - people with learning disabilities are neglected, they haven't got a voice,\" she added. \nSince the interview, Whiley has found out Frances has tested positive for the virus.\nIn a tweet, she said her \"worst fears\" had been realised, with the prospect of a vaccine so close. \n\"Feel like I'm in a terrible film with bad plot twists,\" she said. \"She's ok so far... Everything crossed.\"\nThe charity Mencap is calling for everyone with a learning disability to be in at least priority group six for the vaccine. \nChief executive Edel Harris said the current limitation to people with a \"severe or profound\" learning disability was \"arbitrary and subjective\". \n\"[That definition is] not used by the medical profession,\" she told Today.\n\"We think GPs, who are under enormous pressure at the moment, are having to use their discretion.\"\nAdults with Down's syndrome, which usually causes some level of learning disability, are in priority group four because they are considered clinically extremely vulnerable.\nAsked about Frances's situation on the same programme, the government's Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said: \"The case you've just described to me - living in residential care with a learning disability - is now being vaccinated in category six. We've just embarked on category five and six - that is happening now so that case will be picked up.\n\"Of course we will need to wait 28 days after infection for us to be able to go back - hence why for residential care we go back four times to deliver the two doses because sometimes people can't be given the first dose until the infection is over after 28 days.\""

      "text": "Smart motorways should be abandoned so \"more serious injuries or fatalities\" can be avoided, a Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) has said.\nDr Alan Billings, South Yorkshire's PCC, made his comments after two coroners raised concerns about deaths on a stretch of the M1 in the county.\nMeanwhile, South Yorkshire Police has said it will examine inquest documents relating to two smart motorway deaths.\nHighways England said it wanted \"to make motorways as safe as possible\".\nOn a stretch of M1 smart motorway in South Yorkshire, the hard shoulder has been replaced by an active lane and drivers who break down are encouraged to pull in to emergency stopping places.\nIn a statement, Dr Billings said: \"I do not believe there is anyone who uses this stretch of the motorway, as I do, who does not feel anxious when driving along it.\"\nHe also highlighted a crash on Friday on the northbound M1 between junction 30 and 31 which he said involved a lorry hitting \"a stationary car in a live running lane\".\nAs a result, both carriageways were closed for a time, with motorists experiencing long delays.\nThe accident is currently subject to a police investigation, Highways England said.\nDr Billings said: \"I call upon the minister and Highways England to abandon this type of smart motorway before we have more serious injuries or fatalities.\"\nHe added that he had been contacted by lorry drivers concerned over the dangers of stationary vehicles in a motorway lane and the difficulties of being able to pull out into fast-moving traffic.\nHe said he had written to the transport secretary over his concerns.\nResponding to Dr Billings, a Highways England spokesperson said: \"We want to do everything we can to make our motorways as safe as possible. \n\"We are aware of the ongoing concerns from Dr Billings and others and we are working hard to deliver the improvements set out in the transport secretary's action plan.\"\nIn March, the government published a report which found that \"in most ways smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, conventional ones\", the agency added.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in my area?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Cabinet Office,National Audit Office,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government's decision to hire a firm with links to the PM's ex-chief adviser Dominic Cummings has been challenged at the High Court.\nCampaign group The Good Law Project has complained of \"apparent bias\" in the decision to recruit Public First for Covid-19 opinion polling last year.\nDuring a hearing on Monday, the group's lawyer argued emergency rules used to award the work should not have applied. \nBut Mr Cummings said the \u00a3540,000 contract had been \"entirely justified\". \nIn a written statement, he said although he was \"friends\" with the company's founding directors, he had not recommended them for that reason.\nHe added there had been \"no time\" to follow usual procurement rules, and the work was \"crucial\" to the government's early pandemic response. \nPublic First was founded by James Frayne and Rachel Wolf, whom Mr Cummings said he knew from previous roles both inside and outside government. \nAccording to a November report into Covid-19 contracts by the National Audit Office, it was initially hired \"on an informal basis\" in March 2020 to do focus group research.\nThe spending watchdog added the company was then given a \"retrospective contract\" in June, covering work from March and \"potential future work\". \nThe Cabinet Office's decision to award the work under emergency tendering rules is subject to a legal challenge from The Good Law Project. \nAt a High Court hearing on Monday, the group's lawyer Jason Coppel QC told judge Mrs Justice O'Farrell that \"no other provider was considered\" for the work.\nHe added that although other firms already working for the government had been able to bid, \"no thought was given to any other provider because Dominic Cummings wanted Public First to have the contract\".\nArguing that rules allowing the \"direct award\" of contracts did not apply, he added awarding the contract without open competition had not been \"strictly necessary\". \nMr Cummings, who was working as Boris Johnson's senior adviser at the time the work was awarded, did not give evidence in person during the hearing. \nBut in a written statement, he defended his decision to recommend the firm for the work. \nHe said he was friends with both Mr Frayne and Ms Wolf, as well as ex-civil servant Gabriel Milland, who is also a partner at Public First. \nHe said he had not met Mr Frayne since 2016, and had \"no involvement\" in the \"contractual arrangements\" with the firm.  \n\"Obviously I did not request Public First be brought in because they were my friends. I would never do such a thing,\" he added. \nHe said he had recommended the firm because he knew the company was \"very good\" at running focus groups, and he could \"rely on them to make an extra effort\".\nAlthough he added he was not allowed to \"direct\" civil servants, he said he expected Public First to be hired \"as a result of my suggestion,\" adding that he was an \"expert in the interaction between policy, mass communication and focus groups\". \n\"Civil servants could have disagreed and did disagree with my suggestions all the time, and my response depends on my expertise of the matter in hand and other circumstances.\"\n\"On this occasion, I was an expert,\" he added. \nArguing for the legal challenge to be dismissed, lawyers for the Cabinet Office told the judge Mr Cummings made a recommendation, not a decision, on awarding the work.\nRepresenting the Cabinet Office, Michael Bowsher QC said Mr Frayne and Ms Wolf had \"professional and personal connections\" with Mr Cummings, as well as Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove.\nBut it was \"emphatically denied\" that there was \"any bias, or apparent bias\" in the award of the work to Public First, he added.\nHe said: \"At a time of national emergency Dominic Cummings recommended a firm he knew could get the job done.\"\nHe added Mr Gove did not have any involvement in the decision or influence it in any way.\nIn an outline argument earlier this month, government lawyers said it was \"clear\" that the conditions for allowing emergency procurement rules to apply had been met.\nThey said the research Public First had been hired to do was required \"immediately,\" and there was \"no time to conduct even an accelerated procurement exercise\". \nFormer Labour MP Natascha Engel, who is now a partner at Public First, defended the firm's involvement. \nSpeaking after the hearing, she said: \"Given James Frayne hasn't spoken to Dominic Cummings in several years and neither he nor Rachel Wolf spoke to Dominic Cummings or Michael Gove about Covid research, the idea this was some sort of quiet arrangement between friends is clearly wrong.\"\n\"Everyone in government knows which research agencies can deliver in a crisis, and it's no surprise Public First was chosen given our record.\" \nHaving heard rival arguments, Mrs Justice O'Farrell said she would deliver a ruling on a date to be fixed."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Coronavirus testing,Omicron variant,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "Jaguar Land Rover's Jaguar brand will be all-electric by 2025, the carmaker has said.\nThe company will launch electric models of its entire Jaguar and Land Rover line-up by 2030, it added.\nThe firm said it would keep all three of its three British plants open as part of its new strategy.\nBut it has dropped plans to build an electric version of its XJ saloon at the Castle Bromwich plant, meaning the site will eventually stop making cars.\nChief executive Thierry Bollor\u00e9 said the plant would focus instead on \"non-production\" activities in the long term, without giving details.\nThe company plans to spend about \u00a32.5bn a year on new technology for its cars.\nThis is a big move for Jaguar Land Rover, but the reality is it has little choice. \nLike other manufacturers, it is under pressure to reduce the CO2 emissions from its fleet, as new regulations come into force in Europe and elsewhere. At the same time, sales of diesels - which generally produce less CO2 than petrol engines - have been plummeting.\nAnd in the longer term, the UK government wants to outlaw the sale of all wholly petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Governments in other countries are moving in the same general direction.  \nThe problem is, electric cars cost more to design and build than conventional models, meaning it is currently hard to make a profit from them. Bigger manufacturers can throw money at the problem now, and hope to benefit from economies of scale later. \nJLR is a smaller company and can't do that - so instead it will re-emphasise Jaguar's credentials as a luxury brand when it goes all-electric.\nThat might make sense from a marketing point of view, but making the sums add up looks like a steep challenge.\nIt will also invest in hydrogen fuel cell technology. Fuel cells provide electric power, without producing tailpipe emissions - water is the only by-product. \nHowever, in order for them to be truly environmentally friendly, the hydrogen itself needs to be produced using renewable sources.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the announcement was \"a huge step for British car manufacturing\".\nCarmakers are under pressure to meet stringent carbon emission demands in Europe and China, as well as customer demand for high-performance electric cars with a luxury or performance feel.\nThe UK plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.\nLuxury car brand Bentley Motors, owned by Germany's Volkswagen, said in November its range will be fully electric by 2030, and last month General Motors said it aimed to have a zero tailpipe emission line-up by 2035."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "text": "For children under the age of five, Covid restrictions have been in place for a big chunk of their lives. For the very youngest, daily life has never been Covid-free.\nWhat should parents and carers of young children be concerned about? Five experts offer advice and support. \nFor most families with a new baby, there's no need to worry, Alison Morton, of the Institute of Health Visiting, says.\n\"In those first few months, parents are babies' most favourite things,\" she says.\n\"Sitting on your lap, taking turns, mimicking - they're very happy with just that.\"\nSally Hogg, from the Parent-Infant Foundation, which supports teams working with new parents, agrees. \n\"You don't go to a parent-and-baby group with a three-month-old because baby needs to learn to sing,\" she says.\n\"It's because you need the company and positive baby-friendly ideas.\n\"To get those things in lockdown, you might chat on the phone with friends, family and other parents or join groups online.\"\nAs older babies become more aware of the world around them, Alison says, they remember someone or something exists, such as a parent, even when they can't see them. \n\"As a result, babies experience separation anxiety and may get upset if they're left with unfamiliar people. \n\"This is totally normal and nothing to do with any lack of socialisation because of Covid.\"\nOnce they're more inquisitive and confident, toddlers want to play with other youngsters.\n\"If your child has no older siblings, then clearly - because of Covid - those contacts will be restricted,\" Alison says. \n\"But studies of children with restricted play - like those in hospital long-term - found youngsters adapted and found other ways to play.\"\nMost children should recover long-term, even though the pandemic has changed play, she says.\nAnd if you're a single parent, or know one, you can always \"bubble\" with them.\nUse your daily home routine to help your child develop.\nLearning through play\n\"Be imaginative,\" paediatric registrar Dr Rakhee Shah, at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, says.\n\"Make laundry-folding into a game\n\"Get them to pick out specific colours or items. \n\"Young children love to copy and mimic family life.\"\nThrough domestic role-play children learn to:\nAnd play has become Covid-related, Alison says, \"doing handwashing and putting face masks on Teddy\".\nEveryday routine \nHave a regular snack time, walk time and reading time, Alison says.\n\"People worry about children looking at screens too much,\" Dr Bernadka Dubicka, who chairs the child-and-adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says. \n\"But they've been lockdown lifesavers.\" \nThere should be balance, though.\n\"Have meals together, make eye contact and keep screens out of bedrooms,\" Bernadka says.\nBut how do you persuade two-year-olds to engage in a Zoom conversation with Grandma and Grandad?\n\"Young children will chat for a bit, then just wander off,\" Sally says. \n\"But you can share stories and play games.\n\"Get grandparents to ask them to find things, a certain toy or something that's a specific colour.\"\nGet outside\nAll our experts spoke of the value of going out to play. \nParks and playgrounds remain open. \nEngland's current lockdown restrictions allow under-fives to go with you when you meet someone you don't live with for exercise. \nIn Wales, children aged 10 or below can accompany you. \nAnd in Scotland, the age limit is 11.\nRules by nation:\nNurseries also remain open. \nAlthough, in Scotland only key-worker children can attend.\n\"Sending a child to nursery must be a parent's individual decision,\" Dr Paul Ramchandani, Lego professor of play in education, development and learning, at Cambridge University, says.\n\"I'd say it depends on local Covid levels and how comfortable you feel.\"  \nWatch out for persistent changes in their behaviour.\nFor example, if they:\n\"Stress in very young children can often present with physical symptoms,\" Bernadka says. \n\"They'll describe stomach pains, because they don't have the verbal skills to express themselves accurately.\"\nHealth-visitor appointments were cut when the pandemic started.\nAnd many became online only.\nHealth-visiting services have now restarted.\nBut in practice, Alison says, there are huge local variations. \n\"There's particular worry for small premature babies and for others where conditions like cerebral palsy have been missed,\" she says. \n\"It's been up to parents to acknowledge problems. \n\"Many have been anxious about asking for help.\"\nIf you're concerned about your child, contact your GP, midwife or health visitor.\nParents are anxious, Alison says. \n\"But it's important to know most children are going to be fine,\" she says.\n\"And you can ask for help if you're worried.\"\nPaul agrees. \n\"It's normal to feel extra stressed,\" he says.\n\"Family life has adapted.\n\"But chances are you're still being a good-enough parent.\"\nParent and child mental-health problems go hand-in-hand, Bernadka says. \n\"If more adults are struggling, then it's not going to have a positive impact on children,\" she says.\nAnd those parents need to find help for themselves first.\nSigns you might be struggling include:\nIn a recent survey of pregnancy and young children's providers, by the First 1001 Days Movement, nearly all (98%) said parental anxiety or depression had affected babies. \n\"Not everyone needs to be labelled with a mental-health problem,\" Alison says. \n\"Parents often just lack confidence.\"\n\"I've worked with hundreds of new mums who've had a wobble and needed ideas or a bit of extra support. \n\"Everything's soon back to normal.\"\nSpeak to your partner, family or friends first if you can.\nBut professional advice is available.\nHealth visitors would rather hear from people early, Alison says, before more serious conditions, such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and post-natal depression, develop.\nIn an Ofsted survey of 208 nurseries in England, most reported children returning after the spring 2020 lockdown had fallen behind in personal, social and emotional development. \nSome returned less confident, while others were using nappies and dummies at an older age than nursery staff would expect.\nBut Paul offers words of reassurance. \n\"There are very few developmental goals which most children won't be able to catch up with,\" he says.\nOur experts agree youngsters with special needs or living in poverty or homes where there's conflict or abuse could have longer-term issues and need more support.\nIn the first lockdown, babies and toddlers from disadvantaged backgrounds, according to university researchers in Oxford, missed out on activities to support their development, compared with those with more highly educated and well paid parents.\nThe government says 4.2 million children were living in poverty in 2020. \nBut it's \"committed to making sure every child gets the best start in life\" and has targeted support by:\n\"We know the biggest driver for mental-health problems is poverty,\" Bernadka says. \n\"But for all children, one of the most important things that parents can do is just to be there for their child.\""

      "title": "Covid: Dutch crisis as court orders end to Covid curfew",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A court in The Hague has told the Dutch government that an overnight curfew to reduce the spread of coronavirus should be lifted, ruling that it breaches the right to free movement.\nThe court said the 21:00 to 04:30 curfew was imposed by an emergency law when there was no \"acute emergency\".\nLater, a higher court ruled that the curfew could stay in place pending an appeal on Friday.\nThe curfew, imposed in January, led to rioting in several Dutch cities.\nPolice were patrolling streets near the Dutch parliament on Tuesday evening but no unrest has been reported so far.\nThe earlier court ruling - which said the curfew should be lifted immediately - was a victory for campaign group Viruswaarheid (Virus Truth) and a major upset for the government.\nThe government quickly asked for the decision to be suspended until an appeal was heard at the end of the week. An appeals court later granted that suspension.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the ruling against the curfew as a setback and urged people to continue to follow the restrictions, which he said were \"simply necessary\".\nThe Dutch cabinet is urgently working on a new law to enforce the curfew, but that could take time.\nCurfews have been widely used in Europe to restrict movement. France has had a nightly curfew from 18:00 but has stopped short of imposing a third lockdown. Greece has also imposed curfews, as have Spain and Italy.\nThe Dutch measure, which came into force on 23 January, was intended to reduce movement, particularly among young people, but triggered days of rioting in a number of towns and cities. The Netherlands had not seen a curfew since Nazi occupation in World War Two.\nAlthough the Netherlands initially avoided strict measures, a lockdown was brought in last December and, after the cabinet decided on a curfew in January, MPs backed it days later amid fears that the UK, or Kent, variant would increase infections. The government resigned before last month's curfew decision and now has a caretaker role ahead of elections next month.\nInfection rates were slightly down on Tuesday, with 2,735 new cases reported in the past 24 hours. But hospital admissions were up and 88 more deaths were reported. Some 629,000 people have received their first Covid-19 vaccine dose since vaccinations began in the Netherlands on 6 January, and of those around one in four have had a second dose.\nIn their ruling on Tuesday, the Dutch judges said the curfew had been imposed under an emergency law, even though the court said there was no emergency as in the case of a \"dyke being breached\". \nFears of increased infection because of the UK variant were not valid as no curfew was imposed last year when pressure on Dutch hospitals was far greater, the judges said.\nThe curfew was therefore a violation of the right to freedom of movement and privacy, and limited the right to freedom of assembly. \nCommentators spoke of ministers having faced a \"Catch-22\" situation. When the cabinet decided on the curfew they sought the backing of MPs, but by waiting for parliamentary support, in the judges eyes they had disproved the need for emergency legislation.\nThe case threatened to descend into farce during the afternoon, when Virus Truth spokesman Jeroen Pols accused the lead judge of bias for allowing the government to challenge the court's ruling so quickly.\nEven the group that brought the case to court, Virus Truth, seemed surprised by its success.\nI recently interviewed its Covid-sceptic founder, Willem Engel, in his Rotterdam dance studio. He and his followers are adamant governments around the world are using efforts to control the spread of Covid-19 as a guise to gain control of citizens.\nThis ruling has emboldened them. \nThe curfew has been one of the most controversial and contested elements of the Dutch lockdown but the majority of the population had accepted and abided by it. \nSome people have started planning \"after-curfew\" parties, though other rules, such as no more than one guest at home a day and a ban on gatherings of more than two people outdoors, remain in place. \nWhile this court victory specifically relates to the Dutch situation, it could be used as a precedent by anti-lockdown groups seeking to overturn Covid-related rules in other countries too.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Universities in the UK,Universities,Freedom of expression,Students",
      "text": "Groups representing students and universities have expressed caution at plans for a \"free speech champion\" to regulate England's campuses.\nThe government has announced plans for the role to ensure freedom of speech and expression is not stifled.\nThe National Union of Students says there is \"no evidence\" of a freedom of speech crisis on campus.\nAnd the Russell Group of leading universities says universities need to keep their \"institutional autonomy\".\nThe group warned against creating an \"unnecessary and burdensome bureaucracy\".\nThe new post - which will have a seat on the Office for Students' (OfS) board - is part of a series of proposals, announced on Tuesday, aimed at strengthening academic freedom in England's universities.\nUnder the plans, universities would be legally required to actively promote free speech and the OfS would have the power to impose fines on institutions if they breach this condition.\nThis would also extend to student unions, which would have to ensure that lawful free speech is secured for members and visiting speakers.\nIndividuals would be able to seek compensation through the courts if they suffered loss from a breach of the free speech duties - like being expelled, dismissed or demoted - under a new legal measure.\nThe Department for Education said the next steps for legislation would be set out \"in due course\". \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson warned of the \"chilling effect\" of \"silencing\" in universities.\nMr Williamson said: \"Free speech underpins our democratic society and our universities have a long and proud history of being places where students and academics can express themselves freely, challenge views and cultivate an open mind.\n\"But I am deeply worried about the chilling effect on campuses of unacceptable silencing and censoring. \n\"That is why we must strengthen free speech in higher education, by bolstering the existing legal duties and ensuring strong, robust action is taken if these are breached.\"\nCatherine, a student at the University of Central Lancashire, told the BBC: \"I don't think it's silencing to say 'this view isn't acceptable' or to refuse to give them a platform.\n\"Freedom of speech doesn't mean you have freedom from consequences - I think a lot of people confuse free speech as meaning that they can say whatever they want and nothing will happen to them.\"\nCatherine said the government's  proposal of a free speech champion could be problematic.\n\"I think this new role from the government is a good idea in principle, but in reality it has the potential to go wrong because different views can mean a lot of things and it could result in people not being respectful to one another.\"\nBut Paul from Gloucestershire said there was a problem with freedom of speech on university campuses, with students having to have the \"right opinion\".\n\"My son was treated dreadfully at university because of his beliefs and opinions.\n\"He was shunned, ostracised and even threatened with violence simply because he voted for Brexit and held conservative views. \n\"If you don't have an opinion which is mainstream, for want of a better word, there are labels for you.\"\nPaul said his son had been looking forward to having good debate at university with people who held different opinions, but was \"very disappointed\".\n\"In my experience, university life can be miserable if you don't hold Marxist, communist or socialist views.\"\nThe Russell Group responded cautiously to the government's proposal.\n\"It is important that proposals in this government policy paper, if taken forward, are evidence-based and proportionate, with due care taken to ensure academic freedom and institutional autonomy. \n\"Government should support existing work by universities and students' unions to defend and maintain freedom of expression on campus, rather than adding unnecessary and burdensome bureaucracy.\"\nHillary Gyebi-Ababio, the National Union of Students vice-president for higher education, said:  \"Students' unions are committed to freedom of expression and are the very home of rigorous debate and new ideas. \n\"There is no evidence of a freedom of expression crisis on campus, and students' unions are constantly taking positive steps to help facilitate the thousands of events that take place each year.\"\nJo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, which represents staff, said: \"In reality the biggest threats to academic freedom and free speech come not from staff and students, nor from so-called 'cancel culture', but from ministers' own attempts to police what can and cannot be said on campus.\"\nA failure to \"get to grips with the endemic job insecurity and managerialist approaches which mean academics are less able to speak truth to power\" were also a barrier to free speech, said Ms Grady.\nPeter Tatchell, a gay rights activist, said the plan for a free speech tsar was part of a \"cynical culture war\" to use \"hot-button culture issues\" to secure political advantage.\nMr Tatchell, who has himself been the target of no-platform protests, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that said such issues were \"quite rare\" and needed to be put in perspective.\nProf Selina Todd, an Oxford University academic who previously had an invitation to a conference celebrating women withdrawn over her stance on transgender rights issues, welcomed government action although she said the free speech champion could be a \"blunt instrument\".\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that universities have \"dismally failed\" to uphold freedom of debate in recent years.\n\"Things have got a lot worse for academics and for students - many of whom get in touch with me anonymously to say how frightened they are to speak out,\" she said.\nIn December, Cambridge University said its proposed statement on free speech would no longer require staff and students to be \"respectful\" of differing views, following an intervention from academics who said calling for respect could undermine academic freedom."

      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "text": "The youngest pupils are to return to Scotland's classrooms for face-to-face teaching from next week.\nThe move will see all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school returning from Monday 22 February.\nOther age groups will continue to learn from home, apart from some secondary pupils who need to complete coursework.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was unlikely that any other pupils would return to school before 15 March at the earliest.\nAll other existing lockdown measures will all remain in place until at least the end of this month, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the country remains in a precarious position. \nThe EIS teaching union said it still had significant concerns over school safety which had not yet been addressed, and a blended learning model - with around half of pupils in classes at any one time - would have more appropriate. \nThe union's general secretary, Larry Flanagan, said: \"Everyone is supportive of face-to-face teaching returning as soon as possible - that should not override safety concerns, however, and teachers will be understandably nervous around today's announcement.\"\nThe Scottish government will draw up a \"revised strategic framework\" - to be published next week - to set out how Scotland can exit lockdown and what conditions will need to be met before restrictions can be eased.\nWill your child be returning to school on Monday?  Share your stories. \nMs Sturgeon said it was unlikely that hotels and holiday accommodation would be open again in time for people to book any sort of Easter break, but \"staycations\" may be possible by summer.\nIn an update at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said she had \"more reason to be hopeful now than we did a few weeks ago\" that the race against the virus could be won, with the vaccination programme picking up pace while lockdown contains the spread of new cases.\nShe said she was \"very hopeful that vaccination will start to have a significant impact in reducing the number of people who die from Covid\", saying there was already evidence of this in care homes.\nHowever, the first minister warned that \"our situation is still very fragile\", saying: \"Even a slight easing of restrictions could cause cases to start rising rapidly again\".\nWhile she said it would continue to be \"extremely cautious\", the government is focused on a \"gradual, phased return to as much normality as possible\".\nThis is to begin with schools, with the youngest pupils to return to classrooms as soon as next week.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said there would be trade-offs, adding: \"We are choosing to use the very limited headroom we have right now to get at least some children back to school - because children's education and wellbeing is such a priority.\n\"But being able to get children back to education may mean the rest of us living with some other restrictions for longer.\"\nCareful, cautious, gradual are the watchwords for the easing of lockdown in Scotland.\nThat is to say we're not going to get back the everyday freedoms we once took for granted, quickly.\nThe stay at home instruction will remain in place into March, possibly longer, with the anniversary of the first lockdown drawing nearer.\nA further reopening of schools is a priority but will not happen before 15 March. \nEaster holidays are unlikely to be allowed at home or abroad. The same will probably apply to overseas holidays this summer.\nWhy all this caution when the vaccination programme is now progressing at pace?\nBecause, at this stage, ministers remain nervous that opening up too quickly could mean losing control of the virus again in the wider population.\nThey are desperate to avoid a third lockdown later in the year. \nA return to local protection levels should form part of the exit plan to be announced next week.\nBut expect the restrictions associated with each level to be tighter than before, given this system was overwhelmed as autumn turned to winter last year.\nThe first pupils to return to schools will be those in preschools, those in P1, P2 and P3, and \"a limited number of senior phase students who need access to school for essential practical work\".\nMinisters hope to set out second phase of schools reopening in two weeks time, but Ms Sturgeon said there was \"unlikely to be any further return to school before 15 March\" so that the impact of the initial changes can be assessed.\nShe said at-home testing sets would be provided to senior phase pupils, teachers and school staff once they do return, and that secondary pupils would have to maintain a 2m distance in school buildings.\nPlans for the \"gradual\" easing of the strict stay at home lockdown are set to include a return to a regional levels system.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"caution will be necessary\", and that she would be clear about what will not be possible in the immediate future - including holidays.\nShe said: \"We are likely to advise against booking Easter holidays, either overseas or within Scotland, as it is highly unlikely that we will have been able to fully open hotels of self-catering accommodation by then.\n\"However, for the summer, while it is still highly unlikely that overseas holidays will be possible or advisable, staycations might be - but this will depend on the data nearer the time.\"\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said it was \"very welcome news\" that schools could start opening again safely.\nHowever she said that \"to get us even closer to normality, we need to get all key workers vaccinated as early as we can\", saying government plans were \"short on detail\".\nAnd she urged the Scottish government to publish its plans for helping pupils to catch-up with the schooling they have missed, which she said should be built around a tutoring service to stop the attainment gap growing. \nScottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie also challenged Ms Sturgeon over the vaccine rollout, urging the first minister to commit to more ambitious targets for completing priority groups."

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "The Scottish government is \"satisfied\" it has hit its latest vaccination target - but has warned that progress is set to slow down in the coming days.\nMinisters aimed to give a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to all over-70s and the clinically vulnerable by Monday.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said everyone in this group should have been offered an appointment.\nShe urged anyone who had not received one to contact the government, and said \"nobody is going to be left behind\".\nHowever, she said the rate of progress was set to \"decline a bit\" due to supply issues, with health teams \"unlikely to vaccinate more than 30,000 people a day this week\".\nThis would be fewer than half of the number of people vaccinated on several days over the past week, but Ms Sturgeon said staff \"stand ready to pick up the pace as soon as supplies allow\".\nMonday is the final day for the government to reach its target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all over-70s and those deemed to be extremely clinically vulnerable.\nMs Sturgeon said she was \"satisfied we have met that target\", and that everyone in these groups had been offered the vaccine.\nA \"significant number of people\" had to rebook appointments due to the severe weather over the past week, but Ms Sturgeon said levels of uptake were already \"well beyond the 80% target we set out in our deployment plan\".\nThe first minister said \"close to 100%\" of older care home residents and over-80s in the community had been given a first dose, along with 99% of 75 to 79-year-olds.\nAnd she said the uptake rate for those aged 70 to 74 was already at 85%, with more booked in for Monday.\nMs Sturgeon said this was \"without a doubt a significant achievement\", which in time would \"reduce deaths from Covid-19 significantly\".\nThe vaccination rate is expected to dip over the coming weeks due to a combination of factors, including a reduction in supplies.\nMs Sturgeon said Pfizer had \"re-phased its delivery over the coming period\". The same number of vials will be delivered, but over a different timescale.\nShe also said the higher than expected uptake of vaccines meant more doses had been used than anticipated, while more stocks would have to start being held back for second doses.\nSome vaccination centres like the NHS Louisa Jordan may move from seven days a week operation to five to reflect this.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon stressed that \"we are not talking about closing vaccination centres\" and said the system could pick up pace \"very rapidly\" once supplies are available.\nShe said: \"We're going to see these issues through this programme, that's in the nature of it, but it shouldn't take away from the fact we are in a much better position than we thought we would be in.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the vaccination target being hit was \"great news\" and that the government must now work on a \"route map\" towards easing lockdown.\nHe said: \"Understandably specific dates set in stone are not possible because as the virus mutates it can get stronger variants, as we've seen over the last 10 or 11 months.\n\"But we need to know the triggers that will be in place for all school pupils to go back, for businesses to reopen - will we have a tiered approach or a national approach?\n\"These are the crucial points that businesses really need to be aware of so we can see our way out of this crisis.\"\nMs Sturgeon's cabinet is due to decide on Tuesday morning whether more pupils can return to Scotland's schools in the coming weeks, with an announcement to follow at Holyrood in the afternoon.\nThe first minister said she was \"very keen\" to go ahead with the phased return of children to schools.\nShe said there would be \"trade-offs\" over the coming months as the country eases out of lockdown, with schools and care home visiting \"the kind of things we focus on first as we try to get things back to normal\"."

      "tags": "Israel,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More data from Israel's vaccination programme is suggesting the Pfizer jab prevents 94% of symptomatic infections. \nThis indicates the vaccine is performing just as well in a larger population as it did in the clinical trials. \nIt is proving highly effective at preventing illness and severe disease among all age groups, according to public health doctor Prof Hagai Levine. \n\"High vaccination coverage of the most susceptible groups\" was key, he said. \nIsrael's largest health fund Clalit looked at positive tests in 600,000 vaccinated people and the same number of unvaccinated people, matched by age and health status. \nIt found 94% fewer infections among the vaccinated group.\nThis was based on test results in people's medical records, usually taken if they had symptoms or were a close contact of someone who had tested positive.\nAnd the vaccine prevented almost all cases of serious illness.\nThis pattern was the same in all age groups - including the over-70s, who may have been under-represented in clinical trials.\nThe data has not yet been formally published. \nBut it \"sends a message to other countries such as the UK\" about the usefulness of the vaccine, said Prof Levine, and the need to get \"very high\" coverage of the groups most likely to become very ill from the virus. \nHe said he could not put a number on what proportion of the population would need to be immunised before restrictions could ease.\n\"We still don't know what the impact is on transmission,\" he said. \nBut we can say that, at least, \"the vaccine is useful for personal protection\", he added.\nProf Eran Segal, who is analysing data for the Israeli Ministry of Health, suggested Israel had to vaccinate 80% of its over-60s before learning of its effect on Covid-19 cases. \nIsrael is the first country in the world to see the impact of its vaccination programme, but it took significant population coverage and several weeks to reach this milestone. \nGreater falls were seen in the over-60s who were vaccinated first and in cities that vaccinated their populations earlier - patterns not seen in earlier lockdowns. This provides strong evidence it was the vaccine, and not just the lockdown, driving down cases.\nBut Prof Segal warned falls had happened more slowly than expected, possibly because of the effect of the UK variant, which has become the dominant strain in Israel. \nAnd he cautioned that, even with the \"very rapid pace\" of Israel's vaccination programme, there were still tens of thousands of people who were unprotected and could become severely ill if infected.\n\"We still have to exit our lockdown very cautiously,\" he said, or risk large numbers of people being hospitalised. \nIsrael has been experiencing a significant wave of infection and remains under strict measures - but with everyone over the age of 16 now entitled to get vaccine, the hope is at least the education system could be reopened too. \nThe country has also been met with criticism over questions about who should provide vaccines to the Palestinian territories.\nIsrael has only just also started to transfer some doses to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, so that vaccinations can begin for front-line health workers.\nMeanwhile it has given the full two doses to a quarter of its resident population.

      "text": "A combination of rapid testing and the Covid vaccination programme will help entertainment venues to reopen in England, the vaccines minister says.\nNadhim Zahawi said it was those measures which would get \"our economy back on its feet\".\nHis comments come after the PM said \"rapid\" lateral flow tests could be used by \"those parts of the economy we couldn't get open last year\".\nIndustry bosses have queried whether using rapid tests would be practical. \nSome venues such as nightclubs have been unable to open since March 2020, while others like theatres and cinemas have struggled to make social distancing work.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Zahawi said: \"It's a combination of rapid testing as well as a national vaccination programme that will get our economy back on its feet and venues open again.\"\nHe said that the government favoured testing over vaccine passports as a means to reopening the economy, since it was not yet clear whether a vaccinated individual could still transmit the virus.\nMr Zahawi described preliminary evidence on the effect of vaccines on coronavirus transmission as \"really encouraging\", but said the full data might not be available for weeks.\n\"We have a couple of very large-scale studies related to giving us better data on the vaccines,\" he said. \"We should be able to see really good data in the next few weeks from those studies.\"\nHe added that the government would be \"data driven, rather than date driven\" when it comes to relaxing lockdown measures. \nBoris Johnson is due to set out a road map on 22 February for easing the lockdown in England.\nAt Monday's Downing Street briefing, the prime minister said lateral flow tests, along with vaccination, would \"probably be the route forward\" to reopening the economy.\nLateral flow tests give a result in 20-30 minutes - unlike the more expensive PCR tests used by NHS Test and Trace which need to be taken to a lab to be processed.\nThe UK Cinema Association said asking all customers to have a rapid test and then to wait 30 minutes for a result would be \"impractical\" and in many instances add a \"50% uplift on their cinema ticket\".\nIts chief executive, Phil Clapp, said he was not aware of any of its members considering rapid testing or vaccine passports \"as a viable way forward for the return to cinema\".\nHe added that he believed cinemas offered a \"materially different environment than nightclubs or music venues\".\nKate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade association UKHospitality, said the organisation would be \"keen to understand\" the government's plans for mass lateral flow testing in the community and workplaces.\nShe also said the industry body stood ready to work with ministers on \"a risk-assessed approach to be applied on a voluntary basis where proportionate, pragmatic and necessary\".\nMichael Kill, the boss of the Night Time Industries Association, welcomed the PM's comments, saying: \"Finally we have some acknowledgement from the prime minister and government on the existence of late-night economy businesses, including nightclubs, theatres, casinos and late bars, particularly as they are some of the hardest hit since the start of the pandemic.\"\nHowever, he told the BBC that administering rapid tests would not be straightforward.\nHe said professionals would be required to administer swab tests outside the venue, which would force venues to stagger admissions and have procedures in place to deal with positive cases and those who they came into contact with.\nSacha Lord, who co-founded Manchester's Parklife Festival, said the events sector had been calling for on-site rapid testing for more than five months, and any further delay to implementing such initiatives would do \"irreversible\" damage to the UK's cultural sector. \n\"My fear is that they take another five months to get moving, which the industry simply doesn't have,\" he said.\nThe UK recorded a further 10,625 new infections on Tuesday, down 14% from 12,364 last Tuesday. There were also another 799 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - down 24% from 1,052 last Tuesday. \nMeanwhile, people arriving in England who are required to quarantine in a hotel face an additional \u00a31,200 bill if they test positive for coronavirus, the government has said.This is on top of the \u00a31,750 cost for the entering the quarantine hotel programme and will apply to guests forced to extend their stay beyond the initial 11 nights. \nThe information was published on the government's website on Monday, the day the new rules came into force for arrivals who have been in a high-risk Covid country.\nWest Midlands Police have fined four passengers \u00a310,000 for failing to declare they had travelled from a \"red-list\" country."

      "text": "As many as 88% of people still have antibodies in their blood to fight Covid-19 six months after infection, a study of almost 1,700 people suggests.\nThe data - from one of the world's largest follow-up Covid studies - also provides more detail about the likely symptoms experienced by those infected.\nWhile 26% had a cough and 28% had a fever, a bigger proportion - 43% - said they lost the sense of taste or smell.\nBut 40% had had none of these - and about 20% had had no symptoms at all.\nThe data also backs up previous studies on who is most likely to have been infected with Covid at some point during the pandemic.\nAmong a full group of nearly 20,000 people who were regularly tested monthly during the pandemic, it was younger adults, black or South Asian people and those living in deprived areas who were most likely to test positive for the antibodies.\nThe UK Biobank is a database of blood, urine and saliva samples, heart and brain scans and the genetic data of half a million people who volunteered to have their information analysed to help with global medical research. \nJust under 20,000 of these participants each gave a blood sample every month between 27 May and 4 December 2020.\nAnd 1,699 tested positive for antibodies during this period, which indicates a past Covid-19 infection. \nMost of these were already testing positive in the first month of the study, suggesting they had acquired the infection during the first wave. \nBy the end of the study, six months later, 88% still had detectable antibodies.\nThis echoes findings from previous, smaller studies in healthcare workers.\nAnd it is possible that some or all of the 12% whose tests went from positive to negative retained some protection against subsequent infection although their antibodies had fallen below the threshold measured by the study.\nUK Biobank chief scientist Prof Naomi Allen said: \"Although we cannot be certain how [the presence of antibodies] relates to immunity, the results suggest that people may be protected against subsequent infection for at least six months following natural infection. \n\"More prolonged follow-up will allow us to determine how long such protection is likely to last.\"\nNot everyone was equally likely to show signs of previous infection. \nThe antibody study echoes other data showing which groups were hit hardest by the virus. \nAmong the full group of 20,000 participants, 16% of the black people tested positive for antibodies, compared with:\nThere were regional differences too, with Londoners most likely to have antibodies and people in Scotland least likely. \nAnd 13.5% of the adults under 30 tested positive, compared with 6.7% of the over-70s.\nA separate study by the ONS, based on blood test results from a random sample of people over 16, found around one in seven people in England had antibodies in their blood in mid-January.\nThe figure was one in nine in Wales, one in 11 in Northern Ireland and one in 10 in Scotland.\nThis suggests these people had been infected with the virus in the past, but this is unlikely to be the total infected since the start of the UK epidemic last spring because antibodies - although they are present for at least six months after infection - do decline over time.\nVaccinations also build up antibodies in those given jabs, to help fight off the virus, but the ONS does not differentiate between the two things."

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: How will the phased return to school work?",
      "tags": "Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's schools will open up to more pupils later this month, as part of plans for a phased reopening. \nAll pupils in P1-P3 and pre-school children can return to the classroom full-time from 22 February. \nThere will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. Only between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time.\nHere are the answers to some of the questions you may have about how the return to the classroom will work. \nOne reason for this is the concern that younger children potentially lose out the most from so-called remote learning. The government still feels that a full return of primary pupils is not possible, and the younger classes are being prioritised. Of course some older children are still in primary school buildings because their parents are key workers or because they are deemed vulnerable.\nOlder pupils will only be able to return after 22 February to ensure practical work important to achieving qualifications is completed - but the definition of practical work isn't prescriptive. \nIt is designed to cover the kind of work which cannot be done from home - notably in practical and vocational subjects. It might include work in practical subjects such as art or woodwork. It might also include laboratory work in science subjects. However, the work does not need to be related to the assessments teachers will be carrying out to estimate grades for those who should have sat exams.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hopes to set out the second phase of school re-opening on 2 March. However, she said it was unlikely that there will be any further return to school before 15 March.\nThe key thing will be whether community transmission is under control or not. It is worth watching the daily case numbers to see if they continue to fall.\nThe likelihood is that any decisions on the return will be taken on a Scotland-wide basis.\nTeachers have until the middle of June to submit estimated grades. They need to be signed off by headteachers. The presumption is that candidates will get these grades in August unless the SQA has any cause to question them. There will be no algorithm so a school's previous record should not lead to a candidate's grades being revised up or down. \nDetailed guidance on just what sort of evidence teachers need to gather to justify their estimates has been published by the SQA. The evidence will be needed should grades be queried. Often this could involve what are, in effect, class tests using the kind of questions normally set in exams.\nThe government says the National Qualifications 2021 Group will publish further details soon on how qualifications will be awarded in a way which fairly reflects pupils' experience of remote learning.\nThis could depend on just when secondary pupils may be back in full-time. However, it is worth noting that after Easter, students are often on study leave or consolidating their courses. With no exams - and the June deadline for estimates - this time may be used to actually finish off the courses.\nIt certainly won't have a direct impact or set a precedent. The decision will be taken by the Scottish government and it will be driven purely by the data for Scotland.\nHowever, as a general rule, case numbers in Scotland are lower than in England. How might parents might react if older primary children and early secondary students returned earlier in England than Scotland, even if case numbers south of the border are higher?\nOne challenge for politicians is to try to weigh up whether there is public support for ongoing restrictions and whether the public believes their benefit balances out the harm they cause to so many areas of life. \nSo far, improving case numbers north and south of the border are largely down to lockdown restrictions. Once the impact of the vaccination programme is clearer - especially if, as expected, it substantially cuts deaths and hospital admissions - it will be interesting to see if public attitudes change.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People must be \"optimistic but patient\" about the coronavirus situation in the UK and the end to restrictions, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe PM hailed the vaccine rollout, but warned that now was not the time to \"relax\".\nHe said there were still more people in hospital than at the peak of the first wave, and steps taken to ease lockdown should be \"cautious but irreversible\".\nHe is to set out a roadmap next week for lifting England's restrictions.\nThe government said on Sunday that it had met its pledge to offer at least one Covid vaccine dose to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK. More than 15 million people have received a first dose, according to the latest government figures.\nSpeaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson hailed the \"unprecedented national achievement\" of hitting the target, but warned the threat from the virus remained \"very real\". \nThe prime minister warned that the government did not have all the \"hard facts\" about how the vaccine impacted infections and that there were still more people in hospital with Covid-19 than in April - with admissions running at 1,600 a day across the UK.\n\"We have to keep our foot to the floor,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said no decisions were being taken before he unveiled his roadmap for ending England's restrictions, but that the government wanted this lockdown \"to be the last\", with \"cautious but irreversible\" progress.\nHe added his plan next week would set out \"as much as we possibly can about the route to normality, even though some things are very uncertain\".\nAlthough he said he was \"increasingly optimistic\" he admitted he could not give \"an absolute cast-iron guarantee that we won't face further difficulties\".\n\"I don't want people to think I'm not optimistic. There's been a big change - science is now in the ascendency over the disease,\" he added.\nMr Johnson also said the government was looking at introducing rapid lateral flow testing for venues such as nightclubs and some theatres that were unable to open last year.\n\"I think that, in combination with vaccination, will probably be the route forward,\" he said.\nMichael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said the \"acknowledgement\" would give late night businesses \"the opportunity to deliver pilot schemes which will substantiate the ability for this sector to open safely at the appropriate time\".\n\"But more importantly we will be able to plan and prepare for that opportunity,\" he added.\nCould this be the last lockdown?\nThat is, of course, a huge shared hope and the government's stated aim.\nIt will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in. \nWho knew then that we'd be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later?\nBoris Johnson has been accused, at times, of over-promising and under-delivering during this crisis.\nToday, again, he's urging caution - even as case rates fall and the vaccine rollout goes well.\nThat's because ministers really don't want to lift restrictions only to reimpose them again on a weary nation.\nIt comes after more than 60 Conservative MPs wrote to Mr Johnson over the weekend, calling for a commitment to a \"free life\" and the ending of lockdown measures before May.\nSteve Baker, the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should reopen by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine.\nEarlier, No 10 said the intention was to \"start getting\" pupils back into school on 8 March, but was not ruling out the possibility that they could be sent back in stages.\nThe PM's official spokesman said it was \"important\" the planned review of restrictions was carried out this week, with details to be set out in Mr Johnson's road map on Monday.\nThe spokesman said he would not \"pre-empt\" what the road map might contain, but added: \"It remains our priority to get kids back to school and we always said we want that to start from 8 March, if the science and evidence allows.\"\nThe government is hoping to offer a jab to everyone in the first nine priority groups - including everyone over the age of 50 - by the end of April, Mr Johnson said.\nThis would run alongside giving second doses within the 12-week window to those in the top four priority groups, who have already had a first dose.\nAll those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers, are being contacted with the offer of a vaccination. \nWith every day that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that the UK is winning its fight against Covid.\nScience, as Boris Johnson said, is in the ascendancy.\nIt is easy to forget this virus only emerged just over a year ago.\nBut now the UK has approved three vaccines for use - two of which have already started to be rolled out at speed. Another two are being assessed by the regulator after promising trial results.\nThere is confidence the mutations, while presenting a challenge, can be overcome. Plans are already being made to update the vaccines if needed to work better against new variants.\nNo vaccine is 100% effective and some people may choose not to take it. That's why advances in treatment are vital, too.\nA cheap steroid, dexamethasone, is being widely used to improve the survival rates of the sickest patients. And last week it emerged an arthritis drug, tocilizumab, could also further improve survival chances.\nThere is still a long way to go, but there is a cautious belief in both Westminster and among scientists that each step made from now on should be forward not back.\nSpeaking at the same Downing Street briefing, NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens described the vaccine rollout as \"two sprints and a marathon\".\nHe said the UK had passed the \"finishing line of the first sprint\" and now had a \"second sprint between now and 30 April\" to extend the vaccine rollout to higher risk groups.\nThe \"marathon\" will involve vaccinating everybody in the country who is eligible, alongside the winter flu campaign and further booster shots if needed, Sir Simon added.\nMeanwhile, on Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October.\nA further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend.\nIn other developments:"

      "text": "An eight-year-old girl and her father, wrongly quarantined under Scotland's new hotel isolation rules, have been reunited with the girl's mother after just one day in the UK.\nChun Wong and his daughter Kiernan got the hugs they were desperate for with his wife Danielle on Tuesday after immigration delays kept them apart for 16 months.\nThey were allowed to leave their hotel after an error was discovered. \nThey will now isolate at home in Fife.\nSince Monday, all passengers arriving in Scotland on international flights have to enter \"managed isolation\". \nHowever, this does not apply to those coming from within the Common Travel Area, including the UK and Ireland.\nMr Wong and Kiernan had arrived in Edinburgh from the US via Dublin.\nThey had gone straight to a hotel at Edinburgh airport, following advice they had been given.\nLater that night they were told that as they had got a connecting flight from Ireland, they could instead isolate at home. \nThe family was finally reunited on Tuesday afternoon.\nMrs Wong told BBC Scotland about the moment she got to hug Kiernan for the first time in more than a year.\nShe said: \"I have never had that level of anxiety on my life. My legs were shaking so much and when she came out of the hotel she was scared to run to me. It was lovely and I didn't want to let her go.\"\nMr Wong added: \"I just told her to run to mummy. What a reunion to remember.\"\nHe said an official from the airport had come to see him in the hotel on Monday night. \n\"He said that it was an error on their part that since we came into the country through Dublin we didn't need to quarantine,\" he said.\n\"They were very apologetic. They said they screwed up, which I understand. It was day one and what process is perfect on day one?\"\nThe new arrivals will still carry out self-testing on the second and eighth day, in line with the isolation rules.\nTravellers who are required to self-isolate in hotels have to pay \u00a31,750 each, plus an extra fee for additional isolating guests. In Mr Wong's case that was a further \u00a3325 for Kiernan.\nThe Scottish government said it was investigating why he was \"wrongly advised\" at the airport.\nBut Mrs Wong said she had found it difficult to get the right information ahead of her family's arrival.\nShe said: \"We believed because they came from the US and the Scottish rule says that is international travel regardless of whether it is a red list country or not, they have to quarantine.\"\nShe was advised to book a quarantine hotel but again found problems with the England-based system. She said that online forms had no prompts for Scotland. \nShe added: \"It is confusing. I believe based on the regulations they should be at the hotel. I don't disagree with the stance Scotland is taking. \n\"We were willing and happy to do it. It's an appropriate measure but it needs to be made simpler for people coming here. \n\"I didn't expect this. But I am thankful because I get to see my daughter. I was frantically running to the shops this morning to stock up on food.\"\nMr Wong and Kiernan have moved to Scotland to be with Mrs Wong who has been in the country since November 2019. A dual UK/US citizen, she is a front-line NHS worker, involved in addiction services.\nThe family have been separated for 16 months, after the pandemic hit the immigration system.\nOn Monday Mr Wong said it would be \"heartbreaking\" to be apart for another 10 days if they had to isolate in a hotel.\nHe said his daughter was \"ecstatic, overjoyed and a little nervous\" as it had been more than a year since she had seen her mum.\n\"The last time she saw her she was seven and in April she'll be nine. Crazy.\"\nOn Tuesday Kiernan had two Christmases' worth of presents waiting for her at her new home.\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"We are looking into the circumstances that led to Mr Wong being wrongly advised at the airport that he needed to book a managed isolation package. This is a very new system, being implemented at pace, and some initial challenges are to be expected.  \n\"We are following up with the travel management company to ensure a full refund is provided to Mr Wong.\"\nAn Edinburgh Airport spokesman wished the Wong family well as they settled into their new life in Scotland.\nHowever, he insisted that \"inaccurate advice\" had come from the government which was evidence of the \"confusion\" the policy had created. \nThe spokesman added: \"It is a clear example of the loophole that our governments have created in action and they should work together to close it before this happens again.\"\nAll those arriving into Scotland directly from outside the Common Travel Area must pay to isolate for 10 days in a quarantine hotel.\nBut Scotland's first minister has raised concerns about the risk of people spreading new Covid variants if they arrive at airports and ferry terminals elsewhere, then travel to Scotland on public transport.\nFor example, in England only travellers from 33 \"red list\" countries must enter managed quarantine.\nUK minister Nadhim Zahawi claimed on Tuesday that the quarantine rollout had \"gone smoothly\" in England.\nMr Zahawi told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"As for day one, it's gone reasonably well, we can always do better and, of course, work with Scotland.\"\nHe added: \"Our discussions with the Scottish government will lead to a better operating system. I think it would be unwise to close the border, we are one United Kingdom.\"\nThe guidelines for international travel are published on the Scottish government website. \nA section of it says:\n\"You must also book and pay for managed isolation if you travel to Scotland from the Republic of Ireland, and have been in an acute risk country (a \"red list\" country) in the 10 days before your arrival.\n\"If you arrive in Scotland from within the Common Travel Area, but have been in a country not on the acute risk list in the 10 days before your arrival, you must self-isolate.\n\"There are some limited exemptions from isolation. You may still be required to self-isolate when you are not doing the essential activity the exemption allows.\"\nAre you currently in hotel quarantine?

      "tags": "Walmart,Asda",
      "text": "Asda has new owners. \nThe Issa brothers, two entrepreneurs from Blackburn who made billion-pound fortunes running petrol stations, have completed the deal to buy Britain's third-largest supermarket chain. \nAsda was valued at \u00a36.8bn, but the brothers and the investment firm TDR Capital paid just \u00a3780m.\nThe rest of the money was borrowed. So how does this kind of deal work? And will it leave Asda with too much debt?\nThis kind of deal is called a leveraged buyout - which means that it involves large amounts of debt.\nTDR Capital specialises in this kind of deal. It is also co-owner of EG Group, the worldwide petrol station business which built the brothers' fortune, and which also has large borrowings.\nThe Issas and TDR each contribute half of the \u00a3780m in cash to Asda's former owners, Wal-Mart, which has owned Asda since 1999.\nMost of the purchase price - just under \u00a34bn - will be borrowed. \nWalmart, the American supermarket which owned Asda for the past 21 years, will retain a small stake in Asda, for \u00a3500m, along with a seat on Asda's board. \nThen the new owners will sell off parts of Asda to raise the rest of the purchase price. \nAsda will sell its warehouses and distribution system for \u00a3950m. It will still use them, but in future, it will have to pay rent to their new owners.\nAnd Asda's 323 petrol stations will be sold for \u00a3750m to EG Group, adding to the portfolio of more than 6,000 around the world.\nThe deal is still awaiting approval from the Competition and Markets Authority, which is expected by the summer.\nBuying a \u00a36.8bn business for less than \u00a3800m has certainly raised eyebrows, but it is not unusual for buyers to put up only a small fraction of the purchase price in such big deals. \n\"10% looks low, compared to the average for leveraged buyouts as a whole of around 50%,\" says Roberto Pozzi, senior vice-president at Moody's, an agency which analyses the riskiness of company's borrowings. \n\"Keep in mind that it depends also on the stability of the business, and there is no more stable business than supermarkets,\" he adds.\nFirms such as TDR Capital, known as private equity firms, have backed nearly 5,000 buyout deals over the past decade, worth a total of \u00a3350bn, according to research firm Preqin - although the Asda buyout is the largest in more than a decade.\nWith big debts come fears that paying interest on the debt will suck money away from investing in the business or paying staff. \nBut interest rates are currently extremely low, which will made Asda's debt burden affordable.\nOn the \u00a33.7bn of Asda's debt which is being raised on public markets, the interest bill will be just \u00a3125m a year, according to Azhar Hussain, head of global credit at the Royal London Asset Management. Leasing back the warehouses will cost about \u00a357m a year. \nSo the \u00a3500m or so of cash which Asda makes each year will easily cover the interest costs incurred in the buyout, leaving plenty spare to pay down the debts and reduce Asda's borrowings even further.\nThe debt burden will be higher than supermarket rivals Tesco and Morrisons, but it's expected to fall over time as new owners pay the debts off.\nPaying back borrowers will be less of an issue than competition from other supermarkets.\nAsda may still find itself needing to cut costs, but not necessarily to pay back debts. \"Every grocer is cutting costs anyway, because of competition,\" says Mr Pozzi.\n\"Now their plan is to become more efficient and put in place a lower cost structure, because that's what everybody is doing.\"\nThe Issa brothers are new to the hyper-competitive world of UK supermarkets and they will have to learn fast, at the same time as running a vast forecourt empire.\n\"It won't be easy and they will probably have to work harder to stand still,\" says Mr Pozzi.\nAs the third-largest supermarket in the UK, Asda has seen its market share fall as discounters Aldi and Lidl have grown.\nAsda is behind in the fast-growing and profitable convenience store business, where Sainsbury's Local and Tesco Express have grown rapidly.\nThe new relationship with EG Group gives it a chance to open convenience stores in petrol stations. \nBuyout deals can be extremely profitable for the new owners. Just suppose they pay 10% of the purchase price in cash. If they increase the value by 10%, all that increase in value goes to them, so they've doubled their money.\nBig buyouts are often controversial. The GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said Asda was \"a profitable company that does not need to be loaded with debt\" and labelled the sale of the warehouses \"asset-stripping\". \nThere are stories of businesses where private equity buyouts have led to underinvestment and subsequent collapse. Debenhams is often cited as an example. But most of the thousands of private equity buyouts do not end that way.\nBusinesses with big debts pay much less tax on their profits. They can deduct the interest payments from their profits before calculating how much tax to pay, which reduces their corporation tax bill. \nSo that's a lower contribution to the costs of schools, hospitals and everything else taxes pay for.\nCompanies owned by private investors are not listed on the stock exchange, meaning private investors can't participate in its future success by buying shares. \nHowever, many pension funds will still invest in the new Asda, either by lending their share of that \u00a34bn of debt or investing in TDR Capital."

Latifa made the videos while being held under her father's orders in Dubai in a barred villa.\nSheikh Mohammed was born in 1949 at his family home in Shindagha, near Dubai Creek. He was the third of the four sons of Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum, who ruled Dubai for 32 years from 1958.\nAfter finishing secondary school in 1965, Sheikh Mohammed moved to the UK to study English at a language school in Cambridge. The young sheikh later attended a six-month training court at the British Army's Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot, Hampshire.  \nIn 1968, following his return to Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed accompanied his father to a meeting with the then ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan, at which they agreed to a union that would lead to the establishment of a federation of emirates. \nAfter the UAE gained independence from the UK in 1971, Sheikh Mohammed was named defence minster - a position he still holds.\nSheikh Mohammed also became heavily involved in his father's plan to compensate for Dubai's dwindling oil reserves by diversifying its economy and becoming an international trade and financial centre, as well as a tourist destination.\nToday, more than 95% of the emirate's gross domestic product is non-oil-based, with tourism contributing 20%.\nDubai's population has also grown from about 40,000 in the 1960s to 3.3 million, including almost 3.1 million non-Emiratis, many of whom live in the hundreds of high-rise buildings filling its skyline.\nIn 1990, Sheikh Rashid died after a long illness resulting from a stroke. He was succeeded by Mohammed's eldest brother, Maktoum.\nFive years later, Sheikh Maktoum named Mohammed crown prince of Dubai. He also handed over much of the day-to-day running of the emirate to him.\nSheikh Mohammed became ruler of Dubai and vice-president and prime minister of the UAE in 2006, after his brother died aged 62 during a visit to Australia. \nUnder his leadership, Dubai's development continued apace. \nIn 2008, the emirate unveiled the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa; Dubai Mall, then world's largest shopping centre by total land area; and the Dubai Metro.\nSuch ambitious projects were, however, reliant on borrowing billions of dollars. \nThe global financial crisis caused Dubai's real estate market to crash and in 2009 state-linked companies came close to defaulting on their debts. Abu Dhabi stepped in and loaned the Dubai government the money it desperately needed. \nDubai's construction boom also relied on low-paid migrant construction workers, many of whom complained that they suffered exploitation.\nSheikh Mohammed has also become famous for his involvement in horseracing, and is credited with transforming it into a global industry. \nHe rode horses on beaches in Dubai as a child and was introduced to the sport in 1967 in the UK. Ten years later, he enjoyed his first success as an owner.\nThe sheikh subsequently set up the world's largest horseracing team, Godolphin, as well as the successful stallion breeding operation, Darley. \nGodolphin - which has facilities in the UAE, England, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, Japan and the US - has won 6,000 races across the world since 1992, including 315 prestigious Group One races. \nSheikh Mohammed frequently attends major horseracing events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe sheikh shared a love of horses with his sixth and \"junior\" wife, Princess Haya bint Al Hussein, the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and half-sister of King Abdullah II. The pair married in Amman in 2004 and had two children, Al Jalila and Zayed.\nPrincess Haya painted a picture of a perfect family life in interviews, but cracks began to appear in 2018 when Princess Latifa, one of Sheikh Mohammed's adult daughters with another wife, tried to flee the UAE with the help of a former French spy and a Finnish fitness instructor. \nA boat carrying them was intercepted at sea off the coast of India and Latifa was returned to Dubai. In a video filmed beforehand, she alleged that she had been imprisoned for more than three years and subjected to physical abuse after another unsuccessful escape attempt in 2002. \nNow, new videos made by Latifa have been released after being obtained by the BBC's investigative current affairs programme, Panorama.\nThe footage was recorded over several months by Latifa after she had been taken back to Dubai following her failed escape in 2018. They were made using a phone that was secretly given to her by friends who are campaigning for her freedom.\nIn the videos, she describes how she fought back against the soldiers during her capture, before being tranquillised and flown back to Dubai. She said she was being held alone without access to medical or legal help in a villa with windows and doors barred shut, and guarded by police. The secret messages have since stopped, leading her friends to urge the UN to step in.\nAfter the 2018 escape attempt, Princess Haya had backed claims by the Dubai government that Latifa had been \"vulnerable to exploitation\" and was \"now safe\". But after fleeing Dubai for the UK via Germany along with their children in April 2019, sources alleged that she had become aware of new information relating to Latifa.\nSheikh Mohammed did not comment on the breakdown of his marriage, but he did write an angry poem accusing an unnamed woman of \"treachery and betrayal\" and posted it on Instagram.\nIn July 2019, Haya applied for a forced marriage protection order and a non-molestation order at the UK High Court in London - as well as wardship of their children. Sheikh Mohammed meanwhile applied for the children's return to Dubai.\nEight months later, the High Court issued a series of fact-finding judgements that said Sheikh Mohammed had ordered and orchestrated the forcible return of Latifa in 2002 and 2018, as well as the unlawful abduction of her elder sister Princess Shamsa in 2000. \nShamsa fled the family's UK estate in Surrey that year but was later recaptured in Cambridgeshire by agents of the sheikh and forcibly returned to Dubai. A request by Cambridgeshire Police to visit Dubai to investigate was refused.\nThe court found that Sheikh Mohammed \"continues to maintain a regime whereby both these two young women are deprived of their liberty\".\nIt also said Haya, who'd had an adulterous affair with a bodyguard, was now living in fear of her life after receiving numerous threats both in Dubai and in London. These included a pistol placed on her pillow.\nSheikh Mohammed rejected the judgements and findings, and appealed unsuccessfully to keep them out of the public domain. \nHe said the appeal was \"made to protect the best interests and welfare of the children\" and that the \"outcome does not protect my children from media attention in the way that other children in family proceedings in the UK are protected\".\n\"As a head of government, I was not able to participate in the court's fact-finding process. This has resulted in the release of a 'fact-finding' judgment which inevitably only tells one side of the story,\" he added."

      "text": "US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says Congress will establish an \"outside, independent\" commission to investigate the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump.\nIn a letter to lawmakers, she said the commission would be modelled on the inquiry into the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York and the Pentagon.\n\"We must get to the truth of how this happened,\" she said.\nFormer President Trump was acquitted by the Senate of inciting the violence.\nBut Democrats and some Republicans have backed an independent investigation into the riots, which left five people dead.\nMrs Pelosi said that retired US Army Lt Gen Russel Honor\u00e9 had, over the past few weeks, been assessing the security needs of the Capitol in light of the attack.\nThe commission, she said, \"would investigate and report on the facts and causes\" of the attack; \"the interference with the peaceful transfer of power\"; and the \"preparedness and response\" of both the Capitol police and other branches of law enforcement.\nShe also said that, based on Lt Gen Honor\u00e9's initial findings, Congress needed to allocate additional funding to \"provide for the safety of members and the security of the Capitol\".\nA group of House Republicans wrote to Mrs Pelosi on Monday complaining that their party had not been consulted about the general's security review.\nIn the letter, they also demanded to know what Mrs Pelosi knew and the instructions she gave to secure the Capitol ahead of 6 January. \nHouse Republican Adam Kinzinger, who called for Mr Trump's removal after the riots, was condemned by 11 members of his family in a handwritten letter, in which they said he was in cahoots with \"the devil's army\".\n\"Oh my, what a disappointment you are to us and to God!\" they wrote to the Illinois representative, who was one of 10 Republicans to vote to impeach Mr Trump last month, denouncing his \"horrible, rude accusations of President Trump\", the New York Times reports.\n\"It is now most embarrassing to us that we are related to you,\" they said in the 8 January letter. \"You have embarrassed the Kinzinger family name!\"\nMr Trump survived his second impeachment trial on Saturday, after Democrat prosecutors failed to secure the two-thirds majority needed to convict him. He is the only president to have faced the process twice.\nThe vote split largely along party lines, with seven Republicans joining the Senate's 48 Democrats and two independents in voting to convict.\nThe senior Republican in Congress, Senator Mitch McConnell, had voted against conviction on constitutional grounds, but after the vote declared Mr Trump \"responsible\" for the assault on the Capitol.\n\"President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office,\" Mr McConnell told the chamber. \"He didn't get away with anything yet.\"\nOther Republicans have also expressed support for an independent inquiry into the riots, including a close ally of Mr Trump, Senator Lindsay Graham. He told Fox News Sunday that the former president bore some culpability. \n\"His behaviour after the election was over the top,\" he said. \"We need a 9/11 commission to find out what happened and make sure it never happens again.\""

      "text": "Fake reviews for products sold on Amazon's Marketplace are being sold online \"in bulk\", according to Which?\nThe consumer group found 10 websites selling fake reviews from \u00a35 each and incentivising positive reviews in exchange for payment or free products.\nIt suggested the firm was facing an \"uphill struggle\" against a \"widespread fake reviews industry\".\nAn Amazon spokesman said: \"We remove fake reviews and take action against anyone involved in abuse.\"\nThe retail giant's Marketplace allows other retailers to sell their goods via the Amazon website. \nWhich? identified websites offering review services for goods for sale on Amazon Marketplace that violated the firm's terms and conditions.\nThese included \"packages\" of fake reviews available for sellers to buy for about \u00a315 individually, as well as bulk packages starting at \u00a3620 for 50 reviews and going up to \u00a38,000 for 1,000.\nThe group also suggested that five of the businesses it looked at had more than 702,000 \"product reviewers\" on their books.\nProduct reviewers are offered small payments ranging from a few pounds up to more than \u00a310, alongside free or discounted products. They can even take part in \"loyalty schemes\" and earn themselves premium goods, from children's toys to exercise equipment.\nThe websites Which? reviewed also offered advice on how to write reviews so as not to arouse Amazon's suspicion, and in some cases had criteria for reviewers to meet to qualify for rewards, it said. They included leaving reviews that were at least two sentences long, or including photos, for example.\nRead more on how to spot fake reviews here\nNatalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?, called on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to look into the sale of fake reviews urgently.\n\"The regulator must crack down on bad actors and hold sites to account if they fail to keep their users safe,\" she said.\n\"If it is unable to do so, the government must urgently strengthen online consumer protections.\"\nA previous investigation by the consumer group found dozens of Facebook groups with sellers offering refunds or commissions in exchange for fake, favourable reviews.\nIt led to Facebook and eBay signing agreements with the CMA to \"better identify, investigate and respond to fake and misleading reviews\".\nBut Ms Hitchins said: \"Amazon, and other online platforms, must do more to proactively prevent fake reviews infiltrating their sites so that consumers can trust the integrity of their reviews.\"\nAn Amazon spokesman pointed out that it worked with other tech firms to \"report bad actors\", but added that online retailers \"cannot do this alone\".\nHe said that customers need to be able to trust the reviews they see online and that more enforcement powers should be given to regulators such as the CMA.\nAs demand for online shopping grew at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the UK regulator launched a review into how different websites detect and respond to fake and misleading reviews.\nThe authority warned last May it would \"not hesitate\" to take action if sites were disobeying the law.\nThat could include taking major retailers to court, although it did not name the specific websites it would be investigating."

      "tags": "Bitcoin,Economics",
      "text": "Digital currency Bitcoin has risen to a new record high of more than $50,000 (\u00a336,000).\nThe so-called cryptocurrency, which was created by an unknown inventor, has risen about 72% this year.\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are generated by computers. Part of its supposed value comes from the finite number that can be computed.\nBut regulators have warned that they are risky, since their value can change fast, both downwards and upwards.\nMuch of this year's gain for Bitcoin came after Elon Musk's Tesla bought $1.5bn of them and said it would accept them as payment for its cars.\nSupporters say Bitcoin can act as a store of value, like a digital version of gold. \n\"If that narrative comes to fruition, then the growth potential is off the charts as $50,000 per bitcoin equates to a market cap of roughly $931bn, which is almost 9% of gold,\" said John Wu, president at blockchain company Ava Labs.\n\"If BTC meets gold's market cap, then that would be at least $500,000 per bitcoin.\"\nValuing Bitcoin is difficult, and pricing is susceptible to large swings because of the limited number which are traded. Many supporters are holding on to them in anticipation of higher valuations. Should they all sell at once, the price could tumble.\nWith no intrinsic value, unlike a physical asset such as land, and no ability to generate an income, unlike a company or bond, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and can crash as fast as they rise.\nCritics point out that while Bitcoin may have a finite supply of units - 21 million - the number of cryptocurrencies is ever-growing and potentially limitless.\nPeople have lost large amounts of money in steep drops in the value of cryptocurrencies and in hacks and scams associated with them.\nBritain's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), opened 52 investigations into suspected cryptocurrency frauds in the year to 30 June 2020, according to a Freedom of Information request from law firm RPC.\nThat was fewer than the 59 opened in the previous 12 months, sparking speculation that the regulator was short of resources to tackle cryptocurrency frauds. \n\"Given explosive growth in high-risk cryptocurrency and related frauds, we would expect the number of FCA investigations to jump up and not fall away,\" said Sam Tate, partner at RPC.\n\"The sheen of respectability now being given to cryptocurrencies is being taken advantage of by cyber-criminals and online fraudsters.\"\nThe FCA declined to comment on the figures.\nBitcoin's value dropped by $5,000 on 4 January to about $29,000 before recovering the lost ground. On 11 Jan, it dropped $9,000 to $32,000.\nBecause cryptocurrencies can pass international borders quickly and are not regulated in the same way as cash or regular investments, investigating thefts is hard.\nLast month, the FCA issued a stark warning to investors in so-called cryptoassets.\nThe financial watchdog said investors should be \"prepared to lose all their money\" should their investment's value collapse."

But when I do, if I'm driving the car or wherever I have to pull over because it's just horrendous. \n\"No-one should have to see their daughter like that.\"\nEmily was with her father riding her scooter in the park on Mother's Day when she was killed.\nThe youngster spotted her mother, who was jogging, and was calling out to her as she scooted past a bench where Skana was sitting, alone and armed with a craft knife.\nSkana, originally from Albania, grabbed Emily and slit her throat before running off.\nMr Jones said Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust had \"let their patient down\" and said his daughter's death \"could have been prevented had they done a better job\".\n\"The fundamental thing is that she was un-medicated on the day and they had a suspicion,\" he said.\nThe court heard Skana's sister had indicated to the mental health team that she was not taking her medication. \nMr Jones said Skana had a history of not taking pills and the trust \"bowed down to her demands to put her on oral medication\". \n\"She'd threatened children before, she'd threatened a friend's daughter who was 13, she went round there with a knife,\" he said.\n\"She'd attacked her mother with an iron, her sister had to lock herself in her room. This is a woman who's got a history of violence when she's un-medicated.\"\nMr Jones said he was unhappy with the trust's internal review of the case, which outlined failings but concluded Emily's death was not preventable, and likened it to \"marking your own homework\".\n\"It's an insult to my family for Greater Manchester mental health not to admit some liability. I will keep fighting until I get an apology from them,\" he said.\n\"It's got to stop. There are dangerous people out there and the only people who can protect us are the authorities.\"\nAn NHS review into Emily's death is taking place.\nNeil Thwaite, chief executive of the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"We welcome the decision to commission an independent investigation into this tragic incident.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "NI Health,Northern Ireland Assembly,Abortion in Northern Ireland",
      "text": "The DUP has proposed a new law to prevent abortions being carried out in NI in cases of non-fatal disabilities.\nNI's abortion laws changed significantly last year following legislation passed at Westminster.\nThere is no time limit for terminations when there is a \"substantial risk\" a fetus would suffer a severe mental or physical impairment.\nCampaigners have argued the law allows abortions without time limit for conditions such as Down's syndrome.\nA private member's bill brought by Paul Givan, backed by disability rights campaign group Don't Screen Us Out, is seeking to overturn the law.\nOne high-profile activist involved in the campaign is Heidi Crowter, who has Down's syndrome.\nShe is also taking a separate legal action against the UK government regarding a similar element in the 1967 Abortion Act, which applies in Great Britain.\nHowever, the UK government has said it is legally bound to provide \"access to abortions in cases of severe fetal impairment, not only fatal fetal abnormalities\".\nIn the Republic of Ireland, abortions are allowed in cases of fatal fetal abnormality, but this does not apply for conditions such as Down's syndrome.\nMr Givan's bill represents the first legislative attempt since devolution was restored in Northern Ireland to amend the abortion laws introduced by the UK government.\nHe said the legislation would not seek to amend the law for abortions in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities and that it was about removing discrimination against people with disabilities.\n\"This is an opportunity for people to come together and fight a prejudicial, discriminatory piece of legislation,\" he told the Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"We have introduced laws called the Disability Act of 1995 and we have built upon that to place duties on public authorities and support people with disabilities.\n\"I believe that those rights - and these are human rights - ought to be conferred upon people before they are born and that is what this campaign is going to be about.\n\"I believe there is a majority of assembly members that agree with this, as does the majority of the public.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in called on Health Minister Robin Swann to commission the provision of abortion services without further delay.\n\"Our priority is to provide appropriate, modern and compassionate healthcare services for women across the island,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"The legislation enacted at Westminster in 2019 put a legal responsibility on the British secretary of state to ensure that the recommendations of the Cedaw (UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women) report are implemented in the north, and gives him the powers to make any necessary changes to the law in order for the north to comply with Cedaw.\n\"Therefore the DUP bill is going nowhere.\" \nPaula Bradshaw, of the Alliance Party, challenged Mr Givan. She said checks and balances were already in place.\n\"If he [Mr Givan] thinks these terminations are taken lightly by a woman who has received such a devastating diagnosis, or a healthcare professional who has devoted their whole life to healthcare and supporting women, it is horrendously disrespectful,\" she said.\n\"I'm not pro-abortion, I'm pro-choice.\n\"A woman has to be supported when she's presented with this diagnosis to explore all options for managing the rest of her pregnancy.\"\nThe moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Rev David Bruce, welcomed Mr Givan's bill and has encouraged \"as many MLAs as possible\" to give their backing.\n\"We vigorously opposed the imposition of abortion legislation by Westminster on Northern Ireland, as we believed at the time, as we continue to maintain today, that it would create the most extreme and most liberal abortion regime anywhere in these islands, which it has done,\" he said, in a statement.\nDr Bruce said that many aspects of the current legislation are \"morally wrong and unjustifiable\".\nIn a statement, the UK government said the law requires it to implement recommendations made by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (Cedaw) report in 2018, including \"providing access to abortions in cases of severe fetal impairment, not only fatal fetal abnormalities\".\n\"While abortion remains a devolved issue, the assembly can only legislate in a way that remains compatible with Convention rights,\" it added.\n\"We remain of the firm view that the 2020 Abortion Regulations are compatible with our international obligations, including under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\"\nIn July 2019, MPs voted to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland and create new laws. \nStormont was not functioning due to a row between the main power-sharing parties.\nA new framework for abortion services in NI was then drawn up by the Northern Ireland Office and took effect last March.  \nIt made terminations legal in all circumstances within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nA 24-week limit would apply in situations where continuing a pregnancy would involve risk of injury to the woman's physical or mental health.\nBut there is no term limit in cases of fatal fetal abnormality where there is a substantial risk that the fetus would die or, if born, would suffer a severe mental or physical impairment.\nLast year, the Stormont assembly supported a non-binding motion rejecting the laws. \nPaul Givan has no memory of his great uncle Samuel but grew up listening to stories about him.\nHe had Down's syndrome and died at the age of 57.\nFor him, this move today is both personal and political as his bill -  if successful  - will allow MLAs to change part of Northern Ireland's new abortion laws, which were approved at Westminster while Stormont was in suspension. \nThe DUP have worked out their sums and believe the bill could secure the support of 75 of Stormont's 90 MLAs.\nThat calculation is based on a series of votes in the Stormont chamber last year when an amendment similar to this bill was proposed by Sinn F\u00e9in.\nIt was defeated at the time but Paul Givan believes with the support of his party this time and other anti-abortion MLAs it could get over the line.\nBut predicting outcomes in the Stormont chamber is a risky business and there is no guarantee the voting patterns will remain the same.\nWhat is for sure is that we can expect some heated and emotive exchanges across the assembly floor and maybe a legal challenge in the courts.\nThe DUP is opposed to abortion, while Sinn F\u00e9in voted to change its stance in 2018 and supports it in most circumstances. \nThe SDLP, UUP and Alliance Party view abortion as a matter of conscience so it is up to individual MLAs how they vote on the issue.\nThe new regulations came into force weeks after the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic began.\nStormont's Department of Health said that the full commissioning of abortion services in NI would need to be discussed by the executive.\nSome health trusts then started providing interim services, allowing early medical abortions within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe latest figures from the Department of Health state that since the new abortion laws came into place on 31 March 2020, 1,091 notifications of terminated pregnancies have been received. \nThe British government has been providing funding to allow women from NI seeking abortion services to continue travelling to England."

      "text": "Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. \nWhat are the current rules?\nYou can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unless you have to self-isolate because you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. \nAll holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. \nIf you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. \nAnyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before.\nPeople travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law.\nSome UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding. Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nThe number of people being asked to shield in England is to be expanded, the government has announced. An extra 1.7 million people are expected to be added to the 2.3 million already on the list. Half of the group have not yet been vaccinated so will now be prioritised urgently by their local GPs. It comes after a new model was developed that takes into account extra factors rather than just health, including ethnicity, deprivation and weight, to work out a person's risk of becoming seriously ill if they were to catch Covid.\nThe youngest pupils are to return to Scotland's classrooms for face-to-face teaching from next week. The move will see all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school returning from Monday 22 February. Other age groups will continue to learn from home, apart from some secondary pupils who need to complete coursework. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was unlikely that any other pupils would return to school before 15 March at the earliest, while all other lockdown measures will remain in place until at least the end of this month. You can read more about the plans for reopening schools across the UK here.\nEngland's vaccination programme is starting to pay off, with the over-80s age group now the most likely to test positive for coronavirus antibodies, Office for National Statistics testing suggests. Blood tests reveal that more over-80s than any other age group in England are showing signs of some immunity against Covid infection. Previously, younger age groups who were more likely to be exposed to the virus were the most likely to test positive for antibodies. It comes as Covid deaths have fallen - although overall, deaths are still 40% above the five-year average.\nFour air passengers have each been fined \u00a310,000 for failing to declare they had travelled from a \"red-list\" country, West Midlands Police has said. They were stopped at border control by officials and were not able to leave Birmingham Airport. Under new rules in force since Monday, arrivals in England have to quarantine in hotels if they have been in one of 33 countries deemed a high Covid risk within the last 10 days. \nWithin weeks, Cuba's domestically-produced Covid-19 vaccine, Soberana 2, will be tested on tens of thousands of volunteers, with the government hoping to give the jab to everyone on the island by the end of the year. It is an ambitious goal but a realistic one as Cuba has more than 30 years of experience in biotechnology and immunology, including producing the first meningitis B vaccine in the late 1980s. The BBC's Will Grant has been finding out more about how Cuba hopes to become the first Latin American country to produce its own coronavirus jab.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page, including this piece looking at which groups are being vaccinated first in the UK.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon\u00a0is due to set out later her government's plans for getting pupils currently in Covid lockdown back into classrooms. Currently, the youngest pupils and older children who have to do coursework are due back in from next week. And while Ms Sturgeon has said she is \"very keen\" to have a phased return to school, Scottish ministers will review\u00a0the latest coronavirus data and scientific advice before confirming the next steps later. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said that speedy tests which would show if a person is infectious could be the way to reopen parts of the UK economy which have been closed since the pandemic began - such as nightclubs - and places that have struggled with social distancing, like theatres.\u00a0But Mr Johnson stressed that it was early days and any steps towards lifting lockdown measures would be \"cautious but irreversible\".\nHotel quarantine for people flying back to the UK began on Monday, but for one family from Fife, a lack of familiarity with the rules meant they ended up spending a night in an Edinburgh Airport hotel instead of going home. The Scottish government requires all arriving passengers to enter \"managed isolation\" and because Chun Wong and his daughter had flown to Scotland from the US they were required to check in to a hotel. But officials realised a mistake had been made because Mr Wong had transited via Dublin, and so therefore should be treated as an arrival from the Irish Republic, which is exempt from the rules. The Wongs are due to return home to Fife on Tuesday.\nThe government says it hopes to make Covid a manageable disease like flu. Vaccination and new treatments, they argue, will reduce the death rate, allowing us to live with the virus rather than constantly trying to fight it. Is this the right approach? And is it even possible? Wiping Covid from the face of the Earth would, of course, be great given the death and destruction it has caused. But the only problem with that is this has only been achieved with one virus before - smallpox in 1980. It is easy to forget flu kills. Back in 2017-18 more than 20,000 people died from it.

      "title": "Covid immunity: Can you catch it twice?",
      "tags": "Medical research,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "Coronavirus is a completely new infection in people. \nNobody had immunity at the start of the pandemic - and knowing more about immunity is crucial for understanding what happens next.\nOur immune system is the body's defence against infection and it comes in two parts.\nThe first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as the innate immune response and includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells. \nBut this system is not specific to coronavirus. It will not learn and it will not give you immunity to the coronavirus. \nInstead you need the adaptive immune response. This includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop it - and T cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response. \nThis takes time - studies suggest it takes about 10 days to start making antibodies that can target the coronavirus and the sickest patients develop the strongest immune response. \nIf the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future. \nIt's not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response.\nUnderstanding of the role of T-cells is still developing, but a recent study found people testing negative for coronavirus antibodies may still have some immunity.\nFor every person testing positive for antibodies, it was found two had T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells.\n\"They look rather durable and are being made in almost all exposed people,\" said Prof Danny Altmann from Imperial College London.\nThe immune system's memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others. \nMeasles is highly memorable - one bout should give lifelong immunity (as the weakened version in the MMR vaccine does). However, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter.\nThe new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts.\nBut a recent study led by Public Health England (PHE) shows most people who have had the virus are protected from catching it again for at least five months (the duration of the analysis so far). \nSome are reinfected, however, and, even if asymptomatic, can then harbour high levels of the virus in their noses and mouths, which can be passed on to others. \nPHE will continue to monitor the people in this study, who are all healthcare workers, to see how long immunity lasts. \nOther clues may come from studies involving other coronaviruses. \nFour produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients could be re-infected within a year.\nResearch at King's College London also suggested levels of antibodies that kill coronavirus waned over the three month study.\nBut even if antibodies disappear, then the cells that manufacture them, called B cells, may still be around. B cells for Spanish Flu have been found in people 90 years after that pandemic.\nIf the same is true with Covid, then a second infection would be milder than the first. \nIt is also not understood what happens to T cells in the long term. But T cells against the original Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) have been found 17 years later.\nMaybe.\nThe jury is still out on the field of \"cross-reactivity\" but there may be some infections that look similar enough to the virus that causes Covid that people may gain some protection.\nLaboratory tests show the T cells some people made to fight Sars or common cold coronaviruses can also react against the new coronavirus. \nHow common this is and how much protection it gives is still unknown.\nThere were early reports of people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time. \nBut the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus. \nPHE's ongoing study on immunity in healthcare workers found 44 potential re-infections in a group of 6,614 people who had previously had the virus. \nResearchers conclude reinfection is uncommon but still possible and say people must continue to follow current guidance, whether they have had antibodies or not. \nScientists from Hong Kong recently reported on the case of a young, healthy man who recovered from a bout of Covid-19 only to be re-infected more than four months later. Using genome sequencing of the virus, they could prove he caught it twice because the virus strains were different.\nExperts say re-infection isn't surprising, but it's likely to be rare, and larger studies are needed to understand why this might happen.\nThis is not guaranteed and that is why the World Health Organization is nervous about countries using immunity passports as a way out of lockdown.\nThe idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. This would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms. \nBut while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. Neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. A study of 175 recovered patients in China showed 30% had very low levels of these neutralising antibodies. \nThat is why the World Health Organization says \"that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery\".\nAnother issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn't mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others. \nEveryone's immune system is unique - some may mount more successful defensive responses than others.\nAnd people must continue to follow the current guidance as some may become reinfected and pass the virus on to others, PHE says.\nPeople who have already had Covid-19 should still have a vaccine when offered one, officials say. \nDr Julian Tang, at the University of Leicester, says:\"Having the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 is not an issue... and will likely boost the natural immunity.\n\"We also see this with the seasonal flu vaccine.\"\nPHE scientists will also monitor the immunity of the participants in its Siren study who go on to have vaccines. \nIt matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get Covid-19 multiple times and how often.\nImmunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous.\nUnderstanding immunity better could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus.\nIf it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. Or it may change how the vaccine needs to be used - will it be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot.\nAnd the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading. \nThese are all big questions we still lack answers to.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "Ex-military personnel dismissed from the armed forces because of their sexuality can now reclaim lost medals.\nUnder a new scheme to remedy historical injustices, former service personnel can apply to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to restore honours.\nIt follows Falklands veteran Joe Ousalice's successful battle to return awards he lost after being forced out of the Royal Navy for being bisexual.\nThe MoD said its past actions were \"deeply regrettable\".\nA ban on lesbian, gay, and bisexual people serving in the armed forces was lifted in 2000. Transgender people were officially allowed to openly serve in 2014.\nDefence minister Baroness Goldie explained that, due to disciplinary action and subsequent dismissal, some service personnel \"forfeited medals that they had earned\" or lost out on long service awards.\n\"I am very pleased now to be in a position to address this wrong and to invite any personnel affected or, in some circumstances, the families of those who are deceased to apply to have their medals returned,\" she said.\nMr Ousalice, from Southampton, led a campaign to restore the Long Service and Good Conduct medal and three Good Conduct badges he gave up after his 18-year service as a radio operator ended in his dismissal in 1993.\nHe was dismissed because his sexuality was believed at the time to be \"prejudicial to good order and naval discipline\".\nRecalling his experience to the BBC last year, Mr Ousalice said he felt as though he was living \"a double life\".\n\"I had to be careful about what I said and did, and where I went. Basically, I wasn't living my own life,\" he said.\n\"They cut [the medal] off my chest with a big pair of scissors.\"\nIt is not known how many LGBT service personnel the ban affected, or the number who may now be eligible to have awards restored.\nLabour's shadow armed forces minister Stephen Morgan said the announcement was an \"important step towards justice\" for those dismissed from the army because of their sexuality.\nHe called on ministers to consider restoring ranks, pensions and other forms of compensation to \"appropriately honour those who have served our country with courage and distinction\". \nVeterans minister Johnny Mercer urged anyone who might be eligible to apply and said the announcement \"demonstrates that the military is a positive place to work for all who choose to serve\".\nEach application will be reviewed by the defence council, with the MoD's medal office arranging new honours to be awarded to those who are successful.\nRelatives of former personnel affected by the LGBT ban but who have since died will also be able to make applications for a review."

      "tags": "Diversity,Disability,European Space Agency,Astronauts,International Space Station,Space exploration,Representation",
      "text": "The European Space Agency says it wants to recruit someone with a disability as part of its call for new astronauts.\nEsa will be accepting applications in March to fill four-to-six vacancies in its astro corps but it wants this draft process to be as inclusive as possible.\nThe search for a potential flier with additional functional needs will be run in parallel to the main call.\nThe agency has asked the International Paralympic Committee to advise it on selection.\n\"To be absolutely clear, we're not looking to hire a space tourist that happens also to have a disability,\" said Dr David Parker, the director of Esa's robotics and human spaceflight programme. \n\"To be very explicit, this individual would do a meaningful space mission. So, they would need to do the science; they would need to participate in all the normal operations of the International Space Station (ISS).\n\"This is not about tokenism,\" he told BBC News. \"We have to be able to justify to all the people who fund us - which is everybody, including people who happen to be disabled - that what we're doing is somehow meaningful to everybody.\"\nIndividuals with a lower limb deficiency or who have restricted growth - circumstances that have always been a bar in the past - are encouraged to apply.\nAt this stage, the selected individual would be part of a feasibility project to understand the requirements, such as on safety and technical support. But the clear intention is to make \"para-astronauts\" a reality at some point in the future, even if this takes some time.\nEsa is on a big diversity drive. On matters of gender, for example, it has lagged seriously behind.\nOnly one of its current crop of astronauts is female (Samantha Cristoforetti); likewise only one of its senior directors is a woman (Elodie Viau in telecoms). And in those leading positions on robotic space missions - the project scientist and project manager - the vast majority are still men.\nJust 16% of applicants to the last Esa astronaut call in 2008 were female. The agency wants to see that increase dramatically this time around. Applications are being accepted from 31 March to 28 May. \nTo qualify, candidates must have a master's degree (or higher) in Natural Sciences, Medicine, Engineering, Mathematics or Computer Sciences, or be qualified as an experimental test pilot.\n\"They need to be fluent in English with a good knowledge of a second language. It doesn't matter what that second language is, but it must be a second language,\" said Lucy van der Tas, Esa's head of talent acquisition.\nThe ability to speak Russian - the other language used on the space station - will be part of the training programme. \nThe recruitment process should see at least four individuals go straight into the Esa astronaut corps, which is based in Cologne, Germany.\nA further 20 candidates will additionally go into a reserve. \nThey will be contracted to make themselves available for call-up, either because of retirements among the existing astronauts or because individual Esa member states want to run a national mission to the ISS. \nThis is now possible because the American aerospace companies SpaceX and Boeing will be selling seats in their new crew capsules on a commercial basis. \nIf the member state purchased this opportunity, Esa would train up their national candidate in the reserve pool.\nThe successful candidate that has a disability will also go into a reserve. Esa will then work with its partners on the ISS to find the best way to fly a para-astronaut.\n\"We did not evolve to go to space so when it comes to space travel, we are all disabled,\" said Samantha Cristoforetti. \"What brings us from being disabled to go to space to being able to go to space is just technology. This is a feasibility study and we're going to look into what exactly is needed, how much it will cost - but that's the goal.\"\nThe last astronaut selection process saw Frenchman Thomas Pesquet; Italians Samantha Cristoforetti and Luca Parmitano; Germany's Alexander Gerst; Denmark's Andreas Mogensen; and the UK's Tim Peake join the corps in 2009. Germany's Mathias Maurer - an \"also suitable\" - joined up in 2015. \nTim Peake's selection raised some eyebrows at the time because the UK back then did not help fund Esa's human spaceflight programme. But the agency stresses that applications are accepted from all its member states, irrespective of national funding decisions.\nOf the new call, Tim Peake told BBC News: \"We're involved in the Artemis programme, which will send humans back to the surface of the Moon, and that's a gateway to Mars. So this [draft] could be recruiting the first Europeans who will set foot on Mars.\""

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Grenfell Tower Inquiry",
      "text": "The boss of the company that made the Grenfell Tower cladding has said it was not his \"priority\" to understand fire safety tests and certificates. \nClaude Schmidt, president of Arconic, told the inquiry into the fire that he only learned about a key British fire safety standard after the disaster.\nIt also heard claims the French firm \"arranged\" for some fire tests to pass. \nArconic is being investigated for not informing a British standards board about failed tests.\nThe inquiry is looking into how Grenfell Tower came to be covered in combustible materials, leading to the fire killed 72 people in June 2017.\nArconic manufactured the cladding panels in France and the product was never put through the standard test widely used in the UK construction industry.\nMr Schmidt was asked by the inquiry's lead counsel Richard Millett QC why, when he became managing director in 2007, he did not \"seek to understand thoroughly the testing and certification which supported that product\". \nSpeaking in French through an interpreter, Mr Schmidt replied: \"Because it wasn't my priority\".\n\"This is to do with fire safety and life safety. Why wasn't it your priority?\" Mr Millett asked. \nMr Schmidt said he thought these words were \"a bit too strong\". \nThere are a number of ways that building materials can comply with regulations in order to be used on high-rise buildings.\nOne of them is meeting the British standard, known as Class 0. Though some sections of the government guidance on which standards are required for certain products are disputed.\nArconic was awarded a product certificate for its cladding in the UK by the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment (BBA) in 2008. \nThis said Arconic's Reynobond PE cladding panel \"may be regarded\" as having met the Class 0 standard. The UK building industry relied heavily on it.  \nAcross the country, and at Grenfell, cladding suppliers believed that if the cladding had a BBA certificate and was Class 0, it could be used on tall buildings.\nBut the inquiry heard on Tuesday that the standard British test had not, in fact, been carried out. The French arm of Arconic relied, instead, on European tests that were similar.  \nOn top of that, there were a series of issues with the tests which were done. \nSome versions of the panel, when it was shaped into \"cassettes\" or boxes, had \"failed spectacularly\", Mr Millett said.\nArconic did not tell the BBA, so the product certificate remained in use right up to the decision to use the cladding on Grenfell Tower. \nA statement from Claude Wehrle, a technical manager who worked for Arconic, said the company believed the test was a \"rogue result\", the inquiry heard.\nThe inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, asked Mr Schmidt to respond to the view that Arconic was \"irrational and irresponsible not to carry out further tests\".\nMr Schmidt said: \"Yes... extra tests should have been carried out.\"\nWhen another version of the cladding was put through the European test in 2005 it was given a Class B rating, on a scale where A1 is the best and F is the worst.  This meant it could be used on high-rise buildings.\nBut on Tuesday the inquiry was shown an email 11 years later in which Mr Wehrle said the Class B rating had been achieved \"by 'arranging' the system to pass\".\nMr Wehrle, a French national, has refused - despite repeated requests - to come to the inquiry to give evidence, because of legal advice he says he has received.\nWhen asked how Mr Wehrle might have \"arranged\" the system to pass, Mr Schmidt said: \"I don't have an answer.\"\nThe issue of which standards the Arconic cladding met, and what testing was done on it, is at the centre of this phase of the public inquiry - and is an important component of the Metropolitan Police investigation.  \nIt is also one of the factors behind the building safety crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of people across the country. \nImmediately after the fire, residents of the Chalcots Estate in Camden, North London had to leave their homes when the fire risk of Arconic Reynobond PE aluminium composite cladding was realised. \nArconic's position has always been that it simply produced the raw materials for cladding systems, and it didn't necessarily know how they would be used, so could not know that they might not meet building regulations.\nBut on Tuesday, Mr Schmidt was asked by Mr Millett about \"occasions when Arconic did understand what project the product would be used for.\"\nAsked whether Grenfell Tower was \"an example of that\", Mr Schmidt said: \"Yes.\""

      "text": "Teachers in Northern Ireland are set to be offered a 2% pay rise for 2019/20 and 2% again in 2020/21.\nThe offer has been made following negotiations between union representatives and teaching employers.\nThe employers include representatives from the Department of Education (DE) and the Education Authority (EA).\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy had previously allocated \u00a335.4m to DE on 2 February to support a pay settlement for teachers.\nAn end to a long-running dispute over pay and workload for teachers for the years 2017/18 and 2018/19 was only reached in April 2020.\nNegotiations over 2019/20 and 2020/21 have since been taking place between the employers and the Northern Ireland Teachers Council (NITC) which represents five unions - the NASUWT, INTO, UTU, NEU and NAHT.\nThe National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has begun a consultation with their members on whether to accept the offer of a 2% rise for 2019/20 and a 2% rise for 2020/21.\nHowever, the other unions have yet to formally consult their members on the offer.\nMeanwhile, Education Minister Peter Weir has said he is \"willing to revisit\" a decision to ban schools in Northern Ireland from taking WJEC qualifications.\nWJEC is the Welsh exam board and schools in Northern Ireland use it for AS and A-levels in subjects including sociology, computer science, physical education, psychology, business, drama music and economics.\nBut Mr Weir has decided that schools here can no longer offer WJEC qualifications from September 2022.\nHe said no pupils currently taking AS or A-levels through WJEC would be affected.\nBodies representing grammar schools, drama teachers and the WJEC itself have asked Mr Weir to reconsider his stance.\nIn a letter to the NASUWT union, Mr Weir said DE officials would continue to \"engage with colleagues in Wales\".\n\"Should we receive clarification and assurances that qualifications offered by the Welsh exams board will remain compatible with curriculum policy in Northern Ireland, I would be willing to revisit my decision in relation to WJEC qualifications,\" he wrote.\nJustin McCamphill, NASUWT national official for Northern Ireland, said the minister's original decision had been \"difficult to understand\".\n\"It is nevertheless welcome that DE will now engage with WJEC in relation to the compatibility of qualifications,\" he said.\n\"Teachers who deliver WJEC qualifications remain concerned that they will no longer be able to offer these qualifications in future.\n\"It is welcome that the minister is now listening to teachers but he must ensure that this matter is resolved quickly so that teachers will be able to plan for delivery in September.\""

      "text": "A scheme to try to hold back floodwater is bidding for \u00a3800,000 to continue its work.\nThe Upper Conwy project aims to slow water from the uplands to cut flooding lower down the valley, in towns including Llanrwst. \nIt is the first time in Wales anyone has tried to tackle the problem by looking at an entire river catchment.\nThe project is a partnership between the National Trust, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and landowners.\nSo far, it has involved blocking drainage ditches in blanket bog to make ground wetter so it will hold more water for longer. \nTrees have also been planted on riverbanks to stop surface water from running into rivers so quickly and gravel and boulders have been put back into them to make the water flow more slowly.\nA bid for another \u00a3800,000 of Welsh Government funds is being made to continue the work.  \nNRW's north-west Wales operations manager, Euros Jones, said: \"The mountains used to act as a sponge, soaking up the water and supporting wildlife.  \n\"We want to work with landowners to restore that system, so the mountains can once again work like a sponge rather than like a slate roof.\"\nHe said there was a need for \"harder defences\" further down the valley. \n\"But anything we can do in the mountains to slow that flow is a good thing.\n\"But it needs to be done at scale - the more places the better.\"\nThe scheme is being done across the entire catchment of the River Conwy.  \nMr Jones added: \"It won't deal with the whole flooding problem, but it can hopefully bring the water levels down just enough to add some resilience to our defences.\"  \nThe Conwy catchment area covers 222 sq miles (574 sq km), an area the size of the Isle of Man.    \nThe Upper Conwy project started as a smaller plan to block drainage ditches in moorland near Betws-y-Coed, a place called the Migneint.   \nMore than 30,000 small dams have been built to make the blanket bog wetter and officials say the success of that led them to expand the project.\nDewi Davies, a project manager from the National Trust, said: \"In the past, there was a tendency to try to improve the landscape, to try to drain wet areas and to use rivers to carry the water away as quickly as possible.\" \nMr Davies said work had already been successful in slowing the River Machno before it entered the Conwy. \n\"The river was almost like a canal,\" he said. \n\"The banks and the bed were almost square and it had been dredged to the point where all it did was to shift the water downstream. \n\"Now it flows more slowly. It's starting to meander. What we've achieved here is small in scale, but it shows what can be done across the catchment.\"\nHe also said the work could be improving wildlife habitats: \"You notice the fish more, darting between the boulders we put back in the channel.  More fish helps other wildlife, like otters.\""

      "text": "Guidance for people in England identified as being \"clinically extremely vulnerable\" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing?\nFormal advice telling them to take extra care, or \"shield\", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. \nMost coronavirus restrictions are being lifted in England on 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else.\nHowever, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to \"think particularly carefully\" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including:\nThere is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAlthough Scotland moves to Covid protection level zero on 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said keeping the mandatory use of face coverings past then would give \"added protection and assurance\" to people who were particularly vulnerable.\nFrom 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace.\nHowever, companies still have legally binding health and safety responsibilities - and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. \nSome firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people.\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough) is available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. \nYou may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons.\nRead the updated government advice.\nAlthough the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it \"expects and recommends\" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport.\nYou should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. \nThe NHS Volunteer Responders programme is still available to offer support.\nData shows Covid vaccines are highly effective in most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection.\nBeing double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. \nYou should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not, book through the NHS website or call 119.\nThe most vulnerable people are likely to be offered booster jabs from September, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. \nYou are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions.\nThe pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The government recommends several support websites.\nIf you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on the NHS Shielded Patient List. \nA combination of factors can contribute to a person's risk, including: \nHigh risk categories include people: "

      "tags": "Companies,Jaguar Land Rover,Electric cars",
      "text": "Jaguar Land Rover's Jaguar brand will be all-electric by 2025, the carmaker has said.\nThe company will launch electric models of its entire Jaguar and Land Rover line-up by 2030, it added.\nThe firm said it would keep all three of its three British plants open as part of its new strategy.\nBut it has dropped plans to build an electric version of its XJ saloon at the Castle Bromwich plant, meaning the site will eventually stop making cars.\nChief executive Thierry Bollor\u00e9 said the plant would focus instead on \"non-production\" activities in the long term, without giving details.\nThe company plans to spend about \u00a32.5bn a year on new technology for its cars.\nThis is a big move for Jaguar Land Rover, but the reality is it has little choice. \nLike other manufacturers, it is under pressure to reduce the CO2 emissions from its fleet, as new regulations come into force in Europe and elsewhere. At the same time, sales of diesels - which generally produce less CO2 than petrol engines - have been plummeting.\nAnd in the longer term, the UK government wants to outlaw the sale of all wholly petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Governments in other countries are moving in the same general direction.  \nThe problem is, electric cars cost more to design and build than conventional models, meaning it is currently hard to make a profit from them. Bigger manufacturers can throw money at the problem now, and hope to benefit from economies of scale later. \nJLR is a smaller company and can't do that - so instead it will re-emphasise Jaguar's credentials as a luxury brand when it goes all-electric.\nThat might make sense from a marketing point of view, but making the sums add up looks like a steep challenge.\nIt will also invest in hydrogen fuel cell technology. Fuel cells provide electric power, without producing tailpipe emissions - water is the only by-product. \nHowever, in order for them to be truly environmentally friendly, the hydrogen itself needs to be produced using renewable sources.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the announcement was \"a huge step for British car manufacturing\".\nCarmakers are under pressure to meet stringent carbon emission demands in Europe and China, as well as customer demand for high-performance electric cars with a luxury or performance feel.\nThe UK plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.\nLuxury car brand Bentley Motors, owned by Germany's Volkswagen, said in November its range will be fully electric by 2030, and last month General Motors said it aimed to have a zero tailpipe emission line-up by 2035."

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "The Scottish government is \"satisfied\" it has hit its latest vaccination target - but has warned that progress is set to slow down in the coming days.\nMinisters aimed to give a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to all over-70s and the clinically vulnerable by Monday.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said everyone in this group should have been offered an appointment.\nShe urged anyone who had not received one to contact the government, and said \"nobody is going to be left behind\".\nHowever, she said the rate of progress was set to \"decline a bit\" due to supply issues, with health teams \"unlikely to vaccinate more than 30,000 people a day this week\".\nThis would be fewer than half of the number of people vaccinated on several days over the past week, but Ms Sturgeon said staff \"stand ready to pick up the pace as soon as supplies allow\".\nMonday is the final day for the government to reach its target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all over-70s and those deemed to be extremely clinically vulnerable.\nMs Sturgeon said she was \"satisfied we have met that target\", and that everyone in these groups had been offered the vaccine.\nA \"significant number of people\" had to rebook appointments due to the severe weather over the past week, but Ms Sturgeon said levels of uptake were already \"well beyond the 80% target we set out in our deployment plan\".\nThe first minister said \"close to 100%\" of older care home residents and over-80s in the community had been given a first dose, along with 99% of 75 to 79-year-olds.\nAnd she said the uptake rate for those aged 70 to 74 was already at 85%, with more booked in for Monday.\nMs Sturgeon said this was \"without a doubt a significant achievement\", which in time would \"reduce deaths from Covid-19 significantly\".\nThe vaccination rate is expected to dip over the coming weeks due to a combination of factors, including a reduction in supplies.\nMs Sturgeon said Pfizer had \"re-phased its delivery over the coming period\". The same number of vials will be delivered, but over a different timescale.\nShe also said the higher than expected uptake of vaccines meant more doses had been used than anticipated, while more stocks would have to start being held back for second doses.\nSome vaccination centres like the NHS Louisa Jordan may move from seven days a week operation to five to reflect this.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon stressed that \"we are not talking about closing vaccination centres\" and said the system could pick up pace \"very rapidly\" once supplies are available.\nShe said: \"We're going to see these issues through this programme, that's in the nature of it, but it shouldn't take away from the fact we are in a much better position than we thought we would be in.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the vaccination target being hit was \"great news\" and that the government must now work on a \"route map\" towards easing lockdown.\nHe said: \"Understandably specific dates set in stone are not possible because as the virus mutates it can get stronger variants, as we've seen over the last 10 or 11 months.\n\"But we need to know the triggers that will be in place for all school pupils to go back, for businesses to reopen - will we have a tiered approach or a national approach?\n\"These are the crucial points that businesses really need to be aware of so we can see our way out of this crisis.\"\nMs Sturgeon's cabinet is due to decide on Tuesday morning whether more pupils can return to Scotland's schools in the coming weeks, with an announcement to follow at Holyrood in the afternoon.\nThe first minister said she was \"very keen\" to go ahead with the phased return of children to schools.\nShe said there would be \"trade-offs\" over the coming months as the country eases out of lockdown, with schools and care home visiting \"the kind of things we focus on first as we try to get things back to normal\"."
