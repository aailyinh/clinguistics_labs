We have lost a son, his siblings have lost a brother and others have lost a friend. \n\"The passing of this incredibly talented young boy will be felt by us all.\"\nThe suspects were arrested on Tuesday afternoon, including a 13-year-old boy who was detained in Walsall and another boy, aged 14, who was arrested from a vehicle in Cheshire.\nThe other suspects are men aged between 33 and 38. \nOne, aged 38, was arrested in the same vehicle as the 14-year-old boy, and the 33-year-old was arrested at an address in Kingstanding.\nThe other two, aged 35 and 36, surrendered to police stations in the West Midlands.\nThe force confirmed it had referred the case to the Independent Office for Police Conduct as it examines previous incidents involving Dea-John.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Amazon is to expand its Covid testing lab facilities in the UK as the pandemic continues.\nThe online giant said this was to benefit employees and UK public health.\nHowever, analysts said it could also provide business opportunities in the health sector and buff up Amazon's reputation after questions over working conditions.\nAmazon recently moved into the online pharmacy business in the US for subscribers to its Prime service.\nIn 2020, the online retailing giant set up laboratories in Kentucky and in Greater Manchester to process employees' PCR tests.\nThe lab in Manchester has processed 900,000 test samples to date.\nThe test results are anonymous and will be shared with Public Health England once the lab is approved for sequencing.\nIts coronavirus response efforts have so far cost the company $11.5bn (\u00a38.1bn). \nTom Forte, managing director and senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson, said Amazon could convert staff Covid-19 testing and healthcare clinics for consumer use.\n\"We believe Covid-19 inspired Amazon to accelerate its healthcare-related efforts, by necessity.\n\"That said, we had long believed healthcare was an attractive opportunity for Amazon given its large market size and chances for the company to both improve the customer experience and lower the costs.\"\nThere are very few companies in the world who could have decided to build a state of the art diagnostics lab and have it functioning within months, but Amazon is one of them. \nWhile the company insists that at the moment this site is purely to help keep their staff safer at work, they are sending out a very clear message.\nThey are able to process medical diagnostics and feed that information into public health agencies.\nRight now this multimillion-pound site in Salford is only testing for Covid-19, but it's unlikely to be left idle after the pandemic.\nAmazon's most valuable product is the information they already hold about their customers, and medical data is a very rich pool indeed to be dipping their toes into.\nLab director Luke Meredith joined Amazon from the World Health Organization and works alongside 70 Amazon lab technicians at the site in Wardley, Manchester.\n\"What we decided during the Covid outbreak is that we really needed to maximise protection for safe working in the fulfilment centres,\" he told the BBC.\nAt the moment, the two sites are processing samples from staff across Europe and the Americas, tapping into the company's logistics network.\nNeil Travis, North West regional director for Amazon UK, said: \"For now, we are focused on the safety of our colleagues.\"\nJames Moar, lead analyst for Juniper Research, thinks that Amazon's expansion of its testing laboratories is \"intended to enhance Amazon's reputation\", although he said Amazon would be unlikely to pass up a business opportunity.\nThere have been a number of controversies about how Amazon treats its staff.\nOn Wednesday, a report found that staff at its warehouses in the US are injured at a higher rate than those doing similar jobs at other companies' warehouses.\nEarlier this year, the company apologised for falsely denying that its drivers were having to urinate in plastic bottles.                                         \nAnd during the first wave of the pandemic, the company was accused of \"cutting corners\" on Covid safety, which it denied.\nHowever, Mr Moar thinks that having the laboratories could be useful to Amazon in the future.\n\"Amazon has tried to get into healthcare in a number of ways,\" he said.\n\"This is basically Amazon saying that as well as providing the facilities for its employees' healthcare, it's a demonstration that they can work to provide healthcare services.\n\"This means they've already got some groundwork to show any potential partners.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Tesco,Retailing,Gender pay gap,Pay",
      "text": "Thousands of current and former Tesco workers have won a legal argument in their fight for equal pay. \nThe European Court of Justice has ruled that an EU law could be relied on in making equal pay claims against their employer. \nTesco workers, mostly women, have argued that they failed to receive equal pay for work of equal value with colleagues in its distribution centres who are mostly men. \nThey said this breached EU and UK laws. \nTesco, the UK's biggest retailer, and law firm Leigh Day, acting on behalf of the workers, sought clarification from the Court of Justice of the European Union. \nThey asked the court to rule on a specific aspect of European law - whether the so-called \"single source\" test applies to businesses in the UK. \nUnder EU law, a worker can be compared with somebody working in a different establishment if a \"single source\" has the power to correct the difference in pay. \nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that Asda shop workers can compare their roles with those of their colleagues in distribution centres for the purposes of equal pay. This ruling mainly focused on the UK legal test for comparability.  \nAccording to Leigh Day, the latest decision reinforces the Supreme Court's ruling and makes it extremely difficult for other supermarkets to argue the roles of shop workers cannot be compared with those of their colleagues in distribution centres. \nKiran Dauka, a partner in the employment team at Leigh Day, said: \"This judgement reinforces the Supreme Court's ruling that the roles of shop floor workers can be compared to those of their colleagues in distribution centres for the purposes of equal pay. \n\"For a long time, employers have argued that UK law in this area is unclear, but this judgment is simple: if there is a single body responsible for ensuring equality, the roles are comparable.\n\"Clarification from the CJEU confirms that this single source test can be relied upon by people in the UK bringing an equal value claim. This means that employers can no longer hide behind the grey areas of UK law.\n\"It's time for supermarkets to accept that the roles of shop floor workers and distribution centre workers are comparable.\" \nPam Jenkins, who works at Tesco, said: \"To get a judgement confirming shop floor workers can use an easier legal test to compare their jobs to male colleagues in distribution is uplifting.\n\"I've always been proud to work at Tesco, but knowing that male colleagues working in distribution centres are being paid more is demoralising.\n\"I'm hopeful that Tesco will recognise the contribution shop floor workers make to the business and reflect that in our pay.\"\nThe legal test for comparability is only the first of three stages within Asda's overall pay claim, which is expected to take several years to conclude. \nLeigh Day is also handing similar equal pay claims against Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and Co-op, which are not as far advanced. \nA Tesco spokesperson said: \"The jobs in our stores and distribution centres are different. These roles require different skills and demands which lead to variations in pay - but this has absolutely nothing to do with gender. \n\"We reward our colleagues fairly for the jobs they do and work hard to ensure that the pay and benefits we offer are fair, competitive and sustainable. \n\"These claims are extremely complex and will take many years to reach a conclusion. We continue to strongly defend these claims.\""

      "tags": "British Armed Forces,British Army,Ministry of Defence",
      "text": "Major design flaws have been identified in the Army's new fleet of armoured vehicles. \nAn internal leaked government report also raises serious doubts as to whether the \u00a35.5bn Ajax Armoured Vehicle programme will be delivered on time and within budget. \nProblems include excessive vibration and noise. \nThe Ministry of Defence signed a contract for 589 of the Ajax armoured vehicles in 2014.\nAn investigation by the government's Infrastructure and Projects Authority says the \"successful delivery of the programme to time, cost and quality appears to be unachievable\". \nThe BBC has seen extracts of the leaked report. It states that compelling evidence was found that the programme will not deliver the planned number of Ajax family armoured fighting vehicles to the British Army for planned operational deployments in 2023/24.\nThe MoD and the Army have said they remained committed to the Ajax programme.\nThe MoD has already spent nearly \u00a33.5bn on the flagship programme, which is meant to provide the British Army with a \"family\" of modern tracked armoured fighting vehicles. \nThe Army describes it as a \"core capability' and key to its modernisation. \nThe US-based defence contractor General Dynamics is assembling the vehicles in Merthyr Tydfil in Wales. But so far only 14 of the 589 have been delivered for trial - the Ares reconnaissance variant.\nThere have been reports of yet more problems with the turret and gun of the main Ajax vehicle. The Infrastructure and Projects Authority criticises the current contract for focusing on \"schedule and milestone payments over quality\".\nThe leaked report, first reported in the Sun, also highlights a number of issues with those vehicles delivered for trials, including excessive vibration and noise. \nThe MoD halted trials for four months following complaints that crews were suffering from temporary hearing loss and aching joints. \nThe MoD says the trials resumed in March. But the leaked report says crews are still having to observe strict health and safety restrictions, including \"limiting time in the platform to one hour 30 before a crew change or speed restrictions of 20mph\" - which is less than half its top speed. \nThe report also notes the \"vehicle cannot reverse over an obstacle more than 20cm high\". Defence experts say many of the problems stem from additional armour protection being put on the original hull, which has seen an increase in weight from 19 to more than 40 tonnes. \nThe report team said that, given the limitation of use, the impact of morale on troops should lead to questions as to the vehicles' credibility. It said there was \"a real risk\" that exposing the Army to vehicles in their current condition would undermine soldiers' confidence in Ajax.   \nThe MoD and the Army said they remained committed to the Ajax programme and that they were still planning to reach the vehicles' Initial Operating Capability by summer of this year. \nA defence source said: \"It was no secret that the programme, that was originally contracted in 2010 and 2014, has had problems, which is why the MoD has intensified scrutiny and work to rectify the issues. \n\"The Army, General Dynamics and the MoD is now engaged in an intensive round of assessments and rectification work to resolve any outstanding issues.\"\nSenior Army officers have told the BBC that they are confident of resolving the issues. \nGeneral Dynamics UK said: \"Recent trials have confirmed many of the required capabilities across the Ajax Family of Vehicles, including operations across the full range of speed and reverse step obstacle climb. \n\"A small number of remaining issues are being reviewed and closed out in partnership with the British Army and Ministry of Defence ahead of Initial Operating Capability.\"\nEarlier this year, MPs on the Defence Select Committee issued a damning report on the state of the British Army's armoured vehicle programme. \nIt said the Army had spent hundreds of millions of pounds with little to show for it. Earlier this year, the MoD scrapped its plans to upgrade hundreds of Warrior Armoured Vehicles. \nSome defence experts also question whether Ajax will ever enter service. \nFrancis Tusa, a defence analyst, described Ajax \"as the Army's Nimrod [MRA4]\" - the planned Maritime Patrol Aircraft scrapped in 2010 at a cost of \u00a34bn, without a single aircraft entering service. \nMr Tusa said the only thing the Ajax programme seemed to have delivered so far was tinnitus.

It's a common ground for people to talk about. You see a dog walking past and you'll have staff members who've never said a word to each other stop and have a chat.\n\"We have offenders in there who struggle to communicate with officers or other people, but we find they are much more receptive with dogs, so that's breaking down barriers, and once we break down those barriers we can help them more.\"\nMatthew Robinson, from Pets As Therapy, said animals helped to reduce stress, but for security reasons only prison staff could take their pets into Parc.\nThe dogs have to pass an assessment, which tests their temperament to see whether they startle easily, and their fitness before they can be used as therapy dogs.\nHe said: \"Dogs are non-judgemental, they're great listeners, and they reduce stress levels, so they bring a lot of joy to the people interacting with them.\""

      "tags": "Tourism,Staycations,Housing market",
      "text": "Residents of a small village fear their community will be lost forever as most of the homes are being used for holiday lets.\nOnly two out of the 50 properties in Cwm-yr-Eglwys, Pembrokeshire, have permanent residents. \nA third is for sale for more than \u00a31m and locals say they are being priced out of the market.\nThey want to see urgent action to protect coastal communities from the rise in second home ownership.\nCwm-yr-Eglwys is one of the most picturesque villages in Pembrokeshire - a sheltered cove with a ruined church on the foreshore, echoing a sea-faring past and a time when sea captains and their families, fishermen and farmers all lived in the village and surrounding area. \nIn recent times, it has become hugely popular as a holiday destination, with the Pembrokeshire coastal path running directly through the village.  \nThere is a small caravan park and about 50 properties, which by now are nearly all holiday homes.\nThere is not much else here - no shop, no pub - only an ice cream kiosk in high season. In winter, the place is deserted but in summer, it is bustling with tourists.    \nBut locals say the community has been lost as each house in turn has become a holiday home.   \nKeith Battrick is a councillor with Dinas Cross community council. He lives nearby and has seen the area change in the 50 years or so since he moved here from Bridgend.  \n\"It's a summer village - winter time it's completely dead. No-one here, just the odd walker - that's it,\" he said. \n\"So it's a sad village really and probably will never change. It makes me sad that the local indigenous community can't afford to live here. \n\"Local children - my son included - who want to move back here, find it hard. Within 10 years there probably won't be anyone local living here - the future of Cwm-yr-Eglwys is as a holiday place.\" \nOf the three properties still lived in all year, one is on the market for \u00a31.3m and the other two are home to people in their 80s. \nNorman Thomas's house sits on the water's edge, overlooking the beach. It was the home he shared with his wife and four children. \nHe is 88 years old and also the only remaining Welsh speaker in the village and said the language would disappear entirely after his time.  \n\"All those houses through the valley have been sold to English people,\" he said. \n\"I'm not against them - they bring work here. I get on with them all. But it's sad that the Welsh can't afford these houses.  \n\"That house over there is on the market for \u00a31.3m. It's ridiculous. The government should have stepped in and stopped these high prices. \n\"We've got to accept this is what it's coming to - there are lots of little places like Cwm-yr-Eglwys - nothing left - there isn't even a pub here.\"\nThe only other permanent residents are the Broughtons - Elizabeth and Harry who are 80 and 85.\nOriginally from Lancashire, they came on holiday to Cwm-yr-Eglwys in the 1960s and fell in love with the place. \nWhen the opportunity came to buy a house in the village, they jumped at the chance. \nTwenty years ago, they moved here permanently and said they did not mind the village being full of holiday homes - it means there are usually people around and they have seen their investment grow beyond all expectation. \n\"We get notes through the door, asking can they rent it or are we selling,\" explained Elizabeth.\n\"Our family would like to keep it but it comes down to pounds, shillings and pence. We are sitting on a goldmine here, no question about it. Very few houses come for sale here so they're pretty sought after.\"    \nHouse prices in Pembrokeshire have risen more than 5% in the past year, with the average home in the county costing \u00a3225,000, well above the Welsh average. \nEstate agents are reporting a surge in demand for rural and coastal properties as people emerge from the pandemic, looking for a new way of life.    \nPembrokeshire also has the second highest number of second homes in Wales - about 9% of the county's housing stock.  \nPeople say all this is not only creating an impossible challenge for those trying to get on to the property market, but also that whole communities are now under threat.     \nMr Battrick said more villages and communities like Cwm-yr-Eglwys would be lost unless action is taken to tackle the issue.\n\"It all goes back to Welsh government - really they should sit down and think really hard about what is happening to villages in Pembrokeshire and all through Wales.  \n\"We will end up eventually with villages like Cwm-yr-Eglwys where there are no local people left living in them and that time is coming quickly I think.\"   \nA Welsh government spokesman, said: \"A large number of second homes in a local community can have a real impact on that community. \n\"Wales is the only UK nation to give local authorities powers to charge higher levels of council tax on both long-term empty properties and second homes. The decision to apply and increase council tax premiums rests with local authorities.\n\"We've also increased the higher rate of land transaction tax, which applies when people buy an additional property. We are looking at what further interventions are available and how our partners can use existing powers.\"\nBob Kilmister, Pembrokeshire council cabinet member for finance said the second homes council tax premium - introduced on 1 April 2017 - meant such owners were charged an extra 50% on top of their usual rates.\n\"The funds are used to increase the supply of affordable housing and enhance the sustainability of local communities.\"\nPhotography by Nick Hartley"

      "tags": "Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 20 healthcare organisations, including those representing nurses, doctors, surgeons and therapists, are calling for stricter UK guidelines to be introduced on face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE).\nIn a virtual meeting with officials, they will say existing rules leave them vulnerable to infection through the air, especially by new Covid variants.\nThe unprecedented appeal will see them argue that other countries, such as the United States, protect their health workers with higher-grade equipment.\nIt is thought to be the first time health and care organisations have united on a single issue in this way - a sign of the desperation many feel about the need for staff to be kept safe.\nThe delegation will include representatives of the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and many other professional organisations and unions.\nOn the government side will be about 20 of the most senior officials from all four UK nations, many involved in setting the guidelines on personal protective equipment (PPE). \nWith an estimated 1,000 health and care workers killed by Covid in the UK, the plea is for the risks of airborne transmission to be recognised in hospitals and other care settings.\nThat means all staff caring for Covid patients being issued with masks specifically designed to guard against infectious aerosols. \nThe US government is among many that require health workers to wear what are called N95 respirators - widely judged to be more effective than the standard-issue surgical masks mandated in the UK. \n\"It is the inconsistency that is getting beyond a joke,\" according to Dr Barry Jones, a leading figure in the campaign, who will be presenting evidence at the meeting. \nHe and his colleagues in the nutritional care association BAPEN first raised their concerns with Public Health England as far back as April last year. \nThey objected to the strict guidance that means that only certain procedures considered likely to generate aerosols entitle staff to a high standard of mask known as an FFP3. \nThey say there is a growing body of research highlighting how other processes - including simply breathing and coughing - can produce far more aerosols than those on the official list. \n\"If a patient is breathing 12 times a minute and you're providing close quarters care for them for 15 minutes or more, then the chances are you will get a large dose of the virus if you are just in a surgical mask,\" Dr Jones told me.\n\"If the present guidelines were effective, why have we had such a high death rate among the public, and health and care staff?\"\nOne objection to the higher grade FFP3 or N95 masks is that they cost far more than the thinner surgical ones. \nBut trainee surgeon and researcher Dr Gillian Higgins, who will also be addressing the meeting, believes she has an answer. \nShe and her colleagues have set up a charity, MedSupplyDrive UK, that has donated 500,000 items of PPE to hospitals, and also researched ways to make the use of FFP3 masks cheaper. \nIn discussions with manufacturers, they have found several options for reusable FFP3 masks. \nShe says these would have a better fit than existing models, could be made in the UK, and would work out at far lower cost over the course of a year. \nDr Higgins says: \"It is not pie in the sky, we have worked out how to do this, and we have just got to get on with it.\"  \nShe also points out that distributing these devices widely would end the \"postcode lottery\" of which health and care workers get better protected.\nAt least 17 hospital and ambulance trusts have already decided to break with official guidance by equipping their staff with FFP3 masks, but the majority have not.\nAccording to Kamini Gadhok, chief executive of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, the hope is to work constructively towards a solution. \nShe is concerned that recently updated guidance issued by Public Health England, which allows staff to perform their own risk assessment to decide on PPE, \"isn't strong enough\".\n\"It is not rocket science, we know the virus is airborne, we know surgical masks don't protect you from airborne viruses, and we're still in a dangerous situation with new variants. So why not apply a precautionary approach?\n\"What we are asking for is about saving lives - so why not do it?\"\nFor Tracy Nicholls, chief executive of the College of Paramedics, the meeting is about trying to avoid more losses. \nSo far 30 paramedics and ambulance crew have been killed by Covid, and the big fear is having to care for a Covid patient in the back of an ambulance with only a surgical mask for protection. \n\"What is really important is rebuilding trust and confidence in the guidance because we know from surveys that that has been lost,\" she said.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the safety of staff is a \"top priority\", adding that the PPE recommendations are based on the latest clinical evidence.\nA spokesperson said: \"Emerging evidence and data are continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance will be amended accordingly if needed.\""

One of the officers can be heard saying: \"It's crazy! She's driving?\".\nThe sisters' parents did not know they were missing until police woke them up and told them about the crash, Detective Scott List of West Jordan police said.\n\"The parents were horrified and very shocked to find their kids were gone,\" he told local media.\nThere was a similar incident in Utah a year earlier, when a five-year-old boy took his family car to go and buy a Lamborghini, telling police he had left home because his mother refused to buy it for him."

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Two of Scotland's education authorities are to be reformed amid criticism of the plans put in place to replace school exams.\nThe Scottish government said the role, remit and purpose of Education Scotland and the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) would be examined. \nThe announcement was made by Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville. \nShe had earlier said she would take \"full responsibility\" for the new system.\nThe SQA is responsible for delivering the exam diet for older pupils in Scottish schools every year, while Education Scotland is tasked with improving the quality of the country's education system.\nThe SQA in particular has faced heavy criticism, with some opposition politicians calling for it to be scrapped and replaced. \nIts chief executive, Fiona Robertson, said the organisation would play a full part in the review and remained focused on \"working with the whole education system to support our young people to get the qualifications they deserve this year\". \nSpeaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday afternoon, Ms Somerville said reforms to the two education bodies would form part of \"wide-ranging plans for education recovery\" over the next 100 days and beyond. \nAnd she said the announcement showed \"our determination to deliver improvements with pace and urgency\".\nShe added: \"I am open to considering what further reform is necessary, with the clear purpose of doing all we can to improve outcomes for children. \n\"This includes reducing variability in the outcomes children and young people achieve across the country\".\nThe announcement came shortly after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisted she had full confidence in the SQA while admitting that the system that had been drawn up was \"not perfect\".\nMuch of the anger has centred on the appeals process for pupils unhappy with their grades, which could see their final results revised down as well as up.\nOpposition parties have said this would make decisions on whether to appeal or not a \"perverse gamble\" for pupils.\nThe alternative qualifications model was introduced after formal exams were cancelled for a second year running to the Covid pandemic.\nGrades are to be awarded on the basis of \"teacher judgement of evidence of learner attainment\".\nBut the second national lockdown at the start of the year meant most of the assessment work done by teachers has come in the final weeks of term.\nThis led to claims that the system was effectively \"exams by another name\" which were being conducted with less preparation and often in a more intensive time period.\nSome pupils have said that going through the new system was more stressful than the traditional exam process.\nThe Scottish government was forced to U-turn last year and upgrade the results of tens of thousands of pupils after an outcry over how the grades had been awarded.\nThe Scottish Conservatives' education spokesman Oliver Mundell said the SQA \"isn't fit for purpose and must be axed\".\n \"The SNP can't have it both ways. Nicola Sturgeon said she had full confidence in the SQA, yet a couple of hours later her education secretary announces that she wants to reform the SQA after its continued failures.\n\"That will hardly inspire confidence among pupils, parents and teachers who the SNP have continually let down.\"\nUntil this afternoon, the SNP government was alone in supporting the SQA and Education Scotland as they stand.\nEvery other political party has been calling for them to be reformed. Parliament passed a motion saying they were not fit for purpose back in February. \nIn an interview this morning, the education secretary said she had full confidence in the SQA and during First Minister's Questions at lunchtime, Nicola Sturgeon said the same.\nTwo hours later, plans were announced to reform both organisations.\nShirley-Anne Somerville is now walking the line between saying the assessment process overseen by both of these institutions is credible and fair - and at the same time saying they need to be fundamentally changed.\nScottish Labour accused the government of \"sticking their head in the sand over the ongoing exams crisis\", and said that a \"vague commitment\" to a future review of the SQA does not go far enough. \nThe Scottish Greens tabled an amendment in the Scottish Parliament - which was defeated by 60 votes to 59 - urging MSPS to acknowledge the \"additional stress and anxiety felt by students, teachers, parents and carers as a result of the 2021 alternative certification model\".\nThe party says this year's model should adopt a no-detriment policy - meaning grades cannot be lowered - and has criticised the \"repeated underperformance of the SQA\".\nThe National Union of Students (NUS) Scotland backed those calls \"to ensure no student is left academically disadvantaged by an appeal, and that exceptional circumstances are taken into consideration\".\nThe EIS teaching union's general secretary, Larry Flanagan, welcomed the review, and said Education Scotland should be \"free to challenge government, rather than being an extension of the civil service\".\nHe added: \"Our members have often found the SQA to be too remote from classroom practice and a significant generator of additional workload for teachers.\"\nThe NASUWT union said the reforms must be \"more than a cosmetic exercise\" while NSPCC Scotland called for more focus on children's emotional wellbeing and mental health.\nSpeaking about the appeals process, an SQA spokesman said:  \"We have listened to the views of young people in developing this year's appeals service. For the first time young people have a free and direct right of appeal on a broad range of grounds. \n\"Representatives from the Scottish Youth Parliament have been at every meeting of the NQ Group 2021 over the last six months. The Scottish Youth Parliament also runs our Learner Panel, which gathers the views of learners from across Scotland. \n\"All communication from the NQ Group 2021, including those directly for learners, are agreed with the Scottish Youth Parliament and they have been instrumental in the communications from the NQ Group to learners.\"\nCameron Garrett, convenor of the education committee on the Scottish Youth Parliament, is the only young person on the NQ21 group. \nHe told Radio Scotland he did not feel listened to, and that his voice was \"drowned out\". He said the views of young people had to be considered more. "

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic,Shirley-Anne Somerville",
      "text": "The new education secretary has said she will take \"absolute responsibility\" for Scotland's qualifications system.\nShirley-Anne Somerville promised she would not blame anyone else if there were any issues with the awards.\nShe said Scotland had a fair, credible and a consistent assessment policy despite criticism of the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA).\nThe Scottish Greens have tabled an amendment at Holyrood expressing \"lack of confidence\" in the SQA.\nThe Scottish government announced its overdue appeals process for Higher and National 5 candidates on Wednesday, amid widespread criticism from pupils, parents and teachers.\nAn alternative qualifications model has been introduced after exams were formal exams were cancelled for a second year running due to the Covid pandemic.\nGrades are to be awarded on the basis of \"teacher judgement of evidence of learner attainment\".\nSenior pupils faced numerous assessments throughout May to provide evidence for awards. \nBut the system came under attack after many students and parents claimed these assessments were \"exams by another name,\" conducted with less preparation and often in a more intensive time period.\nThey said the assessments were causing more stress and anxiety than the usual exam system.\nOn Wednesday, more than a month later than originally planned, Ms Somerville finally outlined controversial details of the appeals process - which she said could see pupils having their grades revised down as well as up.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, the education secretary said she had confidence in the arrangements that had been made for this year.\nShe added: \"Of course I will take absolute responsibility. That is part of becoming education secretary, it is my responsibility to listen to the stakeholders and make the decisions. I won't pass the buck onto anyone. \n\"I will ensure as we go through this process, I listen to young people, teachers educationalists and to parents to make sure we design the fairest most consistent and credible policy, and I think we have done that.\"\nMs Somerville said the \"the fair, credible and a consistent assessment policy\" was not devised by the government alone, but by the National Qualifications 2021 group that she said included young people, trade unions, parents and other educationalists.\nBut the only young person on the group - Cameron Garrett, who serves as a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament - has strongly criticised the new appeals process.\nHe claimed the voices of young people had not been listened to, and said they had been \"let down and ignored by this process\".\nHe added: \"Young people deserve fairness this year and should be able to have confidence in the system. Neither is currently true.\"\nIs there an exams crisis? It depends who you ask.\nI've been following this story closely for months and so far the vast majority of young people I have spoken to are not happy with the process. They say they were told there would be no exams, only to find themselves studying for tests which looked and felt exactly like exams but, for many, without the study leave. \nTeachers' representatives involved in creating the way qualifications work this year - the EIS union and School Leaders Scotland - say this is the best solution and the fairest way to measure pupils' abilities. The teachers' groups not involved in the process - the SSTA and NASUWT - say it's flawed and not allowing them to exercise real judgement.\nLike young people, the vast majority of parents I speak to are also unhappy with how things are panning out. That's backed up by the largest independent parents group, Connect, which is calling for the system to be changed.\nThe SQA and the Scottish government have both said they do not expect a situation like last year, where a U-turn had to be made after results were given which meant they reverted only to teacher judgement. \nUltimately, we are going to have to wait and see what happens when pupils are told their results. \nAre they what they would have expected? Have they been disadvantaged by circumstances outwith their control? And has the system stepped up to help them make up for the disruption they have faced?\nMs Somerville said she recognised that young people had wanted some things to be done differently, but that there had been \"no genuine consensus and I have looked to ensure we have a very credible policy as we go through this.\"\nPupils will receive provisional grades from 24 June. After that, they can speak to teachers and register their intention to appeal if they wish to.\nMs Somerville said: \"You absolutely have the right to appeal and for the first time this year young people have the right to appeal directly and at no cost.\n\"The appeals process has no algorithm involved, it goes to a second teacher outside the school, an SQA appointee. They look at all the evidence and take a decision based on that.\"\nHowever, opposition parties have criticised the decision to allow grades to be downgraded if a student does appeal, calling it a  \"perverse gamble\".\nMs Somerville said there was a very low incidence of grades being downgraded, and that in 2019 just one candidate's grade in 11,138 appeals was adjusted down.\nThe issue was raised at First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament later on Thursday, with Nicola Sturgeon insisting she had full confidence in the SQA while admitting that the system that had been drawn up was \"not perfect\". \nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross described it as the \"same old shambles\" in education, and said lessons had not been learned from last year despite Mr Swinney being replaced as education secretary.\nHe called on Ms Sturgeon to accept that the qualifications process was \"fundamentally flawed\" and said she should move on to address the deeper problems in education - \"starting by replacing the SQA\".\nScottish Green MSP Ross Greer's amendment in Thursday's education debate acknowledges \"additional stress and anxiety felt by students, teachers, parents and carers as a result of the 2021 alternative certification model\".\nAnd it says this year's model should adopt a no-detriment policy - meaning grades cannot be lowered - and that provision should be made for appeals based on exceptional individual circumstances.\nIt goes on to note the \"repeated underperformance of the SQA and expresses lack of confidence the body's ability to fulfil its duties\".\nMSPs previously voted on the performance of the SQA in February, when they backed a motion saying the exam body and schools' watchdog were not \"fit for purpose\" after the government was forced to u-turn and upgrade the results of tens of thousands of pupils after an outcry over how the grades had been awarded.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Britain's love of queuing helped the UK coronavirus vaccine rollout, the health secretary has said, as jabs were given \"according to need, not ability to pay\".\nMatt Hancock said there had been no \"special treatment, no queue-jumping\" for politicians, footballers, or royalty, which helped show the system was \"fair\".\nHe also confirmed that three in four UK adults have now had their first jab.\nBut concerns remain over rising cases.\nReflecting on the UK's vaccine rollout at a conference in Oxford, the health secretary said it had been important for the public to know others couldn't \"buy their way up the queue\".\n\"Prince William, our future king, waited in that same line for his jab a couple of weeks after me - no special treatment, no queue-jumping,\" he said.\nMr Hancock also said the government was in talks with AstraZeneca to secure a future version of its jab adapted to better tackle the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.\nAny altered vaccine would need to be approved by the medicines regulator, AstraZeneca said.\nThe health secretary admitted \"a few eyebrows were raised\" after he revealed the Hollywood film Contagion helped him shape the UK vaccine programme.\n\"When I watched that film, a penny did drop for me... that the power of the vaccine would be so great that we would have to think very hard about who to protect and in what order,\" he said.\nFamous faces endorsing the vaccines - including the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and various sports stars - helped encourage take-up, he said.\nBut he said the \"straight-talking approach\" of England's deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam was equally key in helping to \"build public confidence\".\nSpeaking to counterparts running vaccine programmes around the world, he added that while he was aware \"this isn't a vaccine world cup\", confidence in Covid vaccines has been \"sky high\" in the UK.\nHe added: \"We continue to top the list of places where people are willing to take, or have taken, a Covid vaccine.\"\nUnfortunately, even with three-quarters of adults having received at least one dose, there's still a way to go. \nThe first dose of the vaccine gives reduced protection against what will soon be the main type of coronavirus in the UK. \nThat's the variant first identified in India - now known as either B.1.617.2 or Delta. \nThere may be a small proportion of elderly and vulnerable people who are not vaccinated or who don't get full protection. \nBut this is a large country and that's still a large number of elderly or vulnerable people. \nIf this new strain of the virus truly is as infectious as some estimates suggest, it will find those people and we could see large numbers going into hospital. \nEvery person fully vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread and find them. \nBut we don't know exactly how infectious it is. That's the key job of the next few weeks - finding out whether the virus we'll be facing in the summer could cause a big third wave or, hopefully, just a ripple. \nMeanwhile, speculation continues over whether the government will ease all remaining restrictions in England on 21 June.\nMr Hancock said the decision - which is due to be made a week prior to that date - will depend on how successfully Covid vaccines sever the link between cases and deaths.\nAsked whether mask wearing and work-from-home guidance may continue past June, he said there was nothing in the data to suggest the UK was \"definitively off track\".\nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the next 12 days \"are going to be really important to see what the virus is doing\". \n\"We've got a very large-scale surveillance infrastructure in place in terms of waste water surveillance and large-scale testing,\" he told ITV's Peston. \nOn the possibility of giving vaccines to children over the age of 12, he said it would need to be \"unbelievably safe\" and the government would be waiting for guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the regulator. \nScientists advising the government have offered various different perspectives over the last few days about the prospect of easing restrictions. \nOn Wednesday Sir John Bell, who sits on the government's vaccine taskforce, said the UK's \"numbers don't look too intimidating\" and he was \"encouraged\" by what he saw.\nBut on Tuesday, Prof Ravi Gupta, from the advisory committee Nervtag, said there were signs the UK was in the early stages of a third wave, and called for the ending of restrictions to be delayed.\nThe number of new cases reported daily continues to rise, with 4,330 infections reported on Wednesday. Another 12 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded - but the first day after a bank holiday weekend is typically higher than surrounding days because of delays in reporting deaths.\nThe proportion of deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales - as measured weekly by mentions on death certificates - is at its lowest level for more than eight months, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics."

      "text": "Israeli opposition parties have reached an agreement to form a new government that would end Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year tenure as prime minister.\nYair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, announced an eight-faction coalition had been formed.\nUnder a rotation arrangement, the head of the right-wing Yamina party, Naftali Bennett, would serve as prime minister first before handing over to Mr Lapid.\nMr Netanyahu, however, attacked the new \"left-wing\" government as \"dangerous\".\nIn his first comments since the agreement was reached, Mr Netanyahu urged Knesset (parliament) members \"elected by votes from the right\" to oppose the coalition, which still needs to be approved by a parliamentary vote before being sworn in.\nThe vote is not expected to take place for some days, and there is still a chance this newly formed coalition could be upended by defections. \nIn a statement, Mr Lapid said he had informed President Reuven Rivlin of the agreement, adding: \"I pledge that this government will work in the service of all Israeli citizens, those who voted for it and those who did not.\n\"It will respect its opponents and do everything in its power to unite and connect all parts of Israeli society.\"\nAn image carried on Israeli media showed Mr Lapid, Mr Bennett and Mansour Abbas, leader of the Arab Islamist Raam party, signing the agreement, a deal many thought impossible.\nThis is the first time in decades an Israeli Arab party has joined a governing coalition. Other parties representing Israeli Arabs - who make up 20% of the population - have said they will oppose a government led by Mr Bennett, who rejects the concept of a Palestinian state, AFP news agency reports.\nMr Abbas told reporters: \"The decision was hard and there were several disputes but it was important to reach agreements.\" He said that there were \"many things in this agreement for the benefit of Arab society\". \nNo rational political enemy of Benjamin Netanyahu can underestimate his tenacity, ruthlessness and absolute determination to hold on to office. Until a new government with a new prime minister is sworn in, he will do all he can to stop it. \nIf he found himself leader of the opposition, he would do all he could to destabilise a coalition with a wafer-thin majority that would be trying to span the entire Israeli spectrum, from the nationalist right to the liberal left. \nAll that unites them is their desire to remove him from office. \nMr Netanyahu has already called the proposed new government the \"fraud of the century\". He says it endangers the state of Israel, the people of Israel, and the soldiers of Israel. However loudly he complains, the likelihood is that he is leaving office. In the end his defeat was sealed not by left-wing opponents but by fellow right-wingers he has made into enemies by his ruthless, high-handed tactics. \nNo-one should expect big, new initiatives from a new government. Just surviving the onslaught Mr Netanyahu is undoubtedly planning will be a full-time job. His opponents will be hoping that his fall will continue in the Jerusalem courthouse where he is already on trial on serious corruption charges.\nIn his note to the president, Mr Lapid said he would head the government alongside Mr Bennett, who he would replace as prime minister on 27 August 2023.\nMr Rivlin has called on parliament to convene as soon as possible to hold the confidence vote.\nIf the coalition fails to win the support of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, there is a risk of the country having to go to elections for the fifth time in two years.\nThe coalition members span the full spectrum of Israeli politics. The parties have little in common apart from their plan to replace Mr Netanyahu.\nThey are:\nAll eight factions were needed to pass the 61 majority figure.\nWednesday's marathon talks took place in a hotel near Tel Aviv, with a large number of issues - from legalising cannabis to fines for illegal construction to the rotation of judicial selection committee posts - all on the agenda.\nIsraeli media suggested that not all the elements were finalised, and this could still create doubts over whether the coalition will win its confidence vote.\nMr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party won the most seats in March's inconclusive poll. He was given the first chance to form a government but was unable to build a viable coalition. \nMr Netanyahu had called the proposed new government the \"fraud of the century\", saying it endangered the state and people of Israel."

      "tags": "Brain cancer,NHS Wales,United States,Cancer,Oklahoma",
      "text": "The mum of a girl being treated for a brain tumour in the US is \"so scared of losing her, it's incomprehensible\".\nFreya Bevan is undergoing a second round of treatment for cancer that returned last year after six years. \nThe eight-year-old was first diagnosed with a rare form of the disease before Freya, from Neath in Neath Port Talbot, reached the age of two.\nWith celebrity support, a 2015 campaign raised \u00a3110,000 for her to undergo proton beam therapy in the US. \nBut the cancer is back and Freya's family are trying once again to \"give her the chance of life\", this time with a \u00a3200,000 fundraising drive.\nHer mum Kath was \"floored\" at being told the disease had returned. \n\"I was crushed,\" the 48-year-old said. \n\"It was just awful, I thought I just can't go through with this again. \n\"For some reason it felt worse than last time because we knew what was ahead.\"\nHaving done research Mrs Bevan knew a relapse was \"not great.\" \n\"To go through it once is bad enough, but for a little girl to go through it again a second time, she is so much older and aware this time,\" she said.\n\"I knew we had a rocky road in front of us. \n\"You're just numb. You're just completely numb. It's an awful feeling. And it's not just me. \n\"It's the whole family. Everyone was in shock.\"\nFreya was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in May 2014, at 22-months old. \nShe underwent two major brain surgery operations, chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. \nAnd in February 2015, she travelled with her family for the first time to Oklahoma for the proton beam therapy.\nThey returned to Wales in May that year and Freya began rebuilding her life. \nLast October however, a routine scan showed a tumour had returned. \nFreya had to then undergo a nine-hour operation on 31 December to remove it - the experience made worse by the fact it was the festive season..\n\"We tried to make Christmas as best as we could but we had that lurking over our head,\" Mrs Bevan said.\n\"It was a sad time.\" \nIt was then decided the family would return to the US for more proton beam therapy, which they could partly pay for with funds left over in 2015. \nThey arranged for Freya to be treated by Dr Andrew Chang, who had treated her before.\nAnd the family presumed things would go as smoothly as last time. \nBut it was \"completely different\". Freya was \"poorly from the start.\"\n\"The tumour had grown back already,\" Mrs Bevan said.\nHad this been known before they left, Freya may not have been allowed to fly, she confirmed. \nDespite not knowing what would happen, the family decided to press on with treatment.\n\"It took a massive toll on her little body,\" she said. \n\"It was quite harsh, there was a lot more radiation than before.\"\nAfter 30 sessions Freya \"just wanted it to finish.\" \nNow medical costs are mounting. \nNo initial fundraising was done as the trip was budgeted for.\nBut with things not going as planned there have been unexpected costs for things like MRI scans and general anaesthetics.\nIn the US a single MRI scan, Kath said, can cost as much as \u00a310,000. Freya has already had three.\n\"The bills are stacking up, and on top of the worry of getting Freya well, we have the worry of wondering how we are going to pay for all of this,\" Mrs Bevan said. \n\"Hence the fundraising is still going on and we are desperately trying to get more.\"\nIt was \"sad it has to come down to money.\" \n\"This little girl has been fighting to live since she was 20 months old and everyone can see she deserves this chance of life again,\" Freya's mum said. \nWith Freya's condition is on her her mind every day, she \"can't even think about\" losing her. \n\"She's a superhero in my eyes,\" she said. \n\"Some people have always wished to see their superhero but we see ours everyday.\n\"I feel so privileged to be her mum because she has shown me what real strength is.\" \nThe plan is to be home for Freya's ninth birthday in August. \n\"That's all she is talking about,\" Mrs Bevan said.\n\"She is so excited for her ninth birthday.\""

      "text": "A woman was given an invasive gynaecological procedure instead of fertility treatment after she was wrongly identified as another patient, a safety report says.\nThe error was one of 472 serious healthcare incidents reported in England between 2019 and 2020.\nThe Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) says such cases can lead to physical and psychological harm.\nIt says changes are needed to make sure they don't happen.\nThe mix-up happened in an outpatient clinic where patients go for consultations, tests and procedures - but do not stay overnight.\nVisits to these types of clinics have nearly doubled in the past decade, says the HSIB, who investigated the incident.\nNearly half of the serious incidents reported between April 2019 and the end of March 2020 were procedures performed on the wrong patient or on the wrong part of the body, its report says.\nThe 39-year old woman visited a gynaecology outpatient department for her first fertility appointment in July 2019, with her sister.\nShe was checked in at the reception desk at the same time as another patient, who had arrived for a colposcopy appointment. This is a procedure to look at the cervix, the lower part of the womb at the top of the vagina, often carried out if cervical screening finds abnormal cells in the cervix.\nThe nurse called out the second patient's name several times with no response and then just her first name.\nThe first patient, whose surname sounded similar, thought the nurse was calling for her and was led into the clinic room.\nAfter a number of further misunderstandings which failed to pick up the error, the woman was wrongly given the invasive procedure and left the clinic, only to be phoned on her way home and told what had happened.\nStaff apologised and the patient eventually went on to have her fertility appointment.\n\"The patient told us she was so distressed after the incident that she did not want to pursue her fertility treatment,\" said Dr Sean Weaver, deputy medical director at HSIB.\nHe added: \"Any invasive procedure carried out incorrectly has the potential to lead to serious physical and psychological harm and erode trust in the NHS.\"\nDr Weaver said the number of invasive procedures carried out in outpatient settings was rising, and there were no strong barriers in place to stop \"misidentification\" incidents happening.\nAt present, the report says there are no formal safety controls to manage the risks that can arise when patients have similar names and several clinics are running at the same time in a department.\nWith many patients waiting in the same area, this can \"affect the risk of the wrong patient being selected\", it said.\nIt says factors such as workloads and time pressures on staff may affect the level of safety checks carried out."

He made multiple unreserved apologies, which I thought was great - and he was really heartfelt about it.\"\nAsked whether the broadcaster had made amends, he said: \"Yes, very much so. Because I still felt that to this day the BBC were just saying things to sort of appease me. \n\"But I have come away from it feeling, 'no they really, really support me'.\"\nThe in-person apology comes some 26 years after the bombshell interview first aired.\n\"It's been a weight on my shoulders for a very long time,\" Mr Wiessler added.\n\"I think that there's always a bit of regret about that, but as I say, we've hit it off pretty well and I'm quite happy right now.\"\nConcerns about how Bashir secured the interview began to resurface last autumn, prompting an independent investigation by retired judge Lord Dyson.\nThe investigation found Bashir had used deception to secure the interview, and said the BBC had fallen short of its \"high standards of integrity and transparency\". \nThe BBC subsequently made an \"unconditional apology\" over the way it obtained an interview.\nFollowing the investigation, Bashir said he \"never wanted to harm\" Diana and was \"deeply sorry\" to her sons, the dukes of Cambridge and Sussex.\nSpeaking to the Sunday Times he admitted he should not have shown the forged bank statements to Earl Spencer.\n\"Obviously I regret it, it was wrong.

      "tags": "Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 20 healthcare organisations, including those representing nurses, doctors, surgeons and therapists, are calling for stricter UK guidelines to be introduced on face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE).\nIn a virtual meeting with officials, they will say existing rules leave them vulnerable to infection through the air, especially by new Covid variants.\nThe unprecedented appeal will see them argue that other countries, such as the United States, protect their health workers with higher-grade equipment.\nIt is thought to be the first time health and care organisations have united on a single issue in this way - a sign of the desperation many feel about the need for staff to be kept safe.\nThe delegation will include representatives of the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and many other professional organisations and unions.\nOn the government side will be about 20 of the most senior officials from all four UK nations, many involved in setting the guidelines on personal protective equipment (PPE). \nWith an estimated 1,000 health and care workers killed by Covid in the UK, the plea is for the risks of airborne transmission to be recognised in hospitals and other care settings.\nThat means all staff caring for Covid patients being issued with masks specifically designed to guard against infectious aerosols. \nThe US government is among many that require health workers to wear what are called N95 respirators - widely judged to be more effective than the standard-issue surgical masks mandated in the UK. \n\"It is the inconsistency that is getting beyond a joke,\" according to Dr Barry Jones, a leading figure in the campaign, who will be presenting evidence at the meeting. \nHe and his colleagues in the nutritional care association BAPEN first raised their concerns with Public Health England as far back as April last year. \nThey objected to the strict guidance that means that only certain procedures considered likely to generate aerosols entitle staff to a high standard of mask known as an FFP3. \nThey say there is a growing body of research highlighting how other processes - including simply breathing and coughing - can produce far more aerosols than those on the official list. \n\"If a patient is breathing 12 times a minute and you're providing close quarters care for them for 15 minutes or more, then the chances are you will get a large dose of the virus if you are just in a surgical mask,\" Dr Jones told me.\n\"If the present guidelines were effective, why have we had such a high death rate among the public, and health and care staff?\"\nOne objection to the higher grade FFP3 or N95 masks is that they cost far more than the thinner surgical ones. \nBut trainee surgeon and researcher Dr Gillian Higgins, who will also be addressing the meeting, believes she has an answer. \nShe and her colleagues have set up a charity, MedSupplyDrive UK, that has donated 500,000 items of PPE to hospitals, and also researched ways to make the use of FFP3 masks cheaper. \nIn discussions with manufacturers, they have found several options for reusable FFP3 masks. \nShe says these would have a better fit than existing models, could be made in the UK, and would work out at far lower cost over the course of a year. \nDr Higgins says: \"It is not pie in the sky, we have worked out how to do this, and we have just got to get on with it.\"  \nShe also points out that distributing these devices widely would end the \"postcode lottery\" of which health and care workers get better protected.\nAt least 17 hospital and ambulance trusts have already decided to break with official guidance by equipping their staff with FFP3 masks, but the majority have not.\nAccording to Kamini Gadhok, chief executive of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, the hope is to work constructively towards a solution. \nShe is concerned that recently updated guidance issued by Public Health England, which allows staff to perform their own risk assessment to decide on PPE, \"isn't strong enough\".\n\"It is not rocket science, we know the virus is airborne, we know surgical masks don't protect you from airborne viruses, and we're still in a dangerous situation with new variants. So why not apply a precautionary approach?\n\"What we are asking for is about saving lives - so why not do it?\"\nFor Tracy Nicholls, chief executive of the College of Paramedics, the meeting is about trying to avoid more losses. \nSo far 30 paramedics and ambulance crew have been killed by Covid, and the big fear is having to care for a Covid patient in the back of an ambulance with only a surgical mask for protection. \n\"What is really important is rebuilding trust and confidence in the guidance because we know from surveys that that has been lost,\" she said.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the safety of staff is a \"top priority\", adding that the PPE recommendations are based on the latest clinical evidence.\nA spokesperson said: \"Emerging evidence and data are continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance will be amended accordingly if needed.\""

      "tags": "BBC,Kampala,Uganda",
      "text": "The editor of one of Uganda's biggest newspapers has been summoned for questioning by police after reporting findings from a BBC investigation into last year's police killings in Kampala. \nTabu Butagira is the editor the Daily Monitor which ran the story on its front page on 31 May.\nTony Glencross, the managing director of Nation Media Group, which owns the newspaper, has also been summoned. \nThe two men are suspected of publishing false news, libel, and incitement.\nMr Butagira told the BBC the charges were \"possibly politically motivated\" and that the Daily Monitor's lawyers would dispute them. \nMr Glencross said the two men would comply with the summons, but that he was currently self-isolating after exposure to Covid-19 and would not be able to appear before police until next week. \nThe BBC Africa Eye documentary Three Killings in Kampala, released on 31 May, presented evidence that Ugandan security forces fired indiscriminately at passers-by during a crackdown in the capital Kampala last November, killing and injuring unarmed people including women and children. \nThe Daily Monitor was not involved in the investigation. But following the evidence shown in the BBC film, the newspaper reported that on 18 November at about 14:00 local time, armed men in a police truck with the registration number UP5564 drove down Kampala Road firing live ammunition. \nIn the space of a minute or so, seven people were shot, at least four of them fatally. \nThe Ugandan government told the BBC that its security forces were responding to riots, and that the people who died on Kampala Road were killed by \"stray bullets\". There is no evidence that any of the seven people shot on Kampala Road were rioting.\nNBS, one of the country's main television networks, usually broadcasts BBC Africa Eye's investigations, but it did not show Three Killings in Kampala. However, the documentary went viral on YouTube and WhatsApp in Uganda on 31 May, prompting calls from Ugandans for accountability. \n\"The damning evidence [the] government needed to prosecute officers who killed Ugandans in November is here,\" tweeted Raymond Mujuni, a Ugandan journalist and news anchor. \"Let justice prevail.\" \nAnother Twitter user, @drlubegaM, cited the evidence shown in the BBC film and challenged the chief political commissar of the Ugandan police, Asan Kasingye, to \"produce the killers of our people\".\nJenifa Ochwo wrote: \"My prayer has been that at the very least these atrocious acts would be documented for future reference. For the victims' sake. For history. Our ruler has attempted to erase this or to rewrite history. However, now there is a record.\"   \nThe summoning of Mr Butagira and Mr Glencross highlights the increasing hostility faced by Ugandan journalists, especially those who report on opposition to President Yoweri Museveni or who criticise his government. \nThe press freedom group Reporters Without Borders registered nearly 40 attacks against journalists in Uganda between November 2020 and March 2021, including 21 physical attacks and eight arrests. \nIt places the country 125th out of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index, and states that \"acts of intimidation and violence against reporters are an almost daily occurrence in Uganda\". \nThe Daily Monitor has reported extensively on the November killings and has profiled many of the victims. \n\"The brand of Daily Monitor's journalism is that which seeks to unearth the truth,\" Mr Butagira said. \n\"This government prides [itself] on the restoration of human security. Therefore, a media house seeking accountability for civilians shot dead on Kampala streets should not be conflated as a crime in a civilised and democratic society. \""

      "text": "The UK government is \"open-minded\" on SNP calls to extend furlough, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants the job support scheme extended \"for as long as it is needed\".\nThe call came ahead of a virtual meeting between Boris Johnson and the three devolved administrations on how to emerge from the Covid pandemic.\nThe summit was postponed after the Scottish and Welsh first ministers criticised the \"very rough\" agenda. \nMs Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford said the discussion needed to be \"meaningful\" and had asked Mr Johnson to provide more detail of the meeting's schedule. \nMr Johnson called the summit in the wake of the election results in Great Britain earlier this month, which saw Ms Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP) returned to government in Scotland and Mr Drakeford's Labour triumph in Wales. \nDowning Street said the meeting - which was scheduled to begin at 13:30 BST - was an opportunity to share information and ideas on the way ahead.\nFirst Minister Ms Sturgeon said that the four-nation meeting could not be \"a PR exercise\" and that getting \"certainty over funding... is the bare minimum or our expectations\". \nAhead of the summit, the SNP urged the UK government to consider extending furlough \"beyond September if this is required\".\nThe party also said those who have started jobs since 2 March 2021 should be able to be furloughed if needed.\nThe furlough scheme - officially called the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) - was launched in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, to minimise unemployment.\nIt now covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month.\nThe scheme is currently due to expire at the end of September. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland, Mr Gove said he was \"open-minded\" on the SNP's proposal.\nHe added that furlough scheme was a \"huge success\" that was only possible \"thanks to the broad shoulders of the UK Treasury\".\nHe also said Scotland would benefit from more spending by the UK government adding \"it is absolutely vital that we build back better.\"\nIn an earlier statement, Mr Gove said the four nations' \"joint success\" on fighting Covid had \"shown the world what we can achieve as a United Kingdom.\n\"We must take the same approach to the difficult challenge of rebuilding our economy and public services from the damaging impact of Covid-19.\" \nMr Gove, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the secretaries of state for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are also expected to attend the meeting.\nThere is a practical side to this meeting and, as ever, a political one. \nOfficials in Downing Street say the prime minister wants to hear how the different parts of the UK are emerging from lockdown. \nThere will be a discussion on how ideas can be shared and how links created during the pandemic can be maintained. \nBut Number 10 will also want to reinforce the message that being part of the UK has helped in the fight against Covid. \nThe meeting is expected to hear that the success of the vaccine rollout was down to the buying power of the UK government and supplies being sourced through London. \nThe work of members of the British armed forces who helped in the rollout of the vaccine will also be highlighted. \nThe virtual meeting with political representatives from across the UK will also examine how the pandemic has placed extra burdens on the health service and disrupted the education of millions of pupils and students.\nOn Tuesday, the UK announced zero Covid deaths for the first time since the pandemic began, with a government adviser saying the latest coronavirus data looks encouraging. \nThe timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK. \nIn Northern Ireland, ministers have been gradually introducing major relaxations of the Covid restrictions, with indoor hospitality, tourist accommodation and non-essential retail all allowed to reopen with mitigations in place. The next review is due on 10 June. \nThere is currently a debate going on in England as to whether restrictions should be ended on 21 June. \nIn Wales, the health minister has said the easing of restrictions - due to be reviewed on Thursday - could be affected by a \"very serious\" cluster of the Delta variant in Conwy county.\nIt comes a day after the relaxing of measures in Scotland was paused for millions of people in areas where cases have been rising."

      "title": "Travel sector dismay as Portugal faces tougher rules",
      "tags": "Tourism,Companies,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The travel and tourism industry has hit back after the announcement of tighter rules on foreign holidays.\nNo more countries will be added to the green list and Portugal will be relegated to amber from next Tuesday.\nThe government said Portugal had seen a doubling of infection rates since the previous travel review.\nCritics warned of a loss of jobs and confidence, while Easyjet said the government had torn up its own rules.\nMoving Portugal from the green to the amber list was a \"safety first approach\" to \"give us the best chance of unlocking domestically\", said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\nLabour said moving Portugal from green to amber on the UK's foreign travel system was \"not the answer\" and called for the amber list to be scrapped altogether.\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the government of causing \"chaos with the mishandling of travel restrictions at the border\".\nIn addition to not adding countries to the green list and relegating Portugal to amber, seven more countries have been added to the red list. \nAll the changes will take effect on Tuesday at 04:00.\nIn England's traffic light scheme, countries are classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have similar rules.\nThe government says you should not holiday in red or amber destinations - which means most countries. Holidays to countries on the green list can go ahead without quarantining when you return.\nThere had been some speculation that Greek and Spanish islands could be added to the green list as well as Malta, Finland and parts of the Caribbean - but the government insisted it had to remain cautious.\nThe UK government announced that Portugal would be on the travel green list on 7 May.\nIts low point for new cases (on a seven-day average) was 10 May and the number has been rising gradually since then.\nOn 2 June, there were 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a touch higher than the UK at 5.1, although differences in the amount of testing being done make that comparison difficult. It is considerably higher than Israel, for example, which is still on the green list and had 0.2 new cases per 100,000 that day. \nThe decision about which countries go on the green list is not just about the number of new cases, but a number of other criteria, such as the amount of testing capacity. That has not changed dramatically in the past month.\nPresence of variants of concern (VOCs) is also important. The latest report from the World Health Organization says all four VOCs have now been found in Portugal. A month ago, the variant first identified in India was not yet a VOC. The transport secretary says a new mutation of that variant has now been found in Portugal. \nBritish Airways said this was \"incredibly disappointing and confusing news, not just for aviation but also for our customers\".\n\"The UK has reached a critical point and urgently needs travel with low-risk countries, like the US, to re-start the economy, support devastated industries and reunite loved ones,\" a spokesperson said.  \nJohan Lundgren, Easyjet's chief executive, said that with \"Portuguese rates similar to those in the UK\", relegating the country \"simply isn't justified by the science\".\n\"When this framework was put together, consumers were promised a waiting list to allow them to plan.\n\"Yet the government has torn up its own rule book and ignored the science, throwing people's plans into chaos, with virtually no notice or alternative options for travel from the UK. \n\"This decision essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world,\" he said.\nJet2 said it would delay restarting flights from 23 June to 1 July.\n\"We know how disappointed our customers and independent travel agency partners will be following today's announcement, and we share their concerns and frustrations,\" said Steve Heapy, Jet2 chief executive.\nCharlie Cornish, Manchester Airports Group chief executive, said: \"We were told the traffic light system would allow people to travel safely, with the right measures in place to manage risk for different countries.\n\"But it is now clear the government doesn't trust its own system and that international travel is being unfairly scapegoated, with tens of thousands of jobs placed at risk in the process.\nJohn Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, said: \"Ministers spent last month hailing the restart of international travel, only to close it down three weeks later, all but guaranteeing another lost summer for the travel sector. \n\"Everyone wants to protect public health, but the entire point of the Global Travel Taskforce was to establish a system to unlock low-risk travel safely. \n\"Britain is the worst performing economy in the G7, and in the week that the prime minister hosts G7 leaders to launch his government's vision of Global Britain, he's sending a message that the UK will remain isolated from the rest of the world and closed to most of its G7 partners.\" \nVirginia Messina, vice-president of the World Travel & Tourism Council, called the moves a \"huge disappointment for businesses and holidaymakers\", a point underlined by falls in the share prices of several airlines.\nShe said: \"The government has once again cold-shouldered travel and tourism by refusing to add any new destinations to the already slim green list. \n\"The UK could and should leverage its hard-won competitive advantage from one of the world's best vaccine rollout programmes, to restore mobility and reopen the doors to safe international travel.\"\nPaul Charles, chief executive of the PC Agency and spokesman for parts of the travel sector, said tighter restrictions \"will further threaten tens of thousands of jobs in aviation and travel, not to mention further damage consumer confidence\". \nHe said that data showed several countries should be green-listed, so the government's decision \"defies logic\" and was being driven by \"a policy of fear\".\nJohn Foster, the CBI's director of policy, said businesses across the country were \"losing out on key links with trading partners just as the rest of the world is opening up\". \n\"The international travel sector is on its knees and unable to trade its way to recovery. Without a successful summer season, the government will need to consider further sector specific support to save jobs and skills essential for future growth,\" he added.\nThe Caribbean island of Grenada was hoping to be put on green, and tourism minister Clarice Modeste Curwen said she was \"extremely disappointed\" not to be added.\nShe said: \"Grenada has had just 161 cases of Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic and we have reported zero new cases locally since February.\n\"We strongly believe that Grenada should be added to the UK's green list as we have taken all the necessary measures to ensure the islands are safe and ready for visitors.\"\nShares in airlines and travel companies fell after the BBC reported that Portugal is set to move from green to amber.\nIAG, the parent company of British Airways, fell 5%, with Easyjet sinking about the same. Ryanair closed 1.3% lower and Tui fell about 4.5%.\nAre you in Portugal? Are you planning to travel there soon? Please share how this latest announcement will affect you.

      "text": "Democratic Unionist Party leader Edwin Poots has said he will lead DUP ministers at this month's North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in Dublin.\nMr Poots had denied boycotting some meetings in protest against the NI Protocol.\nAfter his first meeting as party leader with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin, he confirmed plans to attend the next meeting.\nMr Martin said they had shared an \"open exchange of views\".\nSpeaking after the meeting, Mr Martin said they discussed a number of issues including north-south cooperation, the protocol and Covid-19. \nHe said he recognised the \"genuine concerns in unionist and loyalist communities around the protocol\".\nThe taoiseach said the focus must be on getting issues resolved and an \"obvious way to do this would be to reach agreement between the EU and UK on a temporary veterinary agreement - which would do away with 80% of checks at NI ports\".\nMr Poots, who described the meeting as \"positive, frank and useful\", said most of their discussion had focused on the protocol.\nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that creates the Irish Sea border.\nHe said they also talked about fulfilling commitments made in the New Deal New Decade agreement in a timely fashion.\nBefore Thursday's meeting took place, he had said there was \"a lot of anger\" among the unionist community towards the protocol and said north-south relations \"have never been as bad\".\n\"I do not blame the current taoiseach for that, I blame the past taoiseach,\" Mr Poots said. \n\"Northern Ireland cannot be a plaything of the European Union or indeed of the southern government.\"\nLater, on Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9's Prime Time programme, Mr Poots said he did not believe the protocol, as it currently exists, \"is fixable\".\n\"It is an international agreement that isn't working,\" he added.\n\"The 15,000 checks per week, more than there would be in the port of Rotterdam - in Belfast and Larne, from goods coming from Britain to a population of 1.8 million, is not feasible, it is not deliverable, it is not implementable and will not be implemented.\n\"Europe needs to wake up and smell the coffee here.\"\nThe new DUP leader said he planned to go to the British Irish Council meeting in Fermanagh next week. \nHe said he believed outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster \"would like to lead on that and I would very much like her to do that\".\nHis comments were made after Sinn F\u00e9in joined the SDLP in seeking legal advice over the DUP's non-attendance at North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood told BBC NI's The View on Thursday night that Mr Poots' confirmation that he would attend the next NSMC meeting was \"good news\".\n\"I am glad to see it, because the north-south institutions are a key part of the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said.\n\"There wouldn't have been a Good Friday Agreement frankly that nationalists would have been involved in if there wasn't a north-south dimension, and I want all of the three strands of the Good Friday Agreement to be fully implemented.\"\nThe NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nUnder the DUP's five-point plan in protest at post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, ministers are refusing to take part in north-south engagement where the protocol is being discussed.\nMr Poots was criticised earlier this month for preventing what was billed as a \"long-standing meeting\" relating to agriculture from taking place. \nHe told a Stormont committee earlier on Thursday, speaking in his capacity as NI agriculture minister, that he had every intention of fulfilling his ministerial obligations. \n\"At no point have I refused to attend north-south meetings,\" he said. \nEarlier on Thursday, DUP MLA Paul Givan said any legal action over non-attendance at NSMC meetings would be an overreaction and should be a \"last resort\".\nMr Givan said there had to be a recognition of the opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nHowever, the SDLP's Nichola Mallon said she firmly believed the DUP was in breach of the ministerial code. \nShe also accused the DUP of being \"dishonest\" in how it has communicated its absences from NSMC meetings. \nOn Wednesday, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill had called on Mr Poots to attend this month's meeting, saying the boycott cannot \"be allowed to continue\"."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

Mr Miller confirmed via Twitter that it is a precursor to Mr Trump's return to social media, although it is unclear when or how. \nThe website - which was often referred to as a blog - had a rolling feed of Mr Trump's various posts and gave visitors the option to \"like\" the post and share it to Facebook and Twitter.\nThe link to the website now directs visitors to a page encouraging them to sign up for alerts from Donald Trump.\nIn March, Mr Miller told Fox News he thinks \"we're going to see President Trump returning to social media in probably about two or three months\" and \"with his own platform\". \nMr Trump's own platform has been talked about since early this year, but it is unclear what it might look like.\nSome thought From the Desk of Donald J. Trump was the platform he had alluded to, but Mr Miller confirmed in May that it was not, saying: \"we'll have additional information coming on that front in the very near future.\"\nThe former president was an avid user of social media as a way to communicate directly to his followers. \nSince his removal from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, the former president has not been heard from in the same capacity, although this website was the closest he has been to directly communicating with his followers since January.\nMr Trump was an enthusiastic tweeter, often posting throughout the day - and sometimes at night - about an array of topics, including the 2020 election, coronavirus and what he called \"fake news\" to his nearly 90 million followers. \nHe has been permanently banned from Twitter. \nFacebook's Oversight Board recently upheld the platform's decision but ordered Facebook to review it again within six months. \nYouTube has said it will reactivate Mr Trump's account when the threat of \"real-world violence\" reduces."

      "text": "Cuts to humanitarian aid by the UK are a \"tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people\", 200 charities said in a joint statement.\nOrganisations including Save the Children and Oxfam said humanitarian assistance was being reduced by more than \u00a3500m.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes reflected a \"strategic shift\" in UK aid spending.\nHe also said the \u00a318m aid budget given to China will be reduced to \u00a3900,000.\nFollowing the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis,  the chancellor cut the foreign aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of total national income - a reduction of around \u00a34bn.\nThe Foreign Office controls 80% of aid spending - \u00a38bn - and the priorities were set out by Mr Raab in a written statement.\nMore than \u00a31bn will be spent on Covid and global health, \u00a3500m towards tackling climate change and \u00a3400m on getting girls into education. \nMr Raab said it was a \"challenging financial climate\" due to Covid-19, but said the government had sought \"maximum strategic coherence, impact and value for taxpayers' money\".\nBut aid charities said even the priority areas were receiving less than before, and \u00a3500m less was being spent on humanitarian aid.\nThe 200 charities, which also include Christian Aid and Care International, said: \"Today's announcement is a tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people the UK once supported, and for the UK's reputation as a trusted development partner. \n\"The government has not even spared countries ravaged by humanitarian crisis, disease, war and poverty.\"\nKevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, accused the government of \"making cuts with no consideration for the human harm they will cause\" after reducing aid in Yemen, \"the world's biggest humanitarian crisis\".\nThe government announced it was cutting foreign aid last November but it has still to say precisely where the axe will fall. Charities are waiting anxiously to see which programmes will lose funding, and which will survive. \nBut we are getting some indications from government now about its priorities: climate change, Covid and global health, girls' education, supporting open societies, trade and economic development and so on. \nThe numbers announced by the Foreign Office allow charities to calculate how much less will be spent on each area than before. That will help them plan. What these numbers will not do is diminish the controversy. \nMinisters argue the decision to cut aid has been made, it is time to decide how best to make it happen. \nBut aid charities and many MPs - including a goodly number of Conservatives - still oppose the cuts and are working to stop them. Plans for a legal challenge are being considered. \nCritics say the government can't ignore a legally binding target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. \nThe FCDO reckons it can make the cuts without holding a vote to change the law. Campaigners might want a judge to decide who is right. \nFor now, the government is pressing ahead with cuts it says are needed to keep the Treasury in funds for other priorities. \nOf the \u00a38bn, the Foreign Office will give more than \u00a33bn to multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank.\nHalf of all UK bilateral aid will be spent in Africa, a third in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia.\nThe remaining humanitarian aid budget, focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan, is \u00a3906m.\nMr Raab also announced he would cut Foreign Office aid to China by 95%, to \u00a3900,000.\nBut other parts of government, such as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, give more aid to China and have yet to say if they will cut their payments too."

      "text": "Twitter is launching its new subscription service, Twitter Blue, in Australia and Canada on Thursday.\nThe paid-for extra service will add features such as an \"undo tweet\" button, bookmarks, and a reader mode, Twitter said.\nThe limited launch is designed to \"gain a deeper understanding\" of what customers are looking for.\nBut the company also said the free-to-use version of the platform would also remain.\n\"We've heard from the people that use Twitter a lot, and we mean a lot, that we don't always build power features that meet their needs,\" the company said in a statement.\n\"We took this feedback to heart, and are developing and iterating upon a solution that will give the people who use Twitter the most what they are looking for: access to exclusive features and perks that will take their experience on Twitter to the next level.\"\nTwitter said the new subscription was not designed to undermine the free experience, but to offer \"enhanced and complementary\" features \"for those who want it\".\nIt will cost $3.49 in Canadian dollars and $4.49 in Australian dollars per month, Twitter said. \nNo date has been announced for other countries, but previous listings in mobile app stores have suggested it will eventually cost $2.99 in the US and \u00a32.49 in the UK.\nTwitter said subscribers will get \"perks\" - giving examples such as customisable app icons for phone home screens and what it calls \"fun colour themes\" for the app.\nBut they will also have access to a \"dedicated\" customer support, the company says.\nThe additional features that Twitter says were inspired by user requests include:\n\"We will be listening to feedback and building out even more features and perks for our subscribers over time,\" it said.\nIt does not, however, include verification in the form of a \"blue tick\" on a user profile, which cannot be bought. \nTwitter recently re-opened its verification applications for the first time in years, but was forced to shutter the programme for a few days after just a week of accepting them, because it was inundated with requests.\nTwitter made no secret of plans to charge its top users a small fee for some extra perks - but it's only dipping its wing in the water for now.\nThe much-asked-for undo tweet button is undoubtedly top of the list, for all of us who've ever had a screamer of a typo, or - even worse - accidentally tweeted something we meant to search for.\nBut other features are squarely targeted at the Twitterati elite. \nWhen Twitter bought web reader firm Scroll in May, it made a big deal about Twitter being for news and discussion. Bookmarks and the reader feature for long threads are firmly targeted there.\nAnd for good reason.\nTwitter's growth in active users has slowed in recent years - a potential problem for any social network, where perceived value is often based on numbers. Twitter has never had the users that Facebook has - it boasts hundreds of millions, but not billions. \nBut many of its biggest users are media personalities, politicians, and business leaders - the type of people for whom a small monthly fee might not be too much to ask.\nThis is new territory. Unfounded rumours that Facebook might one day ask for a fee have led to digital panic in the past - so Twitter's two-country opener is a test to see if the idea will fly.  "

      "tags": "Elderly people,Mind,Self harm,Mental health",
      "text": "Self-harm among the over-65s must receive greater focus because of the increased risks associated with the pandemic, a leading expert has said.\nLoneliness, bereavement and reluctance to access GPs can all be causes in older adults, said Prof Nav Kapur, who has produced guidelines on the subject.\nHe warned that in over-65s, without the right help, self-harm can also be a predictor of later suicide attempts. \nThe NHS's mental health director said it had expanded its community support.\nClaire Murdoch added that its services, including face-to-face appointments, had \"continued for all who needed them\", and 24/7 crisis lines had been established.\nOver-65s are hospitalised more than 5,000 times a year in England because of self-harm and self-poisoning, figures obtained from NHS Digital show.\nWendy, 68, told the BBC that the pressures of the pandemic had led her to self-harm.\nShe said her mother's severe ill health with Covid, feelings of isolation and difficulty accessing her GP have all caused an added mental toll.\nShe added she felt like the weight of looking after her mother - who doctors initially said was unlikely to survive - was \"on my shoulders\".\n\"Trying to get her care sorted [once she left hospital] was when I felt at my most delicate,\" she explained, trying to hold back the tears. \n\"I was falling apart underneath... And that was when I ended up harming myself.\"\nProf Kapur, from the University of Manchester, developed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on self-harm and suicide prevention followed by the NHS.\nHe said it was important to challenge the perception \"that self-harm doesn't happen to older people\", and added it was vital that GPs, specialist mental health services and the voluntary sector work together to provide care for patients.\nProf Kapur warned that if older individuals don't get support, it can leave them at a much greater risk of taking their own lives.\n\"In one of the studies we did, [we found that over-65s] who hurt themselves were about 150 times more likely to die by suicide than adults who hadn't - and that was about three times higher than young people who hurt themselves.\n\"So highlighting that every episode of self-harm needs to be taken seriously, especially in older adults, is a really important clinical message. \n\"Even now, sometimes self-harm is regarded as a low-risk behaviour by clinicians.\"\nWendy, from Northamptonshire, first struggled with self-harm in her early 20s.\nFor her, the support of friends, loved ones and medical professionals is vital - but hasn't been as easy to obtain since the pandemic began.\nHer work volunteering as a street pastor and supporting homeless individuals - causes she feels passionately about - have had to be curtailed because of a mixture of lockdowns, and ill health from her own struggle with Covid.\nHer relationships have been affected too.\n\"I couldn't see my partner because we live in separate houses,\" she explained.\nWhile she used to drop into her GP when thoughts of self-harm arose, she said the extra stresses placed on the health service have meant this has not been possible.\nRachel Boyd, from the mental health charity Mind, says there are many ways to help those struggling with self-harm.\nThe self-harm organisation Harmless, which supports individuals ranging from young children to those in their 80s, describes over-65s as a \"forgotten\" group.\nIt said there was a stigma around self-harm that can prevent individuals from seeking support - including from family and friends.\nColin Menz, from the charity, said it was relatively common for older individuals to tell themselves \"why am I still self-harming at this age?\", or believe \"I should have it under control by now\".\nHe added it was important that every individual feels listened to and receives care that addresses the underlying causes of their self-harm.\n\"Each individual is dealing with their own distress... and their support needs are so different,\" he explained.\nAs Wendy looks towards the future, she believes \"there is always hope\".\nShe is being supported by her local church, and said we can all play a role in helping others struggling with self-harm - simply by listening.\n\"Be kind. Have a cup of tea and a chat,\" she explained, as she sits with her closest companion, her dog Bo, in their favourite park. \n\"Somehow after a cup of tea and some kindness, you just feel better.\"\nFor information and support, a list of organisations can be found at bbc.co.uk/actionline."

      "text": "The variant of coronavirus first identified in India is now the dominant strain in the UK, Public Health England (PHE) has said.\nThe number of cases confirmed by laboratory analysis rose by 79% over the last week to 12,431.\nScientists believe the variant, now known as Delta, has overtaken the Kent, or Alpha, variant.\nThey say that there may also be a higher risk of hospitalisation linked to the Delta variant.\nBut that is based on early evidence, and PHE say more data is needed to have more confidence in the finding.\n\"With this variant now dominant across the UK, it remains vital that we all continue to exercise as much caution as possible,\" said Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency.\n\"The way to tackle variants is to tackle the transmission of Covid-19 as a whole.\"\nPHE said the most affected area of the country remains the north west of England. \nConfirmed cases of the Delta variant in Bolton have risen by 795 over the past week to 2,149, with Blackburn with Darwen seeing a near doubling of cases to 724 in total.\nBut scientists say there are encouraging signs that the transmission rate in Bolton has begun to fall and that the actions taken by residents and local authority teams have been successful in reducing spread.\nEarly analyses from England and Scotland suggest that people infected with the Delta variant could be twice as likely to need hospital care. \nBut there are still low numbers of people being admitted to hospital with any variant, and PHE stress that more data is needed to confirm this analysis. \nIn the last week, 94 people in England were admitted to hospital after attending A&E with the Delta variant. \nThe majority had not yet been vaccinated. \nAnd 6% had had both jabs. \nPHE has also published a breakdown of outbreaks and clusters of variants in schools settings with cases rising in line with higher levels of the Delta variant in the community.\nThe latest data suggest that there have been 97 confirmed outbreaks in primary and secondary schools that have had at least one variant case linked to them over the most recent four-week period. That represents around one in 250 schools in the UK. \nIt said its protection teams continue to work closely with local authorities and academies to carry out surveillance to better understand and reduce transmission in these settings."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Department for Education",
      "text": "The education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, has resigned in a row over the lack of \"credible\" Covid catch-up funding.\nSir Kevan took on the role as catch-up tsar in February to develop a long-term plan to help pupils make up for lost learning during the pandemic.\nBut on Wednesday he stepped down saying the government's funding for the plan \"falls far short of what is needed\".\nHead teachers labelled the \u00a31.4bn cash over three years as a \"damp squib\".\nThe Education Policy Institute had calculated that a catch-up funding recovery would need \u00a313.5bn - and Sir Kevan was reported as having put forward plans costing \u00a315bn.\nThe government's proposal represents \u00a350 per pupil per year - and Sir Kevan wrote to the prime minister saying: \"I do not believe it is credible that a successful recovery can be achieved with a programme of support of this size.\"\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister is hugely grateful to Sir Kevan for his work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic.\n\"The government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning, with over \u00a33bn committed for catch up so far.\"\nEarlier on Wednesday, the government announced an extra \u00a31.4bn over three years for education recovery, in addition to the \u00a31.7bn already announced. \nThis included \u00a31bn for 100 million hours of tutoring, aimed at disadvantaged pupils, and \u00a3250m for teacher training and development.\nThe resignation statement from Sir Kevan, reported by The TES, said: \"A half-hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of pupils. \n\"The support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge and is why I have no option but to resign from my post.\"\nHis resignation letter to Boris Johnson said: \"When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support than the government has to date indicated it intends to provide.\"\nThis was a chaotic end to what should have been a showcase of the catch-up plan for England's schools.\nThe widely-respected adviser brought in to deliver the plans walked out in protest - turning a story that should have been about extra money into an awkward debate about the lack of it.\nThe resignation letter from Sir Kevan Collins to the prime minister makes plain that this should not have come as a surprise.\n\"When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support,\" wrote Sir Kevan.\nBoris Johnson and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had spent the day trying to keep the plans afloat, presenting them as a \"next step\" with more to follow - after strong criticism that the funding was only a tenth of what was required.\nBut Sir Kevan's resignation has fired a torpedo at the government's contention that school recovery is one of its top priorities.\nEarlier, head teachers had said they were \"hugely disappointed\" by the announcement after expectations of a much bigger set of proposals.\nPaul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, described it as a \"damp squib\" and said \"education recovery cannot be done on the cheap\".\nAs such, he said: \"It is completely understandable that Sir Kevan chose not to become a pawn in whatever game the government is playing.\"\nMr Johnson then reassured schools and parents that more funding would be \"coming down the track\".\nSir Kevan had been responsible for overseeing efforts to help schools in England recover from the disruption of the pandemic and lockdowns, which has seen pupils studying from home and exams cancelled over two academic years.\nHe had reportedly called for funding for 100 extra hours of teaching per pupil - including for sports, music and the arts.\nBut any extra teaching time, or longer school days, will now depend on getting further funding from the spending review.\nIn a statement, Sir Kevan said a \"sustained and comprehensive programme of support\" would be needed and that \"more will be needed to meet the scale of the challenge\".\nGeoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"We are sad but not surprised that Sir Kevan Collins is standing down.\n\"We know that Sir Kevan had much bolder and broader plans but that these required substantially more investment than the government was willing to provide.\n\"He's tried his hardest on behalf of children and young people, but, in the final analysis, the political will just wasn't there to support him.\"\nLabour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the resignation was a \"damning indictment of the Conservatives' education catch-up plan\".\n\"He was brought in by Boris Johnson because of his experience and expertise in education, but the government have thrown out his ideas as soon as it came to stumping up the money needed to deliver them.\"\nBefore taking up his post as tsar, Sir Kevan was head of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), which examines evidence for what works in education.\nAs EEF chief executive, he ran an organisation that examined ideas for raising achievement, with the aim of breaking the link between deprivation and poor outcomes in school.\nSir Kevan has had a long career in education, as a former teacher who went on to be the director of children's services and chief executive of Tower Hamlets, east London."

      "text": "Calls to \"fast-track\" second vaccine doses in Conwy have been made amid \"serious concerns\" over a Covid variant cluster.\nThere are now 35 cases of the Delta variant in Llandudno, Llandudno Junction and Penrhyn Bay.\nLlanwrst councillor Aaron Wynne said the ministers must act urgently to \"stem the spread\".\nThe Welsh government said local teams could already bring forward second jabs in areas of risk.\nAny decision to fast track second doses would be made by the area's Incident Management Teams, including public health officials and the local health board, and would not need ministerial approval.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Wynne said: \"It is a concern for us locally here in Conwy that we are now near the top of the table for new coronavirus cases in Wales.\n\"It's now increasingly obvious that the Delta variant, or the Indian variant, is the new dominant Covid variant in Conwy at this time.\"\nHe added that an \"extremely busy\" bank holiday weekend had raised concerns cases of the variant could spread further.\n\"If we can quickly administer the second dose to residents in Conwy, [it would] not only offer locals protection against this new variant, but hopefully it will stem the spread of coronavirus in the community without us having to go back to those restrictions,\" he said. \n\"There is a window when it's best to receive your second dose, but having a second dose is better than only just having your first. \n\"At the moment the health board is vaccinating people across north Wales - still giving some people their first jab - but as we're now seeing that cluster in Llandudno, I think it would be wise for the Welsh government to review possibly giving people in Conwy their second dose quicker.\"\nOn Wednesday, health minister Eluned Morgan said the rise in cases of the variant was \"very serious\", and that this could hamper plans for further easing of restrictions in Wales.\n\"This is becoming very serious, we need to make sure that we try and nip this in the bud in that particular area and obviously all of this will play into how we assess the situation on Friday,\" Baroness Morgan said.\n\"I don't think we'd define it quite yet as community transmission, but it's on its way to becoming that and that's why we really need people in the area to co-operate with us\u2026 to make sure that we can try and suppress this particular variant.\"\n\"The last thing we want to see is this spreading across the whole of Wales,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\nAcross the UK, 12,431 cases of the variant have now been confirmed, of which 97 are in Wales.\nThis is up 67% compared with last week.\nIn England there are now 10,797 cases, up 75% in a week, with 26 in Northern Ireland - up 37% - and 1,511 in Scotland, a rise of 115% in a week.\nPeople in Llandudno, Llandudno Junction and Penrhyn Bay have been urged to get tested, even if they do not have symptoms.\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board has asked people without symptoms to get a lateral flow test at a mobile unit at Ysgol Awel y Mynydd in Llandudno Junction.\nThose in the area who do have symptoms have been asked to attend Conwy Business Centre for a more accurate PCR test.\nGareth Davies, MS for the Vale of Clwyd, told BBC Radio Wales the Conwy cluster was \"very concerning\" but that \"on a UK level it's relatively low\". \n\"We've got to be cautious of it, the testing facilities are there,\" he said, after residents in Llandudno, Llandudno Junction and Penrhyn Bay were urged to get a Covid test, whether they had symptoms or not. \n\"A collective effort to try and nip it in the bud is going to be the best way of getting it sorted. \n\"Hopefully it can stay in one area and not spread across north Wales.\" \nHe added that enforcing local restrictions was \"a fine balance\".\n\"That area of Llandudno... is an area that relies heavily on hospitality,\" he continued. \n\"There are a lot of tourism and businesses that have struggled in that area. \n\"I think it's a balance of getting it right and the Welsh government have got some big decisions to make in the next 24 hours that are going to not only effect the numbers of the virus but also the livelihoods of a lot of business that have just been able to open. \n\"It's going to be a crucial 24 hours for the Welsh government.\"\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"Local public health teams are able to bring forward and prioritise second doses of the vaccine to areas of risk, if they feel this is appropriate.\n\"Public Health teams across Wales are doing an excellent job in tracing, testing and promoting vaccinations with the aim of stopping and slowing the spread of the virus.\""

      "tags": "Conservative Party,UK aid",
      "text": "The government is facing a growing rebellion that could force it to reverse cuts to foreign aid.\nThirty Tory rebels, including former prime minister Theresa May, have now promised to back a bid to increase aid spending in 2022.\nNext week's planned Commons vote will come in the same week the government hosts world leaders at the G7 summit. \nA minister said despite the \"temporary\" cut, the UK remained \"one of the largest donors of aid in the world\".\nThe rebels want to restore aid spending to 0.7% of national income from next January, after ministers reduced it to 0.5% this year, a cut of almost \u00a34bn.\nThe group is hoping to use a technical procedure, involving an amendment to a new law setting up the UK's new \"high risk\" science agency, to bring about the change.\nThe aid reduction has meant millions of pounds less is being spent on supporting girls' education, reproductive health, clean water, HIV/AIDS, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen and Syria, and hundreds of other projects. \nCharities warned that millions of women and children would not receive food and support and have predicted that more than 100,000 people could die as a result of the government's decision. \nThe United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, has described the aid cuts as a \"death sentence\". \nThe reductions to the overseas development assistance budget were introduced by the government this year without a vote, in part because ministers feared defeat at the hands of MPs.\nInitially ministers conceded the change would require a change to the 2015 law, passed during the Tory-Lib Dem coalition, which made the 0.7% target legally binding.\nBut in March, Boris Johnson argued a change would not be required because the current law allows the target to be temporarily missed in exceptional circumstances. \nThe government has promised to restore spending to the 0.7% level \"when the fiscal situation allows\" - but has not specified a date. \nCritics have argued the decision to cut spending without changing current legislation is unlawful, and have been looking for an opportunity to test opinion in the Commons.\nOn Thursday, former Tory premier Theresa May, her former de facto deputy PM Damian Green, former Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb and former defence minister Johnny Mercer joined those supporting the rebellion.\nIt means there are now 30 Tory MPs supporting the amendment, including seven former cabinet ministers.\nFormer International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell - who is leading the rebellion - said he was confident of finding the 45 or so Conservative rebels needed to defeat the government. \nHe said more Conservative MPs were coming forward to support the amendment to \"stand by\" the party's manifesto promise to spend 0.7% of national income on aid.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Mitchell tabled his amendment to the Advanced Research and Invention Agency Bill. \nThe bill, which would set up a new agency designed to come up with innovative policy, is due to receive detailed scrutiny in the Commons on Monday.\nMr Mitchell's technical amendment would oblige the new agency to make up any shortfall in aid spending if the government were to miss the 0.7% target.\nWhitehall officials are studying whether the amendment is likely to be considered within the scope of the bill. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide on Monday whether it should be put to a vote.\nOne of the Conservative rebels, Caroline Nokes, said the group had put \"an awful lot of work\" into designing their amendment, and she was \"very hopeful\" it would be selected.\nBut, speaking to BBC News, she added the group was \"entirely in the hands of the Speaker at this point\".\nLabour's shadow international development secretary Preet Kaur Gill said the aid cut had \"risked lives\" during the pandemic and undermined the UK's credibility as a \"leader on the greatest global challenges\".\nShe urged ministers to \"do the right thing\" ahead of the G7 summit and reinstate the UK's commitment to spending 0.7% on foreign aid.\nResponding to the move, Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins said the cut was a \"small temporary reduction,\" and the UK still remained \"one of the largest donors of aid in the world\".\nShe told Sky News: \"The prime minister has made clear that this is a temporary measure.\n\"In 2019, no one could have foreseen the extent of the pandemic and the measures we were going to have to take as a country in order to deal with this; it has had a huge impact on our economy.\"\n\"So we've had to make some very, very difficult decisions,\" she added. \n\"I do believe we still have a record of which we can very much hold our head up high in terms of international development.\""

      "tags": "Nasa,Geology,Space exploration",
      "text": "Nasa has announced that it is sending two new missions to Venus in order to examine the planet's atmosphere and geological features. \nThe missions, which have each been awarded $500m (\u00a3352m) in funding, are due to launch between 2028 and 2030. \nNasa administrator Bill Nelson said the missions would offer the \"chance to investigate a planet we haven't been to in more than 30 years\". \nThe last US probe to visit the planet was the Magellan orbiter in 1990. \nHowever, other spacecraft - from Europe and Japan - have orbited the planet since then. \nThe missions were picked following a peer review process and were chosen based on their potential scientific value and the feasibility of their development plans. \n\"These two sister missions both aim to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world, capable of melting lead at the surface,\" Mr Nelson said. \nVenus is the second planet from the sun and the hottest planet in the solar system with a surface temperature of 500C - high enough to melt lead. \nThe Davinci+ (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging) mission will measure the planet's atmosphere to gain insight into how it formed and evolved. It will also aim to determine whether Venus ever had an ocean. \nDavinci+ is expected to return the first high resolution images of the planet's \"tesserae\" geological features. Scientists believe these features could be comparable to continents on Earth and could suggest that Venus has plate tectonics. \nThe second mission, Veritas (Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy), will map the planet's surface to understand its geological history and investigate how it developed so differently than Earth. \nIt will use a form of radar to chart surface elevations and discover whether volcanoes and earthquakes are still happening. \n\"It is astounding how little we know about Venus, but the combined results of these missions will tell us about the planet from the clouds in the sky through the volcanoes on its surface all the way down to its very core,\" said Tom Wagner from Nasa's Planetary Science Division.\n\"It will be as if we have rediscovered the planet,\" he added. \nAnalysis by Paul Rincon, Science Editor, BBC News website\nOver the last few decades, Mars has dominated Nasa's budget for planetary missions. In the meantime, researchers studying Venus have become philosophical about the lack of priority given to their planet. \nBut that has been changing. New ideas, interpretations and new people have been transforming our understanding of Earth's nearest neighbour. Long thought to have been a \"dead\" planet by some, there are many who now think Venus may be geologically active, perhaps with periodic volcanism. \nIt may have harboured oceans for a billion years of its history, and there is even a region of the planet's thick atmosphere where microbial life could survive, floating among the clouds. \nScientists who have devoted their careers to studying this hothouse world are jubilant that the planet is finally back on Nasa's radar.\nYou may also be interested in:"

      "title": "Hearings in London aim to assess allegations of genocide in China",
      "tags": "Xinjiang,Human rights,China",
      "text": "A series of hearings begins in London on Friday aiming to gather evidence on whether the Chinese government's alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region constitute a genocide.\nAn eight-member panel, chaired by the prominent British barrister Sir Geoffrey Nice, will hear from about 30 witnesses over four days of testimony. \nThe hearings have no government backing and the panel's conclusions are not binding on ministers, but the organisers say they hope the process will add to the body of evidence around the allegations against China.\nThe panel consists of academics, lawyers, and a former British diplomat. In selecting its members, the organisers intentionally drew from a mix of disciplines and avoided China experts to avoid a risk of prejudgment, Sir Geoffrey said.\nThe hearings, branded by organisers as the Uyghur Tribunal, were arranged by the London-based businessman Nick Vetch. Mr Vetch was previously involved with similar hearings in 2019 that examined allegations of organ harvesting in China.\nThe Chinese state has been accused of crimes against humanity and genocide in Xinjiang, a large region in the country's northwest which is home to the Uyghurs and other minority Muslim groups.\nExperts say that at least a million Uyghurs and other Muslims have been detained in the region and held in extra-judicial camps or sent to prisons. Former detainees and residents of Xinjiang have made allegations of torture, mass surveillance, and forced sterilisation.\nChina denies that abuses are taking place, and says its network of camps in Xinjiang are for \"re-education\" and vocational training purposes. Xu Guixiang, the spokesman for the Xinjiang regional government, called the hearings a \"total violation of international law and order, a serious desecration of the victims of real genocide, and a serious provocation to the 25 million people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang\".  \nA dozen experts have been invited to give evidence at the hearings, including Dr Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Denver, Colorado; Dr Jo Smith Finley, a reader in Chinese Studies at Newcastle University; Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute; and Adrian Zenz, who has published reports on forced labour and abortion in Xinjiang.\nDolkun Isa, the president of the World Uyghur Congress, will also give evidence. Mr Isa told the BBC that the privately-organised hearings were the only option available for investigating China's actions in Xinjiang because the two international courts which might otherwise take up a case had no plans to do so.\nThe International Criminal Court announced in December it would not investigate because China, as a non-member, was outside of its jurisdiction, and the International Court of Justice can only take a case that has been approved by the UN Security Council, over which China has veto power.\nMr Isa, who believes his mother died while in detention in Xinjiang, and who discovered this week that his brother had been sentenced to life in prison there, said he hoped the hearings would force politicians to \"pay more attention\".\n\"And not only pay more attention, but take concrete steps like imposing sanctions. This is the moral obligation of all countries,\" he said.\nAnother witness, the prominent Uyghur scholar and activist Abduweli Ayup, told the BBC the hearings were \"a platform to tell our stories\".\nMr Ayup said he would be thinking about his niece Mihray Erkin while he gave evidence. Ms Erkin was a graduate from Shanghai's Jiao Tong University and Tokyo University and went on to join the staff of Japan's Nara Institute of Science and Technology. In 2019, she returned to Xinjiang after authorities put pressure on her parents, Mr Ayup said.\nShe is believed to have died in November, aged 30, in Yanbulak Detention Center in Xinjiang. Reports of her death were confirmed in May by Radio Free Asia.\n\"If there is a question about my niece I will be happy to answer it. That is the personal side, the suffering,\" Mr Ayup said.\nThe panel will be chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice, who previously led the prosecution of the former Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic. Sir Geoffrey told the BBC that the inability or failure of international criminal courts to take up investigating the allegations of genocide had left a \"void of information\".\n\"What we hope to achieve is to provide facts that others may use,\" he said. \"The tribunal will not go further than that, it will not look outside the crimes it has been asked to investigate, and it will not overreach by making recommendations about what others should or shouldn't do. It will simply provide facts for others to use.\"\nThe US State Department has previously described China's actions in Xinjiang as a genocide, and the parliaments of the UK, Canada, Netherlands, and Lithuania have passed resolutions making the same declaration.\nOthers have argued that genocide is a specific term with legal force that should only be determined by a criminal court.\nThe case for genocide is based on reports that China is taking steps to erase the culture of the Uyghurs and assimilate or diminish the population through programmes of forced relocation and birth control. \nIn a report published in April, the US-based charity Human Rights Watch concluded that China was responsible for crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, but stopped short of calling the state's actions a genocide."

      "text": "The UK government is \"open-minded\" on SNP calls to extend furlough, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants the job support scheme extended \"for as long as it is needed\".\nThe call came ahead of a virtual meeting between Boris Johnson and the three devolved administrations on how to emerge from the Covid pandemic.\nThe summit was postponed after the Scottish and Welsh first ministers criticised the \"very rough\" agenda. \nMs Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford said the discussion needed to be \"meaningful\" and had asked Mr Johnson to provide more detail of the meeting's schedule. \nMr Johnson called the summit in the wake of the election results in Great Britain earlier this month, which saw Ms Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP) returned to government in Scotland and Mr Drakeford's Labour triumph in Wales. \nDowning Street said the meeting - which was scheduled to begin at 13:30 BST - was an opportunity to share information and ideas on the way ahead.\nFirst Minister Ms Sturgeon said that the four-nation meeting could not be \"a PR exercise\" and that getting \"certainty over funding... is the bare minimum or our expectations\". \nAhead of the summit, the SNP urged the UK government to consider extending furlough \"beyond September if this is required\".\nThe party also said those who have started jobs since 2 March 2021 should be able to be furloughed if needed.\nThe furlough scheme - officially called the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) - was launched in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, to minimise unemployment.\nIt now covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month.\nThe scheme is currently due to expire at the end of September. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland, Mr Gove said he was \"open-minded\" on the SNP's proposal.\nHe added that furlough scheme was a \"huge success\" that was only possible \"thanks to the broad shoulders of the UK Treasury\".\nHe also said Scotland would benefit from more spending by the UK government adding \"it is absolutely vital that we build back better.\"\nIn an earlier statement, Mr Gove said the four nations' \"joint success\" on fighting Covid had \"shown the world what we can achieve as a United Kingdom.\n\"We must take the same approach to the difficult challenge of rebuilding our economy and public services from the damaging impact of Covid-19.\" \nMr Gove, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the secretaries of state for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are also expected to attend the meeting.\nThere is a practical side to this meeting and, as ever, a political one. \nOfficials in Downing Street say the prime minister wants to hear how the different parts of the UK are emerging from lockdown. \nThere will be a discussion on how ideas can be shared and how links created during the pandemic can be maintained. \nBut Number 10 will also want to reinforce the message that being part of the UK has helped in the fight against Covid. \nThe meeting is expected to hear that the success of the vaccine rollout was down to the buying power of the UK government and supplies being sourced through London. \nThe work of members of the British armed forces who helped in the rollout of the vaccine will also be highlighted. \nThe virtual meeting with political representatives from across the UK will also examine how the pandemic has placed extra burdens on the health service and disrupted the education of millions of pupils and students.\nOn Tuesday, the UK announced zero Covid deaths for the first time since the pandemic began, with a government adviser saying the latest coronavirus data looks encouraging. \nThe timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK. \nIn Northern Ireland, ministers have been gradually introducing major relaxations of the Covid restrictions, with indoor hospitality, tourist accommodation and non-essential retail all allowed to reopen with mitigations in place. The next review is due on 10 June. \nThere is currently a debate going on in England as to whether restrictions should be ended on 21 June. \nIn Wales, the health minister has said the easing of restrictions - due to be reviewed on Thursday - could be affected by a \"very serious\" cluster of the Delta variant in Conwy county.\nIt comes a day after the relaxing of measures in Scotland was paused for millions of people in areas where cases have been rising."

      "text": "Ageing equipment to spot cancer early is being upgraded to clear growing waiting lists - but there are concerns over a shortage of staff to operate the new scanners.\nMore than 500,000 people are now waiting for treatment on the Welsh NHS.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said \u00a325m would be spent on NHS diagnostic equipment to stop a \"bottleneck\" in treatment.\nThe Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) warned more staff must be recruited.\nOncologist Sarah Gwynne said new CT scanners would make treatment more accurate and improve patient care.\nDr Gwynne said the CT scanner at Singleton Hospital, Swansea, was 10 years old and \"technology had moved on dramatically in that time\".\nThe (RCR) welcomed the new equipment, but said radiographers, radiologists and doctors were needed to operate it and interpret the results, adding there was \"a shortage of all three\", with more expected to leave the NHS or reduce their hours in the next year.\nEarlier this year, the shortage was described as \"shocking\".\n\"It's very welcome as the equipment it's funding is top-end stuff and it is going to make a different to patients,\" said Dr Toby Wells, from the RCR.\n\"You need the machines [but] you need the radiographers to take the imaging and the radiologists, the doctors, to interpret what the scans show and there's a shortage of all three of those.\"\nThere have been concerns that many people fearing they have cancer may not have contacted their GPs during the coronavirus pandemic.\nLatest Welsh government figures show more people than ever - the equivalent of 18% of the population - are waiting for planned treatments. \nThere were 568,367 people on waiting lists in March, up 24.4% on the same time last year.\nWith many people unable to attend hospitals for imaging and diagnostic appointments during the pandemic, waiting times for scans and tests have also increased. \nAnnouncing \u00a325m to upgrade CT, X-Ray, ultrasound and MRI machines across Wales, Baroness Morgan said the new diagnostic equipment was vital to start to clear the \"backlog\" and would \"transform lives\".\nSpeaking during a visit to Singleton Hospital, she said she was concerned about 30,000 fewer people had contacted the NHS about cancer concerns this year, compared to 2020.\nClearing the waiting list for cancer scans and treatment was a \"key priority\" for the Welsh government because people with cancer \"cannot wait\".\n\"We are aware there is a huge backlog that we need to address, but cancer services in particular have always been essential services throughout this pandemic,\" she said.\nDr Gwynne said she hoped a \u00a35.5m new state-of-the-art CT simulator would help to cut waiting lists for treatment, with its accuracy speeding up the process.\nShe said the new CT simulator would allow them to get a \"better picture of where the tumour is\" to allow them to kill cancer cells with radiation more accurately, without harming surrounding cells.\nShe said this greatly benefitted patients with tumours in their chest - such as breast and lung cancer - as they can move while breathing, as well as helping target radiation.\nThe RCR estimates that Wales needs to recruit 97 more radiologists to meet growing demand.\nIt also warned that many radiologists plan to leave NHS Wales next year and those staying intending to reduce their hours.\n\"They've started and they've given us this kit and they've funded more radiology trainees, but we need more,\" said Dr Wells.\nThose concerns were echoed by Judi Rhys, chief executive at Tenovus Cancer Care: \"We know that there are still approximately 35,000 people in Wales 'missing' from the cancer system and additional diagnostic equipment will help address the backlog.\n\"But we also need to invest in other elements of the NHS, including the workforce.\"\nThe Welsh government has already announced \u00a3100m of funding to help deal with the backlog caused by Covid-19.\nBaroness Morgan is to announce that \u00a325m of the cash would be used to upgrade \"ageing equipment as part of our effort to ensure the NHS can respond to demand with resilient services\".\nThe spending plan includes:\n\"It's our priority to support the recovery of the NHS and this is a first step to ensuring the health service has access to sufficient diagnostic capacity to deal with the people waiting as a result of the pandemic,\" Baroness Morgan added.\n\"We aren't out of the pandemic yet. Investing in the diagnostic national capital replacement programme and upgrading the equipment available to our incredible healthcare workforce is key to diagnosing, treating and caring for people as we move forward.\"\nCancer charities have raised concerns about the impact of the pandemic on waiting times for both patients and staff.\nBaroness Morgan has also previously warned that the Welsh NHS faced \"a gargantuan task\" to tackle \"record high\" NHS waiting lists."

We were criminalised.\""

      "tags": "Foreign & Commonwealth Office,Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office,UK aid,International aid,Humanitarian aid",
      "text": "The UK's temporarily cutting back money it gives to other countries, in a move which some charities say will harm poor communities around the world.\nThe government says the impact of the pandemic on the UK's finances means there has to be a temporary reduction in foreign aid.\nThe target for foreign aid spend has usually been 0.7% of gross national income - but that will come down to 0.5% which will be around \u00a34bn less.\nBut what is the money actually used for?\nIn 2020, Britain spent \u00a314.5bn on aid, meeting that 0.7% target, according to provisional data.\nThere's always been debate over the UK's aid spend, with some people saying the UK shouldn't be helping people overseas while cutting services at home.\nThey argue problems of poverty and inequality are being fuelled by conflict, corruption and political instability which makes foreign aid worthless.\nOthers say it's a mark of the UK's generosity and helps address the difference in wealth between developed and developing countries - and helping to save lives.\nIn its most basic definition, foreign aid is resources given from one country to another.\nIt can involve a transfer of things like food or military equipment, or even people to provide training and medical help.\nUsually these are loaned by governments, organisations and individuals in richer countries to help people in poorer countries.\nAn example would be the UK sending \u00a3200m to help developing nations battle coronavirus.\nThere are different types of aid, such as emergency or short-term aid which is needed after sudden disasters such as earthquakes, flooding or tsunamis.\nConditional or tied aid is when one country donates money or resources to another but with conditions attached, for example a trade deal.\nThere is also aid funded by donations from the public through charities such as Children in Need.\nLong-term or development aid involves providing local communities with education and skills.\nMoney shared through international organisations such as the World Bank or UN, rather than by one specific country, is called multilateral aid.\nOverall, the top five countries receiving UK aid were Pakistan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Yemen and Nigeria, with almost all the money going to countries in Africa and Asia.\nIn 2019, the UK spent \u00a31.5bn on humanitarian assistance - which is short-term help in immediate crises - mostly in Yemen, Syria and Bangladesh, statistics show.\nAround \u00a31.4bn was spent on health projects including medical research, family planning and infectious disease control globally.\nThere will be cuts across lots of different areas.\n\"The impact will be profound and very damaging, particularly for poor people,\" says Professor Guy Howard, an expert in international development from the University of Bristol.\nThe UN Population Fund, which supports family planning, says an initial commitment by the UK to spend \u00a3154m on supplies this year will shrink to \u00a323m - and there'll also be a drop in funding to the UN's children fund, Unicef.\nAnd funding for things like water, sanitation and hygiene projects will reportedly be cut by more than 80%.\nProf Howard feels cutting back aid from a \"core public health area seems odd.\"\nHe wants to see a reverse to cuts in water and sanitation because \"that's the foundation of public health\" and vital in dealing with different diseases.\n\"We often forget a thousand children a day die of diarrhoea because of poor water sanitation.\"\nIt's an important goal in its own right, he says, \"but what Covid has shown us is just how important water supply is in combatting the disease.\n\"If you have to collect water from a shared water point, social distancing will be virtually impossible.\"\nAs the amount the UK donates is a percentage of national income, the amount of money it spends on foreign aid would have been less this year even before the cut was announced. That's because the economy's got smaller during the pandemic.\nBut Prof Howard says the decision to cut 0.2% makes it an even more difficult situation for the countries which receive the aid.\nSeveral countries have met the 0.7% UN aid target including Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nBut many others don't hit the target.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes reflected a \"strategic shift\" in UK aid spending.\nA spokeswoman from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office told Newsbeat reducing spend was a \"tough but necessary decision\" and the government's \"committed to returning to 0.7%\" once the financial situation allows.\nMore than \u00a31bn will be spent on Covid and global health, \u00a3500m towards tackling climate change and \u00a3400m on getting girls into education.\nMuch of the humanitarian aid budget will be focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A second dose of the Pfizer vaccine will be offered to 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK, following updated advice from the UK's vaccine committee.\nAll over-18s across the UK can have two Covid vaccine doses, as can some vulnerable, high-risk children over 12.\nHealthy, low-risk children between 12 and 15 have only been offered a single dose - which should be delayed until 12 weeks after a coronavirus infection.\nThe Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says a second dose for those aged 16 and 17 is safe and effective 12 weeks after the first.\nThe JCVI has previously held back from recommending a second dose because of concerns over a very rare heart condition, called myocarditis, experienced by tiny numbers of young people - particularly boys - after the second dose.\nIt says it is now reassured by evidence from other countries that a 12-week gap between doses would lower that already very small risk.\nA decision on a second dose for 12-15s has not yet been made but could happen in the next few weeks.\nIn the meantime, all 12-17 year olds should wait 12 weeks after a Covid infection before having their first or second dose.\nNo vaccine is currently approved for under-12s in the UK.\nIf you're over 18, and want to book your first, second or booster dose, you can find out how here.\nNo. If you're under 40 or pregnant you'll be given Pfizer or Moderna.\nEvery woman who is pregnant (or planning to become pregnant) is encouraged to get two vaccine doses. Hospital figures show that 98% of pregnant women admitted to intensive care this year were not vaccinated.\nUnder-18s have so far been offered Pfizer. \nThe vaccines are very effective at protecting people against becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid-19. \nLatest data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests more than 90% protection against hospitalisation and death with all three vaccines.\nThe vaccines are less effective at stopping people becoming infected by the virus, developing mild symptoms or passing it on - but they do reduce the risk of that happening too.\nIf you've been double-jabbed, you are far less likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid.\nCovid vaccines aren't compulsory, but everyone is urged to get jabbed to protect themselves, their family, friends and wider society.\nChildren under 16 don't need parental consent to get jabbed, as long as they are believed to have \"enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what's involved in their treatment\". This is known as \"Gillick competence\". \nBeing fully vaccinated can make travelling to most other countries easier, and in many cases means you will not have to self-isolate either when you return to the UK. \nHowever, it's worth bearing in mind that under-16s are not eligible for their own digital NHS Covid Pass, which is now accepted widely as proof of vaccination. \nWhat's more, the single jab which most UK teenagers have so far received, is not recognised as full vaccination by some countries (including France), and more tests may be required.\nCheck your destination's rules on the Foreign Office website before you travel. \nMost are mild, completely normal and disappear after a few days. \nThey happen because the body's defences are reacting to the vaccine, and include:\nA very small number of people had a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, so you should discuss any allergies you have before vaccination.\nThere's no evidence to suggest you should avoid alcohol altogether, but drinking in large quantities can suppress your immune system.\nSome women have experienced unusually heavy, painful or prolonged periods after being jabbed.\nThis may be because the vaccine prompts an increase in activity in the immune system, which also plays a role in the menstrual cycle. \nHowever, there's no evidence  the vaccine has any impact on pregnancy or fertility.\nPregnant women are being urged to get the vaccine, to protect themselves and their babies.\nCoronavirus can cause serious illness in some women in later pregnancy, and possibly a slightly higher rate of stillbirth.\nIf you're planning a pregnancy or are breastfeeding, government guidance says you can still get vaccinated, \nA recent study suggests vaccination can help improve long Covid symptoms.\nResearchers think the vaccine could be pressing the body's reset button and helping it recover.

The list of firms will be updated on a rolling basis.\nIt expands an order previously issued by former President Donald Trump.\nEven before the official announcement, China suggested it would retaliate.\nUnder the new order, US investors will be banned from buying or selling publicly-traded securities for other companies including the China General Nuclear Power Corporation, China Mobile Limited and Costar Group.\nIt expands the previous list from 31 firms to include surveillance companies and is aimed at ensuring \"US persons are not financing the military industrial complex of the People's Republic of China,\" one White House official said.\n\"The prohibitions are intentionally targeted and scoped to maximise the impact on the targets while minimising harm to global markets,\" the official added.\nHuawei recently said that sanctions imposed on it by the US in 2019 have had a major impact on its mobile phone business.\nThe US took action amid claims that the company posed a security risk and last July, and the UK said it would exclude the company from building its 5G network.\nThe new list of companies barred from US investment will update one from the Department of Defense.\n\"We fully expect that in the months ahead... we'll be adding additional companies to the new executive order's restrictions,\" the White House said.\nIt comes as the surveillance of citizens, including Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region in particular, has come under scrutiny.\nThe Biden administration has also accused China of acting more aggressively abroad and more repressively at home. \nThe China-US relationship is crucial to both sides and the wider world, with Beijing repeatedly calling on the new administration in Washington to improve relations which deteriorated under predecessor Donald Trump.\nIn their first meeting under the Biden presidency last month, the two countries' top trade negotiators held \"candid, pragmatic\" talks on their trading relationship.\nPresident Biden has insisted, however, that existing tariffs will be kept in place for now as he looks to boost the US economy, which was hit hard early in the pandemic but is now recovering.\nChinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin suggested China would retaliate against the latest measures.\n\"China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and resolutely support Chinese enterprises in safeguarding their rights and interests in accordance with the law,\" he said.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nMore than 20 healthcare organisations representing nurses, doctors, surgeons and therapists meet officials from all four UK nations today to plead for better protection from coronavirus. They say current guidance on kit leaves them vulnerable to infection through the air, particularly from new variants, and want better masks that can filter out aerosols carrying the virus. The UK government says emerging evidence is continually monitored.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson will chair a meeting involving the first ministers of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales later to discuss how to emerge from the pandemic. Downing Street says it's an opportunity to share information and ideas. The summit was postponed from last week after Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford complained about a \"very rough agenda\".\nOnline retailer Amazon is to expand its Covid testing lab facilities in the UK, saying it will benefit employees and public health. Last year, it set up a facility in Greater Manchester to analyse employees' samples which has so far processed 900,000 tests. However, analysts believe it could also provide business opportunities in the health sector.\nLeaving work at the office can be tricky when \"the office\" is your kitchen table. With 35.9% of employees said to have worked from home last year, the Prospect union is calling for a legal \"right to disconnect\" that would ban bosses from \"routinely emailing or calling\" outside working hours. But companies say this would be difficult at a time when many people are demanding flexible working.\nFifty days out from the Olympics, Tokyo 2020's president says she's \"100%\" certain the Games will go ahead. That's despite recent polls suggesting nearly 70% of Japan's population do not want them to happen, with the country in the midst of a new wave of the virus.

I looked through my sight, it went to his forehead.\n\"He (Khan) put his hand to his head in disbelief and so I went for central body mass.\"\nThe officer also explained how he tried to clear people from the area as he feared the bomb would go off.\nWS5 told the inquest: \"I remember there was a lady pushing a pram, not a care in the world, and river cruise boats going by (on the Thames).\n\"I've seen IEDs [improvised explosive devices] and what devastation it can cause. It could have caused death or serious injury,\" he said.\nAnother officer, YX16, described how he was trying to get people away from the footpaths underneath the north end of London Bridge as he believed Khan's device \"was going to explode\".\n\"I was screaming to get out of the way, 'go go go, there's a bomb on the bridge',\" he said.\nThe officer added that he \"focused on trying to get people out of the way, to save lives\".\nA third officer, known as YX99, said his first thought was that Khan was \"selfish\" for wanting to be killed by police.\nHe said: \"I was slightly stunned. I was thinking... you want to kill yourself and you want me to do it.\n\"You start thinking of all different outcomes and what you're going to do.\n\"I instinctively used my hand to touch his torso.\n\"Your thoughts are going through your mind that if someone's mentally ill, you've just shot someone unarmed and on the floor... that's playing on your mind.\"\nIn all, six officers fired 20 shots during a 10-minute period, although there was a lengthy gap between the first two shots and the remaining 18.\nKhan was pronounced dead about an hour later, once the scene had been made safe.\nHis suicide belt turned out to be a fake, jurors heard.\nThe inquest continues."

People arriving in the UK from these destinations will be required to stay in a quarantine hotel for 10 days at a fixed cost of \u00a31,750 per adult.\nThe changes come into effect at 04:00 BST on Tuesday.\nNo new countries will be added to the green list, Mr Shapps said.\nThe removal of Portugal means the green list will, from Tuesday, consist of: Australia, Brunei, the Falkland Islands, the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Iceland, Israel, New Zealand, Singapore, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.\nThe transport secretary said two factors had led to the decision to downgrade Portugal, along with the islands of Madeira and the Azores.\n\"One is the positivity rate has nearly doubled since the last review in Portugal,\" he said.\n\"And the other is there's a sort of Nepal mutation of the so-called Indian variant [now known as Delta] which has been detected and we just don't know the potential for that to be a vaccine-defeating mutation.\"\nOn the so-called \"Nepal mutation\", Public Health England told the BBC it was \"aware of reports linking Nepal to Delta (VOC-21APR-02) with the additional mutation K417N\".\n\"This variant is present in multiple countries including a small number of cases in the UK, detected through rapid testing and whole genome sequencing,\" PHE said. \"We are investigating K417N to better understand its significance.\"\nOn 2 June, Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult.\nKerry, a photographer from the Wirral, says her family - like many others - have had \"the year from hell\".  \nHer partner has been shielding for over a year due to an auto-immune disease, Kerry has had to nurse her mother through Covid-19 and a stroke, and her 18-month old son has hardly known a world without a pandemic.\nShe was just about to book a trip to Portugal when the rules changed. \"This holiday was everything for us our first with our baby who has had no experiences in his first 18 months on this planet,\" she says.\nBut others say they are likely to make the trip anyway.\nOne man told the BBC: \"Unless they say, you must not go, you will be fined if you go, we might well still go and just have to bear the additional costs of an extra PCR test and the fact that we have to quarantine.\" \nRead more travellers' reactions\nLabour said downgrading Portugal was \"not the answer\" and called for the amber list to be scrapped altogether.\nThe travel and tourism industry also voiced dismay, as shares fell in airlines and travel companies after the BBC first reported plans to lower Portugal's rating.\nEasyJet's chief executive accused the government of having \"torn up its own rule book\", saying the decision \"essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world\".\nThe chief executive of Heathrow Airport said: \"Ministers spent last month hailing the restart of international travel, only to close it down three weeks later.\"\nThe debate over travel rules comes after it was announced that more than half of the UK's adult population has now been vaccinated.\nA total of 26,422,303 second doses have been given out since the vaccine rollout began nearly six months ago.\nMeanwhile, cases continue to rise in the UK with another 5,274 infections reported on Thursday, and another 18 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test."

      "tags": "Angela Rayner,Boris Johnson,Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Parliamentary Standards Commissioner ",
      "text": "Parliament's sleaze watchdog should investigate the funding of the prime minister's Downing Street flat refurbishment, Labour says.\nBoris Johnson was last week cleared of misconduct and of breaking the ministerial code by his adviser on ministerial interests.\nBut Lord Geidt said the prime minister had \"acted unwisely\".\nLabour says he might have broken the rules governing the conduct of MPs after failing to declare a donation.\nLabour is keen to increase the pressure on Mr Johnson over the renovations to his flat as part of its wider charge of cronyism against the government, and has written to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, Kathryn Stone.\nLast Friday, Lord Geidt - who was appointed by the PM in April as his ministerial standards adviser - said Tory donor Lord Brownlow had paid an invoice to cover some of the costs for the works, which were overseen by Mr Johnson's wife Carrie.\nHe accepted that Mr Johnson had not been aware how the bill had been paid but rebuked him for \"unwisely\" allowing the refurbishment to proceed \"without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded\".\nAt the time, Labour said it was \"staggering\" that Mr Johnson could \"rack up\" a bill \"yet have no knowledge of how it was eventually paid\".\nNow, the party says Mr Johnson still has more questions to answer in his capacity as an MP, which falls under the remit of Ms Stone.\nIn the letter to the commissioner, Labour's Deputy leader, Angela Rayner, noted Ms Stone had previously reprimanded Mr Johnson in 2019 for failing to register a share of a property within the required time frame, and warned any further breaches may warrant \"more serious sanction\".\nBut Ms Rayner said \"far from learning the lessons of his previous transgressions, the prime minister has continued with his attitude of treating basic standards of integrity, openness and transparency with contempt, and behaving as though there is one rule for him and another for everyone else,\".\nShe says the fact that Mr Johnson told Lord Geidt he became aware of the donations for the works on the flat in February this year but did not settle the invoices personally until 8 March suggests he is in breach of parliamentary rules that all MPs must follow.\nThe Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament states that all MPs must register financial interests, donations and gifts, and Mr Johnson, as prime minister, is not exempt from that. \nMs Rayner added: \"I therefore write to request that you instigate a further investigation into the prime minister's failure to register this donation, using your powers as commissioner.\"\nShe also accused Mr Johnson of breaching the general principles on conduct in public life, including \"selflessness\", \"integrity\" and \"leadership\".\nMs Stone is already investigating whether Mr Johnson properly declared a \u00a315,000 holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique with his wife Carrie.\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said: \"Lord Geidt's independent report shows the prime minister acted in accordance with the ministerial code at all times and sets out the background to the intended establishment of a Downing Street trust.\n\"The report shows how, at all times, the prime minister followed the advice of officials and he has made a declaration in his list of ministerial interests, as advised by Lord Geidt.\n\"The House of Commons rules and Electoral Commission guidance are clear that support relating to ministerial activity should be declared through ministerial declarations and this has been done.\"\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards has the power to refer a case to the Committee on Standards if she deems it is serious enough and the committee can, in principle, recommend suspension. \nThe sanction for less serious cases can require the MP to acknowledge and apologise for any breach. \nMr Johnson faces two other inquiries in to the flat refurbishment. \nThe Electoral Commission is conducting its own investigation in to whether the Conservative Party broke the rules on declaring donations over the Downing Street flat and has the power to issue a fine of up to \u00a320,000.\nMeanwhile, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, is also looking into the refurbishment, including whether donations were properly declared."

It's one of the key weapons in our arsenal in our efforts to curb the spread of Covid.\"\nAn additional \u00a332m will go towards the scheme, which has reached 99.7% of all positive cases eligible for follow up since it was introduced last June, the Welsh government said. \nHelen Alefounder, a GP in Conwy, said the potential for social mixing during half term was \"slightly worrying\".\n\"What's reassuring is we've isolated these cases, we know where they are and we can make sure that those patients are isolated and [we can] try and prevent the spread of the virus any further,\" she said.\n\"But it is half term... we've got a lot of visitors in Wales and we just need to make sure we're maintaining our social distancing and keeping to the rules because otherwise there will be an increase in cases. We don't want to go back to where we were a few months ago. \n\"It's really important for everyone to remember that this is still very real, the virus is still out there but we can prevent this. We can stop the cases from increasing,\" she said.\nConwy's Covid case rate is currently the 163rd highest in the UK.\nFor context, where we have had clusters in recent weeks - Bridgend, Newport and Monmouthshire - these have all eased off now and they never got beyond 30 cases per 100,000. \nAll, including Conwy, according to the most recent surveillance, have had raised numbers of under-25s; the Bridgend and Monmouthshire clusters were linked to schools in Porthcawl and Abergavenny.\nConwy breaks down into 15 communities. Three of these are among the 23 across Wales which have shown any positive test numbers greater than two in the past week. \nThe other 12 local areas are among the 94% in Wales with fewer than two cases in the last seven days.\nThe lag in test results being published means it will be a few more days before the Conwy cluster starts to show up properly in the figures. The county's case rate stands at just under 20 but it has been below the 50 cases per 100,000 threshold for two months. \nDuring the second wave in January, Conwy reached 221 cases per 100,000. That is the third lowest peak of any local authority area of Wales, after Anglesey and Gwynedd."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

The county's case rate stands at just under 20 but it has been below the 50 cases per 100,000 threshold for two months. \nDuring the second wave in January, Conwy reached 221 cases per 100,000. That is the third lowest peak of any local authority area of Wales, after Anglesey and Gwynedd."

      "tags": "Tourism,Travel,Portugal,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "News that Portugal will be taken off the government's green list of quarantine-free destinations from Tuesday has thrown travel plans for thousands into disarray. Some tell the BBC of cancelled holidays, wasted money and family visits postponed once again.\nKerry, a photographer from the Wirral, says her family - like many others - have had \"the year from hell\".  \nHer partner has been shielding for over a year due to an auto-immune disease, Kerry has had to nurse her mother through Covid-19 and a stroke, and her 18-month old son has hardly known a world without a pandemic.\nShe was just about to book a trip to Portugal, one of the few tourist destinations where quarantine-free travel was allowed, when the rules changed.\nFrom 04:00 BST on Tuesday, it will join the amber list, meaning holidaymakers should not visit and arrivals must self-isolate for 10 days.\nKerry says: \"This holiday was everything for us our first with our baby who has had no experiences in his first 18 months on this planet.\"\nKerry says there are countries with low rates of infection but the government refuses to \"let us holiday and live our life\", even when many people are fully vaccinated.\nRachel Richmond, from Edinburgh, also expects to be fully vaccinated by the time of her two-week trip to Portugal in early July, booked just last week.\n\"What is the point of being vaccinated if you cannot go anywhere?\u00a0It is so utterly frustrating and so unfair,\" she says.\nShe feels the government keeps \"shifting the goalposts on travel\", raising the hopes of people who follow the rules only to dash them a few weeks later.\nAlthough travel to Portugal will still be legally permitted for people willing to quarantine on their return, some people - like Paul Modley and his partner, Tom Griffith, from London - say they are cancelling their trip.\n\"It doesn't feel responsible\" to travel anyway, Paul says, adding: \"Neither of us are really up for doing quarantine for 10 days when we come back.\"\nThe couple will lose \u00a3360 spent on PCR tests to travel. They do not yet know if the airline or accommodation provider will give them a refund.\nPaul, 54, says he booked out of \"hope\" that they would be able to get away and relax after the stresses of the last 15 months.\nThe suspense of waiting to hear if they had a negative test had already meant it was \"not the most relaxing start or preparation for a holiday.\"\nBut he says: \"It was worth a punt.\" \nFor others, the news that the green list status might be revoked came when they were already in Portugal - in the case of Mervyn Dinnen, just as he landed at Faro airport in the Algarve from Gatwick.\nIt's not the first time he's experienced a travel U-turn from the UK government, having previously been in the Canary Islands in December when quarantine requirements were imposed.\nArriving on a plane more-or-less full of Britons to a hotel full of Britons, he says most people seem determined to make the most of their holiday.\n\"I had a lovely lunch, I've got a beer here, the sun is shining. I feel relaxed even though what's happened has completely thrown my plans into disarray,\" he says.\nBut he says the fact that thousands of football fans were able to travel to Portugal for the Champions League final on 29 May sent a signal that it was safe for others to make the trip and it was \"frustrating\" to see that change within a week.\nAlthough Portugal is a major tourist destination with about 2.5 million UK visitors before the pandemic, it is not only holiday plans that are being disrupted.\nStephanie Price, from Burnley, has tried five times to visit her family in Portugal after originally booking in 2019, each time being forced to rearrange due to the pandemic.\n\"I have worked all through lockdown and was looking forward to getting away to see my family,\" she says.\nShe says she has had both vaccinations and the virus is \"here to stay\" so people should not be \"confined to misery\" without being able to travel.\nPortugal's coronavirus infections are much higher in the north and centre than in southern regions such as the Algarve, she says, and the travel policy should reflect that.\nSome people are refusing to let the change to the travel list stop them, however.\nOne man, who is due to fly from London to Portugal on Saturday to stay in an AirBnB, says he may consider rebooking for another destination - but the need for a negative test in the 72 hours before travel means the options are limited. \nInstead, he tells the BBC he is \"leaning towards\" heading on the Portugal trip anyway \"because it is still legal\".\n\"Unless they say, you must not go, you will be fined if you go, we might well still go and just have to bear the additional costs of an extra PCR test and the fact that we have to quarantine,\" he says."

      "title": "Why are people talking about Dr Anthony Fauci's emails?",
      "tags": "Anthony Fauci,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Thousands of private emails from US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci have revealed the concern and confusion at the start of the pandemic. So what did we learn from them?\nA National Institutes of Health specialist with a career spanning seven US presidents, Dr Fauci, 80, became the face of the nation's Covid-19 response and has since been the subject of both effusive praise and ferocious criticism.\nThe over 3,000 pages of emails, obtained by the Washington Post, Buzzfeed News and CNN through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, date from January to June 2020.\nHis conversations offer a glimpse into the early days of the US Covid outbreak and his dealings with the government, foreign and domestic health officials, the media, celebrities and everyday Americans.\nThe Wuhan lab theory\nDr Fauci and his colleagues took notice, in the early days, of the theory that Covid-19 may have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\nThe controversial claim was dismissed by experts last year, who said it was \"extremely unlikely\". No evidence to support it has emerged. \nBut in recent days, amid criticism of an inconclusive international probe into the virus' origins and new reports of Covid-related illness in the region weeks before it was officially identified, the theory is once again sparking debate.\nA January 2020 email to Dr Fauci from the director of the country's largest biomedical research facility suggested the \"unusual features\" of the virus may indicate it is \"engineered\", prompting Dr Fauci to say he will reach out via phone. \nIn April 2020, an email from the director of the National Institute of Health, Francis Collins, nudged Dr Fauci with the subject line \"conspiracy gains momentum\". The doctor's response to this is fully redacted.\nThis May, Dr Fauci said he is \"not convinced\" the virus originated naturally and expressed support for an investigation.\nOn masks\nIn the early months of the virus, the US government was still working out mask guidance - a move that has been criticised for adding to the confusion.\nIn a February 2020 email exchange with a former US health secretary, Dr Fauci said: \"Masks are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection.\"\nHe added that store-bought masks are \"not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through material\".\nThe following month, a friend in the Chinese public health field wrote to say he has been misquoted in the media for saying the West is making a \"big mistake\" in not recommending mask use.\nDr Fauci responded: \"I understand. No problem. We will get through this together.\"\nQuestions from all sides\nAs the public sought answers to the worsening crisis, Dr Fauci fielded inquiries from across the US - including Hollywood and Silicon Valley.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg invited the doctor to participate in the social media platform's Covid information hub and respond to users' questions.\nActress Morgan Fairchild - who reportedly collaborated with him during the Aids epidemic of the 1980s - reached out in February asking how she could help.\nDr Fauci suggested she tweet: \"The American public should not be frightened, but should be prepared to mitigate an outbreak in this country by measures including social distancing, teleworking, temporary closure of schools, etc.\"\nAnd, soon after a phone call with Bill Gates, a senior executive at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation wrote to say he was \"seriously worried\" about Dr Fauci's health and safety.\nThe emails also reveal Dr Fauci frequently and firmly shut down rumours that he was being censored by President Trump.\n\"I actually have not been muzzled at all,\" he wrote to one unidentified fan in February 2020.\nSome moments of levity\nLionised on prayer candles and bobble-head toys, the emails show Dr Fauci professing discomfort with the adulation coming from many corners of the internet.\nWhen a colleague emailed him a story of how a shop sold out of doughnuts emblazoned with his face, he responded: \"Truly surrealistic. Hopefully this all stops soon... It is not at all pleasant, that is for sure.\"\nIn another email, he shared a story about 'Fauci Fever' with the quip: \"It will blow your mind. Our society is really totally nuts.\"\nAnd, when actor Brad Pitt played him on the Saturday Night Live sketch comedy show, he happily told a colleague that one reviewer said Pitt \"looked 'exactly like me'. That statement made my year.\"\nSome conservative politicians and media pundits have cited the emails in their calls to sack Dr Fauci for his work on the pandemic response.\nUS Senator Rand Paul, a Republican who has frequently clashed with Dr Fauci in hearings on Capitol Hill, said the emails make it \"abundantly clear\" the doctor is \"a massive fraud\".\nAcross the political aisle, liberals have argued Dr Fauci's positions adapted to the scientific evidence available at the time. Others celebrated his style and tone of response to various emails.\nAnalysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter\nFauci's emails are like a Rorschach ink blot: what you see in them reveals more about you than the ink blot, or, in this case, the emails. \nFor Trump supporters I know in small Kansas towns and other rural areas, Fauci is a villain. He broadcasts conflicting messages about the virus, these Republicans say, and twists science. They also say that he undermined then-President Trump. \nThese conservatives refused to wear masks, even during the worst days of the pandemic, because, they said, the scientific guidelines changed constantly, and Fauci had flip-flopped. \nHis emails will reinforce their opinions. Fauci did indeed change his mind about health guidance, such as the wearing of masks, as more information emerged about the virus. He told someone in February 2020 they did not need to wear a mask while travelling. Later, he encouraged people to wear them. \nIn contrast, for liberals in the Midwest and in other regions, Fauci is a hero. His emails reinforce their views - that he changed his mind about what people should do to fight the virus, depending upon the scientific data, and not on what Trump wanted people to hear."

      "text": "A Russian cyber-criminal group was behind a ransomware attack that has targeted the world's largest meat processing company, the FBI has said.\nThe FBI said it was working to bring the REvil group to justice for the hack on JBS.\nThe cyber-breach over the weekend shut some JBS operations in the US, Canada and Australia. \nREvil - also known as Sodinokibi - is one of the most prolific and profitable cyber-criminal groups in the world.\n\"We have attributed the JBS attack to REvil and Sodinokibi and are working diligently to bring the threat actors to justice,\" the FBI statement said. \n\"We continue to focus our efforts on imposing risk and consequences and holding the responsible cyber actors accountable.\"\nThe White House said on Wednesday that US President Joe Biden would bring up the issue of cyber-attacks when he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in two weeks.\n\"Responsible states do not harbour ransomware criminals,\" said press secretary Jen Psaki.\nJBS said it was on schedule to resume meatpacking operations on Thursday in the US, where its five biggest beef plants are located.\nThe company, which identified the ransomware attack on Sunday, has not disclosed whether it paid the hackers.\nRansomware is one of the most prolific forms of cyber-attack. It typically involves hackers gaining access to a computer network and either encrypting files or locking users out of their systems until a ransom is paid.\nIn recent years, the use of ransomware for extortion has become a national security issue of serious concern.\nLast month, fuel delivery in the south-east of the US was crippled for several days after a ransomware attack targeted the Colonial Pipeline. \nInvestigators say that attack was linked to another group, DarkSide, with ties to Russia.\nColonial Pipeline has confirmed it paid a $4.4m (\u00a33.1m) ransom to the cyber-criminal gang responsible.\nThe US government has recommended in the past that companies do not pay criminals over ransomware attacks, in case they invite further hacks in the future.\nJust days after the attack on Colonial Pipeline, a different group of\u00a0cyber-criminals infected the Irish national health system with ransomware.\nREvil is a criminal network of ransomware hackers that first came to prominence in 2019.\nMost of its members are believed to be based in Russia or countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union.\nPronounced \"R\" followed by the word \"evil\", REvil has been linked to GandCrab, a now-defunct hacker gang that has used similar ransomware in the past.\nREvil is known as a ransomware-as-a-service (RAAS) enterprise for the way it operates. This involves ransomware developers recruiting affiliates, or partners, to spread their malicious malware.\nIf the attacks are successful, developers take a percentage of the earned income and provide the other portion to the affiliates.\nThe group threatens to post stolen documents on its website - known as the \"Happy Blog\" - if victims don't comply with its demands.\nOne of the group's best-known attacks was on an Apple Inc supplier named Quanta Computer Inc earlier this year. In a note posted on the dark web, the group said it would release sensitive internal documents unless it received $50m in ransom.\nREvil was also linked to a co-ordinated attack on nearly two dozen local governments in Texas in 2019."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday morning. \nPortugal will be taken off the UK's travel \"green\" list and relegated to \"amber\" from 04:00 BST Tuesday - meaning that people can only travel there for essential reasons and have to quarantine upon their return. The government says it follows \"increased concern\" over the spread of coronavirus variants, including a mutation of the so-called Indian variant, now called Delta. Meanwhile, seven countries - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Trinidad & Tobago - have been added to the \"red\" list, meaning these destinations should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\". Here is a reminder of the travel rules. \nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi has announced that more than half of UK adults have had both doses of a coronavirus jab. He thanked the \"brilliant\" rollout team for hitting \"another important milestone\". The prime minister welcomed the \"amazing achievement\", tweeting: \"Now let's finish the job.\" A total of 26,422,303 second doses have been given out since the vaccine rollout began nearly six months ago, according to official figures. Find out if you're eligible for your vaccine yet here.\nDoor-to-door testing will begin this weekend in areas of Bedford hit by a coronavirus variant first identified in India, known as Delta. In Scotland, NHS Lanarkshire says it is bringing forward second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from 12 weeks to eight weeks to \"get ahead\" of any significant rise in cases of this variant. Meanwhile, in Wales there are calls to \"fast-track\" second vaccine doses in Conwy. Find out more about the Delta variant here.\nThe UK government is \"open-minded\" on SNP calls to extend furlough, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants the job support scheme extended \"for as long as it is needed\". The call came ahead of a virtual meeting between Boris Johnson and the three devolved administrations on how to emerge from the Covid pandemic.\nBefore the pandemic, Madam Tess Tickle performed at The New Foresters, in Nottingham, but now she patrols the outdoor marquee and warns revellers against moving tables. Landlady Debbie Law says she decided to train the drag queen in enforcing coronavirus rules after realising she did not have enough money to pay for extra door staff. Madam Tess, who has a Covid-19 test before each shift, says: \"It's literally a case of make everybody feel safe and secure but still have a good time.\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nAs Portugal moves to the travel \"amber\" list, find out where you can go on holiday in the UK instead.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Yair Lapid,Israel,Naftali Bennett,Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "text": "Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu has lashed out at a newly agreed coalition which looks set to remove him from power after 12 years as prime minister.\nMr Netanyahu called on right-wing members of parliament to block the coalition from taking office.\nEight parties reached an agreement to work together to form a new government late on Wednesday.\nBut the group, from across Israel's political spectrum, still needs parliamentary backing to take office.\nNo date has so far been set for such a vote in the Knesset (parliament). But it is expected to take place next week at the latest, and there is still a chance this newly formed coalition could be upended by defections.\nIn his first comments since the coalition was announced, Mr Netanyahu urged members of the Knesset \"elected by votes from the right\" to oppose the coalition.\nIn a post on Twitter, he criticised them as \"left-wing\" and \"dangerous\". He has previously called the proposed new government the \"fraud of the century\", saying it endangered the state and people of Israel.\nObservers have already noted that Mr Netanyahu - who failed to form his own coalition despite his Likud party winning the most seats in the March vote - is likely to try to prevent the group getting the support it needs.\nNews of a fresh coalition emerged late on Wednesday, when Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, called President Reuven Rivlin to let him know that agreement had been reached. \nHe pledged to form a government which would \"work in the service of all Israeli citizens... respect its opponents and do everything in its power to unite and connect all parts of Israeli society\".\nHowever, Mr Lapid will not become prime minister immediately. Under a rotation arrangement, the head of the right-wing Yamina party, Naftali Bennett, would serve as prime minister first before handing over to Mr Lapid in August 2023.\nThe coalition members span the full spectrum of Israeli politics with little in common apart from their plan to replace Mr Netanyahu. For the first time in decades, the government will include an Israeli Arab party. \nAn image carried on Israeli media showed Mr Lapid, Mr Bennett and Mansour Abbas, leader of the Arab Islamist Raam party, signing the agreement, a deal many thought impossible.\nThe other five parties included in the agreement are:\nIf the coalition fails to win the support of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, there is a risk of a fifth election in two years. All eight parties were needed to secure the 61-seat majority. \nNo rational political enemy of Benjamin Netanyahu can underestimate his ruthlessness and absolute determination to hold on to office. Until a new government with a new prime minister is sworn in, he will do all he can to stop it. \nIf he found himself leader of the opposition, he would do all he could to destabilise a coalition with a wafer-thin majority that would be trying to span the entire Israeli spectrum, from the nationalist right to the liberal left. All that unites them is their desire to remove him from office. \nHowever loudly he complains, the likelihood is that he is leaving office. In the end his defeat was sealed not by left-wing opponents but by fellow right-wingers he has made into enemies by his ruthless, high-handed tactics. \nNo-one should expect big, new initiatives from a new government. Just surviving the onslaught Mr Netanyahu is undoubtedly planning will be a full-time job. His opponents will be hoping that his fall will continue in the Jerusalem courthouse where he is already on trial on serious corruption charges.\nReaction to the agreement has been mixed. According to news agency AFP, other parties representing Israeli Arabs - who make up 20% of the population - have said they will oppose a government led by Mr Bennett, who rejects the concept of a Palestinian state.\nMeanwhile, right-wing politicians have also voiced concerns. \"The left is celebrating but it is a very sad day for the State of Israel,\" Miki Zohar, a prominent Likud member wrote on Twitter, saying the right-wing parties in the coalition \"should be ashamed\".\nBut elsewhere there was jubilation. Protesters who had been demanding Mr Netanyahu's resignation danced in the street.\nSome were just relieved at the prospect of an end to the political turmoil which has seen Israel hold four elections in just two years as politicians struggled to find someone to unite behind.\n\"I think that the political situation has been deadlocked for too long,\" protester Zvi Yosef told Reuters news agency. \"We have to try something new, even though it's a little bit scary and there's a lot of unknowns. But at the moment, I don't see any other option.\""

      "text": "The Home Office's decision to house cross-channel migrants in a \"squalid\" barracks in Folkestone was unlawful, the High Court has ruled.\nSix asylum seekers brought the case, claiming Napier Barracks was \"unsafe\" and dormitory use caused a Covid-19 outbreak earlier this year.\nThe ruling could see a damages claim against Home Secretary Priti Patel. \nThe Home Office said use of the barracks would continue, and it was considering its \"next steps\".\nThe judgment could lead to further cases from any other men held at the camp who can bring similar evidence to court.\nMr Justice Linden's judgment looked in detail at a fire that broke out at the site in January, and when nearly 200 people contracted coronavirus during an outbreak at the camp.\nThe ruling followed hearings that took place in April.\nThe judge said: \"I do not accept that the accommodation there ensured a standard of living which was adequate for the health of the claimants.\n\"Insofar as the defendant considered that the accommodation was adequate for their needs, that view was irrational.\"\nBy Dominic Casciani, home and legal correspondent, BBC News\nOne of the crucial questions about Napier is why it was allowed to open in the way it did, given Public Health England (PHE) had warned the Home Office the dorms would not be suitable.\nDuring the High Court hearing in April, there was no witness statement from PHE or Clearsprings - the Home Office contractor running the site - about how a plan was developed to manage Covid-19 risks.\nThe judge found civil servants appreciated the risks existed, but it's not clear how they took on board the \"significant problem\" PHE warned of, given they also needed to get the best value of money out of the site.  \nThe \"bottom line\", said the judge, was the arrangements were contrary to PHE advice and did not even implement measures which the Home Secretary herself had apparently regarded as desirable and feasible.\nRead more from Dominic here.\nMr Justice Linden also criticised the \"detention-like\" setting for the men.\nHe said: \"They were supposed to live voluntarily pending a determination of their applications for asylum.\n\"When this is considered, a decision that accommodation in a detention-like setting - a site enclosed by a perimeter fence topped with barbed wire, access to which is through padlocked gates guarded by uniformed security personnel - will be adequate for their needs, begins to look questionable.\"\nFollowing the ruling, campaigners, including human rights group Liberty, Refugee Action and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, called for the immediate closure of the site.\nLiberty lawyer Lara Ten Caten said: \"The government's only response can be to close it down immediately.\"\nRefugee Action and the JCWI accused the government of being reckless with people's lives.\nYvette Cooper, home affairs select committee chairwoman, said Ms Patel and the Permanent Secretary told the committee in February the Home Office was working \"in line with public health guidance\".\nShe said: \"Clearly they were not. We have called on them both to come back before the committee at the earliest opportunity to explain the decisions they made and also the contradictions with the information they previously gave us in light of today's court ruling.\"\nMen living at the barracks told the BBC conditions were inhumane. \nOne man, speaking through the fence at the site, said there was no hot water or electricity and only one shower for 100 people.\nLawyers from Deighton Pierce Glynn (DPG) had claimed the site - which they said still housed more than 265 people - had breached the migrants' human rights. \nThe firm said despite emptying the barracks in early April 2021 and amid ongoing concerns from public health officials that the site could not be made Covid-19 secure, the Home Secretary began refilling the site.\nDPG said residents are sleeping in dormitories of up to 12 people and lawyers understood the intention was to fill the barracks to over 300.\nIn April, the court heard public health experts had repeatedly raised concerns about the use of the site during a pandemic, while an independent report found seven suicide attempts and seven incidents of serious self-harm.\nMilitary asylum seeker sites 'filthy and run-down'\nTom Hickman QC, representing four claimants, previously told the court the site was \"squalid, ill-equipped, lacking in personal privacy and unsafe\". \nLisa Giovannetti QC, representing the Home Office, said clinically vulnerable people had been \"sifted out\".\nShe said Ms Patel had decided the barracks could be used safely by \"introducing safeguards\".\nBut in a statement read to the court, one of the claimants, who was later moved to other accommodation, said: \"The situation in the camp is very bad and degrading.\" \n\"Detainees in the barracks including myself have lost hope.\"\nThe judge declined to rule the barracks could never be used to house asylum seekers, but called for \"substantial improvements\".\nThe Home Office and the six men have yet to agree on damages.\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"During the height of the pandemic, to ensure asylum seekers were not left destitute, additional accommodation was required at extremely short notice.\n\"Such accommodation provided asylum seekers a safe and secure place to stay. Throughout this period our accommodation providers and sub-contractors have made improvements to the site and continue to do so.\n\"It is disappointing that this judgment was reached on the basis of the site prior to the significant improvement works which have taken place in difficult circumstances.\"\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

Every person who is fully vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread. \nSo this is more great news about a successful vaccination programme that will hopefully keep us safer in the months to come.\nThe UK continues to be among those with the highest vaccination rates globally.\nThe number of first doses administered each day is now averaging about 170,000 - a drop from an average of about 500,000 in mid-March - as the schedule of second doses kicks in.\nAn average of more than 350,000 second doses are now being given a day.\nOn Wednesday, the health secretary confirmed the government was in talks with AstraZeneca to secure a future version of its jab which would be adapted to better tackle the Beta variant first identified in South Africa. \nAny altered vaccine would need to be approved by the medicines regulator.\nThe variant of coronavirus first identified in India is now the dominant strain in the UK, Public Health England (PHE) has said.\nThe number of cases confirmed by laboratory analysis rose by 79% over the last week to 12,431.\nScientists believe the variant, now known as Delta, has overtaken the Kent, or Alpha, variant.\nMeanwhile, Portugal is set to be downgraded from UK's green travel list to amber, meaning that people can only travel there for essential reasons.\nSeven countries and territories will be added to the red list facing toughest travel restrictions, including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Trinidad and Tobago."

      "text": "A landlord accused of destroying history by renaming a pub that is more than 200 years old has actually restored its original name. \nThe pub, on Cardiff's High Street, originally opened as Blue Bell in 1813, but became the Goat Major in 1995.\nPrevious owners Brains did not plan to reopen it as lockdown eased but Croeso pubs bought it and returned it to its 208-year-old name.\nSome social media users had accused Croeso of a \"criminal\" name change.\nAfter also complaining that its owners were \"destroying Cardiff's history\", it was pointed out the Blue Bell was in fact its historical name, forcing the accusers to retract their statement.\nNick Newman, who has worked in hospitality in the city for 41 years and will manage the pub, said it was a \"storm in a Twitter cup\" and had been resolved quickly and politely.\nThe Blue Bell was renamed the Goat Major to mark its connection with the Welsh infantry regiment, The Royal Welsh, whose mascot is a goat that was sponsored by Brains brewery.\nMr Newman, 61, said changing the name was a difficult decision but ultimately seemed like the right thing to do - because the military connection would go down in history anyway whereas the Blue Bell name may not.\n\"We sat down and said, 'Do we keep it as the Goat Major or turn it back to Blue Bell?\n\"I found this out from veterans but Brains called it Goat Major because there used to have military tattoos in the castle, but they no longer take place, so that took away part of the reason for keeping the name.\n\"That's already got its place in history, so we thought it was probably right to take it back to Blue Bell.\"\nMr Newman was also responsible for bringing the Philharmonic pub back into use, which he said had become \"derelict and dilapidated\". The company also has Brew House and Retro.\n\"We like to take bits of Cardiff's heritage and restore them to former glory,\" he said.\n\"We felt our main focus with the pandemic was keeping the business going.\n\"People do joke about me being the grandfather of High Street and St Mary Street and we could pick any of [the pubs on those streets] and say, 'If you know what you're about, and we do, you'll be able to do it right'.\"\nMr Newman, who is also chairman of Cardiff Licensees Forum, said otherwise the reception to the name change has been \"really positive\", especially among the older generation who still remember the pub as the Blue Bell.\n\"They all said it's great to see the Blue Bell again.\""

      "text": "A new film directed by Sean Penn is among the movies set to premiere at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.\nThe event will take place in person next month, but with strict Covid safety measures in place for attendees.\nFlag Day, which Penn also stars in alongside Josh Brolin, is an adaptation of the book by Jennifer Vogel.\nIt tells the story of a father who lives a double life as a counterfeiter, bank robber and conman in order to provide for his daughter.\nPenn's previous directing efforts have included Into The Wild, The Pledge and The Crossing Guard.\nFlag Day will also star Miles Teller and Eddie Marsan, alongside Penn's daughter Dylan.\nIt's one of several films organisers announced on Thursday for this year's festival, which will run from 6 to 17 July.\nIt was previously confirmed that the opening night film will be Annette from director Leos Carax and starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard.\nWes Anderson's new film The French Dispatch, starring Timothee Chalamet, Elisabeth Moss, Tilda Swinton and Frances McDormand, and Paul Verhoeven's Benedetta, were also confirmed to be running in competition.\nOrganisers announced earlier this week that Jodie Foster will receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the 2021 festival.\nSpike Lee will head up the jury that hands out the festival's official awards. The Oscar-winning filmmaker was set to be jury president for the 2020 festival, but that was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"Cinema is not dead,\" said Cannes artistic director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux on Thursday. \"The return of audiences to movie theatres around the world was the first good news. And the festival will be the second good news.\"\nThe closing night film has not yet been confirmed, however Fr\u00e9maux indicated that he has a major blockbuster premiere still to reveal. \nFour of the 24 films in competition this year have female directors, which Variety said matched the event's previous record, set in 2019.\nThey are Hansen-Love, Catherine Corsini, Julia Ducournau and Ildik\u00f3 Enyedi. Female directors elsewhere in the line-up include Eva Husson, Hafsia Herzi, Gainsbourg and Arnold.\nThe festival previously announced that it will require attendees to be tested for Covid-19 every 48 hours if they have not been fully vaccinated, or show proof of immunity.\nFrance's audience limit in cinemas is set to lift on 1 July, which means all films should, in theory, be able to screen to full-capacity crowds.\nHowever, masks will still need to be worn during screenings. It is not yet clear whether they will also be required on the red carpet.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Merthyr Tydfil,Social distancing,Llandyrnog,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Social distancing could continue in Wales for the rest of the year, the first minister has said.\nMark Drakeford said it remained one of the \"strongest defences\" against Covid.\nThe warning comes after the news outdoor sporting events and concerts can resume from Monday for up to 10,000 people sitting or 4,000 standing.\nExtended households can also expand to include a third and up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors, including in private gardens.\nBut, Mr Drakeford said he was \"not certain there is a huge thirst\" for people to give up safeguards, including the 2m social distancing rule.\n\"I think they will remain part of the repertoire here in Wales during the rest of the summer, and maybe into the rest of this year,\" he told a coronavirus press briefing.\n\"Whether we will be able to move from them being mandatory to just [things] we advise people about will depend on whether we continue to see improvements of the position here in Wales.\"\nAllowing more people to meet indoors was ruled out until at least late June, as other lockdown rules were eased.\nThe decision to delay comes amid \"growing concern\" over the Delta variant, first identified in India, and the Welsh government said the delay was designed to allow more people to get vaccinated.\nThere are currently 97 cases of the variant in Wales, up 67% compared with the previous week.\nMr Drakeford said: \"The risk of infection is significantly less outdoors than it is indoors. This is why we are phasing in the changes in this three-week cycle.\n\"This will allow more people to enjoy events outdoors and take advantage of the Welsh summer, while we continue to roll out the vaccination programme to all adults.\"\nHowever, he added: \"We have to be realistic. The fact that the Delta variant is spreading so quickly in the north-west of England will mean that it will cross the border into Wales.\n\"That is why we are delaying some of the measures we might otherwise take to maximise the amount of vaccination that we can carry out because that is our best defence against that new variant.\"\nThe lockdown measures will be reviewed again on 21 June.\nThe changes - described as a phased move to Wales' alert level one - will begin from Monday.\nIt means three households are able to meet indoors and have physical contact - but each household can only meet one other at a time.\nA further household with a single adult, or single adult with caring responsibilities, will still be able to join extended households.\nFurther rule changes on indoor activity will be considered by the Welsh government before 21 June - when an ending to restrictions in England may happen. \nPubs and restaurants have been allowed to serve customers inside from 17 May, however, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective has called for all significant restrictions to be lifted before July, including scrapping the 2m social distancing rule.\nSarah Hemsley-Cole, of campaign group WeMakeEvents Cymru, said the announcement was \"great news\" for the industry, having been crippled by repeated lockdowns.\nIn recent weeks a series of test events have been held, including the Tafwyl and Eid festivals in Cardiff Castle, while the upcoming Wales v Albania football match at Cardiff City Stadium is limited to 4,000 spectators.\nMs Hemsley-Cole said while they were happy with the Welsh government's \"cautious\" approach, the test events had been \"incredibly restrictive\" with some limited to just 100 people amid social distancing.\nShe added: \"The reality is, as long as there is social distancing, that is a challenge for the sector... it's a real challenge to make things work, and people sort of forget they have to maintain it.\n\"But we understand it is there to make us safe and we will find solutions and a way to make it work.\"\nAnnual events, such as Brecon Jazz and Green Man Festival, were waiting to see if they would be allowed to go ahead this summer, while Live Nation have confirmed they will now hold four outdoor concerts, each for up to 10,000 people, in Cardiff Bay in September.\n\"There's been an optimistic outlook for the last month or so but we're very pleased with this news,\" said Rob Waller, of Live Nation. \"It's great to have live music back.\"\nThe Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd says businesses will be concerned there were no announcements on financial support.\nAndrew RT Davies said: \"There's \u00a3140m of unallocated money in the Welsh government's coffers for business support but there was no mention of that.\"\nPlaid Cymru welcomed the changes but pressed for more support to businesses while \"the economic devastation of the pandemic remains.\"\nWelsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds welcomed the \"cautious\" move, but warned that after more than a year of changing restrictions, people were \"exhausted\".\nShe also wanted a review of the rules on hospital visits.\nDespite concerns over the Delta variant, Wales will not push for a ban on travel from hot-spots in England, similar to that demanded last year.\n\"I don't think that's the position that we are in at the moment,\" said Mr Drakeford.\n\"We are asking people coming into Wales from those hotspot areas to behave carefully and responsibly, to take all the precautions you would expect them to take to keep themselves and other people safe.\" \nWales has the highest vaccination rate in the UK, with 2,169,624 people having been given a first vaccine dose, or 68.5%.\nFigures also show 1,181,259 people have now had a second jab, almost 40% of the population of Wales.\nThe case rate in Wales is currently 8 per 100,000 people over seven days.\nA cluster of cases, attributed to the Delta variant, has been responsible for a spike in Conwy county, taking the case rate there to 23.\nThere have been no new deaths with covid reported in Wales for the past nine days."

      "tags": "Nasa,Geology,Space exploration",
      "text": "Nasa has announced that it is sending two new missions to Venus in order to examine the planet's atmosphere and geological features. \nThe missions, which have each been awarded $500m (\u00a3352m) in funding, are due to launch between 2028 and 2030. \nNasa administrator Bill Nelson said the missions would offer the \"chance to investigate a planet we haven't been to in more than 30 years\". \nThe last US probe to visit the planet was the Magellan orbiter in 1990. \nHowever, other spacecraft - from Europe and Japan - have orbited the planet since then. \nThe missions were picked following a peer review process and were chosen based on their potential scientific value and the feasibility of their development plans. \n\"These two sister missions both aim to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world, capable of melting lead at the surface,\" Mr Nelson said. \nVenus is the second planet from the sun and the hottest planet in the solar system with a surface temperature of 500C - high enough to melt lead. \nThe Davinci+ (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging) mission will measure the planet's atmosphere to gain insight into how it formed and evolved. It will also aim to determine whether Venus ever had an ocean. \nDavinci+ is expected to return the first high resolution images of the planet's \"tesserae\" geological features. Scientists believe these features could be comparable to continents on Earth and could suggest that Venus has plate tectonics. \nThe second mission, Veritas (Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy), will map the planet's surface to understand its geological history and investigate how it developed so differently than Earth. \nIt will use a form of radar to chart surface elevations and discover whether volcanoes and earthquakes are still happening. \n\"It is astounding how little we know about Venus, but the combined results of these missions will tell us about the planet from the clouds in the sky through the volcanoes on its surface all the way down to its very core,\" said Tom Wagner from Nasa's Planetary Science Division.\n\"It will be as if we have rediscovered the planet,\" he added. \nAnalysis by Paul Rincon, Science Editor, BBC News website\nOver the last few decades, Mars has dominated Nasa's budget for planetary missions. In the meantime, researchers studying Venus have become philosophical about the lack of priority given to their planet. \nBut that has been changing. New ideas, interpretations and new people have been transforming our understanding of Earth's nearest neighbour. Long thought to have been a \"dead\" planet by some, there are many who now think Venus may be geologically active, perhaps with periodic volcanism. \nIt may have harboured oceans for a billion years of its history, and there is even a region of the planet's thick atmosphere where microbial life could survive, floating among the clouds. \nScientists who have devoted their careers to studying this hothouse world are jubilant that the planet is finally back on Nasa's radar.\nYou may also be interested in:"
