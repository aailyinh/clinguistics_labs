      "tags": "Georgia,US election 2020,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Prosecutors in the US state of Georgia are investigating attempts by former President Donald Trump to overturn results from last November's election.\nMr Trump was recorded telling the state's top election official to \"find\" more than 11,000 votes, enough to give him victory there.\nThe official is heard replying that Georgia's results are correct.\nJoe Biden's win in Georgia and other swing states secured him the presidency. \nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis sent a letter asking state officials to preserve documents including those relating to the phone call and saying that a criminal investigation was being carried out.\n\"I just want to find 11,780 votes,\" Mr Trump told Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in a recording of the call released by the Washington Post last month.\nIn the months after the election, Mr Trump made unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud and claimed that votes were stolen from him.\nThe call was made on 2 January, just four days before the US Congress confirmed Mr Biden's election victory.\nMs Willis said in the letter, addressed to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, that the investigation included:\n\"This letter is notification that all records potentially related to the administration of the 2020 general election must be preserved, with particular care being given to set aside and preserve those that may be evidence of attempts to influence the actions of persons who were administering that election,\" she added.\n\"I know we all agree that our duty demands that this matter be investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted, in a manner that is free from any appearance of conflict of interest or political considerations.\"\nMr Raffensperger's office opened its own investigation into the phone call on Monday.\nIn excerpts of the 2 January phone call, Mr Trump can be heard alternately cajoling and pressurising Georgia's secretary of state.\nHe insisted that he had won the election in Georgia and told Mr Raffensperger that there was \"nothing wrong with saying you have recalculated\".\nMr Raffensperger responded by saying: \"The challenge you have, Mr President, is that the data you have is wrong.\"\nLater in the call, Mr Trump said the rumour was that ballots had been shredded and voting machinery had been removed from Fulton County in the state - claims denied by Mr Raffensperger's lawyer.\nThe president then threatened the official with possible legal consequences.\n\"You know what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal offence. You can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer,\" Mr Trump said.\nHe then called for the extra 11,780 votes - which would have given him a total of 2,473,634 votes in the state, one more than Mr Biden, who received 2,473,633 votes.\nThe president told Mr Raffensperger he should re-examine the result in the state."

      "tags": "Drug use,Young people",
      "text": "Among 17-year-olds in the UK, one in 10 will have used hard drugs, such as ketamine and cocaine, a study suggests.\nThe University College London research also showed nearly a third of 17-year-olds had tried cannabis and more than half admitted to binge-drinking alcohol.\nAlmost 20,000 young people, born between 2000 and 2002, were surveyed as part of the Millennium Cohort Study. \nDrug-use rates were higher among white teens than black teens.\nA quarter of 17-year-olds also said they had assaulted someone, including shoving, slapping or punching another person over the previous 12 months. \nBut this figure had fallen by seven percentage points from when the tracking survey was last conducted, when participants were aged 14. \nA similar study, which surveyed Britons born in the late 1980s when they were teenagers, found similar rates of alcohol consumption, but slightly higher rates of cannabis use.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, overall drug use among 16-24 year olds in 2020 was much lower than it was in the late 1990s. \nThe latest wave of the Millennium Cohort Study, intended to record a \"detailed portrait of the children of the new century\", was undertaken between 2018 and 2019 when participants were 17-years-old.\nLevels of vandalism and weapon use were similar to when these young people were 14, but shoplifting rose from 4% in early adolescence to 7% a few years later.\nHard drug use was twice as prevalent among white teenagers than their BAME counterparts, while binge-drinking was almost three times higher.\nThis list of hard drugs included cocaine, acid, ecstasy, speed, ketamine and any other psychoactive substances.\nAmong white teenagers, 11% reported using harder drugs compared with 5% for their BAME counterparts, and 59% of white teenagers had engaged in binge-drinking alcohol, compared with 21% of BAME teenagers. \nCannabis use, hard drug taking and binge-drinking were also considerably higher among young men than women. \nEmla Fitzsimons from the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies, who co-authored the study, said: \"Experimental and risk-taking behaviours are an expected part of growing up.\"\n\"Nevertheless, behaviours in adolescence can be a cause for concern as they can have adverse long-term consequences for individuals' health and wellbeing, and their social and economic outcomes.\"\nYoung people with graduate parents were more likely to report alcohol use and binge drinking than those whose parents did not have degrees.\nBut rates of drug use remained similar regardless of parents' educational qualifications.\nThe study found that as these young people \"approached adulthood, reports of anti-social behaviours mostly remained stable or declined compared to rates at age 14\". \nUCL's Aase Villadsen said she was surprised how the findings showed \"the peak in anti-social behaviours in this generation has been reached earlier than usual and rates have already started to come down by age 17\".\n\"This is a positive and will potentially help to improve the future social and economic prospects of Generation Z,\" said Dr Villadsen.\nProf Fitzsimons added: \"It remains to be seen how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected engagement in these behaviours.\"\nBBC Action Line: Advice and support about alcohol or drug problems"

      "title": "Trump impeachment: Key takeaways from second day of Senate trial",
      "tags": "US politics,United States Senate",
      "text": "On day two of Donald Trump's Senate trial, the prosecutors had the spotlight to themselves.\nThe House impeachment managers presented new video footage as evidence of the brutality of what happened during the Capitol riots.\nBut Democrats made Donald Trump's Senate trial about more than just the events in Washington on 6 January. \nThey prosecuted a case against the president's conduct - in tweets and speeches - before, during and after election night 2020.\nHere are some of the key takeaways.\nLead manager Jamie Raskin quickly picked up where he left off on Tuesday, using Trump's own words on the day of the Capitol insurrection to tie him to the unrest.\nTrump was no \"innocent bystander\" on 6 January, he said, he was the \"inciter-in-chief\". Over many months, Trump had \"praised, encouraged and cultivated violence\". \nThe Democratic congressman said Trump's \"remember this day forever\" tweet while the Capitol was being ransacked were not words of sadness, but of celebration. Accusing the former president of watching the chaos unfold on TV \"like a reality show\", he went on to say: \"This is a day that will live in disgrace in American history, unless you ask Donald Trump.\"\nAnd if the Senate doesn't convict Trump and prohibit him from holding office in the future, Raskin concluded, such violence will happen again.\nFrom here, the managers laid out the details of their case, including more videos and accounts. But Raskin set the stage.\nThe Democrats want the senators to pass judgement on whether a president can call into question American electoral processes the way Trump did.\nSuch actions, Congressman Joaquin Castro said in his presentation, are dangerous to a democracy.\nThis is going to put Trump's legal team in a delicate situation. \nThey have reportedly advised the former president that his best defence is to focus on the constitutionality of the trial and his freedom of speech, not to rehash arguments that the election was fixed. But the Democrats are using their time in front of the Senate to launch a full-bore attack against the president's claims. He may demand that his team have a response.\nThe move also may not sit well with some of the Republican senators - like Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas - who vocally supported Trump's election fraud claims. The Democrats were never going to win their support for conviction, but they might make them uneasy in their seats.\nSenator Hawley certainly didn't want to give the impression of feeling uncomfortable - he sat with his feet on a chair in the chamber's second-floor gallery. Meanwhile, Rand Paul of Kentucky was seen doodling on a notepad. \nThose were a few of the more visible indications that, for at least some of the senators sitting in judgement of the former president, the day's proceedings may not have much relevance.\nHawley and Paul were among the 44 Republicans who voted on Tuesday evening to dismiss the case against Trump as unconstitutional. Given that they believe the entire trial is illegitimate, it would stand to reason to think they have concluded that whatever happens over the next few days is irrelevant. And it only takes 34 Republicans sticking by Trump to assure that he will be found not guilty.\nThat must be at least a bit frustrating for the Democratic impeachment managers, who have at least so far constructed a meticulous, cohesive case against the president, while Trump's defenders largely stumbled through their one appearance.\nTo use a sports metaphor, the Democrats are playing a flawless game and their opponents are struggling, but when they look up at the scoreboard they're still losing.\nOn the same day that Twitter announced that its ban of Donald Trump's account was permanent and irreversible even if he were to win back the presidency in 2024, the former president's tweets took centre stage in his impeachment trial.\nJamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, once again displayed Trump's post-riot message that \"these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots\".\nAfter Raskin's opening statement, a series of impeachment managers spent large chunks of their presentations reading out Trump's tweets - prosecuting him with his own words.\nThere's a certain amount of irony in the fact that Trump's political rise was facilitated, in part, through his savvy use of social media to establish his unscripted authenticity, set the news cycle and bypass the filters of mainstream news. \nNow, weeks after his Twitter account has been shuttered, his tweets are Exhibit A to Z in an attempt to permanently end his political career.\nAfter hours of presentations on events leading up to 6 January, Delegate Stacey E Plaskett of the US Virgin Islands and Congressman Eric Swalwell of California walked through the attack on the US Capitol, minute by minute. \nUsing previously unreleased audio from police radios and video from Capitol security cameras, they recounted the violence as it unfolded, with the rioter's progress illustrated on a map of the US Capitol.\nThe House impeachment managers noted earlier in the day how close the rioters came to reaching US elected officials. The presentation drove that point home in painstaking detail.\nVideo showed Senator Mitt Romney turning and running in a Capitol hallway as a police officer warned him of the approaching mob. \nVice-President Mike Pence and his family were quickly ushered by the Secret Services from their hiding place near the Senate Floor. \nSenators hurried out of the building just 58 steps from the angry crowd, Swalwell noted.\nAides to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi rushed to a conference room to barricade themselves in, just moments before a group of rioters entered the hallway and pounded on the doors. \nOne rioter wandered the Capitol, calling in an eerie sing-song voice: \"We're looking for you, Nancy.\"\n\"President Trump put a target on their backs, and his mob went into the Capitol to hunt them down,\" Plaskett said."

      "text": "A graffiti marriage proposal which became a symbol of a city has been removed by developers.\nJason Lowe's public display of affection was spray-painted on a bridge at Park Hill, Sheffield, in 2001.\nHis bid to woo girlfriend Clare Middleton formed part of the city skyline, inspired a track by singer Yungblud and appeared on a t-shirt worn by Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner.\nUrban Splash said the graffiti was removed for \"essential repair work\".\nSam Feeley, who lives in one of the renovated flats, said he noticed the writing - I Love You Will U Marry Me - had been removed on Sunday. \nDescribing it as \"a piece of Sheffield history\", he said: \"It means a lot to the people of the city, so I was quite surprised to see it had gone.\"\n\"I would class it as a piece of artwork and famous artwork fades over the years.\n\"[Leonardo] da Vinci paintings fade and people touch them up and restore them, I wouldn't see why this isn't any different really.\"\nAlthough Mr Lowe and his girlfriend never married, his romantic gesture has formed part of the city's skyline since, with many considering it an \"iconic\" piece of history. \nIn a BBC radio documentary, Mr Lowe explained how he braved his fear of heights to make a public show of proposing to Ms Middleton, who he had had been dating for a year.\nHe said: \"You used to be able to see it from the Odeon cinema.\n\"I took her there, she thought she was going to see a film and I said: 'I've got something to show you'. I told her to look up and she read it.\n\"She said 'yeah'. She thought I was mad.\"\nThe pair split up three months later and Ms Middleton died in 2007 from cancer. \nWhen Urban Splash started renovation of the flats in 2008, they decided to immortalise Mr Lowe's words.\nNeon lights were placed over the writing and it formed part of the developer's marketing campaign. \nYungblud, real name Dominic Harrison, from Doncaster, described the graffiti as \"a quirky act of romance\" in his song I Love You, Will You Marry Me.\nAlex Turner, lead singer of Sheffield band Arctic Monkeys, has also worn the slogan on a T-shirt during gigs.\nSurriya Falconer, speaking on behalf of the developers, said there were \"some structural issues\" which meant the words had to be removed so a coating could be put on the bridge.\nShe said Mr Lowe would be involved in deciding upon a replacement and the meaning would \"continue to be celebrated\".\n\"I understand people may feel a sense of loss but we're talking about new futures and celebrating a piece of history. It's still going to be there but it needs to be safe,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the proposed maximum 10-year jail term for people lying about their recent travel history as an \"empty threat\". \nThe Labour leader said \"pretending\" judges would sentence anyone to that long in prison \"wouldn't help anyone\".\nMinisters have said the public expects strong action and the maximum sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime.\nBut critics, including ex-Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption, have argued lower tariffs exist for sex offences.\nFrom Monday, people arriving in England from \"red list\" countries must isolate for 10 days in hotels, costing \u00a31,750.\nIt follows concerns that existing vaccines being rolled out in the UK may struggle to control new virus variants identified around the world.\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the hotel quarantine plan was \"measured\" and \"proportionate\".\nBut Sir Keir, a barrister who was England's director of public prosecutions before entering politics, questioned how realistic it was. \n\"I have prosecuted many cases that have ended in a 10 year sentence and I know an empty threat when I see it... pretending that there's going to be a 10 year sentence, I don't think is going to help anyone,\" he said.\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Sumption accused Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who announced the latest measures on Tuesday - of losing his connection with reality.\n\"Ten years is the maximum sentence for threats to kill, non-fatal poisoning or indecent assault,\" he wrote. \n\"Does Mr Hancock really think that non-disclosure of a visit to Portugal is worse than the large number of violent firearms offences or sexual offences involving minors, for which the maximum is seven years?\"\nFailing to quarantine in a designated hotel after arriving from a \"red list\" country will carry a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nThe 10-year jail term would be the maximum penalty for anyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in by travellers when they arrive in the UK.\nNew border measures also require international arrivals to pay for additional tests during their quarantine period.\nDowning Street said MPs will not be asked to vote on the plans as the government will be including the restrictions under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.\nConservative MP Alberto Costa, a ministerial aide to the Attorney General, told the BBC the UK was facing a \"once in a century\" public health crisis, which justified measures that would otherwise not be contemplated. \nHe told the BBC it was not up to politicians to decide the length of sentences, but it was right that judges should have the discretion to impose long custodial terms for the \"most egregious breaches of the worst sort\" - as had long been the case with other criminal offences.\nKnowingly flouting the regulations and putting other's lives at risk was, he said, \"a serious matter and people need to understand that\". \nMr Costa added: \"It is about reinforcing in people's minds the importance of the Covid restrictions and abiding by them.\"\nAround 1,300 people a week are arriving into the UK from the 33 red list countries - including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa - at the moment, Mr Shapps said.\nInternational travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed.\nAirlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said.\nThe penalties also include a \u00a31,000 fine for travellers who fail to take the new mandatory tests and a \u00a32,000 fine for failing to take the second mandatory test - along with a 14-day extension to quarantine.\nThe Scottish government said it would go further than England's measures and require everyone arriving by air to isolate in hotels for 10 days.\nAll travellers arriving in the UK are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test and must self-isolate for 10 days.\nHave you recently travelled into the UK?

It didn't hurt - not many people know that.\"\nIncidentally, 10 years ago, the Oscar-winner said he was fed up of being associated with that catchphrase because he did not come up with it. \"I have never said, 'Not Many People Know That',\" he wrote on ICorrect.com at the time; and later repeated on the Michael Parkinson show.\nThe phrase had mistakenly become linked to him after Peter Sellers used it as part of an impression he did of Sir Michael in 1972.\nThe NHS film ends with the director thanking Sir Michael for the audition, before quipping, 'OK let the little fella {Sir Elton] know he didn't get the job'.\"\nVaccines are given to the most vulnerable first. A list of high-priority groups - covering up to 99% of those most at risk of dying - is being followed.\nAnyone aged 70 or over in England and has not yet been vaccinated is now being asked to contact the NHS to book an appointment online or by calling 119 free of charge.\nMost NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and over 80s have been vaccinated. Some areas are now inviting over 60s. \nAll four nations of the UK follow these priorities, but the roll-out varies between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Fishermen are to rename two of their biggest exports in a bid to attract British consumers after post-Brexit difficulties selling to the EU.\nMegrim sole is to be sold as Cornish sole, with spider crab being rebranded as Cornish King crab.\nIt is being driven by the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation (CFPO) after research with chefs and consumers.\nPaul Trebilcock from the CFPO said: \"There is something about the names that has negative connotations.\"\nBoth species primarily rely on exports to Europe, which he explained that \"in the current climate is not a pleasant experience\".\n\"The two species are particularly under-loved in this country but really popular with some of our export markets.\"\nEach year about 1,000 tonnes of megrim sole is brought into Newlyn, Cornwall's biggest fish market, with 98% exported. \nAbout 85% of spider crab is exported, mainly to Spain.\nTrade has been disrupted this year by the extra paperwork and border checks required after Brexit.\nMr Trebilcock said: \"Our investigation revealed that simply by calling it Cornish sole, straight away more people were willing to to try it and were more interested in finding out where it came from.\"\nJohnny Murt, a shell fisherman off Padstow, said: \"It can only be a good thing.\"\n\"It is a hard sell but if the rebranding can just get people to taste it, they will immediately realise just how good spider crab is,\" he said.\nChef Jack Stein agreed and said spider crab and megrim sole were both \"good value and delicious\". \nHe said spider crab was very sustainable with \"amazing quality meat and there is just so much of it in the summer\" but lots of it was sold in the EU. \nSimilarly megrim sole had a \"lovely taste\" similar to plaice, he said.\n\"With a bit of a rebrand and a bit of a publicity drive we might be able to eat more of it in this country,\" he added.\nFollow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

But for Mr Hart to broadcast false information about investment in his own country - the interests of which he has a duty to defend - is reprehensible. I expect a retraction and apology.\"\nShadow Welsh Secretary Ms Griffiths said: \"It is deeply unfair for the prime minister to be so loose with his words when Bridgend has faced so many set backs on his watch. The community is still reeling from the closure of Ford and the loss of the Ineos project to France.\"\nPeter Hughes, Unite Wales Regional Secretary said: \"The prime minister's comments today regarding Bridgend are news to everyone in Wales.\"\nA UK government spokeswoman said they would \"continue to work with investors\" to progress plans for UK battery manufacturing.\n\"We are investing heavily to expand the UK's supply chain for cleaner vehicles, while working with our auto industry to ensure it remains competitive for years to come.\n\"As part of the prime minister's Ten Point Plan, we recently announced nearly \u00a3500m funding - as part of a wider commitment of up to \u00a31 billion - to support the electrification of vehicles and their supply chains, including developing Gigafactories across all parts of the UK.\n\"We will continue to work with investors to progress plans to mass manufacture the batteries needed for the next generation of electric vehicles.\""

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus variant first found in Kent could become the world's dominant strain, the head of the UK's genetic surveillance programme has predicted.\nProf Sharon Peacock told the BBC's Newscast podcast the new variant has \"swept the country\" and \"it's going to sweep the world, in all probability\".\nShe said her team's work sequencing variants of the virus could be required for at least 10 years.\nThe Kent variant has already been detected in more than 50 countries.\nIt was first detected in September 2020 in south-east England and its rapid spread over the following months was cited as the reason for the introduction of new lockdown rules across the UK in January.\nProf Peacock, director of the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, said: \"What's really affected us at the moment is transmissibility.\"\nShe added: \"Once we get on top of [the virus] or it mutates itself out of being virulent - causing disease - then we can stop worrying about it. But I think, looking in the future, we're going to be doing this for years. We're still going to be doing this 10 years down the line, in my view.\"\nShe explained this was not because she thought the pandemic would go on for 10 years, but she believed they would be sequencing new variants for that length of time.\nCurrent vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well.\nProf Peacock said the vaccines approved for use in the UK appeared to work well against the existing variants of the virus in the country.\nThe Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium is a network of public health bodies and labs and currently analyses more than 20,000 positive tests a week. \nIn recent weeks, it has been explained that about 5-10% of positive tests are selected randomly to be sent on for further genome analysis but the consortium says, as the number of cases falls below its capacity, its aim is to genetically screen every positive coronavirus test.\nProf Peacock told Newscast that while it is normal to see variants, only a very small number have \"special features\". These can make them more transmissible, avoid the immune response and affect vaccination, or have the potential to cause more severe disease. \n\"These are the things we are looking out for. I'd say it happens vanishingly rarely but we have to be on the look out for it,\" the expert, who was previously director of the government's National Infection Service, said.\nIt comes as the World Health Organization is recommending using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine even in countries tackling new variants of coronavirus.\nThe Oxford jab has attracted controversy about its effectiveness against new variants, whether it should be used in the elderly and how far apart the doses should be given, due to a lack of data.\nEarly data from trials in South Africa - where a variant has acquired mutations that seem to help it evade immunity from vaccines and from previous infections - showed the vaccine was offering \"minimal protection\" against mild and moderate disease in young people.\nBut the WHO's director of immunisation, Dr Katherine O'Brien, said the South African study was \"inconclusive\" and it was \"plausible\" the vaccine would still prevent severe disease.\nOxford scientists still expect their vaccine to prevent people from becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 and needing hospital treatment.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged the two million people yet to take up their offer of a Covid jab to \"come forward\" this week.\nThe government is aiming to offer a first dose of a vaccine to 15 million people - those aged 70 and over, healthcare workers and people required to shield - by 15 February.\nAs of Tuesday 13,058,298 had received a first vaccine dose, a daily rise of 411,812."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has urged the two million people yet to take up their offer of a Covid jab to \"come forward\" this week.\nThe UK was closing in on Monday's target for vaccinating almost 15 million of its most vulnerable people, the PM told a Downing Street briefing.\nBut he said some people \"for one reason or another\" had not been vaccinated.\nMr Johnson said the aim was not to \"hit some numerical target, but to save lives... another step on the long and hard road back to normality\".\nThe government is aiming to offer a first dose of a vaccine to 15 million people - those aged 70 and over, healthcare workers and people required to shield - by 15 February.\nAfter the first four priority groups receive their jabs, ministers hope that people aged 50 and over, as well as those with underlying health conditions will be vaccinated by the end of April.\nAs of Tuesday 13,058,298 had received a first vaccine dose, a daily rise of 411,812.\nMr Johnson said: \"With less than a week to go until the target date... there's no doubt we've made great strides, with just over 13 million people now vaccinated in our United Kingdom, including one in four adults in England, over 90% of everyone over 75 and over 90% of eligible residents of care homes for the elderly.\n\"But that still leaves nearly two million people, a population roughly twice the size of Birmingham, that we still hope to reach.\n\"And there are people across the country who for one reason or another haven't yet taken up their offer. So now is the moment to do it.\"\nMr Johnson appealed to care workers who still have not been vaccinated to contact their employer to \"fix it up\". His comments came after a survey suggested more than 30% of staff in nearly half of all care homes for older people have not been vaccinated.\nThe government is on track to meet its target to offer vaccines to 15 million people by Monday.\nBut the question now on everyone's lips is what difference is it making?\nGiven it takes two to three weeks for immunity to develop and then another few weeks for the impact of that to be seen in infection levels and hospitalisations, it is too early to tell for sure from the published data.\nThe government has been collecting data behind the scenes by monitoring cases in people who have been vaccinated. \nIt is expected to unveil that next week. \nEarly reports suggest it is having a significant difference - and if that is the case it will shift the dynamics of the pandemic significantly.\nThe latest official figures on Covid also show there have been a further 1,001 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and another 13,013 positive tests.\nThis compares to 1,322 deaths and 19,202 cases reported a week ago.\nMr Johnson acknowledged that the figures showing a reduction in Covid-19 cases were not necessarily down to the rollout of the vaccine.\nThe prime minister said: \"I've looked at the data and scrutinised it with my layman's eye and so far, yes we are getting the numbers down, but can I see results that I think are directly attributable to the vaccine? Although I'm assured that will happen soon, I can't say that I can see them yet.\"\nThe UK's chief medical adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the briefing there were still a \"significant number of people in high-risk groups\" who had not been vaccinated and the lifting of restrictions in England needed to take place with \"caution.\"\nSir Patrick said: \"Those people remain at risk and so it's important we go cautiously in opening up, in order to be able to measure the effects.\"\nSir Patrick was asked about Covid lateral flow tests (LFTs) as they began to be rolled out to more workplaces.\nHe said they were a \"really important part of our toolkit\", and while not as \"sensitive\" as a PCR lab test, were \"good with picking up people with high viral load, who are most infectious\", and who are asymptomatic.\nMr Johnson says LFTs will \"come into their own\" once the economy is starting to \"unlock\".\n\"They do have a very clear use case but it's in conjunction with everything we are doing and the priority is obviously vaccination.\""

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,US politics,United States",
      "text": "The rule of thumb in the cinema is that the original is invariably better than the sequel. \nBut then you get The Dark Knight getting far more acclaim than Batman Begins. Or Godfather 2 being better than the first movie - and personally I thought Toy Story 3 was the best. And don't get me started on Star Wars. \nSo, what should we expect from Impeachment II, Incitement of Insurrection, coming to a TV screen near you this week?\nSome very general and obvious observations. \nThe plotlines in this second impeachment will be much easier to follow than the original. \nA presidential call to his Ukrainian counterpart asking questions about an obscure energy company on which Joe Biden's son had served as a director, does not have the immediacy of the events of 6 January when a Trump supporting mob stormed Congress after listening to a speech delivered by the president. \nWhat is not in question is that the MAGA-mob tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Five people died following the mayhem. There will not be an American who doesn't have a view on what unfolded.\nThe other quick observation I would make is this - the chamber where the Senate trial will unfold is also the crime-scene; the epicentre of this assault on America's most sacred democratic sanctum. And the corollary of that is that some of the people who will be 'trying' the former president will have felt themselves to be victims of the crime that unfolded.\nSo what chance is there that Donald Trump will get a fair trial?\nWell, the first thing I would say about that is though the language of impeachment is replete with quasi-judicial terminology, the jurors are the 100 Senators - Republican and Democrat. This is political. \nHow many of those who will weigh the evidence for and against Donald Trump will be swayed by the evidence presented? I find it hard to imagine there will be a single one.\nDemocrats, I would guess, will vote as a block to convict. Republicans are split three ways - and this is a political split, not a schism based on the evidence. \nThere are those Republicans who remain firmly behind Donald Trump, and will not now, not ever, vote to find him guilty of \"incitement of insurrection\", the three words on the article of impeachment. \nThere are those who would love nothing more to see the former president slip away from the national consciousness, and feel that he has been a corrosive force on the democratic norms and values of US democracy - but don't want to pick a fight with him for fear of the consequences. Their worst nightmare is Trump rallying support behind a Republican rival the next time they're up for election.\nAnd there is a smaller number of Republicans who are ready to very publicly say they believe that the party of Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Reagan needs to be rid of the Trump legacy, that it is a cancer that needs to be cut out.\nIn other words, this will all be about political calculation. And the second order calculation will be how these senators will explain the decision to their voters.\nWhich brings us to this next question, how will this play itself out?\nDemocrats will make a case that evokes the drama of the day and the fears some of them had - they thought their lives were in danger as they cowered in offices while the mob went room to room. The blame for that will be laid squarely at the defendant's door.\nThe Trump defence will take two forms. \nOn the substance of the \"incitement of insurrection\" charge, his lawyers will argue that he was exercising his free speech, First Amendment rights - and they will point out that in that address on 6 January, the president told his supporters to march on Congress \"peacefully and patriotically\".  \nBut the speech was notable for all its \"We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" And telling his supporters that they have to be tough and not weak.\nAnd his case is not helped by the tweets and messaging around this time - urging his supporters to come to Washington on 6 January because it was \"going to be wild\". \nIn a video released on the night of the riots, Donald Trump told the mob that had descended on Congress that he loved them and they were special people. He tweeted that evening - seemingly to justify the actions of the insurgents - that this is what happens when you steal the result of the election.\nHe repeatedly claimed he had won the election by a landslide. There is no evidence for that. \nHe repeatedly claimed that the election had been stolen. Judge after judge - many appointed by Donald Trump - rejected those legal arguments put by his campaign lawyers. \nAnd the charges of fraud - again promoted by Mr Trump - were dismissed by the president's own Attorney General William Barr; the head of election security - another Trump appointee - also said the election had been fair.\nSo don't expect the president's words to be the backbone of the defence.\nInstead it will focus on the constitutionality of impeaching a president once he's left office. The lawyers will argue that the weapon of impeachment is only to be used for a serving politician, not a private citizen (as Donald Trump now is).\nHow can you use the sanction of removing someone from office when they've already left office? And this is I suspect the justification (fig-leaf, I feel sure Democrats will insist) that Republicans will reach for as their justification for acquitting Donald Trump.\nOf course, Democrats will point out the offence took place while he was president, and you don't get a free pass just because you've left office. Or as James Corden put it on his Late, Late Show, it's like being pulled over by a traffic cop for speeding, and saying to the officer \"I might well have been going at 50mph back then, but now as I speak to you I am stationary, so you can't charge me now\u2026\"\nImpeachment II will get big, big TV audiences - though they'd have been far greater if the president had testified, as Democrat impeachment managers had wanted.\nBut the outcome - and here I feel the need to issue a spoiler alert - is almost certainly going to be the same as Impeachment I. \nHe will be acquitted."

      "text": "The government has been hit by a backbench rebellion over plans to ensure Britain's future trade partners are not committing genocide. \nMPs backed a government proposal to give select committees a greater role in examining allegations of genocide. \nBut a number of Tory MPs rebelled and the government saw its working majority of about 80 slashed to just 15. \nThose pressing the UK to take a tougher stance on human rights abuses in China have vowed to carry on the fight. \nA total of 31 Conservative MPs voted against the government on Tuesday, several accusing ministers of playing \"appalling\" parliamentary games to avoid defeat.\nMPs were expecting to vote on a plan to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. \nBut the government, which opposed the plan, used a procedure to prevent a vote and instead backed a separate move giving Parliament greater say.\nThis passed by 318 votes to 303 but peers will seek to overturn this and re-insert a clause empowering British courts into the Trade Bill when it returns to the House of Lords later this month. \nThe government was heavily defeated on the issue in the Lords last month and independent peer Lord Alton has said he will resurrect his amendment in the hope MPs will get the chance to vote on it.\n\"Denying them that right makes a mockery of democracy,\" he said.\nMPs were prevented from having their say on it on Tuesday after ministers used a parliamentary procedure to lump it together with a Labour proposal which required ministers to determine whether a prospective trade partner has committed crimes against humanity.\nDowning Street argues it's \"common practice\" to package certain amendments together during parliamentary ping-pong but developments have undoubtedly provoked anger on the Conservative backbenches. \nSome MPs view what's happened as pure \"parliamentary chicanery\" on what is a very important and emotive issue. \nAnd, looking to the longer term, there are claims that the episode has \"hardened\" attitudes against the government, a government, it's said, that had been getting \"very twitchy\" on the numbers following a big whipping operation. \nAnother backbencher described that operation as \"heavy, full-on stuff\" and an exercise which had revealed the extent of a potentially \"stonking\" rebellion. \nWhat's more, it appeared that some newer MPs were gearing up to rebel for the first time. That is a habit any government doesn't want its backbenchers to get into. \nA number of Conservative MPs criticised the government's tactics, Nusrat Ghani saying \"she was appalled at the parliamentary games being played over such a grave issue\".\nThe UK, she said, should not be \"using its newfound post-Brexit freedoms to trade with states which commit and profit from genocide...Britain is better than that\".\nTrade Minister Greg Hands said a committee could trigger a Commons debate and vote if it decided there were \"credible reports\" that genocide had been committed by a state with which the UK was negotiating a trade deal. \n\"This approach rightly puts Parliament, not the courts, in the driving seat on the issue of who generates a debate in Parliament,\" he told MPs.\nBut former Conservative leader Sir Ian Duncan Smith said there was a reason why matters of huge public importance, such as public inquiries into tragedies and scandals, were overseen by judges.\n\"I have my own differences with judges but when we need an impartial taking of evidence and a judgement, we turn not to select committees but judges. Why do we do that?\n\"One, because we assume they are impartial. Two because they are trained to take evidence and deal with evidence. We are not here.\"\nAnd Labour's Emily Thornberry accused the government of \"shameful, shabby and shifty\" behaviour.\nCampaigners want British courts to hear genocide cases so that persecuted minorities, such as the Uighurs in Xinjiang, China, can have their situation considered by a court of law.\nA legal opinion by senior barristers at Essex Court Chambers has already concluded there was a \"very credible case\" that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uighurs."

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Grenfell Tower Inquiry",
      "text": "A new regulator will be established with powers to ban the use of dangerous building materials, following evidence at the Grenfell Tower Inquiry that manufacturers covered up safety issues. \nIt will be able to prosecute companies that flout rules, the government said. \nMinisters have called revelations at the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire \"deeply disturbing\".\nThey have also ordered a review of product testing because of \"abuses\" in the testing system.\nThe findings of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, which led to the deaths of 72 people in June 2017, are not expected for at least another year. \nBut Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it was \"already clear that action is required now\".\nIn evidence given late last year, the behaviour of several companies was under close scrutiny - with damaging admissions about their activities in the years before the fire.\nKingspan, which makes insulation panels, revealed it sold a combustible product despite failed fire tests.\nThe Grenfell Inquiry heard that Celotex, another insulation maker, effectively \"rigged\" a test to keep its product on the market. \nThe BBC also revealed that cladding manufacturer Arconic failed to tell British standards bodies about poor results from tests it carried out on the aluminium panels used at Grenfell. \nAll three products have been found to have contributed to the fire.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the new regulator would be able to conduct its own tests. \nIt will operate within the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS), which was  set up by the government to help manage large-scale product recalls and identify risks to consumers. \nThe OPSS will be expanded and given \u00a310m in funding to establish the new function.\nThe regulator will work with the newly created Building Safety Regulator and Trading Standards to \"encourage and enforce compliance\".\nMr Jenrick said:\u202f \"The Grenfell Inquiry has heard deeply disturbing allegations of malpractice by some construction product manufacturers and their employees, and of the weaknesses of the present product testing regime.\n\"We are establishing a national regulator to address these concerns and a review into testing to ensure our national approach is fit for purpose. \n\"We will continue to listen to the evidence emerging in the inquiry, and await the judge's ultimate recommendation - but it is already clear that action is required now and that is what we are doing.\"\nThe Grenfell Tower fire revealed deep-seated problems with the building regulations and product testing. \nMinisters say they are pushing through a \"fundamental overhaul of regulatory systems\". \nBut thousands of people currently live in buildings constructed with materials which pose a risk.  They have to pay for extra fire safety measures until cladding or insulation is stripped off. \nGiles Grover, from the national campaigning coalition End Our Cladding Scandal said the announcement was not enough.\n\"It will help people in new homes but it doesn't help those of us with Kingspan K15 insulation wrapped around our flats.  The only way that the government's going to make sure our buildings are safe is to put up the money now.\"\n The government has made \u00a31.6 billion available for the work, and there has been steady progress on public housing. But for private sector buildings it has barely begun.  The overall cost of the crisis could to rise to \u00a315 billion.  \nKingspan and Celotex have both admitted failings in the testing of their products. \nCelotex said it discovered discrepancies in the tests and some staff had been disciplined. \nKingspan said \"these matters do not reflect the organisation that we are or aspire to be, and significant actions have been taken and are in progress, that further underpin our commitment to fire safety and to professional conduct.\"\nArconic previously told the BBC its products could be used safely provided those who \"design the cladding system\u2014such as architects, fabricators, contractors, or building owners... conduct their own full systems testing or analysis of the entire cladding system.\" "

      "tags": "Mars,China,Space exploration",
      "text": "China says it has successfully put its Tianwen-1 mission in orbit around Mars.\nIt's the first time the country has managed to get a spacecraft to the Red Planet and comes a day after the United Arab Emirates accomplished the same feat.\nTianwen-1, or \"Questions to Heaven\", comprises an orbiter and a rover.\nEngineers will bide their time before despatching the wheeled robot to the surface but the expectation is that this will happen in May or June.\nWednesday's orbit insertion underlines again the rapid progress China's space programme is making.\nIt follows December's impressive mission to retrieve rock and soil samples from Earth's Moon - by any measure a very complex undertaking.\nTianwen-1's mission, particularly the surface element, will be no less challenging.\nIts five-tonne spacecraft stack, made up of orbiter and rover, was launched from Wenchang spaceport in July, and travelled nearly half a billion km to rendezvous with the Red Planet.\nEngineers had planned a 14-minute braking burn on the orbiter's 3,000-newton thruster, with the expectation that this would reduce its 23km/s velocity sufficiently to allow capture by Mars' gravity.\nThe manoeuvre was automated; it had to be. Radio commands currently take 11 minutes to traverse the 190 million km now separating Earth from Mars.\nIt should have put Tianwen-1 in an initial large ellipse that comes in as close as 400km from the surface and out as far as 180,000km.\nThis will be trimmed over time to become tighter and more circularised.\nIn contrast to the Emiratis' live TV coverage on Tuesday, China chose to report the orbit insertion at Mars only after it had occurred.\nIt was clear early on, however, that events were proceeding as they should because amateur radio enthusiasts could listen across Tianwen-1's signals, and they could see each milestone in the manoeuvre was being achieved. \nChina is following the strategy employed by the Americans for their successful Viking landers in the mid-1970s. The idea then was to make orbit first and only later send a robot to the surface.\nA period of reconnaissance will now follow but Tianwen-1's primary choice for a touchdown is a flat plain within the Utopia impact basin just north of Mars' equator. \nThe rover, which has yet to be named, looks a lot like the US space agency's (Nasa) Spirit and Opportunity rovers from the 2000s. It weighs some 240kg and is powered by fold-out solar panels.\nA tall mast carries cameras to take pictures and aid navigation; five additional instruments will help assess the mineralogy of local rocks and look for any water-ice.\nA key experiment will be the ground-penetrating radar, which should be able to sense geological layers at depths of many metres.\nThis surface investigation is really only half the mission, however, because the orbiter that has been shepherding the rover will also study the planet, using a suite of seven remote-sensing instruments.\nLike previous satellites, this spacecraft will observe characteristics of the high atmosphere and examine the structures and composition of the surface. High- and medium-resolution cameras should return some impressive pictures.\nTinawen-1 is one of three missions arriving at Mars this February.\nThe UAE's Hope probe made it safely into orbit on Tuesday. Next week, Nasa will attempt to put another of its big rovers on the surface."

      "text": "Further funding towards the cost of removing unsafe cladding on buildings is expected to be announced by the government. \nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick will make a statement to MPs shortly, but details of the plan are unknown.\nThousands of flat-owners are facing huge bills for fire-safety improvements after 2017's Grenfell disaster, when flames spread via combustible cladding.\nThe government announced a \u00a31.6bn building safety fund in 2020 to help.\nBut pressure is growing on ministers to increase the pot for residents stuck in the buildings, with a committee of MPs estimating the total cost of the crisis could run to \u00a315bn.\nBBC Newsnight reported last month that the government had decided to allocate extra funding, possibly running into billions of pounds, to speed up the removal of unsafe cladding.\nMore than three and a half years since the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding.\nAfter Grenfell, round-the-clock fire patrols known as \"waking watches\" were put in place in hundreds of buildings, costing groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month. \nFixing safety faults has seen costs surge for leaseholders, while residents have seen insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems rocket.\nConservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley said ministers should accept that \"the only tenants who are being asked to pay at the moment are leaseholders\" and confirm they are \"not responsible\".\n\"They need to provide the money so that remediation can take place,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \n\"Buildings should be made safe, they need to be made saleable - which means you can't have liabilities hanging around the necks of individual leaseholders.\"\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast there has been \"substantial help\" available for those facing higher costs, but \"needs are very high\".\nHe acknowledged concerns among leaseholders - referring particularly to those who share ownership with housing associations or local authorities - that they \"may be left out of this\".\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said work was \"either completed or under way\" on around 95% of the residential high-rises identified as having flammable ACM cladding at the start of last year, \"with all works to be completed this year\".\n\"We all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible and are already backing this with our \u00a31.6 billion funding we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes,\" a statement said.\nIt added that the government was \"working at pace to develop further financial solutions to protect leaseholders from unaffordable costs\".\nBut data released last month showed that cladding removal and repair work had been completed on only 58% of social housing blocks and 30% of private sector buildings.\nHomebuilder Persimmon said it was putting aside \u00a375m \"towards any necessary cladding remediation and safety work\" in 26 developments.\nThey include nine high-rise buildings where cladding may need to be removed - although Persimmon no longer owns the sites - and 17 smaller buildings that may be fitted with unsafe cladding and need investigating.\nFirst-time buyer Amy Cottenden, who is 28, bought a one-bed flat in Metis Tower in the centre of Sheffield for \u00a385,000 in 2017.\nInspections of the 14-storey building in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed it had the same type of flammable ACM cladding and other safety faults.\n\"It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here,\" she said. \"With lockdown, they are saying not to go out, but you are in a building where all you want to do is not be in it. You can't leave. You can't sell. My flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe.\"\nWhile the government's Building Safety Fund is paying for the Grenfell-style cladding to be removed, the building has other fire safety faults, including missing fire breaks, that aren't covered by the scheme.\nIt could cost up to \u00a36m to fix. Flat owners fear they may face huge bills of up to \u00a350,000 each.\n\"We can't pay it and we shouldn't have to pay it. It is not our fault. We could all go bankrupt because of this,\" Ms Cottenden said.\nA spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner, the company which manages Metis Tower, said: \"We understand and sympathise with residents and owners about the uncertainty that this situation is causing and will do all we can to assist.\"\nRead more: Cladding crisis: 'Delays could bankrupt us' \nLabour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, said it was \"shameful\" that \"hundreds of thousands of people are still trapped in unsafe homes\". \nShe added: \"Whatever is announced will be too late for those first-time buyers who have already gone bust.\"\nIn an open letter to the chancellor, campaigning coalition End Our Cladding Scandal said Mr Jenrick's announcement should not be \"another partial solution\".\n\"If your government chooses to force us, the innocent victims of this crisis, into lifelong loans, of any size, this will be unacceptable, unfair and completely immoral,\" it said.\nIt said any proposal \"must be adequate in size and scope to fully resolve this quandary\", adding: \"This is not just about billing the taxpayer ever higher amounts, but finding ways to make those who caused the crisis pay.\"\nOn Tuesday evening, the National Leasehold Campaign tweeted that it was \"another sleepless night\" for leaseholders \"worried sick\" about what Mr Jenrick was going to announce.\n\"Please don't help some and not others,\" it said."

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,United States Capitol,Donald Trump,United States Senate",
      "text": "The US Senate has found that the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump is constitutional, allowing full proceedings to begin.\nMr Trump's defence team argued that he could not face trial after leaving the White House.\nBut a 56-44 majority voted in favour of continuing, with a handful of Republicans backing the measure.  \nMr Trump is accused of \"inciting insurrection\" when Congress was stormed last month. \nThousands gathered in support of false claims that widespread electoral fraud denied Mr Trump victory in the US presidential election. \nHowever Mr Trump is almost certain to be acquitted because only six Republican senators voted to move forward with impeachment, well short of the 17 Republicans whose votes would be needed to convict Mr Trump.\nDemocrats prosecuting the case opened the proceedings by showing a dramatic video montage of Mr Trump's 6 January speech and the deadly rioting by some of his supporters.\n\"That's a high crime and misdemeanour,\" Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland said of the footage. \"If that's not an impeachable offence, then there's no such thing.\"\nLawyers for the former president argued it was unconstitutional to put a former president through the process at all and accused Democrats of being politically motivated.\nA two-thirds majority is required to convict Mr Trump in the evenly split 100-seat Senate. Tuesday's vote implies loyalty toward the former president in his party remains high enough to avoid a conviction. \nHowever, if convicted, Mr Trump could be barred from holding office again. \nProceedings opened with impeachment managers - the Democrats tasked with leading the prosecution - arguing their attempts were legitimate. \nIn the 10-minute video used in their presentation, Mr Trump was shown telling his supporters to \"fight like hell\" before they stormed the US Capitol in violence that resulted in five deaths - including a police officer. \nRep Raskin was brought to tears as he recounted fear for his own family's safety during the riot after he was separated from his visiting daughter.\n\"This cannot be the future of America,\" he told senators, who act as jurors for impeachment. \n\"We cannot have presidents inciting and mobilising mob violence against our government and our institutions because they refuse to accept the will of the people under the Constitution of the United States.\"\nHe argued there could be no \"January exception\" to impeaching outgoing officials without risking a dangerous precedent. \nLawyers for Mr Trump then took the stand to outline their arguments with detailed complaints and allegations about due process and the constitutionality of proceedings.\nFormer Pennsylvania prosecutor Bruce Castor opened the defence with a meandering presentation that was met with a critical reception by even allies of Mr Trump.\nA second lawyer, David Schoen, was more pointed. He showed videos dating back to 2017 as evidence of what he labelled as an \"insatiable lust for impeachment\" among Democratic lawmakers.\n\"What they really want to accomplish here in the name of the Constitution is to bar Donald Trump from ever running for political office again, but this is an affront to the Constitution no matter who they target today,\" he told senators. \nRepublican Senator Bill Cassidy, one of the six to vote with Democrats, said after that the House prosecution had \"made a compelling, cogent case and the president's team did not\".\nReports in US media suggest Mr Trump - whose Twitter account has been banned - expressed anger at his lawyers' performance while watching on television from Florida. \nDonald Trump's Senate trial is just getting started. The final outcome, however, is all but certain.\nWhen the first substantive vote of the proceedings was taken on Tuesday - a vote about whether to have a trial at all - only six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats to continue. That is well short of the 17 Republicans that will be needed to convict.\nThe grim reality for Democrats is that making the case for the constitutionality of the trial should have been the easy part. They had precedent on their side. Nothing in the language of the Constitution explicitly said a former president cannot stand trial. But only one senator - Bill Cassidy of Louisiana - appeared to shift from a previous position to join the Democrats.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had reportedly been \"pleased\" that the House was impeaching Mr Trump, voted no. He, more than anyone in the Senate chamber, knows the mood of his fellow Republicans.\nDemocrats will now proceed with their case. They may make more heartfelt arguments that could resonate with the majority of Americans who polls indicate favour convicting Donald Trump. Inside the chamber, however, it appears minds are already made up.\nEach side now has up to 16 hours to present their case, starting at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. These arguments are expected to run through until the weekend when senators will get a chance to ask both sides questions.\nIt is unclear if the impeachment managers will then extend the timetable by requesting witnesses be called or subpoenaed - though Mr Trump has already declined to voluntarily testify.\nLawmakers on both sides are said to favour a quick trial, amid an ongoing effort to have President Joe Biden's coronavirus relief package approved.\nWith the speedy timetable, it is thought a Senate vote on whether to acquit or convict Mr Trump could be held as early as Monday."

It is about 770mph (1,200km/h) at sea level, but slower at higher altitudes. A plane flying at 30,000ft would reach the speed of sound at about 675mph (1,085km/h), according to NASA's educational website.\nIt can be heard over such a large area because it moves with the plane, rather like the wake of a boat spreading out behind the vessel.\nRAF jets are only given permission to go supersonic over populated areas in emergencies, usually when they are required to intercept another aircraft.\nFollow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "Senedd members are calling on the independent body that sets their salaries to maintain a pay freeze for politicians in Cardiff Bay.\nThe Independent Remuneration Board has recommended a 2.4% pay rise for Members of the Senedd (MSs) in May.\nIt would amount to an increase of \u00a31,624 on an MS' basic salary, bringing it to \u00a369,273.\nParties opposed to the change include Labour, the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru.\nThe Independent Alliance for Reform, Abolish the Assembly Party and UKIP also oppose it.\nNeil McEvoy, leader of the unregistered Propel party, has called for members to \"lead by example in these extraordinary times\" and back a two-year pay freeze.\nSenedd members' pay was frozen in 2020, with a planned 4.4% increase scrapped.\nThe remuneration board, which acts separately of the politicians in the Welsh Parliament, said at the time it was \"difficult to justify\" the rise given the poor economic outlook caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nBut in a review the body says continuing to freeze pay for the next Senedd term \"will no longer fairly reflect the role\" and could result in the need for a significant increase in salaries.\nFuture pay rises would also be capped at 3% under the changes, which have gone out to consultation.\nIn its response to the consultation, the Senedd's Labour group said it was \"strongly opposed\" to the pay rise, adding it would be \"inappropriate, insensitive and unfair... at a time when our constituents are facing very difficult circumstances as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\nA Welsh Conservative spokesman said: \"At this time of economic downturn when many people across Wales have been living off 80% of their salary, or have lost their job entirely, this is a completely unacceptable proposal.\n\"We will be making this view known in our response to the independent remuneration board.\"\nA Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: \"At a time when public sector workers are facing a pay freeze, elected members should not see their salaries rising\"\nThe Independent Alliance for Reform's Caroline Jones MS said: \"Anyone sensible would recognise giving politicians a pay rise would be absolutely ludicrous.\"\nMark Reckless, one of Abolish the Assembly Party's two MS's, said: \"Since the Labour government have put many people out of work, we welcome their drive for members' pay to be frozen. \n\"We would like them to go further and save the Welsh taxpayer millions per week by abolishing the unnecessary and expensive layer of bureaucracy in Cardiff Bay.\"\nA UKIP spokesman said: \"Senedd Members already earn almost three times the average salary in Wales. This pay rise is wholly inappropriate in the middle of a pandemic that has seen the livelihoods of many obliterated. \n\"This is another example of politicians feathering their own nests at the expense of ordinary people. Devolution has been a good deal for politicians but a bad deal for Wales. The Senedd must be scrapped and these over-inflated salaries reinvested in Wales.\"\nA spokesperson on the behalf of the board said it was \"consulting on a series of proposals for the determination on members' pay and allowances for the sixth Senedd, which includes a proposal regarding members' salaries\". \nThe spokesperson added: \"The board has written to stakeholders asking for views on these proposals. \n\"The closing date for submissions is Thursday 11 February and we look forward to considering the views of stakeholders in due course.\" "

But its prime market position has not yet translated into leadership on this critical issue. \n\"We hope that Tesco's board will endorse the resolution and grasp the opportunity to help build a healthier UK post-Covid, while also improving its financial sustainability in the long-term.\"\nShareAction praised recent Tesco initiatives, which showed that price cuts on fruit and vegetables raised sales, and that removing chocolate from prominent promotion spaces cut consumption.\nA Tesco spokesperson said: \"We are working hard to make it easy for our customers to make healthy choices, and we have set very clear targets on health and sustainability, published in our Little Helps Plan. \n\"Our reformulation programme has already removed more than 50 billion calories from our products since 2018; our 'helpful little swaps' events offer healthier alternatives to family favourites at the same price; and we have given away more than 100 million pieces of free fruit to children. \n\"We have also announced a target to increase sales of plant-based meat alternatives by 300% by 2025, and were the first retailer to set a target of this kind.\"\nBackers of the move include Robeco Institutional Asset Management, JO Hambro Capital Management's UK Dynamic Fund and Epworth Investment Management, owned by the Central Finance Board of the Methodist Church.

      "text": "The risk of coronavirus transmission from sharing sports equipment is \"lower than once thought\", a study suggests.\nResearchers, led by Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, applied live virus particles to nine types of sports equipment and a control material.\nThey concluded it \"seems unlikely\" that sports balls and accessories are a major cause for transmission.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said last June that cricket balls are a \"natural vector\" of coronavirus.\nThe Strike study found the virus was least transferrable on absorbent materials like cricket gloves and tennis balls, compared with non-porous equipment like racing saddles and rugby balls.\nThe researchers found that there was \"rapid decay\" of viral particles across several types of equipment, and it was \"very difficult\" to transfer live virus back off it.\n\"Close contact\" between players is likely to be a more important mode of spreading the virus than sharing equipment, researchers concluded.\nJames Calder, from Imperial College and Fortius Clinic, said: \"The findings in this study are important not only for elite athletes, but also for community sports and our schools. \n\"It shows that the risk of transmission when sharing sports equipment is lower than was once thought and it highlights the importance of promoting other infection control measures in sports, whilst urging equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may be less likely to retain viable virus.\"\nDuring the study a low dose and a high dose of live coronavirus was applied to a cricket glove, a football, a golf ball, a piece of gym pit foam, a horse saddle, both red and white cricket balls, a rugby ball and a tennis ball, as well as a piece of stainless steel as a control material.\nEach was tested after one minute, five minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 90 minutes, to see whether live virus could be transferred off the equipment at time points that were relevant to sports events.\nWhen the low dose was applied, virus was recoverable on seven of the 10 items tested after one minute, one of the 10 after five minutes - the horse saddle - and none of the 10 after 15 minutes.\nWhen the high dose was applied, virus was recoverable on nine out of the 10 items after one and five minutes - all except the cricket glove - six out of 10 after 30 minutes, and two out of 10 after 90 minutes (the rugby ball and horse saddle).\nHowever, the study - which is awaiting peer review - found that the \"mean recovery of the virus fell across all materials to 0.74% at one minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes\".\nDr Emily Adams, a senior lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: \"Anything that is slightly absorbent like a tennis ball or some of the leathery cricket balls, it's very difficult to transfer any live virus off those. So we think that transmission from sports equipment is probably very low in these cases. \n\"Basically in many sports, like tennis, really the public health intervention should be focused on players and how players interact before a game, during a game and after a game and in transport rather than the sports equipment itself.\"\nThe study found there was a \"noticeable\" difference in the viral recovery of red and white cricket balls.\n\"Despite the white and red cricket ball surfaces both being composed of bovine leather, the different coatings used to finish the surfaces (synthetic grease on the red ball, nitrocellulose on the white ball) had a noticeable effect on viral recovery, with the red ball having a lower level\", it says.\nThe study concludes that, given the differences in virus transfer between the types of sports equipment, the findings could \"direct the engineering of materials that retain and absorb virus\" as opposed to water-repellent materials, where the ability to transfer virus particles back off a surface is greater."

      "text": "The company that made Grenfell Tower's cladding would \"by default\" sell flammable materials to construction projects, including high-rise buildings, a sales manager has said.\nDeborah French told the public inquiry into the June 2017 west London blaze that Arconic could have sold a fire-retardant product.\nBut she said it saw the UK market as preferring a slightly cheaper version, albeit with a greater fire risk.\nSeventy-two people died in the fire.\nThe first phase of the Grenfell Inquiry concluded that cladding put on the tower block during refurbishment fuelled the fire.\nStatements from a series of Arconic managers shown to the inquiry on Tuesday said the \"UK was generally a 'PE market'\" - PE referring to polyethylene, which is used as the core material of the panel and is highly flammable.\nCombustible cladding is the major cause of the building safety crisis now affecting millions of flat owners. \nGiving evidence, Ms French, the company's UK sales manager, said a type of product called Reynobond PE panels were 4 to 5 euros cheaper per square metre than the fire-retardant version.  \nIn June 2014, she sent an email listing large construction projects to which she was hoping to sell cladding sheets.\nThey include a major development, Pendletons in Salford, Greater Manchester, on which Reynobond PE was used, as well as towers in Swansea and London. \nSmaller projects listed by Ms French included Grenfell Tower, which was listed as awaiting an order for cladding, with just the colour to choose.\nShe told the inquiry \"the discussions never came up about requiring anything other than a PE core\". \nWhen asked by inquiry lead barrister Richard Millett QC if Arconic would \"by default sell them PE\", she replied: \"That's right, yes.\"\nMs French said it was \"very, very, very rare\" for customers to ask about fire safety. \n\"It was not something that was discussed,\" she said. \"The majority of what I dealt with was colours, availabilities and those types of things.\"\nSales of Reynobond PE cladding were encouraged by a certificate issued by the independent British Board of Agrement. \nIt said that the flammable panels \"may be regarded\" as meeting a British fire performance standard known as Class 0. \nHowever the cladding had not passed the relevant British laboratory test, and had failed several of the European tests on which the certificate was based. \nMr Millett asked Ms French: \"If you were selling that product based on claims made about its fire performance [...] do you agree that you would be tending to mislead buyers?\"\n\"Yes, I wouldn't knowingly have done that, but inadvertently I would have been,\" she said. \nMs French insisted throughout her evidence that she was not a technical expert and passed detailed questions on to a technical manager, Claude Wehrle, based in France.  \nMr Wehrle is one of three potential witnesses to the inquiry who have refused to give evidence on legal advice that, if they did so, they could incriminate themselves under a law in France.\nThe so-called French Blocking Statute prevents its citizens taking part in some foreign legal cases.\nAll three worked for Arconic. Mr Wehrle and fellow potential witness Gwenaelle Derrendinger live in France, while the third, Peter Froehlich, is based in Germany.\nMr Millett said \"the refusal of these witnesses to come and give evidence is unreasonable\". \nThe inquiry was also told that Arconic refused to disclose documents to the inquiry and only did so following a criminal European Investigation Order requested by the Metropolitan Police.\nThe police force is investigating potential corporate manslaughter, fraud, and breaches of health and safety law. \nMs French will continue giving evidence on Wednesday.

      "text": "The EU was late to authorise Covid-19 vaccines and \"still not where we want to be\", European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said.\nShe also acknowledged the EU had been overconfident about production targets being met amid delays at factories.\nThe Commission chief has come under fire for the EU's slow vaccine rollout.\nThere is anger that the bloc has fallen behind countries like the UK, where more than 12 million people have already received the jab.\nBut Mrs von der Leyen was adamant that ordering vaccines collectively on behalf of member states was \"the right thing to do\".\nMeanwhile pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca has said it will join forces with German company IDT Biologika to produce more vaccines for Europe.\nProducers of vaccines including the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech jabs have postponed delivery of some of the EU's order because of capacity and supply issues. \nThis was Mrs von der Leyen's first public acceptance of criticism. Last week, she told German paper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung that \"a country on its own can be a speedboat, the EU is more like a tanker\".\n\"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production,\" the Commission president told the European Parliament, \"and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" She also noted that questions would have to be answered about what went wrong. \nHowever, Mrs von der Leyen maintained that a joint EU response had been the correct decision in dealing with the pandemic: \"I can't even imagine if a few big players had rushed to it and the others went empty-handed.\n\"In economic terms it would have been nonsense and it would have been I think the end of our community.\"\nShe also defended the time taken to approve vaccines, which she described as \"an essential investment to establish confidence and security\".\nThe Commission president said she \"deeply\" regretted a threat made by the EU last month to restrict the flow of vaccines passing between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\"But in the end we got it right and I can reassure you that my Commission will do its utmost to protect the peace in Northern Ireland.\" \nBy Kevin Connolly, Europe correspondent, Brussels\nThe EU's vaccination programme has become an important political test for the European Commission, which took over responsibility for the rollout from individual member states.\nIt has also become a critical test of the personal standing of Ursula von der Leyen. She has now acknowledged failings and admitting underestimating the difficulties of mass production.\nBut this was not by any means a straightforward apology. Mrs von der Leyen said it was right for the EU to have acted together, not in competition. \nThe experiences of Serbia, which is not an EU member state, and Hungary, which is, point to a possible solution to vaccine shortages in Europe. Both have turned to suppliers of Russian and Chinese vaccines to supplement supplies from Western pharmaceutical companies.\nRight-wing Danish MEP Peter Kofod complained that the EU was \"treading water\" while other countries such as the UK, US and Israel made big strides in vaccinating their populations.\nAddressing Mrs von der Leyen directly, left-wing French MEP Manon Aubry asked: \"How could the European Commission accept to just lie down when dealing with the pharma companies?\" \nBut there was support for the EU's response, too.\nSpanish centre-right Euro MP Esteban Gonz\u00e1lez Pons said if it had not been for the Commission's decision to centralise the purchase of vaccines, his country and others would not have received their consignments \"because of a lack of political clout and budget\".\n\"Not everything was perfect in the last weeks and the last months,\" said Manfred Weber, the chairman of the centre-right EPP group of MEPs. \"The key decisions were right.\""

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Personal finance,UK fire safety",
      "text": "Three years after the Grenfell fire, many buildings with dangerous cladding still have 24-hour fire safety patrols - introduced originally as a temporary measure. Now, thousands more homeowners are being forced to pay for \"waking watches\" with no end in sight.\nIn November 2017, when people in high-vis jackets arrived at Ritu Saha's block in Bromley, south-east London, she was told not to worry: they'd be gone by January.\nThree years and about \u00a3500,000 of charges to flat owners in the block later, they are still there.\nMost of the cladding - the type that caused the Grenfell fire to spread so fast, killing 72 people - has been removed from Ritu's flat. \nBut entire walls would need to be demolished to clear it away entirely, Ritu says. \nThe contractors suggest the task is too difficult, and the remaining cladding may have to stay, along with other safety measures to prevent a deadly fire. The fire brigade says that could mean the waking watch has to stay.\n\"Will we have these fire wardens for the rest of our lives?\" Ritu asks. The patrols have already cost her, on average, more than \u00a3300 a month for the last three years, totalling \u00a311,700. \nA university administrator and one of the founders of the UK Cladding Action Group, she says she cannot bear the cost much longer - \"I will be ruined, basically, if that happens.\"\nCosts for the fire patrols vary hugely, with flat owners often saying they are imposed with little notice or consultation. \nGovernment research suggests the typical flat owner pays \u00a3137 a month, or \u00a3256 in London - about \u00a311,000 to \u00a315,000 per block each month. Fire wardens are mostly paid around \u00a314 an hour - but some earn up to \u00a330 an hour, the government says.\nAnd the number of affected buildings continues to rise: in London, 573 blocks now have the patrols, up from 286 in March.\nOne flat owner in east London tells the BBC the waking watch introduced at his block in July costs the equivalent of \u00a31,300 per flat every month. At the moment, the bill is being paid by the housing association, but he says if the costs cannot be recovered from the original developer or through the building warranty, leaseholders will be charged.\nThe leasehold system in England and Wales means many flat owners do not own their property outright, but instead buy the right to use it for a fixed period of time - often between 99 and 125 years. \nTheir buildings are owned by a freeholder, who charges them a small annual rent, plus money for repairs - which can mean huge bills for issues such as cladding.\n\"The buck keeps being passed between each body,\" the flat owner says. \"What are they trying to do to leaseholders? Are they really trying to bankrupt us?\"\nSome residents have organised their own waking watch to reduce the cost, with volunteers covering many of the shifts, sometimes in the face of opposition from insurers.\nRitu says she would rush home from work to start her 19:00 to midnight shift. A retired woman in her block would take some of the night shifts, staying up from midnight to 07:00 three nights a week to watch for signs of a blaze.\nA fire alarm can be fitted for the same average cost as just seven weeks of waking watch, government research suggests. But in practice it rarely works out that way: many leaseholders are required by the National Fire Chiefs Council to maintain patrols so they can help evacuate the building in the event of a fire. \nRitu now has eight highly sensitive smoke and heat detectors scattered around her one-and-a-half bedroom flat, frequently setting off false alarms.\nBut fitting the system - which cost leaseholders \u00a3120,000 - only allowed residents to reduce their waking watch from two people to one, still leaving them a \u00a312,000 monthly bill between them.\nMatt Browne and Lizzie Bennett are among thousands of flat owners who discovered in the last year they lived in a dangerous block that would require 24-hour fire patrols when they tried to sell.\nTheir estate agent told them their building, in Birmingham city centre, had failed its external wall fire review, known as EWS1. \nThe review process - demanded by lenders - was extended to many more buildings in January this year with a change of government guidance. Blocks that fail because of dangerous cladding, like Matt and Lizzie's, are valued at \u00a30, cannot be mortgaged and are almost impossible to sell.\nSince then, their building's service charge has risen from \u00a3950 every six months to \u00a34,629 to pay for a \u00a317,000-a-month waking watch, a \u00a3150,000 alarm system (not yet installed) and a 300% increase in insurance bills.\n\"It's unfathomable, you can't really wrap your head around the idea that it costs this much to live in a one-bedroom flat,\" says Lizzie, a primary school teacher.\nShe has suffered anxiety and sleeplessness over the mounting costs, but says: \"It's been a constant battle of trying to keep it together because I can't show emotion at work, I have to be there for the children.\"\nLike many leaseholders, they hope their building wins some of the \u00a31.6bn of government funding to remove dangerous cladding when applications close this month. But Matt says the Building Safety Fund is \"nowhere near big enough\" to meet demand.\nThe 26-year-old video producer has been exhausted by the process after six months. \"I know people have been fighting this for years already,\" he says. \"We are at a stage now where in the next year you will start seeing people go bankrupt and people will start losing their homes.\"\nIn 2019, solicitor Peter Tolson signed up to help run his block's management company in order to push forward some minor repairs. \nHe's seen the impact the charges have had on fellow residents - some have lost their jobs in the pandemic - since the flats in east London failed their EWS1 earlier this year.\n\"We had people literally banging on our doors, crying, banging the door down at this thought of paying a grand or two grand a month to pay for waking watch on top of insurance costs,\" he says.\nThey have since reduced the costs by arguing they did not need such extensive patrol coverage. But residents have nicknamed the waking watch \"the Wombles\" and don't regard them as a serious safety measure.\nResidents complain the wardens just sit around, Peter says. He questions the likelihood of them being in just in the right spot at the right time when a fire is visible behind a flat door with time still to evacuate.\nMeanwhile, each week more flat owners discover they are in the same situation. Olivia Hill, a PhD student, helped form the Sheffield Cladding Action Group after discovering her block had failed its assessment last month.\nShe says residents face an uncomfortable choice between protection from the dangers of fire and letting strangers into their building. \"I live on my own, I'm a young woman, it's easy to feel unsafe,\" Olivia says.\nHaving done all the due diligence when she purchased it last year, she was shocked to discover potentially deadly faults are still being discovered in buildings more than three years after Grenfell.\n\"It's been going on so long and potentially there's no end in sight,\" Olivia says. \"It could keep going on that long for us.\" \nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said waking watches should only be used \"as an interim measure\", adding: \"They are not a substitute for the swift removal of unsafe cladding.\n\"Where leaseholders have concerns about waking watch costs they should speak to their building owner, who is responsible for putting safety measures in place. Leaseholders can also challenge excessive costs at the First Tier Tribunal.\"\nThe government on Thursday announced a \u00a330m fund to help pay for the installation of common fire alarms in affected buildings, to end what it called the \"scandal\" of excessive waking watch costs."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nBoris Johnson has urged nearly two million people to \"come forward\" and take up the offer of a Covid jab. The prime minister said the UK was closing in on Monday's target for vaccinating nearly 15 million of the most vulnerable people, but some people \"for one reason or another\" have not had one. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson said the aim was not to \"hit some numerical target, but so we save lives... another step on the long, hard road back to normality\".\nEngland's Deputy Chief Medical Officer has said it \"really concerns\" him that fewer people from ethnic minority backgrounds may get the Covid vaccine. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said that while vaccine uptake has been high among the UK population so far, he's worried it's not going to be \"as rapid or as high\" among ethnic minority communities. \"This virus just doesn't care about what ethnic background you are from,\" he said as he urged everyone to get the jab. Prof Van-Tam was answering audience questions as part of a #BBCYourQuestions session and also addressed concerns about the South African variant and the spread of misinformation. \nIf you're hoping to get away for a summer break, you might not want to pack your bags just yet. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has warned that people in the UK should not be booking holidays at home or abroad at the moment due to coronavirus. He told the BBC he did not know \"where we'll be in terms of cases, deaths and vaccination\" by the summer. He also said the UK was talking to other countries about setting up an \"international system\" for checking if people have been tested or vaccinated - but this should not be likened to a Covid \"passport\".\nThere's been a lot of focus this week on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine following suggestions it was less effective against the South African variant of Covid-19. Now the World Health Organization has recommended using the vaccine in all adults - whatever their age. Dr Alejandro Cravioto, the chairman of the WHO's panel of experts, said there was \"no reason not to recommend its use\" even in countries that have circulation of the coronavirus variant. It comes after several countries have opted not to give the jab to those over 65. The WHO also said spacing out the two doses, as is happening in the UK, makes the vaccine more effective.\nMany business owners have seen their customer numbers dwindle as a result of the pandemic - including mechanic Jim Walsh. His car repair business was on the brink of collapse due to the fact there are less drivers on the road during lockdown. But the garage is now fully booked this week and busy for the next fortnight after his daughter, Harley, posted a single tweet to drum up business. \"It just shows that there's good people and it's nice to see that on social media,\" she said.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nTo read about what your rights are if you do decide book a holiday in the UK for later in the year.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found.\nThis is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage.\nIncreased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in very specific locations - local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets.\nSome of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not have Covid symptoms.\nThe testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.\nSurge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.\nEast\nNorth West\nWest Midlands\nSouth East\nSurge testing is also currently being carried out in specific and targeted locations within the following local authority areas:\nLondon\nSouth East\nNorth West\nYorkshire and the Humber\nTargeted community testing is also taking place in various health board areas across Scotland. \nScientists have identified a number of \"variants of concern\" - these are  newly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. \nAlso, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines.\nThe Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). \nThe variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming system which uses Greek letters instead. \nThe PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test \nPeople tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. \nThis involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.\nIt is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result.\nThe lateral flow test \nThis also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes.\nWherever you are in the UK, if you have symptoms you should book a free test online. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home. \nIf you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland. \nAnyone in England can now get free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms. These can be ordered online, by calling 119, or can be collected from test centres and pharmacies. \nAnyone in Scotland can also order free lateral flow tests online, or collect them from test centres.\nAnyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.\nSelf-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials.\nPeople in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nAnyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a \u00a3500 payment."

      "tags": "Travel,Reality Check,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are more than 40 countries on the government's red list, which has the strictest travel restrictions.\nOne is India, where a new mutation of coronavirus first identified in the country has spread to the UK. This has been linked to international travel. It has been classified as a \"variant of concern\" and more than 3,400 cases of it have been found in the UK.\nBut despite this and the discovery in the UK of other variants identified abroad, the government has never banned international travel altogether - unlike some countries.\nA traffic light system has been introduced for travel, with countries classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests.\nRed list countries (which include India, Pakistan, Brazil and South Africa) are those the UK government says are at the highest risk from Covid, and should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\".\nIf you have been in one, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national, or UK resident.\nYou must be tested negative for Covid-19 before departure and self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel.\nDirect flights from many red list countries to the UK are banned but some are allowed. These include flights from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. The government says this is to avoid potential disruption to critical freight and British nationals seeking to return home.\nOn one day (19 May), Reality Check counted 4 direct flights from India to Heathrow.\nCoronavirus variants originally found in Brazil, South Africa and India are believed to be more transmissible, and there are concerns vaccines may not be quite as effective against them.\nBritish and Irish citizens who have been in these countries are allowed to return to the UK and - until mid-February - were trusted to self-isolate at home and could take public transport to get there. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had moved \"as fast as we could\" to introduce quarantine hotels, describing them as a \"very tough regime\". The measures began on 15 February 2021, after weeks of speculation.\nLabour said there had been a lack of a \"comprehensive\" border system. \nThe Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. \nThe country was placed on the red list on 23 April and there has been criticism that it should have been added earlier.\nJust under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according to a 13 May briefing from Public Health England. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England.\nPositive tests from passengers arriving in the UK are automatically sent for genome sequencing, which identifies new variants.\nBut there is concern that by the time a variant has been identified, it may already have spread in the UK.\nThe debate over whether to shut UK borders stretches back to the start of the pandemic.\nBetween January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures to try to protect itself from the new virus.\nQuarantine was imposed on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China, where the first outbreak was seen. Others from \"high-risk countries\" including China, Iran and Northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days.\nAn inquiry into the pandemic suggested it was understandable the government \"did not consider it practical or effective simply to restrict flights\" at that time, partly because there were so many British residents trying to get home.\nBut these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March 2020 - 10 days before the UK went into the first lockdown.\n\"The government's failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people,\" Yvette Cooper, chair of the committee of MPs behind the inquiry said. \nOne study found the virus was introduced to the UK \"well over a thousand times in early 2020\", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases.\nAt the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against travel bans, saying they were \"usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact\".\nIn April 2021, the WHO said it would update its \"risk-based guidance\" on Covid and international travel.\nThe Home Office said the committee behind the inquiry was \"incorrect in their assertions\".\nIt said keeping borders open helped businesses maintain international connections, boosted the economy and meant people could still travel for essential reasons. \nIt argued that by mid-March 2020 there was \"significant transmission\" in the UK and any extra travel restrictions at that time would have had a \"very marginal\" impact.\nAt a meeting in February 2020, the government advisory committee Sage suggested that cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the epidemic by five days. \nThe scientists estimated that a 95% reduction in imported cases, which would have required \"draconian\" travel restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month.\nBut at its meeting in January 2021, Sage said: \"No intervention, other than a complete, pre-emptive closure of borders, or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities, irrespective of testing history, can get close to fully preventing the importation of cases or new variants.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Travellers having to stay in quarantine hotels in England will be charged \u00a31,750 for their stay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced.\nThe measures, which come into force on Monday, apply to UK and Irish residents returning from 33 red list countries.\nThose who fail to quarantine in a government-sanctioned hotel for 10 days face fines of up to \u00a310,000.\nMeanwhile, all travellers arriving into Scotland from abroad by air will have to go into quarantine hotels. \nPeople travelling from red list countries to Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to book and pay for quarantine in England, as neither destination currently has any direct international flights.\nTravellers arriving into England who lie on their passenger locator forms about visiting a red list country face a fine of \u00a310,000 or up to 10 years in jail.\nIt comes as the UK reported another 12,364 confirmed cases of coronavirus and a further 1,052 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - bringing that total to 113,850. More than 12.6 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine.\nDelivering a statement in the Commons, Mr Hancock said 16 hotels have been contracted for the programme, with 4,600 rooms secured.\nThe health secretary also confirmed a new \"enhanced testing\" regime for all travellers arriving into the UK would begin on Monday, with two tests required during the quarantine process.\nThey will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The tests, conducted by NHS Test and Trace, will cost travellers \u00a3210.\n\"People who flout these rules are putting us all at risk,\" the health secretary told MPs.\nAirlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said.\nThe penalties include a \u00a31,000 fine for travellers who fail to take mandatory tests and a \u00a32,000 fine for failing to take the second mandatory test - along with a 14-day extension to quarantine.\nFailing to quarantine in a designated hotel carries a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nAsked when the travel rules would be relaxed, Mr Hancock said: \"We want to exit from this into a system of safe international travel as soon as practicable and as soon as is safe.\"\nPassengers required to stay in a quarantine hotel will need to reserve a room online in advance using a booking system that opens on Thursday.\nThe \u00a31,750 fee for an individual includes the hotel, the cost of transport and testing. The additional rate for one extra adult or a child aged over 12 is \u00a3650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is \u00a3325.\nThese travellers will only be allowed to enter the UK through a \"small number of ports that currently account for the vast majority of passenger arrivals\", Mr Hancock added.\nResponding to Mr Hancock's statement, Labour's shadow health secretary said the public wanted the government to \"go further\" on border quarantine measures.\nJonathan Ashworth told the Commons: \"Our first line of defence is surely to do everything we can to stop (new variants) arising in the first place. That means securing our borders to isolate new variants as they come in. \n\"He's announced a detailed package today but he hasn't announced comprehensive quarantine controls at the borders.\"\nMr Hancock later said the red list was kept \"under review\". \nAnnouncing Scotland's tougher measures, which apply to arrivals from all countries, Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the \"targeted, reactive approach\" of the UK government was \"no longer sufficient\" to deal with the threat from coronavirus.\nWelsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said he also wanted to see \"a stronger set of defences at our borders\" and said the UK government's measures were \"the bare minimum of what needs to be done\".\nEnforcement fines and prison sentences over quarantine breaches are still \"under review\" in Wales. A Welsh government spokesperson also said the country was working to determine when it will need its own quarantine hotels, if the red list expands or if international flights resume. \nAlthough the 4,600 rooms secured so far in England would only allow for around one Boeing 747's worth of passengers per day, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said discussions were under way to add more capacity. \nShe told BBC Radio 4's World at One that separate security teams contracted by the government would be responsible for enforcing the quarantine, while hotel staff focused on giving people the \"best possible experience in what are very difficult circumstances\".\nThe \u00a31,750 fee includes three meals, tea, coffee and water, Ms Nicholls said, but other items will be available at an extra cost through room service.\nTravellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nThis test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to \u00a3500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks.\nThey must also provide contact details and their UK address. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate. \nAll travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK.\nThe \"test to release scheme\" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - will remain under the new testing rules.\nPassengers will be expected to use the gold-standard and more expensive PCR tests.\nLockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. These are the same as the \"reasonable excuses\" for domestic travel, including:\nPeople leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure.\nThe new measures come after England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, warned it was too soon to say to what extent people could begin to start planning summer holidays.\nSpeaking at Monday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing, he said: \"The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point,\" he said.\n\"I can't give people a proper answer at this point because we don't yet have the data. It is just too early to say.\"\nAfter the announcement of the travel rules, aimed at preventing the spread of new variants of coronavirus, government advisers designated another \"variant of concern\" - a version of the virus which was revealed last week to have been found in Bristol.\nIt's not surprising that officials are adding this new version of coronavirus to their \"variants of concern\" list. \nTargeted testing is already under way to spot any new cases linked to the 21 that have already been found, mostly in the south west of England.\nThis new incarnation of the virus is the Kent variant \"plus\". It has the same N501Y mutation as the one that triggered lockdown - a genetic change that scientists say lets the virus spread more easily. But it also has an extra mutation called E484K.\nE484K is what experts are worried about for vaccine efficacy. It is also seen in the South Africa and Brazil variants of concern. \nA cluster of another variant in Liverpool is different again. It has got the E484K mutation but is an iteration of an earlier version of the pandemic virus rather than the Kent one.\nInevitably, more variants will continue to emerge. The challenge is to make sure vaccines are a good match to keep us ahead in this race against the virus. \nHave you recently travelled into the UK? What was your experience at the UK border?"

      "text": "Staff at the DVLA headquarters, which has seen more than 500 Covid cases since September, are to be balloted for strike action.\nThe PCS union said the DVLA had been \"forcing\" staff to go into the Swansea office despite the infections. \nIt comes after MP Geraint Davies called for the UK government to reduce the number of workers at the centre. \nBoris Johnson said at Prime Minister's Questions all staff who can work from home, were working from home. \nThe DVLA rejected claims it is \"an unsafe place to work\".\nThe ballot will be open from 18 February until 11 March, the union said. \nBoth Mr Davies and the PCS Union said 250 people were working on the site last March, but that number is now in the thousands. \nIt was announced last month that one member of staff had died with coronavirus. \nPCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: \"It is a scandal that DVLA have insisted over 2,000 staff members come into work every day, despite having the biggest outbreak of Covid in an office workplace within the UK.\"\nHe added management had shown a \"cruel indifference\" to staff's concerns. \nThe coronavirus outbreak was declared at the offices in the Llansamlet area of Swansea in December after 352 cases in the space of four months. The total number of Covid cases at the site now stands at 526, according to Mr Davies. \nSpeaking at Prime Minister's questions, Labour MP for Swansea West, Mr Davies, said thousands were now working at the site \"facing a more infectious and widespread disease\".\n\"Yesterday 90 people were sent home following the latest outbreak of coronavirus just before the weekend,\" he told the Commons.\n\"Given that BT are on standby to install home secure technology to allow home working, will the prime minister meet with me and the union ahead of the strike ballot next week so that workplace numbers can be reduced until the vaccine is rolled out to keep people safe and avoid an unnecessary strike?\"\nThe DVLA later said only 37 staff had been sent home on Tuesday after one staff member had tested positive. \nIt added this had not been declared an outbreak by Public Health Wales. \nThe prime minister responded that \"to the best of my knowledge\" out of the workforce of 6,000 there were \"thankfully\" only nine cases of Covid now and three of those individuals were currently working from home. \nMr Johnson said that the DVLA was pursuing a working from home strategy.\nHe added the UK government was \"rolling out lateral flow tests\" but said the \"long term solution\" was vaccinating people. \nA DVLA spokesperson said: \"We care deeply about the safety of DVLA staff and we fully reject the claims made that DVLA is an unsafe place to work. Rigorous protocols are in place to ensure a Covid-secure workplace. \n\"We are disappointed that the trade union feel that industrial action is justified, not only because of the current low rate of positive cases among DVLA staff, but also because we are actively working with PCS on further steps that can be taken to keep staff safe on site.\" "

      "text": "The risk of coronavirus transmission from sharing sports equipment is \"lower than once thought\", a study suggests.\nResearchers, led by Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, applied live virus particles to nine types of sports equipment and a control material.\nThey concluded it \"seems unlikely\" that sports balls and accessories are a major cause for transmission.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said last June that cricket balls are a \"natural vector\" of coronavirus.\nThe Strike study found the virus was least transferrable on absorbent materials like cricket gloves and tennis balls, compared with non-porous equipment like racing saddles and rugby balls.\nThe researchers found that there was \"rapid decay\" of viral particles across several types of equipment, and it was \"very difficult\" to transfer live virus back off it.\n\"Close contact\" between players is likely to be a more important mode of spreading the virus than sharing equipment, researchers concluded.\nJames Calder, from Imperial College and Fortius Clinic, said: \"The findings in this study are important not only for elite athletes, but also for community sports and our schools. \n\"It shows that the risk of transmission when sharing sports equipment is lower than was once thought and it highlights the importance of promoting other infection control measures in sports, whilst urging equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may be less likely to retain viable virus.\"\nDuring the study a low dose and a high dose of live coronavirus was applied to a cricket glove, a football, a golf ball, a piece of gym pit foam, a horse saddle, both red and white cricket balls, a rugby ball and a tennis ball, as well as a piece of stainless steel as a control material.\nEach was tested after one minute, five minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 90 minutes, to see whether live virus could be transferred off the equipment at time points that were relevant to sports events.\nWhen the low dose was applied, virus was recoverable on seven of the 10 items tested after one minute, one of the 10 after five minutes - the horse saddle - and none of the 10 after 15 minutes.\nWhen the high dose was applied, virus was recoverable on nine out of the 10 items after one and five minutes - all except the cricket glove - six out of 10 after 30 minutes, and two out of 10 after 90 minutes (the rugby ball and horse saddle).\nHowever, the study - which is awaiting peer review - found that the \"mean recovery of the virus fell across all materials to 0.74% at one minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes\".\nDr Emily Adams, a senior lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: \"Anything that is slightly absorbent like a tennis ball or some of the leathery cricket balls, it's very difficult to transfer any live virus off those. So we think that transmission from sports equipment is probably very low in these cases. \n\"Basically in many sports, like tennis, really the public health intervention should be focused on players and how players interact before a game, during a game and after a game and in transport rather than the sports equipment itself.\"\nThe study found there was a \"noticeable\" difference in the viral recovery of red and white cricket balls.\n\"Despite the white and red cricket ball surfaces both being composed of bovine leather, the different coatings used to finish the surfaces (synthetic grease on the red ball, nitrocellulose on the white ball) had a noticeable effect on viral recovery, with the red ball having a lower level\", it says.\nThe study concludes that, given the differences in virus transfer between the types of sports equipment, the findings could \"direct the engineering of materials that retain and absorb virus\" as opposed to water-repellent materials, where the ability to transfer virus particles back off a surface is greater."

The worse one being at the base of the spine. \n\"This sore had an open wound about the size of a five pence piece. Within this wound I could see what I thought was bone with yellow fluid around it.\"\nMedical records showed when Mrs Jones was admitted to hospital the pressure sores covered an area 18cm by 14cm, but shortly before her death had increased to 50cm by 20cm.\nA pathologist found she died from sepsis due to infected pressure sores, as well as from immobility and dehydration.\nThe inquest also heard evidence from Brithdir care staff who looked after Mrs Jones after she moved to the nursing home in August 2005.\nSandra Rutter said she did not see Mrs Jones's pressure sores when she washed and changed her because they were covered by dressings.\nShe described walking into the room shortly before she was admitted to hospital and noticing the smell.\n\"In entering the room the first thing I noticed was the terrible smell. I can only describe it being a rotting smell or a dead cat,\" she said.\n\"I then saw the pressure sore was the size of a 50p coin and looked to be as deep as the length of my thumb.\n\"It was black and green in colour and looked absolutely terrible.\n\"I asked the nurse how it got to be like that and all I was told it was being treated by someone called Godfrey who was someone who dealt with bed sores.\"\nThe inquest is also looking at the deaths of Stanley James, 89, June Hamer, 71, Stanley Bradford, 76, Edith Evans, 85, and William Hickman, 71.\nA hearing into the death of a seventh resident, Matthew Higgins, 86, will be held following the conclusion of the other six.\nThe hearings are expected to last until March."

      "tags": "Internet fraud",
      "text": "Romance fraud - scamming someone out of money by pretending to want a relationship - has been on the rise during lockdown.\nAccording to UK Finance, there was a 20% increase in bank transfer fraud linked to romance scams in 2020 compared to 2019.\nAnd \u00a368m was lost to such scams in 2020, said the UK's Action Fraud - another increase on the previous year.\nOrganisations warned people to be vigilant ahead of Valentine's Day.\nThe advice suggests:\nIn both 2019 and 2020, the amount of money lost to romance fraud outstripped that stolen by online shopping fraud, according to Action Fraud, which is the main reporting body in the UK. \nIn 2020, online shopping and auction fraud accounted for \u00a363m compared to \u00a368m for dating scams.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has added to the problem.\n\"The national lockdowns, and other restrictions on our social lives, implemented because of the coronavirus outbreak, have meant more people have been seeking companionship online and this has undoubtedly affected the number of reports we have seen,\" said Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud.\n\"Romance scams can leave customers out of love and out of pocket,\" added Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at trade association UK Finance.\nVictims of romance scams lose money via money transfers, and sending fraudsters gift cards and vouchers or presents such as phones and laptops. Some even provide access to their bank account or bank card.\nFraudsters can be very convincing, using emotive language and stories to manipulate people, for instance saying they need money for medical bills.\nAnd increasingly, victims are at risk of prosecution as well as having their bank account emptied - as it is revealed that some scammers are now asking them to unwittingly launder money for criminal gangs.\nABC News reported on an Australian woman who thought she was falling in love with a US army officer but ended up laundering A$150,000 (\u00a383,000) for such a gang.\nAccording to data from Lloyds Bank, people aged 55 to 64 are particularly at risk.\nLike Anna (not her real name) who is in her 50s and a widow: she became prey to her scammer \u2013 who called himself Tim \u2013 after meeting him on a dating website, initially using its chat facility before switching to WhatsApp. \nAfter a few weeks, Tim told Anna he was travelling to Romania to work on a transport project, and asked her to send money. First he asked for small amounts, and then larger ones, eventually defrauding her of \u00a3320,000.\nRomance fraud often starts on online dating websites but quickly switches to social media or old-fashioned texting, so there is no evidence of the scam.\nSometimes the scammer is more subtle than just asking for money, seeking instead to garner personal information, which can later be used to commit identity fraud.\nMany victims do not report romance scams because they are embarrassed or ashamed. But for those who do, there is some recourse.  In 2019 banks agreed to a voluntary code which said that if someone \"has taken reasonable care and has any element of vulnerability\" they are more likely to receive a refund.\nIn Anna's case for example, she was able to recover half of what she lost."

      "text": "Travellers having to stay in quarantine hotels in England will be charged \u00a31,750 for their stay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced.\nThe measures, which come into force on Monday, apply to UK and Irish residents returning from 33 red list countries.\nThose who fail to quarantine in a government-sanctioned hotel for 10 days face fines of up to \u00a310,000.\nMeanwhile, all travellers arriving into Scotland from abroad by air will have to go into quarantine hotels. \nPeople travelling from red list countries to Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to book and pay for quarantine in England, as neither destination currently has any direct international flights.\nTravellers arriving into England who lie on their passenger locator forms about visiting a red list country face a fine of \u00a310,000 or up to 10 years in jail.\nIt comes as the UK reported another 12,364 confirmed cases of coronavirus and a further 1,052 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - bringing that total to 113,850. More than 12.6 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine.\nDelivering a statement in the Commons, Mr Hancock said 16 hotels have been contracted for the programme, with 4,600 rooms secured.\nThe health secretary also confirmed a new \"enhanced testing\" regime for all travellers arriving into the UK would begin on Monday, with two tests required during the quarantine process.\nThey will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The tests, conducted by NHS Test and Trace, will cost travellers \u00a3210.\n\"People who flout these rules are putting us all at risk,\" the health secretary told MPs.\nAirlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said.\nThe penalties include a \u00a31,000 fine for travellers who fail to take mandatory tests and a \u00a32,000 fine for failing to take the second mandatory test - along with a 14-day extension to quarantine.\nFailing to quarantine in a designated hotel carries a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nAsked when the travel rules would be relaxed, Mr Hancock said: \"We want to exit from this into a system of safe international travel as soon as practicable and as soon as is safe.\"\nPassengers required to stay in a quarantine hotel will need to reserve a room online in advance using a booking system that opens on Thursday.\nThe \u00a31,750 fee for an individual includes the hotel, the cost of transport and testing. The additional rate for one extra adult or a child aged over 12 is \u00a3650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is \u00a3325.\nThese travellers will only be allowed to enter the UK through a \"small number of ports that currently account for the vast majority of passenger arrivals\", Mr Hancock added.\nResponding to Mr Hancock's statement, Labour's shadow health secretary said the public wanted the government to \"go further\" on border quarantine measures.\nJonathan Ashworth told the Commons: \"Our first line of defence is surely to do everything we can to stop (new variants) arising in the first place. That means securing our borders to isolate new variants as they come in. \n\"He's announced a detailed package today but he hasn't announced comprehensive quarantine controls at the borders.\"\nMr Hancock later said the red list was kept \"under review\". \nAnnouncing Scotland's tougher measures, which apply to arrivals from all countries, Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the \"targeted, reactive approach\" of the UK government was \"no longer sufficient\" to deal with the threat from coronavirus.\nWelsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said he also wanted to see \"a stronger set of defences at our borders\" and said the UK government's measures were \"the bare minimum of what needs to be done\".\nEnforcement fines and prison sentences over quarantine breaches are still \"under review\" in Wales. A Welsh government spokesperson also said the country was working to determine when it will need its own quarantine hotels, if the red list expands or if international flights resume. \nAlthough the 4,600 rooms secured so far in England would only allow for around one Boeing 747's worth of passengers per day, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said discussions were under way to add more capacity. \nShe told BBC Radio 4's World at One that separate security teams contracted by the government would be responsible for enforcing the quarantine, while hotel staff focused on giving people the \"best possible experience in what are very difficult circumstances\".\nThe \u00a31,750 fee includes three meals, tea, coffee and water, Ms Nicholls said, but other items will be available at an extra cost through room service.\nTravellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nThis test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to \u00a3500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks.\nThey must also provide contact details and their UK address. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate. \nAll travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK.\nThe \"test to release scheme\" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - will remain under the new testing rules.\nPassengers will be expected to use the gold-standard and more expensive PCR tests.\nLockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. These are the same as the \"reasonable excuses\" for domestic travel, including:\nPeople leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure.\nThe new measures come after England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, warned it was too soon to say to what extent people could begin to start planning summer holidays.\nSpeaking at Monday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing, he said: \"The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point,\" he said.\n\"I can't give people a proper answer at this point because we don't yet have the data. It is just too early to say.\"\nAfter the announcement of the travel rules, aimed at preventing the spread of new variants of coronavirus, government advisers designated another \"variant of concern\" - a version of the virus which was revealed last week to have been found in Bristol.\nIt's not surprising that officials are adding this new version of coronavirus to their \"variants of concern\" list. \nTargeted testing is already under way to spot any new cases linked to the 21 that have already been found, mostly in the south west of England.\nThis new incarnation of the virus is the Kent variant \"plus\". It has the same N501Y mutation as the one that triggered lockdown - a genetic change that scientists say lets the virus spread more easily. But it also has an extra mutation called E484K.\nE484K is what experts are worried about for vaccine efficacy. It is also seen in the South Africa and Brazil variants of concern. \nA cluster of another variant in Liverpool is different again. It has got the E484K mutation but is an iteration of an earlier version of the pandemic virus rather than the Kent one.\nInevitably, more variants will continue to emerge. The challenge is to make sure vaccines are a good match to keep us ahead in this race against the virus. \nHave you recently travelled into the UK? What was your experience at the UK border?"

      "tags": "Companies,Alcohol,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Restaurants,Pubs",
      "text": "Beer and pub sector leaders are pressing the government to give them a reopening date.\nThe industry is desperate to get back to business after repeated warnings many pubs will not survive.\nThe British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) is asking the government for a clear timeline and a \"roadmap to recovery\".\nThe government insists that it has a plan for re-opening the economy which it will reveal after 22 February.\nThe BBPA said trading restrictions and lockdowns knocked sales by 56% - worth \u00a37.8bn - last year. \nIn the first lockdown in the second quarter of the year, beer sales plummeted by 96%, it said. Even during the summer, which saw the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and a temporary VAT cut on food and soft drinks, pub beer sales fell 27%.\nThe BBPA said that unless pubs received more assistance, even once they were allowed to reopen with far fewer restrictions, thousands would fail and be lost for good as many had built up substantial debts during the pandemic. \nIts proposed roadmap states that, post-vaccination of the most vulnerable, pubs must reopen in unison with non-essential retail and other parts of the hospitality sector.\nIt also says mandatory trading restrictions - such as alcoholic drinks served only with a substantial meal, no mixed households and the 10pm curfew - should be removed when pubs reopen in a timely way. \nFinancially, it is pressing for an extension to the VAT cut and business rates holiday, as well as a significant beer duty cut.\n\"There's been a real lack of clarity,\" said Dianne Irving, who manages three pubs in Carlisle. \"It's just really, really difficult to know where we are and where we are going.\"\n\"It's very difficult to plan.\" Beyond March, things will be \"very difficult, financially,\" she said.\nAny kind of restrictions make her pubs expensive to run, she said.\nUnder Tier 1 - the mildest of restrictions - two of her pubs were only breaking even, with her city-centre venue making a loss, she said. \nPhilip Whitehead, chairman of the British Beer & Pub Association,  urged the government \"to provide clarity to our sector on when it can expect to fully reopen\".\nHe added: \"After nearly a whole year under forced closure, or open but under severe restrictions, pub trade has been decimated and sales of beer in pubs have plummeted . Furthermore, due to their revenue falling off a cliff in 2020, pubs are holding debt and have little to no cash left. \n\"We need the government to continue to provide financial support for pubs when they reopen to bridge the gap to full recovery.\nNick Mackenzie, boss of brewer and pub giant Greene King, said the industry needed \"a clear plan for reopening. without complex and unjustified restrictions which would make it unviable to open\".\nHe added that without additional support, \"there is a real risk of more viable businesses closing their doors in the weeks and months ahead\". \nMark Davies, boss of Hawthorn, the Community Pub Company with over 700 pubs said: \"I cannot emphasise enough how important it is that the government recognises the role that pubs play in so many communities around the UK and that pubs are part of the fabric of our society. \n\"It is therefore crucial that immediate financial support is secured for the pub sector with business rates and VAT an urgent priority.\"\nA Government spokesperson said: \"We will set out our plan for reopening schools and, gradually, the economy in the week of 22 February. Ministers regularly engage with the sector to understand their concerns and discuss how the sector can restart when it is safe to do so.\n \"We have put in place one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth \u00a3280 billion. This includes a new one-off grant worth up to \u00a39,000, VAT relief, various loan schemes, a business rates holiday as well as the extended furlough scheme.\""

      "text": "Scotland's transport secretary says he is pressing the UK government to close a loophole which could allow travellers to avoid new Covid quarantine rules.\nMichael Matheson told BBC Scotland the current UK arrangements for enforced isolation in hotels were \"inadequate\".\nNew UK quarantine rules only apply to people arriving from 33 countries deemed \"high risk\", but Scotland's apply to all international travellers.\nThere are fears traveller could avoid the rules by flying into England first.\nEveryone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days at a cost of \u00a31,750.\nThe Scottish government has block-booked rooms at six hotels near Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.\nMr Matheson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme he believed there should be a \"comprehensive system\" across the UK on managed isolation to reduce the risk of importing variants of Covid-19.\n\"Our preferred option would be for individuals to be required to self-isolate at the point of entry into the UK, rather than travelling from one part of the UK to self-isolate when they get into Scotland or Northern Ireland or any other part of the UK,\" he said.\n\"[The UK government] want to continue to take a targeted approach on the way in which individuals enter into ports of entry in England.\n\"Our view is that remains inadequate in order to prevent the risk of new variants entering into the country and that is why we we're continuing to pursue and press the UK government to listen to the clinical advice and expert opinion from the Joint Biosecurity Centre that the existing system operating isn't adequate.\"\nAsked if Scotland would introduce controls on the border with England to ensure people travelling to Scotland via an English airport were complying, Mr Matheson said the Scottish government was looking at a \"range of measures\".\nThe \u00a31,750 cost of the stay in managed quarantine will have to be paid for by the passengers themselves.\nThe charge includes mandatory Covid tests on day two and day eight following arrival for one person - any additional travellers will incur supplemental costs. \nAnyone who breaches the measures could face criminal charges including culpable and reckless conduct.\nMr Matheson told the BBC that about 1,600 people travelled to Scotland from abroad last week.\n\"If you take out those who would be subject to an exemption, we estimate there would be the need for potentially around 1,200 individuals to self-isolate in a managed quarantine facility,\" he said.\n\"One of the things that may happen as a result of the policy we have taken forward, is that some of the airlines may choose to draw back on their international flights into Scotland.\n\"And there is some indication that the airlines may choose to cancel their flights coming into Scotland next week as a result of the managed isolation provision we have put in place, on the basis that they believe the demand for those flights is going to drop off dramatically as a result.\"\nThe oil and gas industry has said the 10-day quarantines could have a massive impact on business.\nTrevor Stapleton, from industry body Oil and Gas UK said: \"Given that they are doing critical roles and that the rotas have been planned a good year in advance, to suddenly say that that individual cannot go offshore - and therefore they have to quarantine for 10 days - would have a couple of outcomes.\n\"If they are doing a critical role then either they... have to stay on the installation for a further 10 days, and if that's not possible, if the person has to come back, then you are looking quite seriously at whether you can continue to operate that installation.\"\nMr Matheson said that there would be \"some level of exemptions\" provided for some passengers.\n\"We're looking at particular aspects around the oil and gas sector and also around areas such as defence and areas of critical infrastructure as well,\" he added.\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs on Tuesday that new UK border measures built on \"touch actions\" already taken to prevent news variants of Covid-19 entering the country.\nHe also said that the UK government was working on \"similarly tough schemes with the devolved administrations\"."

      "text": "Covid restrictions have made this year much tougher for young people already dealing with a cancer diagnosis. \nSophie, like many other young cancer patients, has had to attend appointments and treatments alone, with no family or friends at her side. \n\"My mum was crying, I was crying and she had to leave me at the door and drive off,\" the 24-year-old says.\nLast year, she was told she would need hospital treatment for five weeks, 70 miles away from home.  \n\"We had to travel to Manchester so my mum drove me,\" Sophie says.\n\"We got to the door and I had my suitcase - I was struggling alone with this suitcase.\n\"My mum was terrified leaving me, because she was probably thinking, 'I can't be there to comfort her,' and as well, if things go wrong, would she be walking back out of the hospital?\" \nRules on who can visit have varied at different hospitals throughout the pandemic but official NHS England advice is that young cancer patients should be able to have friends and family supporting them at appointments in a Covid-safe way.\nMikaela, 18, from Frome, needed treatment for cancer last March. \nShe had three weeks of radiotherapy, fertility treatment to freeze her eggs and a biopsy operation.  \nMikaela's mother was able to go with her for a couple of chemotherapy sessions - but lockdown rules changed that.\nAnd Mikaela had to attend appointments - and have a stem-cell transplant - alone. \nKathryn, 22, from Gwernaffield, in Flintshire, who has Hodgkin lymphoma, says the prospect of being isolated in hospital for up to six weeks without any of her family being there is difficult to comprehend. \n\"It's going to be extremely difficult going from shielding at home with my mum, dad and my brother around to not having my family there in person,\" she says.\n\"I know from friends going through similar things that having family there is really important - and I won't have that at all.\" \nAn NHS England spokesperson said it was \"absolutely clear that young cancer patients should be able to have friends and family supporting them at appointments, which is why the national guidance is explicit that this should be offered, in a Covid-safe way.\" \n\"It is important that families know cancer treatment is continuing across the country, so that young people can come forward for the care they need, with the right support.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care in England said: \"This pandemic is a uniquely challenging time, and we know it is particularly difficult for people who are suffering with a critical illness.\n\"The health, safety and wellbeing of patients is our top priority and we are committed to supporting the needs of patients by taking a compassionate approach that makes hospital visits possible, whilst managing the risk of infection. \n\"To make sure patients are given the care and support they need, our current guidance recommends that patients can be accompanied where appropriate and necessary, providing it happens in a Covid-secure way. \"\nTwo cancer charities - Teenage Cancer Trust and Clic Sargent - have written a letter to cancer ministers in the UK's four nations to highlight the issue. \nDr Louise Soanes, from Teenage Cancer Trust, said: \"Having cancer treatment, receiving a diagnosis or learning or hearing how you're responding to treatment can be for many a scary and isolating experience. \n\"Young people then need to share often very complex information - some of which they might be still processing - with family members, friends or a partner.  \n\"That's why we want to dispel the disparity so all young people, where safe and possible, have that crucial loved one with them and a hand to hold, particularly during some of the most difficult times of their life.\" "

      "text": "A maximum 10-year jail term for lying about recent travel history has been defended by the government.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the British public \"would expect pretty strong action\" and the maximum sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime.\nIt was criticised by former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption who said lower tariffs exist for sex offences.\nFrom Monday, people arriving in England from \"red list\" countries must isolate for 10 days in hotels, costing \u00a31,750.\nIt follows concerns that existing vaccines being rolled out in the UK may struggle to control new virus variants identified around the world.\nMeanwhile, Mr Shapps said people should not be booking holidays either in the UK or abroad, and that it was \"too soon\" for sun-seekers to plan getaways.\n\"People shouldn't be booking holidays right now - not domestically or internationally,\" he told the Today programme, prompting the travel industry to warn of another lost summer.\nIt comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the public would need to \"get used to the idea of vaccinating and then re-vaccinating in the autumn\" due to new variants.\nAnd, speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, he said the hotel quarantine plan was \"measured\" and \"proportionate\".\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Sumption accused Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who announced the latest measures - of losing his connection with reality.\n\"Ten years is the maximum sentence for threats to kill, non-fatal poisoning or indecent assault,\" he wrote. \n\"Does Mr Hancock really think that non-disclosure of a visit to Portugal is worse than the large number of violent firearms offences or sexual offences involving minors, for which the maximum is seven years?\"\nFormer Tory MP and ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve said the 10-year penalty was \"a mistake\", \"exaggerated\" and \"entirely disproportionate\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The reality is that nobody would get such a sentence anyway, the courts are simply not going to impose it. \n\"Now I recognise that the government has to put down strict rules and needs to have penalties to enforce them.\n\"But to suggest that a 10-year sentence is going to result from a false declaration on a form on landing at Heathrow Airport is, I think, a mistake because it is exaggerated, it is not going to happen.\"\nFailing to quarantine in a designated hotel after arriving from a \"red list\" country will carry a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nThe 10-year jail term would be the maximum penalty for anyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in by travellers when they arrive in the UK.\nNew border measures also require international arrivals to pay for additional tests during their quarantine period.\nDowning Street said MPs will not be asked to vote on the plans as the government will be including the restrictions under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.\nAsked about harsh penalties attached to the new measures, Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast those who are fined as much as \u00a310,000 would have to \"go out of their way to lie and cheat\" the new system.\nMr Shapps said the 10-year maximum jail term reflected the \"serious\" nature of the offence.\n\"I think the British public would expect pretty strong action\" for those who seek to evade hotel quarantine, he said.\nAround 1,300 people a week are arriving into the UK from the 33 red list countries - including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa - at the moment, Mr Shapps said.\nInternational travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed.\nMr Shapps confirmed ministers were speaking to other governments about a potential \"international system\" to check whether travellers have been vaccinated - or tested for - coronavirus.\nDowning Street said Mr Johnson will outline a \"roadmap\" for easing the current national restrictions in the week of 22 February.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told a BBC News Your Questions special it was \"certainly plausible\" other countries may insist visitors are vaccinated.\nBut he stressed mandatory vaccination has never been a policy in the UK before and described confidence in jabs among the public as \"super high\".\nAirlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said.\nThe penalties also include a \u00a31,000 fine for travellers who fail to take the new mandatory tests and a \u00a32,000 fine for failing to take the second mandatory test - along with a 14-day extension to quarantine.\nAsked when the travel rules would be relaxed, Mr Hancock said: \"We want to exit from this into a system of safe international travel as soon as practicable and as soon as is safe.\"\nThe Scottish government said it would go further than England's measures and require everyone arriving by air to isolate in hotels for 10 days.\nThe Institute for Government think tank said different hotel quarantine rules across the UK add \"another layer of complexity\" as it warned of \"big gaps\" in the policy.\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the delay in introducing hotel quarantine and said research showed the UK was lagging behind other nations when it came to border security.\nAll travellers arriving in the UK are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test and must self-isolate for 10 days.\nThis negative test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to \u00a3500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks.\nThey must also provide contact details and their UK address. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate. \nA \"test to release scheme\" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - remains under the new testing rules.\nPassengers will be expected to use the gold-standard, and more expensive, PCR tests.\nPeople leaving England will soon have to declare their reasons for travel prior to departure.\nHave you recently travelled into the UK?

      "text": "There are \"encouraging signs\" coronavirus cases in Wales are falling, the head of NHS Wales has said.\nChief Executive Andrew Goodall said rates of the virus in the community were \"significantly down\" from where they were in December.\nOver a similar period the number of hospital patients with Covid has fallen by about a quarter.\nOffice for National Statistics (ONS) figures show a second week of falling death rates in Wales.\nMeanwhile, the latest Public Health Wales (PHW) figures showed the number of cases per 100,000 people in Wales had fallen to 111.4. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Goodall said: \"Our community prevalence rates are down, they are down very significantly from where we were in December.\n\"We see the positivity rates and the reproduction values are well down within Wales now.\n\"Just over the last two or three weeks or so the number of patients in hospitals for coronavirus has actually reduced by about a quarter.\"\nHowever, he cautioned there were still more than 2,000 patients in hospital with the virus.\n\"That is going to still take us some time I think to reduce those to what we would say would be close to normal levels,\" he said.\nAt the Welsh Government press briefing, Dr Goodall added the Welsh NHS was still in a \"precarious\" position, with the number of people in critical care - with other conditions as well as Covid - running over capacity. \n\"There are still nearly 50% more patients with coronavirus in hospital beds than at the peak of the first wave in April.\"\nHe added 202 people were in field hospital beds. \nDr Giri Shankar, from PHW, also sounded a note of caution, particularly for north Wales.\nHe said: \"Although the data currently shows all-Wales numbers of cases are reducing and that the incidence is now below 120 cases per 100,000 population, the rates in some areas - particularly in north Wales - are still at nearly double that, and there have been small increases in others.\n\"It is encouraging to see that the numbers of people being treated for coronavirus in our hospitals is reducing, [but] there are still a large number of people who are extremely ill, which means that the pressure on services is still very high.\"\nBut Dr Goodall also warned the rate of critical care deaths in hospital could be 25% more in the second wave due to the number of patients being admitted with Covid.\n\"I think what is different in the second wave, that it has just been a higher volume and that is the thing that has caused the pressure right across our system.\n\"And it will mean sadly in areas like critical care, although the data will say that some of the outcomes feel the same [as the first wave], we would have ended up sadly with 25% more deaths in a critical care environment,\" said Dr Goodall.\n\"We would expect a normal emergency medical patient to stay for perhaps between five to seven days, a typical coronavirus patient coming in to our hospitals will be there for three times longer than that.\"\n\"There will be ongoing problems with patients who need to be cared for after they've been discharged, but also those that will still need to receive care in the community.\"\nAsked about the long-effect on waiting lists, Dr Goodall said: \"We've had to prioritise the immediate problems facing us to ensure that the NHS has the resilience to be able to respond.\n\"It will take us some time, maybe even some years, to work our way through some of the pressures that we've had.\nHowever he said the pandemic was a chance to \"reset\" the way patients in hospitals and community settings received cared as there had been so much \"transformation\" in delivery during the pandemic."

      "text": "Beer and pub sector leaders are pressing the government to give them a reopening date.\nThe industry is desperate to get back to business after repeated warnings many pubs will not survive.\nThe British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) is asking the government for a clear timeline and a \"roadmap to recovery\".\nThe government insists that it has a plan for re-opening the economy which it will reveal after 22 February.\nThe BBPA said trading restrictions and lockdowns knocked sales by 56% - worth \u00a37.8bn - last year. \nIn the first lockdown in the second quarter of the year, beer sales plummeted by 96%, it said. Even during the summer, which saw the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and a temporary VAT cut on food and soft drinks, pub beer sales fell 27%.\nThe BBPA said that unless pubs received more assistance, even once they were allowed to reopen with far fewer restrictions, thousands would fail and be lost for good as many had built up substantial debts during the pandemic. \nIts proposed roadmap states that, post-vaccination of the most vulnerable, pubs must reopen in unison with non-essential retail and other parts of the hospitality sector.\nIt also says mandatory trading restrictions - such as alcoholic drinks served only with a substantial meal, no mixed households and the 10pm curfew - should be removed when pubs reopen in a timely way. \nFinancially, it is pressing for an extension to the VAT cut and business rates holiday, as well as a significant beer duty cut.\n\"There's been a real lack of clarity,\" said Dianne Irving, who manages three pubs in Carlisle. \"It's just really, really difficult to know where we are and where we are going.\"\n\"It's very difficult to plan.\" Beyond March, things will be \"very difficult, financially,\" she said.\nAny kind of restrictions make her pubs expensive to run, she said.\nUnder Tier 1 - the mildest of restrictions - two of her pubs were only breaking even, with her city-centre venue making a loss, she said. \nPhilip Whitehead, chairman of the British Beer & Pub Association,  urged the government \"to provide clarity to our sector on when it can expect to fully reopen\".\nHe added: \"After nearly a whole year under forced closure, or open but under severe restrictions, pub trade has been decimated and sales of beer in pubs have plummeted . Furthermore, due to their revenue falling off a cliff in 2020, pubs are holding debt and have little to no cash left. \n\"We need the government to continue to provide financial support for pubs when they reopen to bridge the gap to full recovery.\nNick Mackenzie, boss of brewer and pub giant Greene King, said the industry needed \"a clear plan for reopening. without complex and unjustified restrictions which would make it unviable to open\".\nHe added that without additional support, \"there is a real risk of more viable businesses closing their doors in the weeks and months ahead\". \nMark Davies, boss of Hawthorn, the Community Pub Company with over 700 pubs said: \"I cannot emphasise enough how important it is that the government recognises the role that pubs play in so many communities around the UK and that pubs are part of the fabric of our society. \n\"It is therefore crucial that immediate financial support is secured for the pub sector with business rates and VAT an urgent priority.\"\nA Government spokesperson said: \"We will set out our plan for reopening schools and, gradually, the economy in the week of 22 February. Ministers regularly engage with the sector to understand their concerns and discuss how the sector can restart when it is safe to do so.\n \"We have put in place one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth \u00a3280 billion. This includes a new one-off grant worth up to \u00a39,000, VAT relief, various loan schemes, a business rates holiday as well as the extended furlough scheme.\""

      "text": "Transport Secretary Grant Shapps' call for people to stop making summer holiday plans has been branded \"puerile and nonsensical\" by a senior travel industry professional.\n\"We're talking about the end of May or June, which is a long way off,\" said Sue Ockwell of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO).\nMr Shapps said there was too much uncertainty because of Covid.\nBut Ms Ockwell said booking breaks gave hope to holidaymakers and the industry.\n\"It's something for people to look forward to and to keep travel companies going,\" she told the BBC.\nEarlier, Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Please don't go ahead and book holidays. I simply don't know the answer to the question of where we'll be up to this summer.\n\"It's too early to give that information. The best advice to people is: do nothing at this stage.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson later said it was \"just too early for people to be certain about what we'll be able to do this summer\".\nHe added that he understood \"why people want to make plans now, but we're just going to have to be a little bit more patient\".\nMr Shapps' comments have been seen by many in the travel sector as dealing a blow to hopes of a swift recovery for tourism.\nFor Ms Ockwell, they are symptomatic of a government that has failed to listen to her and her colleagues.\n\"It's highly frustrating. The government doesn't compare notes with anyone in the travel industry,\" she said. \"They could save getting a lot of egg on their faces if they did.\"\nAITO represents about 120 specialist and independent tour operators in the UK. \nMs Ockwell said the industry understood \"the scale of the challenges\" facing the government over coronavirus, but added that tourism brought great benefits to the UK economy and was in need of sector-specific help.\n\"Holidays bring in a lot of money, holidays employ a lot of people and they're good for us,\" she said.\n\"We just want to be allowed to trade. That's all we're asking,\" she added.\n\"We're not forcing people to make bookings. We want people to be allowed to make their own common-sense judgements.\"\nOther travel industry figures have echoed Ms Ockwell's dismay.\nBrian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: \"Airlines are drowning but, rather than throwing us a life raft, the transport secretary has just thrown a bucket of cold water at us.\"\nAnd trade organisation Abta said waiting until the UK's vaccination programme was completed before allowing people to travel abroad meant \"we'll lose another summer season to the pandemic\".\nSeveral big travel companies, including Tui and Ryanair, have said they expect to see a strong rebound in bookings this summer.\nRyanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC he remained \"optimistic\" that British people would be allowed to travel from May onwards.\n\"Many companies will not see their way through next winter if we go through a second summer of no bookings,\" he added."

Two of these are civil servants and the other a special adviser.\nHe said the snappers were \"a government resource\" and the most recent recruit was working across a range of departments, taking photos of cabinet ministers undertaking official government business.\n\"They document the work not just of the prime minister but of the whole cabinet,\" he said, adding that their pictures were made available to the media free of charge.\nNo 10's flickr album includes recent images of the PM working in the Cabinet Room in No 10, Home Secretary Priti Patel visiting a vaccination centre and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab meeting an Israeli minister.\nAmong this rather dry pictorial record of day-to-day government activities, there were four more unusual images of Dilyn frolicking in a snowy No 10 garden whilst chewing a stick.\nNo 10 later removed one of the photos after being told the contact details for Carrie Symonds, the PM's fiancee, could be seen on Dilyn's collar.  \nDilyn arrived in Downing Street shortly after the couple took up residence in July 2019. The Jack Russell-cross, now nearly two years old, was rescued after being abandoned by puppy farmers.\nHe became a regular feature on the 2019 election campaign trail when Ms Symonds took him canvassing. \nNo 10's Flickr album contains more than 10,000 images dating back to May 2010, when David Cameron became prime minister and hosted the famous \"Rose Garden\" press conference with then deputy Nick Clegg.

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,Nancy Pelosi,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Former US President Donald Trump is being put on trial by lawmakers for allegedly inciting a riot at the US Capitol.\nLast month Mr Trump became the first president in US history to be charged with misconduct - or impeached - twice by the lower chamber of Congress.\nRepublicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to pass an article of impeachment that accused Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\".\nThe article alleged that Mr Trump had made false allegations of election fraud and encouraged his supporters to storm Congress on 6 January.\nNow a trial is being held in the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate, which will decide whether to convict or clear Mr Trump of the charge.\nThis is an unprecedented moment for the US, which has never put an impeached president on trial after they have left office.\nSo, what can we expect?\nThe trial in the Senate is political, rather than criminal. A vote will be held at the end of the trial to determine whether Mr Trump is guilty of the charge.\nA two-thirds majority of the 100-member Senate must back a guilty verdict to convict Mr Trump.\nIf Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again.\nThe trial opened on Tuesday with a four-hour debate on whether the proceedings were unconstitutional because Mr Trump is no longer president. A 56-44 majority then voted in favour of continuing, with six Republicans backing the measure. \nEach side will then be given 16 hours in total to make their arguments, and this will be limited to eight hours in any one day. \nThere will be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are said to favour a speedy trial, amid an ongoing effort to get President Joe Biden's Covid-19 relief plan approved. \nIt is thought a vote on a conviction could come as early as Monday if no witnesses are called.\nDemocrats prosecuting the case opened the proceedings by showing a dramatic video montage of Mr Trump's 6 January speech and the deadly rioting by some of his supporters.\n\"That's a high crime and misdemeanour,\" Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland - who is leading the case - said of the footage. \"If that's not an impeachable offence, then there's no such thing.\"\nThey say Mr Trump is \"personally responsible\" for the riot and must be convicted.\nAccording to a pre-trial legal brief, they will say his repeated refusal to concede the election led to an \"incitement of insurrection against the republic he swore to protect\".\nMr Trump's \"statements turned his 'wild' rally on 6 January into a powder keg waiting to blow\", they will argue.\nAlthough he is no longer in office, Mr Trump \"must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last\", Democrats argue.\nThey have called for Mr Trump to be disqualified from ever running for office again.\nOn the opening day, his defence lawyers argued unsuccessfully that it was unconstitutional to put a private citizen through the impeachment process. \nDefence lawyer David Schoen said the Democrats were using \"the guise of impeachment as a tool to disenfranchise\" those who support Donald Trump.\nHis lawyers are now likely to change tack and argue that Mr Trump's supporters stormed Congress of their own accord. \nAccording to their own pre-trial brief, they will argue that Mr Trump's pre-riot remarks did not amount to incitement. \nThe former president's call to \"fight\" was not meant to be taken literally, they say.\n\"To characterise this statement alone as 'incitement to insurrection' is to ignore, wholesale, the remainder of Mr Trump's speech that day, including his call for his supporters to 'peacefully' making their 'voices heard,'\" they add.\nMoreover, FBI documents had shown that the riot was planned days in advance, the lawyers said.\nIt is never happened before, so it is untested and the US Constitution does not say.\nImpeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon were ended when he quit in 1974.\nSo Mr Trump could take his case to the Supreme Court, claiming his trial was unconstitutional.\nSome lower ranked officials have been impeached after leaving office.\nThat is certainly what prosecutors wanted. Last week, they sent a letter inviting him to testify under oath \"at a mutually convenient time and place\".\nThe prosecution team suggested that they would cite Mr Trump's silence as further proof that their allegations were true.\nWithin hours, however, the former president's lawyers had rejected the request as a publicity stunt.\nThey made clear he would not testify voluntarily. The prosecutors do have the power to issue a subpoena - or an order to compel him to appear in court to testify - but that is considered unlikely.\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Mr Trump, but will not do so again.\nDemocratic Senator Patrick Leahy - third in the line of presidential succession - is presiding over the trial instead.\nProsecuting the case are nine House Democrats, known as the impeachment managers.\nMr Trump is being represented by two attorneys - Bruce Castor and David Schoen.\nAll 100 US senators have been sworn in as jurors in the trial.\nDemocrats only hold half the 100 seats so they would require 17 Republicans to vote against someone from their own party.\nThat is a high bar for a party that has largely remained publicly loyal to Mr Trump.\nTen Republicans in the House supported impeachment and a handful of senators have indicated they are open to it.\nBut Tuesday's vote implied loyalty toward the former president in his party remained high enough to avoid a conviction.\nIf he is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers must hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024.\nThis could be the biggest consequence of this impeachment.\nIf he is convicted, a simple majority of senators would be needed to block Mr Trump from holding \"any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States\".\nSo 50 senators plus a casting vote from Vice-President Kamala Harris would be enough to damn Mr Trump's hopes of political power.\nThis could be appealing to Republicans hoping to run for president in the future and those who want Mr Trump out of the party.\nThere has been talk of Mr Trump losing benefits granted to his predecessors under the 1958 Former Presidents Act, which include a pension and health insurance, and potentially a lifetime security detail at taxpayers' expense. \nHowever, Mr Trump is likely to keep these benefits if he is convicted after leaving office.\nThat was over his dealings with Ukraine, although he denied any wrongdoing.\nHe was accused of pressing the country's leader to open an investigation into Mr Biden, then his emerging rival for the White House, and his son Hunter.\nMr Trump appeared to use military aid as leverage. He was impeached by the House and cleared by the then Republican-controlled Senate."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Elderly people,Dementia,Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Relatives of care home residents are telling the Scottish government it is time to let them visit their loved ones.\nAfter almost 11 months, many are still only seeing vulnerable relatives through windows or outside, if at all.\nThe Scottish government says new guidelines on visiting are \"imminent\".\nBut MSPs are due to consider a petition on Wednesday calling for one designated visitor per care home resident to be allowed.\nNational Records of Scotland statistics show that since restrictions were first introduced in March 2020, 14,273 residents have died inside Scottish care homes. \nCovid has been a factor in one in five of the deaths but relatives fear many more have been caused by the isolation their loved ones have felt over the past year with many simply just giving up.\nWith almost all care home residents having had their first vaccine dose, families are hoping for good news on visiting.\nElaine Macdonald is one of them.\nShe has seen deterioration in her mum Jean McKay since the start of the pandemic.\nJean, 81, has advanced Alzheimers and has lived in a care home for five years. Until March 2020, Elaine and her sister took her out twice a week.\nSince restrictions were placed on visits, they have only been able to see their mum through a window, and for a short time in the summer they had outdoor visits. \nElaine believes that after almost a year, something better should be possible.\n\"Other groups in society, outside the care home setting, are able to form extended households and bubbles,\" she said.\n\"And here we are in care homes and it is like prison - people are not allowed to see their relatives in a normal way, there is no holding hands and no contact. \n\"It makes me feel frustrated and sad and I am beginning to wonder if we are ever going to get in to see them properly again.\"\nShe added: \"Nobody puts their relative in a care home expecting never to be able to see them again. Nobody would do it, and now I know people who are deciding not to do it.\"\n\"It's time to let people have their relationships with their family members again - this whole situation is inhumane and it has to come to an end.\"\nNatasha Hamilton, from Edinburgh, is desperate to see more of her mum Anne, who has early onset dementia and is in a home in East Kilbride. She started a petition in September to give residents like Anne the right to see at least one caregiving relative, regardless of lockdown or levels.\n\"We are doing it for her,\" she said. \"She would fight to see her children, she would fight to see her husband. We are fighting so mum has the right to see her family. \n\"I find it absolutely awful thinking what is going through her head just now - that those faces she used to know, visiting her all the time, are no longer there. That part hurts me more than me not being able to see my mum. \n\"We have to learn from this so that care home residents are not kept apart from their families for almost a year again. Residents in care homes have to be living, not just existing.\"\nThe petition has more than 92,000 signatures and is to be considered by a committee of MSPs on Wednesday.\nDuring FMQs, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie pressed the first minister for a date on when safe visiting of care homes may be allowed.\nNicola Sturgeon said that new guidance on the matter was being worked on and would be \"published imminently\", but would not commit to a date.\n\"I very much hope we can reach that position soon but just as I have tried to avoid doing in past, I have tried to refrain from giving simplistic or easy answers.\n\"I think that would be wrong and run the risk of giving families falsehoods. I want a date we can have some confidence in. I don't underestimate how deeply traumatic this is.\"\nHundreds of relatives have also been sending letters and posters to their MSPs in the \"Broken Hearts\" campaign to draw attention to the issue.\nNational clinical director Jason Leitch said during Tuesday's coronavirus briefing that Health Secretary Jeane Freeman was finalising new advice.\nHe said: \"New guidance is imminent that will be published shortly, once the cabinet secretary has final meetings with officials. \n\"She has met with the care home relatives group, as have I. It's not just about vaccine, it's protection from outbreaks, it's test and protect, it's staff, it's PPE and it is about what should and could be permitted for families to reconnect after such a long time.\"\nDonald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, which represents the private care sector in Scotland, said everyone involved had been consulted over the new plans.\nHe added that after 11 months there was a realisation that the risk of the virus and the risk of people no longer being in touch and in contact with their families had to be balanced.\nHe said: \"One of the reasons we are all trying to engage is so we don't get a lottery of one company doing it and another not doing it. The reason people are anxious is because of the fear of the  virus. \n\"No care provider wants to keep people apart. Neither do they want the devastation of this virus. \n\"What we are doing is to reduce the fear, increase confidence and make sure visiting can happen indoors as a matter of priority.\""

      "text": "People with Covid in Northern Ireland can now stop self-isolating after five full days, if they have have two negative tests. \nThese rules are also in place in England, where the prime minister has said that there will \"soon be a time\" when self-isolation is not required.\nThe self-isolation period for anyone who develops symptoms or tests positive for Covid is five full days. \nThe day symptoms begin - or you test positive - is day zero. The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately. They don't need to take a PCR test, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so.\nYou can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier than day six. If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Robert Jenrick,UK fire safety",
      "text": "Campaigners have said the government's promise of \u00a33.5bn of extra funding to remove unsafe cladding from England's high-rises is \"too little, too late\".\nThe government said flammable materials would be removed from buildings over 18m high \"at no cost to residents\".\nBut Labour said the \"arbitrary\" height limit could result in financial ruin for many in lower blocks, who would be offered loans to make their home safe.\nAfter 2017's Grenfell disaster, many tower blocks were found to be unsafe.\nThis meant many thousands of flat-owners have since faced huge bills for fire-safety improvements, brought in after the devastating tower block fire when flames spread via combustible cladding, killing 72 people.\nThe Grenfell United campaign group said the latest measures were \"too little, too late\", and it needed the mess dealt with \"once and for all\".\n\"Residents living in unsafe homes will go to bed tonight worrying if their building will qualify or be left out once again. And bereaved and survivors of Grenfell will lay awake fearful that what happened to us could still happen again,\" the group said.\nIn the Commons, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick also announced:\nThe \u00a33.5bn comes on top of \u00a31.6bn in funding that was announced for the removal of unsafe cladding last year.\nMinisters have come under growing pressure to increase the pot as leaseholders have been hit by building improvement costs and soaring insurance costs.\nSome say they have effectively become trapped in their own homes - unable to sell until the work is carried out, yet in danger of bankrupting themselves to meet the costs.\nStephen Squires, who lives in a 22-storey block in Manchester, told the PA Media news agency he and others were \"still stuck in limbo\", even after the announcement.\nThe government had consistently failed to acknowledge the issues were far wider reaching than cladding, he said, and they still did not know whether fire safety defects would be covered by the funding.\nMr Jenrick told MPs that leaseholders in high-rise buildings above 18m, or with six storeys or more, would face no costs for cladding works. \nHe said the risk was \"significantly lower\" for lower-rise blocks of flats. \nHowever, for anyone living with dangerous cladding in such flats, a loan scheme would be set up to protect leaseholders so none of them would pay more than \u00a350 a month for the removal of unsafe cladding.\nIt \"cannot be right the costs fall solely on tax payers\", he said, adding that the government would develop a levy targeted at developers seeking to build certain high-rise buildings in England. \nHe also said a new tax for the UK residential property sector would be introduced from next year, to raise \u00a32bn over a decade and help pay for the removal of cladding.\nMr Jenrick described the action as an \"unprecedented intervention\" without which building owners would simply pass on the costs of remediation work to leaseholders.\n\"That would risk punishing those who have worked hard, who have bought their own home, but through no fault of their own have found themselves caught in an absolutely invidious situation,\" he said.\nThe Home Builders Federation, a trade association for private sector homebuilders, said it supported \"sensible\" solutions for recouping costs and was looking forward to working with the government on an \"equitable\" tax that did not \"threaten housing supply\".\nMatt Browne and Lizzie Bennett are among thousands of flat-owners who discovered in the last year they lived in a dangerous block.\nTheir Birmingham city centre building measures 18.2 metres - so just qualifies for the funding promised today. \nMatt, a 26-year-old video producer, says although he is relieved, he feels \"incredibly sorry\" for those whose homes don't meet that threshold.\n\"[That] could have been ours if our building was one brick lower. That's literally the difference we're talking about,\" he says.\nHe says leaseholders feel \"betrayed\" because the government has said \"multiple times\" they should not pay. \n\"Then all of a sudden today it's like, 'right, leaseholders are going to pay \u00a350 a month,'\" he says.\nThe couple say they have been hit with a \u00a350,000 bill after their block failed an external wall fire review. \nThat covers not only the removal of unsafe cladding, but also works relating to other things found in the review like missing fire cavity barriers. \nMatt is now concerned the government fund only covers the cladding removal. \"There are still costs in there which are going to cost thousands and thousands of pounds, which is money we don't have,\" he says.\nAround 100 miles away in east London, solicitor Peter Tolson lives in a building that also qualifies for the extra cash, but says the announcement \"doesn't make a huge amount of difference\" to him and his fellow residents.\nHe helps run his block's management company, and says they began the initial process to prove their eligibility for the fund last spring. But they haven't received funds, he says.\n\"We're just trying to pass every barrier and get access to the funds, which we're finding harder and harder,\" he adds.\nConservative MP Stephen McPartland, a critic of the government's handling of the cladding crisis, said Mr Jenrick's announcement did not go far enough and the issue was much bigger than the matter of cladding.\n\"The support he has offered does not help most people because people who've got excessive insurance premiums, fire safety defects - that's where the real costs are,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.\n\"Leaseholders are the innocent parties in this. Many people were in primary school when these buildings were constructed and they're now being hit with bills that will be bankrupting them.\"\nLabour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, called the proposals \"an injustice\" that would \"pile financial misery\" on homeowners.\nShe said there were many questions left unanswered, including on \"skyrocketing\" insurance costs, homes potentially remaining \"unsellable\", and the amount leaseholders would be expected to pay. \nThe \"arbitrary 18m-height limit\" could \"mean the difference between a safe home and financial ruin\", she said.\nLabour wants an independent taskforce to be established to take the matter out of politicians' hands and ensure funds are distributed fairly.\nBy Sarah Corker, BBC consumer affairs correspondent\nThe question of who should pay to fix fire safety faults - government, developers, building owners or leaseholders - is at the heart of resolving this crisis. \nWhile cladding campaigners have welcomed the extra government funding, they say an additional \u00a33.5bn is not enough given the scale of the problems. \nTo force the building industry to contribute, the government will introduce a levy on developers which build future high-rises. A move broadly welcomed, but it will take years to build up a pot of money. \nWhat started as a cladding scandal has become a much wider building safety crisis. \nIn the wake of the Grenfell tower tragedy, safety inspections on thousands of high rise blocks have exposed not just dangerous cladding but other fire safety problems including defective insulation, missing fire breaks and timber balconies. \nCurrently there is no government money to fix non-cladding faults.\nRebecca Fairclough, from Manchester Cladiators, which represents 70 tower blocks with fire safety issues in the Greater Manchester area, said funding was needed to cover all building safety issues, not just cladding.\nShe said she was disappointed loans were the only solution on offer to those in buildings under 18m high.\n\"Millions of residents continue to live in dangerous buildings, facing impossible bills and with their mental health deteriorating daily,\" she said. \nNatasha Letchford, a campaigner for the End Our Cladding Scandal group, said the funding was far short of the estimated \u00a315bn bill to fix all the issues.\nShe said as long as there were outstanding bills on properties, they would be worthless and people simply would not want to buy them. \nThe government said the spending funded by the UK-wide tax would be subject to the Barnett formula. This means Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding, which can be spent as the devolved administrations see fit, including on building safety. "

I told her to look up and she read it.\n\"She said 'yeah'.

Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nCare home staff were not given personal protective equipment (PPE) early in the pandemic because the government prioritised the NHS, MPs have said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said care homes received only a fraction of the PPE needed. Between March and July 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care provided NHS trusts with 1.9 billion items of PPE, the equivalent to 80% of estimated need. The adult social care sector was given 331 million items - just 10% of its need. At the same time, about 25,000 patients were discharged to care homes from hospitals without being tested for Covid-19. Last month, our political editor Laura Kuenssberg interviewed a care home owner who said Covid \"hit the home like a missile\" last year.\nThe British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) is asking the government for a clear timeline for reopening and a \"roadmap to recovery\". The BBPA said trading restrictions and lockdowns knocked sales by 56% - worth \u00a37.8bn - last year. \"There's been a real lack of clarity,\" said Dianne Irving, who manages three pubs in Carlisle. \"It's just really, really difficult to know where we are and where we are going.\" Under Tier 1 last year - the mildest of restrictions - two of her pubs were only breaking even, with her city-centre venue making a loss, she said. The government says it has a plan for reopening the economy, which it will reveal after 22 February.\nMeet Dr Sarah Marsh, Argjira Luzha and Becky Leigh - three people fighting Covid-19 at Harrogate Hospital's intensive care unit. They spoke to the BBC's Newsbeat as part of an exclusive 48-hour visit to see what life is like on the NHS frontline.\nEurope's oldest person has survived Covid-19, just days before her 117th birthday. Lucile Randon, a French nun who took the name Sister Andre in 1944, tested positive for coronavirus on 16 January but didn't develop any symptoms. She told local media she \"didn't even realise I had it\". \"She has been very lucky,\" a spokesman for her retirement home said.\nThe BBC has found that \"dangerous\" coronavirus treatments are being sent on chat apps such as WhatsApp, as well as being widely available on social media.

So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\nShortly afterwards a Capitol police officer calls for backup. \n\"They're throwing metal poles at us,\" he says. \"Multiple law-enforcement injuries,\" he adds in a panicked voice. \nCapitol police send an evacuation warning. \nProtesters surge past Capitol police protecting the west steps, the side facing the White House. \nMinutes later, an officer declares there is a riot at the Capitol.  \"We're going to give riot warnings,\" he says. \"We're going to try to get compliance but this is now effectively a riot.\"\nMeanwhile Vice President Mike Pence is continuing to preside over the session. \nSecret Service quickly and suddenly evacuate Mr Pence from the Senate floor. \nThe protesters break through the windows. They push inside, hopping through the broken glass. They then kick open the doors to let others in. Some wear hoods and helmets, some hold cameras or Confederate flags.\nAn immediate recess of the Senate is called. \nA minute later, Officer Eugene Goodman runs to respond to the initial breach. He warns Senator Mitt Romney that the mob is approaching. Mr Romney turns and runs through a capitol hallway to safety. \nThe mob, a floor below them, has already begun to search for the Senate chamber. \nOfficer Goodman makes his way down to the first floor where he encounters the mob. \nHe lures the armed rioters away from the upper chamber. Many of these individuals have been calling for Mr Pence to be hanged.\nBy that point, the rioters are \"within 100ft\" (30m) of Mr Pence and a foot away from one of the doors to the chamber. Many senators are still inside. \nAt the same time, Ms Pelosi is rushed from the house floor. She is evacuated entirely from the Capitol complex to a secure off-site location. \nHer staff barricade themselves into a conference room, hiding under a table. \nStaff members of the House leader speak softly, frantically, to each other. Just outside, rioters are spreading out across the building, searching for Ms Pelosi herself.\nThe rioters chant: \"Where are you Nancy?\" In an audio clip, we hear one staff member whisper: \"They're pounding on doors trying to find her.\"\nOne man breaks open the outer door to the office where the staff are hiding, but not the inner door. Another tries as well, but eventually moves on.\nPresident Trump tweets about Mr Pence. \nAt the same time, Mr Pence is evacuated to a secure location. \nRioters start to spread through the buildings. Others break in from outside through various doors around the building. \nThey open the east side door of the rotunda to let more people in, flooding through the doors and overwhelming the officers. \nThe House floor debate is suspended to update members. House members are told to reach for tear gas masks and be prepared to use them. \nThe House is called back into session in the hope of continuing the count. \nBut minutes later the House is abruptly recessed. Members are told to get down under their chairs if necessary. \n\"Folks have entered the rotunda and are coming this way,\" lawmakers are told. \nDemocratic Congressman Eric Swalwell sends a text to his wife: \"I love you and the babies. Please hug them for me\". \nThe mob outside the chamber grows larger and they get within feet of the house door. \nPresident Trump called Senator Mike Lee, according to the Utah Republican who has provided the trial lawyers with a copy of a log from his mobile phone.\nAccording to his office, he received a call from the White House switchboard number - and the call lasted four minutes. Mr Lee has said that apparently the call was meant for Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville, and that he handed his phone to his colleague.\nMr Tuberville told reporters that he informed Mr Trump that Mr Pence had been evacuated from the Senate floor. \"I said: Mr President, they've taken the vice-president out. They want me to get off the phone, I gotta go.\"\nHouse impeachment managers say it is further evidence that the president knew how much danger his vice-president was in.\nAshli Babbit is seen turning the corner towards the House lobby doors as members are leaving.\nHouse Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern is spotted by the mob as he leaves the House floor. \nIn a hallway outside the House chamber, a group attempts to force its way through a set of locked doors. The glass window panes on the doors are shattered. A rioter uses a baton to smash through as the crowd around him chants \"break it down, break it down\".\nFootage shows the hands of an officer on the other side, holding a gun and pointing it toward the mob. We hear a shot and see Babbitt fall to the ground. \nPeople still inside the gallery of the chamber are trapped. They tell each other to take off their congressional pins. \nIn the meantime, a number of rioters reach the inside of the Senate gallery. \n\"Is this the Senate?\" one demands to know. \"Where are they?\" another asks, apparently referring to the evacuated senators.\nVideo footage shows some rioters rifling through papers and materials left behind by lawmakers. \"There's got to be something we can use against these scumbags,\" one says.\nTrump tweets asking for people to \"remain peaceful\". \nMeanwhile the mob are still at the Capitol. \nFootage shows a sprawling mob, a sea of people on the Capitol grounds. A Confederate flag waves in the foreground.\nTrump releases a video in which he tells the mob to go home. \nFifteen minutes after police confirm Ashli Babbitt has died, Trump tweets again. \nHe refers to those at the Capitol as \"great patriots\".

      "text": "There are \"encouraging signs\" coronavirus cases in Wales are falling, the head of NHS Wales has said.\nChief Executive Andrew Goodall said rates of the virus in the community were \"significantly down\" from where they were in December.\nOver a similar period the number of hospital patients with Covid has fallen by about a quarter.\nOffice for National Statistics (ONS) figures show a second week of falling death rates in Wales.\nMeanwhile, the latest Public Health Wales (PHW) figures showed the number of cases per 100,000 people in Wales had fallen to 111.4. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Goodall said: \"Our community prevalence rates are down, they are down very significantly from where we were in December.\n\"We see the positivity rates and the reproduction values are well down within Wales now.\n\"Just over the last two or three weeks or so the number of patients in hospitals for coronavirus has actually reduced by about a quarter.\"\nHowever, he cautioned there were still more than 2,000 patients in hospital with the virus.\n\"That is going to still take us some time I think to reduce those to what we would say would be close to normal levels,\" he said.\nAt the Welsh Government press briefing, Dr Goodall added the Welsh NHS was still in a \"precarious\" position, with the number of people in critical care - with other conditions as well as Covid - running over capacity. \n\"There are still nearly 50% more patients with coronavirus in hospital beds than at the peak of the first wave in April.\"\nHe added 202 people were in field hospital beds. \nDr Giri Shankar, from PHW, also sounded a note of caution, particularly for north Wales.\nHe said: \"Although the data currently shows all-Wales numbers of cases are reducing and that the incidence is now below 120 cases per 100,000 population, the rates in some areas - particularly in north Wales - are still at nearly double that, and there have been small increases in others.\n\"It is encouraging to see that the numbers of people being treated for coronavirus in our hospitals is reducing, [but] there are still a large number of people who are extremely ill, which means that the pressure on services is still very high.\"\nBut Dr Goodall also warned the rate of critical care deaths in hospital could be 25% more in the second wave due to the number of patients being admitted with Covid.\n\"I think what is different in the second wave, that it has just been a higher volume and that is the thing that has caused the pressure right across our system.\n\"And it will mean sadly in areas like critical care, although the data will say that some of the outcomes feel the same [as the first wave], we would have ended up sadly with 25% more deaths in a critical care environment,\" said Dr Goodall.\n\"We would expect a normal emergency medical patient to stay for perhaps between five to seven days, a typical coronavirus patient coming in to our hospitals will be there for three times longer than that.\"\n\"There will be ongoing problems with patients who need to be cared for after they've been discharged, but also those that will still need to receive care in the community.\"\nAsked about the long-effect on waiting lists, Dr Goodall said: \"We've had to prioritise the immediate problems facing us to ensure that the NHS has the resilience to be able to respond.\n\"It will take us some time, maybe even some years, to work our way through some of the pressures that we've had.\nHowever he said the pandemic was a chance to \"reset\" the way patients in hospitals and community settings received cared as there had been so much \"transformation\" in delivery during the pandemic."

      "text": "A man who posed as teenage girls online and blackmailed 51 boys into sending him indecent images of themselves has been jailed for 25 years.\nDavid Wilson, 36, of Kirstead, King's Lynn, Norfolk, admitted 96 offences in November at Ipswich Crown Court.\nIn some cases he threatened to share indecent images of the boys online unless they sent him footage of them abusing younger siblings or friends.\nThe judge described Wilson as \"extremely dangerous\" and \"sadistic\".\nThe court heard some of the children who were groomed to abuse others had been arrested and one was now in a children's home.\nWilson's victims were aged between four and 14 and his crimes took place between 2016 and 2020, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.\nHe won their trust by sending sexual images of young women in exchange for photographs and videos of the victims themselves.\nWilson then used these images to blackmail his victims into sending more extreme content.\nThe NCA said he distributed images to some of his victims' friends, despite them begging him to stop, and some children spoke of wanting to end their lives as a result.\nSentencing, Judge Rupert Overbury described Wilson as a \"serial paedophile\" and \"an extremely dangerous individual\".\n\"You carried out a lengthy and premeditated campaign of sadistic and manipulative abuse of young boys using social media,\" he said.\n\"Any decent human being will be astonished at the level of depravity involved.\"\nOne child was groomed while struggling with the effects of his father dying from cancer, the judge said.\nAnother pleaded for Wilson to stop as his grandfather was about to die but this had no effect on his abuser, he added.\nWilson pleaded guilty to 54 counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, 25 counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, 10 counts of causing a child to watch a sexual act, three counts of blackmail and four counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child.\nHe was ordered to serve a further eight years of extended licence once he is released from prison.\nOfficers began compiling intelligence on Wilson after Facebook identified 20 accounts of boys ranging from 12 to 15 years old, who had sent images of themselves to an account seemingly belonging to a 13-year-old girl.\nThe mother of one of Wilson's victims spoke of her concern over Facebook's plan to bring in end-to-end encryption of messages on the platform.\n\"I'm eternally grateful that David Wilson was caught,\" she said.\n\"I think that if it becomes too difficult for law enforcement agencies to track these people then we won't be able to protect our children and people like him will be able to get away with it.\"\nA spokeswoman for Facebook said: \"Child exploitation and grooming have no place on our platform.\n\"Facebook has led the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect, and respond to abuse and we will continue to work with law enforcement to combat criminal activity.\"\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said: \"This sickening case is a chilling reminder of how crucial it is that tech companies play their part in combating child sexual abuse.\n\"It is vital that Facebook do not press ahead without amending their current end-to-end-encryption plans, otherwise sick criminals like David Wilson could still be abusing children with impunity.\"\nTony Cook, head of child sexual abuse operations at the NCA, said Wilson \"preyed\" on his victims' \"vulnerability\".\n\"He groomed, bullied and blackmailed young boys into sending him indecent images and in some instances performing horrific abuse on themselves and others,\" he said.\n\"Despite knowing their utter anguish and despair he ignored their pleas from him to stop.\"\nMr Cook urged parents to speak to their children about who they communicate with online and understand \"this can happen to anyone\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Women's rights,Saudi Arabia,Human rights in Saudi Arabia",
      "text": "The prominent Saudi women's right activist Loujain al-Hathloul has been released from prison, her family says.\nMs Hathloul, 31, was instrumental in the movement to allow women to drive in the kingdom. She was detained in 2018, just weeks before the ban was lifted.\nIn December a court found her guilty of seeking to change the political system and damage public order.\nShe was sentenced to nearly six years in a maximum security prison, but two years and 10 months were suspended.\nHer family have warned that she is \"not free\" and will face numerous restrictions while on probation, including a five-year travel ban.\n\"Loujain is at home!!!!!!\" Ms Hathloul's sister Lina tweeted on Wednesday, breaking the news that she had been released after 1,001 days in prison.\nAnother sister, Alia, wrote that \"this is the best day of my life\".\nMs Hathloul became a symbol of the suppression of dissent in Saudi Arabia following her detention in May 2018 along with about a dozen other female activists who had also campaigned for women to be allowed to drive.\nHer family said she was initially held incommunicado for three months, and that she was subjected to electric shocks, whippings, and sexual harassment. They also alleged that that she was offered freedom if she agreed to say she was not tortured.\nThe Saudi government denied the allegations of torture, which her family said were recently dismissed by an appeals court.\nOfficials also insisted that she was not detained because of her activism, but rather her contacts with foreign diplomats, media and other organisations.\nPresident Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan welcomed Ms Hathlouo's release from prison, describing it as \"a good thing\".\nLoujain Al-Hathloul has become the face of dissent in the kingdom - a symbol of Saudi Arabia's crackdown on any form of protest. \nMore than any other female activist languishing in prison, her case has gained global prominence. Her outspoken family and a persistent campaign by human rights groups have kept the spotlight on her. \nThat's thrown a long dark shadow on the kingdom's efforts to publicise its new economic and social reforms. \nSaudi officials say they aren't bowing to outside pressure. But it's also clear they want this issue off the agenda now that there's a new team in the White House emphasising human rights. \nThis week also saw the announcement of reforms to the Saudi legal system. But there are other issues in this file, including the even longer shadow of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi officials insist their strategic importance in the region will outweigh all other issues. \nMs Hathloul and 10 other women were put on trial at a criminal court in Riyadh in March 2019. However, the case was adjourned several times.\nAt the end of October 2020, Ms Hathloul started a hunger strike to protest against the conditions of her detention, including not being allowed regular contact with her family.\nThe following month, her charge sheet was amended and her trial was transferred to a court specialising in handling terrorism cases.\nOn 28 December, the Specialised Criminal Court found Ms Hathloul guilty of \"acts criminalised according to article 43 of the counterterrorism and terror finance law\", Saudi media reported.\nThe acts allegedly included \"inciting change to the basic ruling regime; serving a foreign agenda inside the kingdom by using the internet with the objective of damaging public order; and collaborating with a number of individuals and entities who have committed criminalised acts\".\nMs Hathloul denied the charges, but the judge ruled that she had \"confessed willingly without being under duress\".\nAnd while the judge suspended part of her sentence of five years and eight months, paving the way for her early release, he warned that \"if she commits any crimes within the next three years, the suspension will be annulled\". He also banned her from leaving Saudi Arabia for five years.\nUN experts described the charges as \"spurious\" and said Ms Hathloul had merely been exercising her fundamental rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. \n\"Loujain al-Hathloul's release after a harrowing ordeal in prison in Saudi Arabia - lasting nearly three years - is an incredible relief, but long overdue,\" said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International's deputy Middle East director.\n\"Nothing can make up for the cruel treatment she has suffered, nor the injustice of her imprisonment.\" \nLina al-Hathloul stressed that \"the fight is not over\".\n\"I am not fully happy without the release of all political prisoners,\" she added."

      "tags": "Employment tribunals,Racism,Belgium",
      "text": "The head of influential dance label R&S Records discriminated against black and female artists, according to a former employee.\nLabel founder Renaat Vandepapeliere dismissed music by some ethnic minority artists as \"meaningless\" and claimed the history of techno was \"very white\", said former talent scout Raj Chaudhuri.\nChaudhuri is suing R&S for unfair dismissal, citing race discrimination.\nThe label said there was \"no truth\" to his \"spurious\" and \"damaging\" claims.\n\"Mr Renaat Vandepapeliere is certainly not racist and everyone at R&S Records embraces equality,\" said R&S co-founder Sabine Maes, who is also Mr Vandepapeliere's wife, in a statement.\nThe statement characterised Mr Chaudhuri as a \"freelancer who became disgruntled\", and accused him of trying to \"blackmail\" the label for \u00a310,000.\n\"There is simply no truth in anything he says,\" it added.\nLaunched in Belgium in 1984, R&S Records has released some of the most seminal tracks in electronic music, from Joey Beltram's Energy Flash to Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works 85-92.\nIn employment tribunal papers he has filed in London, Mr Chaudhuri said he had repeatedly attempted to \"diversify the label and the artists it worked with\", but found his efforts frustrated or criticised.\nSome of the BAME artists he championed were dismissed as \"terrible\" and \"crap\", according to text messages included in his claim. \nMr Chaudhuri also alleged that Mr Vandepapeliere refused to sever ties with a recording artist who had placed anti-Semitic messages on Facebook. \nOne post contained a photograph of Hitler captioned: \"You should have listened\".\n\"Remove his track? No way\", wrote Mr Vandepapeliere, after being made aware of the messages. \"Inform him of the danger - yes\".\nWhen Mr Chaudhuri continued to express his unease over being associated with the artist, he was told to \"relax a bit\".\nMr Chaudhuri also alleged that R&S tried to suppress an NHS charity album he had put together because - in his opinion - Mr Vandepapeliere was uncomfortable with the Black and non-binary musicians featured on the compilation.\nHis tribunal papers included an email from Mr Vandepapeliere, in which he said: \"Time to delete the NHS comp... and time for quality\".\n\"I know, Raj, you love all this - etc - but I hate it. No talent, no quality.\"\nMr Chaudhuri said his year-long tenure at the label, where he was paid \u00a31,000 a month, ended \"with no warning\" last September. \nHis dismissal came after Mr Vandepapeliere engaged in a public spat with former R&S recording artist Eddington Again.\nLast September, the LA-based musician published an email exchange with the label boss, in which he questioned why R&S had signed so few black and female artists.\nIn response Mr Vandepapeliere wrote: \"We are not a political party\" and \"I sign music I can find - I don't sign color mate\".\nHe also referenced a new artist the label was planning to work with, writing: \"I hope that I have now found a full pure breed black artist that I can spend my life with in full focus\".\nThe messages provoked widespread condemnation from the dance music industry, and two of R&S's biggest artists, Lone and Paul Woolford (aka Special Request) posted messages saying they were ending their relationship with the label.\nIn his tribunal claim, Mr Chaudhuri said he had confronted Mr Vandepapeliere over the controversy, conveying some people's opinion that he should step down from the label.\n\"How dare you, mate,\" wrote Mr Vandepapeliere in a text message. \"Don't need your advice at all... R&S goes my way\".\nMr Chaudhuri claims he was dismissed the following day, with Mr Vandepapeliere  saying he wanted \"a strong team\" who stood behind the company.\nText messages from that day, which also appear in the tribunal papers, show that the label boss called Mr Chaudhuri a \"superstar\" who should \"start ur own label\".\nMr Vandepapeliere subsequently apologised for the content of his leaked emails.\n\"R&S is by no means an organisation where bigotry has a place,\" he wrote in a statement. \"We are deeply convinced of the urgency of racial equality, non-discrimination and a sensitive and respectful discourse\".\nFollowing his dismissal, Mr Chaudhuri demanded payment for the remainder of his contract, totalling \u00a310,000. He also threatened to reveal what he called Mr Vandepapeliere's \"discriminatory conduct\" in a public letter, if the money was withheld.\nIn a statement to the BBC, R&S said this amounted to an attempt at \"extortion or blackmail\". It added that it was considering launching a defamation case over Mr Chaudhuri's allegations.\nThe employment tribunal claim has only recently been filed in London, and the papers have not been served on R&S yet, and a date for the tribunal hearing is some way off.\nR&S said the initiation of proceedings \"proves nothing\", adding: \"We have no intention of litigating this in the press and have every confidence that justice will prevail.\"\n\"We believe Mr Chaudhuri has done this in order to attack Mr Renaat Vandepapeliere in an attempt to sway him away from other legal proceedings and cause the malicious damage that he threatened unless Mr Renaat Vandepapeliere gave into his monetary demands,\" it added.\nMr Chaudhuri said he had filed the case to draw attention to racial inequality in the music industry.\n\"The music industry must become free of racial and gender discrimination and the fight back starts with those in the music community supporting and working towards equality,\" he told the BBC.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has denied breaching the ministerial code by meeting Alex Salmond while claims against him were being investigated by her government.\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said there was a \"cover up at the heart of government\" over the row.\nBut the first minister said she would rebut \"ridiculous conspiracy theories\" when she faces a Holyrood inquiry.\nAnd she hinted that the committee should use its powers to compel her predecessor, Mr Salmond, to appear too.\nThe former first minister is now not expected to give oral evidence after the committee said he had set conditions they \"simply could never meet\".\nThe Holyrood inquiry was set up after the government admitted its investigation of two internal harassment complaints against Mr Salmond had been \"unlawful\", and agreed to pay him \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses.\nMs Sturgeon also commissioned an independent review of whether or not she broke the ministerial code in her dealings with her former mentor during the process, with both probes expected to report back in the coming months.\nMs Davidson said the first minister had \"chosen not to tell officials in advance and not keep a record\" of the meetings with Mr Salmond, and said she had told MSPs \"things that are utterly contradicted by her own evidence and testimony\".\nShe added: \"We have failed women, taxpayers money and a cover up at the heart of government - this whole affair stinks to high heaven.\"\nMs Sturgeon, who is expected to finally give evidence to the committee next week after the session was repeatedly postponed, said she was \"relishing\" the prospect.\nShe said: \"I certainly hope to be sitting in front of the committee answering all of these questions on oath next Tuesday morning, and people can listen to that and make up their own minds.\n\"I believe it is important to subject myself to scrutiny, but also to have the opportunity to take head on some of the ridiculous conspiracy theories that people like Ruth Davidson have been all too quick to want to indulge.\"\nMs Sturgeon was also pressed by Scottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie, who said ministers who knowingly mislead parliament are expected to resign.\nShe asked Ms Sturgeon whether she would quit if she was found to have breached the code - but  the first minister said she would not engage with the \"hypothetical\" question.\nMs Sturgeon added: \"I do not consider that I breached the ministerial code - I will make that case very, very robustly.\n\"I know why the opposition are desperate to get rid of me, I'm under no illusions about that. But I like everyone else am entitled to due process.\"\nMs Sturgeon also hinted that the inquiry committee should use Holyrood's powers to compel Mr Salmond to appear, saying it should not \"indulge conspiracy theories without insisting people come before the committee to substantiate those theories\".\nShe said: \"I still hope the committee will perhaps use the powers that are available to it to make sure everybody relevant sits before it and gives evidence.\"\nParliamentary committees do have the power to compel witnesses to attend, although there is an exemption if they can provide a \"reasonable excuse\".\nMr Salmond had said he would only appear if MSPs agreed to publish his written submissions in full, and to give certain guarantees about what he could speak about.\nThe committee was split over whether to publish one submission - which included detailed claims about Ms Sturgeon breaching the ministerial code - but narrowly voted down the proposal along party lines.\nOn Monday, the inquiry committee questioned SNP chief executive Peter Murrell - Ms Sturgeon's husband - amid a dispute over whether he had given contradictory evidence about his wife's meetings with Mr Salmond.\nHe told members that his previous evidence about the meetings being a government matter - rather than SNP business, as Ms Sturgeon has claimed - was \"speculation on my part\".\nHe said he would \"absolutely refute\" claims that he had given \"false information\", adding: \"It's pretty simple, I think you're trying to suggest things or knowledge that I just don't have about these things.\"\nDuring Thursday's Holyrood questions, Ms Davidson said that Mr Murrell \"may have committed perjury by changing his story under oath\".\nMs Sturgeon insisted that her husband \"did tell the truth\", adding that he \"is perfectly capable of standing up for himself\".\nShe added: \"It's clear to everyone why the opposition parties are so keen to drag Peter Murrell into a process he had no part in and try to damage him. Perhaps they know how integral he's been to the electoral success of the SNP, and conversely the electoral defeat of their parties.\"\nMs Davidson later said Ms Sturgeon had \"backed herself into a corner\" by supporting Mr Murrell's account, saying she was \"dismantling her own evidence\".\nShe said: \"If the SNP chief executive told the truth under oath, as Nicola Sturgeon insisted today, then the first minister misled parliament and broke the Ministerial Code. \n\"Peter Murrell said the Sturgeon-Salmond meetings were government business. The first minister has told the Parliament that they were not. \n\"That is a glaring contradiction. Both accounts cannot be correct.\""

      "text": "A man cleared of being involved in \u00a326m raids on the luxury homes of three celebrities in west London says he is now sleeping in a car.\nAlexandru Stan was acquitted of conspiring to burgle the homes following a high-profile trial.\nWatches and jewellery belonging to Frank Lampard and Tamara Ecclestone were among the items taken during a series of burglaries in December 2019.\nMr Stan says the case has left him homeless and he has \"lost everything\".\nA legal expert told the BBC that there was nothing in place to help people who are acquitted of a crime following a trial.\n\"This is the system working,\" said Dr Hannah Quirk, a reader in criminal law at King's College London.\n\"It is disgraceful and it has been dubbed the innocence tax.\"\nSpeaking to BBC London, Mr Stan said he had not even heard of Ms Ecclestone until he was arrested by police last year.\nMr Stan spent nearly six months in custody at Wormwood Scrubs Prison. While on remand he made friends with his co-accused Sorin Marcovici.\nBoth were released on 8 January following the not guilty verdicts. \n\"We were scared we would be convicted because we were Romanian,\" Mr Stan said. \"They [the prosecution] made out we were thieves and terrorised London.\n\"I knew I had done nothing and I thought I had been framed. If they found me guilty of the burglaries, I risked 14 years in prison.\"\nIsleworth Crown Court heard how the raids at the homes of Mr Lampard, Ms Ecclestone and the family home of duty-free tycoon Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha netted \"big money\" for a team of burglars. \"Fabulous jewellery\" was stolen, the majority of which has never been recovered.\nIn one burglary alone, a \u00a325m haul of cash and jewellery was taken from Ms Ecclestone's Kensington home. This happened only hours after she left London for a holiday in Lapland with her husband Jay Rutland and their daughter, on 13 December 2019.\nThree days before, burglars had ransacked the family home of the late Leicester City owner Mr Vichai. \nThe first in the series of raids was at the home of Mr Lampard and his TV presenter wife Christine. About \u00a360,000 worth of jewellery was taken when they were out on 1 December.\nMr Stan, Mr Marcovici, Maria Mester and her son Emil Bogdan-Savastru were said to be the \"support cast\" to a team of burglars, who cannot be named for legal reasons.\nAll four were unanimously found not guilty by a jury of 11, much to the relief of Mr Stan.\n\"I thought I was dreaming,\" he said. \"I have been through hell and no-one can ever know what it is like to lose your home, lose your place at university and everything.\"\nMr Stan first moved to London in June 2019 and worked as a porter and waiter.\nIn July 2020 he enrolled at the University of Suffolk to study for a business degree, but said he lost this place and was evicted from his home in Harrow while in prison on remand.\nThe 49-year-old says he is struggling to get his life back on track since being released from prison.\nHe added: \"Mr Marcovici took me in and we sleep a couple of nights with his friends or sleep in his car. \n\"It is hard to find a place in the pandemic, people are scared to put you in their home. We have nothing.\"\nMr Stan said Mr Marcovici was helping him with clothing and food and lets him sleep in his car at night.\nMr Marcovici, who has a room in a shared house, said his life was \"really bad\" and he could not find a job because of lockdown.\nHe said: \"No-one helps us. Every morning Mr Stan tries to do something for each of us, but no-one is helping.\n\"How they have left us on the streets in a pandemic - I have no words.\"\nDr Quirk, who used to work at the Criminal Case Review Commission, said that a high-profile victim of the so-called innocence tax was the Conservative MP Nigel Evans, who was cleared of all charges at a trial in 2014.\n\"He was charged with rape and sexual offences and ended up having to use his life savings.\"\nDr Quirk told the BBC that when convicted criminals finish a jail sentence, they deal with the Probation Service which helps them acclimatise to life on the outside.\nBut for those who are acquitted, \"there is no involvement with the criminal justice system any more\".\nShe added: \"It is a real problem.\"\nTwo men accused of burgling the three homes are due to go on trial at Isleworth Crown Court in August."

      "text": "Among 17-year-olds in the UK, one in 10 will have used hard drugs, such as ketamine and cocaine, a study suggests.\nThe University College London research also showed nearly a third of 17-year-olds had tried cannabis and more than half admitted to binge-drinking alcohol.\nAlmost 20,000 young people, born between 2000 and 2002, were surveyed as part of the Millennium Cohort Study. \nDrug-use rates were higher among white teens than black teens.\nA quarter of 17-year-olds also said they had assaulted someone, including shoving, slapping or punching another person over the previous 12 months. \nBut this figure had fallen by seven percentage points from when the tracking survey was last conducted, when participants were aged 14. \nA similar study, which surveyed Britons born in the late 1980s when they were teenagers, found similar rates of alcohol consumption, but slightly higher rates of cannabis use.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, overall drug use among 16-24 year olds in 2020 was much lower than it was in the late 1990s. \nThe latest wave of the Millennium Cohort Study, intended to record a \"detailed portrait of the children of the new century\", was undertaken between 2018 and 2019 when participants were 17-years-old.\nLevels of vandalism and weapon use were similar to when these young people were 14, but shoplifting rose from 4% in early adolescence to 7% a few years later.\nHard drug use was twice as prevalent among white teenagers than their BAME counterparts, while binge-drinking was almost three times higher.\nThis list of hard drugs included cocaine, acid, ecstasy, speed, ketamine and any other psychoactive substances.\nAmong white teenagers, 11% reported using harder drugs compared with 5% for their BAME counterparts, and 59% of white teenagers had engaged in binge-drinking alcohol, compared with 21% of BAME teenagers. \nCannabis use, hard drug taking and binge-drinking were also considerably higher among young men than women. \nEmla Fitzsimons from the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies, who co-authored the study, said: \"Experimental and risk-taking behaviours are an expected part of growing up.\"\n\"Nevertheless, behaviours in adolescence can be a cause for concern as they can have adverse long-term consequences for individuals' health and wellbeing, and their social and economic outcomes.\"\nYoung people with graduate parents were more likely to report alcohol use and binge drinking than those whose parents did not have degrees.\nBut rates of drug use remained similar regardless of parents' educational qualifications.\nThe study found that as these young people \"approached adulthood, reports of anti-social behaviours mostly remained stable or declined compared to rates at age 14\". \nUCL's Aase Villadsen said she was surprised how the findings showed \"the peak in anti-social behaviours in this generation has been reached earlier than usual and rates have already started to come down by age 17\".\n\"This is a positive and will potentially help to improve the future social and economic prospects of Generation Z,\" said Dr Villadsen.\nProf Fitzsimons added: \"It remains to be seen how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected engagement in these behaviours.\"\nBBC Action Line: Advice and support about alcohol or drug problems"

      "tags": "The Troubles,Northern Ireland Assembly",
      "text": "Stormont's Executive Office is under a legal duty to fund a pension for people badly injured in the Troubles, Northern Ireland's Court of Appeal has ruled.\nThe scheme is due to open for applications next month but it is not clear who will fund the payments.\nStormont and Westminster have been engaged in a long-running row about who is responsible.\nOn Tuesday, the Court of Appeal said it was giving the parties four weeks to find a solution.\nIt said if that was not possible the case would be relisted to include Stormont's Department of Finance as an additional notice party.\nA spokesperson for the department said Finance Minister Conor Murphy had been pressing Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis to meet him about the pension since September.\nA UK government spokesperson said Mr Lewis had \"always been clear\" that the responsibility for funding the scheme lay with the Stormont Executive.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is understood the NI secretary has agreed to meet Stormont ministers and has asked for more detail about estimated costs and wider spending plans.\nThe pension scheme was initially approved at Westminster when devolution in Northern Ireland had collapsed.\nSince power-sharing returned in January 2020, estimates from Stormont for the cost of the scheme have been suggested to run to as high as \u00a3800m.\nThe executive argues that Westminster should help fund it, as it is a UK-wide scheme and people injured outside Northern Ireland will be able to apply.\nLast year, a judge ruled that the Executive Office was acting unlawfully in delaying Troubles pensions, following a legal challenge from some victims.\nTuesday's appeal was brought by Brian Turley, one of those known as the Hooded Men, who were detained and subjected to special interrogation methods by the British military in the early-1970s.\nIn the ruling, Northern Ireland's Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan said there was a legal duty on the Executive Office regarding the funding, to ensure payments could be made.\nHe backed submissions that there is no discretion involved but said the court expressed \"no view\" on the political dispute between the Stormont Executive and Northern Ireland Office.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Mr Turley said the judgement confirmed there were \"no justifiable reasons\" for delaying the payments to victims.\n\"The need to keep taking cases to court to obtain what I am entitled to is another form of torture,\" he said.\nAlan McBride from Wave Trauma Centre told BBC Newsline that he was \"disappointed\" that it had been left to the courts system to make progress with the scheme.\n\"It is up now to the executive and Northern Ireland Office to sit down around the table like mature adults and sort this out once and for all.\"\nDUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster said the ruling was \"reassuring\" for victims and that she looked forward to payments being issued.\n\"Whilst the payments will be made from the Northern Ireland Executive, there is a strong argument that the government should be increasing the NI budget accordingly to fund the pension,\" she added.\nSinn F\u00e9in's Linda Dillon said her party was committed to ensuring payments were made as quickly as possible, but insisted the executive alone does not have the resources to deliver it.\nStormont's Justice Minister Naomi Long said she hoped Stormont and Westminster could agree a resolution.\nChair of Stormont's Executive Office Committee, the SDLP's Colin McGrath said it was \"welcome\" that a four-week deadline had been set.\n\"While the British government clearly must meet their financial commitments to this scheme, the public row between the Secretary of State and Finance Minister is unedifying and also serves to re-traumatise victims and survivors,\" he said.\nUlster Unionist assembly member (MLA) Doug Beattie described the ruling as the \"latest abject failure\" in supporting the needs of Troubles victims.\n\"The Executive Office has not only a moral obligation but now a legal one to provide the funding to this scheme and end the uncertainty for those who have spent years suffering as a result of injuries caused by no fault of their own,\" he said.\nThe scheme is due to run for two or three decades and payments are to be backdated to 2014, the year in which it was first agreed.\nLast August, Stormont's Department of Justice was designated to administer the scheme.\nBut in January, the Department of Finance did not set aside funding for payments in the draft budget for 2021-22, only the administrative cost of the pension.\nThe legislation came on to the statute book in January 2020. To qualify, applicants must have an injury which is severe and permanent and caused by no fault of their own.\nThat can be physical injury, such as a loss of limbs, or psychological, caused by being present at a bombing, for example.\nThe scheme covers violence related to the Northern Ireland Troubles between 1966 and 2010, including incidents in Great Britain and Europe.\nNon-UK residents injured outside the UK cannot apply - such as victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings carried out by loyalists in 1974.\nPeople will get between \u00a32,000 and \u00a310,000 a year for the rest of their lives.\nUpon their death, a spouse or carer, will get the payments for a further 10 years.\nThe scheme is a recognition that criminal injuries awards from decades ago were largely inadequate."

      "text": "Thousands of flat owners are facing large bills for fire-safety improvements demanded following the Grenfell disaster. Labour says they're not getting enough help, but the government insists it's taking appropriate action.\n\"The building should never have been signed off in the first place,\" says Pippa Hamshaw. \"The flats are all valued at nothing. Mortgage companies won't offer mortgages on any of them.\"\nPippa, 31, is also expecting a \u00a370,000 bill for her share of renovations on her block of flats in Leeds.\n\"I go from being really angry with the situation to being in tears,\" she tells BBC 5 live's Naga Munchetty. \"It's taken over my life.\"\nPippa is one of thousands of people facing large payments for safety renovations required following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, in west London, in which 72 people died when flames spread via combustible exterior cladding.\nMany fire-safety concerns have come up in inspections since then, but those not relating to cladding - such as missing fire breaks and flammable balconies - are not covered by the government's Building Safety Fund.\nAnd a report by MPs has said that the \u00a31.6bn the government has allocated for removing dangerous cladding is insufficient - with the real cost nearer \u00a315bn.\nFixing safety faults has seen costs surge for leaseholders like Pippa, whose monthly service charge has risen from \u00a3240 to \u00a3630.\n\"I just feel totally let down by the whole system,\" she says. \"The government could do something right now... I feel like everyone's winning bar the leaseholder.\"\nAfter Grenfell, round-the-clock fire patrols known as \"waking watches\" were put in place in hundreds of buildings, costing groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month.\n\"I don't feel any safer,\" says Pippa. \"I don't see how they are going to be much use. They literally have to go and knock on every door of the flats to tell you that the building is on fire. We've got 10 floors in my property. Are they really going to be able to knock on every door?\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer is accusing ministers of offering \"half-baked solutions\" to the problems exposed by Grenfell and has called for a national cladding taskforce, modelled on a similar body set up in Australia.\nHe argues this would \"drive forward\" work on funding the removal of dangerous cladding, while pursuing \"those responsible for the cladding scandal\", protecting residents from costs and ensuring they can sell their properties.\nJenny Garrett, who bought her flat in Sheffield in 2019, says that, when the survey was carried out, \"absolutely nothing\" wrong was found. Only later did she find out the building's cladding was flammable.\n\"The whole situation is quite overwhelming because there's the issue of feeling unsafe,\" she says. \"On top of that, there's the issue about the financial pressure and worrying about what's coming down the road.\"\nResidents have seen insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems rocket.\nFlat owners in one Cheshire development had their combined premiums rise from \u00a334,000 in 2018 to more than \u00a3500,000. Some are now paying almost \u00a32,000 a year for building insurance.\nMeanwhile, data released last month shows that cladding removal and repair work has been completed on only 58% of social housing blocks and 30% of private sector buildings.\nThe Association of British Insurers says the slow pace of getting buildings fixed means means high policy prices reflect risks accurately.\n\"For the last two or three years, a lot of our lives have been completely ruined,\" says Giles, a flat owner from Manchester. \"We're living in fear and limbo. All we've been told so far is the government wants us to pay sums running into the tens of thousands of pounds, simply to make our homes safe.\n\"It's all got even worse over the last year, because we're trapped in our homes for 23 hours a day during the pandemic. We almost feel safer outside than inside.\"\n\"We all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible... we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes,\" a Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman says.\n\"Leaseholders shouldn't have to worry about the unaffordable costs of fixing safety defects in high-rise buildings that they didn't cause - and should be protected from large-scale remediation costs wherever possible,\" he adds.\n\"The Building Safety Bill is the appropriate legislative mechanism for addressing these issues and will be brought forward in due course.\"\nThe House of Commons backed a Labour motion calling for further action on cladding on Monday by 263 votes to none.\nThe Conservative leadership asked its MPs to abstain and the result is not binding on the government."

      "text": "The supermarket price-war has edged up a notch after Sainsbury's followed Tesco's Aldi price-match scheme.\nThe major supermarkets are fighting the German discount chains for business and price is their chosen battleground.\nTesco launched its Aldi price-match in March 2020 and extended it to around 500 products in September.\nSainsbury's - the UK's second-largest supermarket - has now joined the fray, saying: \"It will help shoppers who are working hard to balance budgets\".\nIt has promised to slash the cost of hundreds of essential groceries to match Aldi.\nPrices will be cut on 250 popular items including meat, chicken, fresh fruit and vegetables and dairy.\nThe price match is the first part of chief executive Simon Roberts' plan announced in November to put food back at the heart of the business.\n\"We are making great progress delivering our Food First plan and I'm determined that in these tough times, we do even more to help our customers save money,\" he said.\nThe grocery chains are under political pressure with rumours circulating that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering a levy on them for making \"excess profits\" during the pandemic.\nBut while people are buying more food to eat at home, the supermarkets say they are making less money.\nMr Roberts has said that that the pandemic has led to customers switching from its most profitable channel - convenience stores - to its least profitable - online shopping.\nSupermarkets make less money out of online shopping because of delivery and higher staffing costs.\nThe latest price-war will hit profit margins already squeezed to between 2-4%.\nBut on the other hand, the move to online has benefited the traditional supermarkets as Aldi's smaller online offering has left it unable to take advantage of the booming demand for home deliveries.\nIn fact Aldi has seen its sales growth fall behind some of its rivals during the pandemic.\nFigures from retail analysts Kantar for the 12 weeks to 24 January 24 revealed that Aldi sales grew by just 5.7% compared with 12.2% growth across the UK grocery market as a whole.\nThe price war has seen rival supermarkets set up their own discounts and deals to try and attract customers through their doors or onto their online sites.\nAs well as its Aldi Price Match, Tesco offers savings through its Club Card Prices and said: \"We know that our customers want competitive prices for the products and brands they buy regularly.\"\nAldi pointed out that \"Consumer group Which? recently found that Sainsbury's were over 31% more expensive than Aldi\". An Aldi spokesperson said: \"Shoppers know that the only place you can get Aldi prices is at Aldi.\"\nLidl, contrarily, avoids price drop campaigns in favour of low prices, although it does have a Pick of the Week special offer.

      "tags": "Space exploration",
      "text": "The United Arab Emirates is celebrating its first mission at Mars.\nIt has put a probe called Hope in orbit around the planet, making it only the fifth spacefaring entity to do so after the US, the Soviet Union, Europe and India.\nThe spacecraft, which left Earth seven months ago, had to make a braking manoeuvre to be sure of being captured by Mars' gravity.\nUAE scientists can now look forward to studying the planet's atmosphere.\nTheir satellite carries three instruments that will observe, among other targets, how neutral atoms of hydrogen and oxygen - remnants from Mars' once abundant water - leak into space. \nIn the process, Hope will return spectacular, high-resolution, full-disk images of the planet.\nTuesday marked the most critical phase in the mission.\nHope had been approaching Mars at over 120,000km/h (relative to the Sun) and needed to execute a precise 27-minute burn on its braking engines to scrub some of that speed or risk skipping off into ever deeper space.\nThe manoeuvre, performed by six thrusters on the probe, commenced at about 19:30 GST (15:30 GMT), with confirmation received at Earth some 11 minutes later - the delay being the time it took for radio signals to traverse the 190-million-km separation between Mars and Earth.\nThe official announcement on the burn's completion when it came was calm, and the applause relatively restrained. Perhaps it was the relief speaking after a nerve-shredding wait for the positive telemetry. \n\"Mars orbit insertion was the most critical and dangerous part of our journey to Mars, exposing the Hope probe to stresses and pressures it has never before faced,\" said Omran Sharaf, the Hope mission's project director at the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre\n\"With this enormous milestone achieved, we are now preparing to transition to our science orbit and commence science data gathering.\"\nThe past few days have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm for Hope and its mission, with public monuments, buildings and heritage sites across the federation all lit up in red.\nDubai's Burj Khalifa, the tallest human-made structure on Earth, had been flashing a countdown to Tuesday's big moment.\nHope is regarded as a triumph for a small gulf nation that dared to think seven years ago that it could inspire the next generation by launching the first Arab interplanetary space mission. \n\"We wanted to arrive at Mars; (I'm) really grateful, and it's like a weight of seven years has been lifted from my shoulders,\" said Her Excellency Sarah Al Amiri, UAE minister of state for advanced technology and chair of the UAE Space Agency.\n\"On arriving at Mars. I'm now truly looking forward to the scientific discoveries. And I truly hope this mission will impact an entire generation to strive to do things that are even bigger,\" she told BBC News.\nHope is now running in an initial ellipse around Mars that comes as close as 1,000km from the planet and goes out to almost 50,000km. Over the course of the next few weeks, this will be trimmed to a 55-hour, 22,000km-by-43,000km orbit that is inclined to the equator by about 25 degrees.\n\"It depends on what that initial orbit looks like but we would need around three manoeuvres to get into our science orbit,\" said propulsion engineer Ayesha Sharafi.\nThis path is very different to those of previous satellites which have tended to operate with greater proximity to Mars to facilitate high-resolution imagery of the surface and communications with landed robots.\nBut it's from this high perch that Hope plans to carry out some novel research. It's going to trace how energy moves through the atmosphere from the very bottom to the very top. \nA key influencer in this respect is dust which can on occasions blow up into storms that envelop the entire planet.\n\"Dust plays a hugely important role in the Martian atmosphere. There are a few places on Earth where the atmosphere can be that dusty, but they're localised and maybe for short times,\" explained Prof David Brain, a University of Colorado at Boulder planetary expert who is working with the UAE team.\n\"Dust absorbs a lot of energy; it can become very warm and radiate energy. And so when you're talking about energy transport, dust is a much larger part of the big picture at Mars.\"\nHope is leading a wave of missions to Mars this February.\nOn Wednesday, it will be the turn of China with its Tianwen-1 orbiter. Like Hope, it must complete a braking manoeuvre to be captured by the planet's gravity.\nTianwen-1 is carrying a rover that will be despatched to the surface, most likely in May.\nNext week, on Thursday 18 February, the Americans will arrive at Mars with another of their big rovers. The Perseverance robot is being aimed at a crater that once held a giant lake. It will look for signs of fossilised life. "

      "text": "Scotland's transport secretary says he is pressing the UK government to close a loophole which could allow travellers to avoid new Covid quarantine rules.\nMichael Matheson told BBC Scotland the current UK arrangements for enforced isolation in hotels were \"inadequate\".\nNew UK quarantine rules only apply to people arriving from 33 countries deemed \"high risk\", but Scotland's apply to all international travellers.\nThere are fears traveller could avoid the rules by flying into England first.\nEveryone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days at a cost of \u00a31,750.\nThe Scottish government has block-booked rooms at six hotels near Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.\nMr Matheson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme he believed there should be a \"comprehensive system\" across the UK on managed isolation to reduce the risk of importing variants of Covid-19.\n\"Our preferred option would be for individuals to be required to self-isolate at the point of entry into the UK, rather than travelling from one part of the UK to self-isolate when they get into Scotland or Northern Ireland or any other part of the UK,\" he said.\n\"[The UK government] want to continue to take a targeted approach on the way in which individuals enter into ports of entry in England.\n\"Our view is that remains inadequate in order to prevent the risk of new variants entering into the country and that is why we we're continuing to pursue and press the UK government to listen to the clinical advice and expert opinion from the Joint Biosecurity Centre that the existing system operating isn't adequate.\"\nAsked if Scotland would introduce controls on the border with England to ensure people travelling to Scotland via an English airport were complying, Mr Matheson said the Scottish government was looking at a \"range of measures\".\nThe \u00a31,750 cost of the stay in managed quarantine will have to be paid for by the passengers themselves.\nThe charge includes mandatory Covid tests on day two and day eight following arrival for one person - any additional travellers will incur supplemental costs. \nAnyone who breaches the measures could face criminal charges including culpable and reckless conduct.\nMr Matheson told the BBC that about 1,600 people travelled to Scotland from abroad last week.\n\"If you take out those who would be subject to an exemption, we estimate there would be the need for potentially around 1,200 individuals to self-isolate in a managed quarantine facility,\" he said.\n\"One of the things that may happen as a result of the policy we have taken forward, is that some of the airlines may choose to draw back on their international flights into Scotland.\n\"And there is some indication that the airlines may choose to cancel their flights coming into Scotland next week as a result of the managed isolation provision we have put in place, on the basis that they believe the demand for those flights is going to drop off dramatically as a result.\"\nThe oil and gas industry has said the 10-day quarantines could have a massive impact on business.\nTrevor Stapleton, from industry body Oil and Gas UK said: \"Given that they are doing critical roles and that the rotas have been planned a good year in advance, to suddenly say that that individual cannot go offshore - and therefore they have to quarantine for 10 days - would have a couple of outcomes.\n\"If they are doing a critical role then either they... have to stay on the installation for a further 10 days, and if that's not possible, if the person has to come back, then you are looking quite seriously at whether you can continue to operate that installation.\"\nMr Matheson said that there would be \"some level of exemptions\" provided for some passengers.\n\"We're looking at particular aspects around the oil and gas sector and also around areas such as defence and areas of critical infrastructure as well,\" he added.\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs on Tuesday that new UK border measures built on \"touch actions\" already taken to prevent news variants of Covid-19 entering the country.\nHe also said that the UK government was working on \"similarly tough schemes with the devolved administrations\"."

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,North Kensington,Grenfell Tower Inquiry",
      "text": "The firm that sold the cladding used at Grenfell Tower knew about the risk of fires in 2013, but continued to offer a flammable version of it.\nThe public inquiry has been shown an internal email sent by a sales manager at Arconic warning of the risk of high-rise fires in the United Arab Emirates.\nDeborah French also forwarded an email from a competitor company that was switching to sell only fire-resistant cladding as a result.\nSeventy-two people died at Grenfell.\nOn Wednesday the inquiry has focused on what Arconic told its customers, who were fabricating cladding systems for high-rise blocks around the UK.\nOn 1 May 2013, the BBC reported on \"towering inferno\" fears following a series of fires involving cladding in the Gulf.\nDeborah French sent a link to the article and also forwarded an email from Richard Geater, a rival salesperson for another company, Alucobond, who was warning his customers of the risks.\nMr Geater wrote that using cladding known as aluminium composite material (ACM), made partly from plastic, created a situation like \"a chimney which transports the fire from bottom to top or vice versa within the shortest time.\n\"The perils of using cheap ACM alternatives have been exposed,\" he said.\nArconic did not follow its competitor's lead. Its most popular type of cladding in the UK was Reynobond PE, with its flammable plastic layer, used on dozens of buildings including Grenfell Tower.\nOn 13 May 2013, Deborah French wrote to her customers saying that by working closely with them, \"we are able to follow what type of project is being designed/developed and then offer the right... specification\".\nHowever, since the fire, Arconic has insisted it had no control over the type of materials it sold to customers, taking the position that it was for architects to decide whether they met fire safety regulations.\nIn a later witness statement, Ms French adopted this position, saying that in her email to customers she had simply meant the company's technical support department could offer advice if needed.\nRichard Millett, the inquiry's lead counsel, questioned her about why, if the email was false, she had sent it in the first place.\nHe suggested the email might have been correct and that she had changed her account since the fire, despite being content to say at the time that Arconic could control the types of cladding used.\nThe degree to which Arconic \"pushed\" flammable cladding for use on tall buildings is central to the question of who might be to blame for the fire.\nThe timing of Ms French's emails is relevant. She was negotiating with the Grenfell Tower project for the sale of 3,000 sq m of cladding.\nShe admitted to the inquiry that at the time she knew this was a high-rise residential housing project.\nBy this point, Arconic had already changed its marketing materials after receiving poor fire test results for the Reynobond cladding sheets.\nBut a technical manager at Arconic said customers would only be informed \"when asking about the fire performance\" of the product.\nThe change was made a year earlier, in 2012, as designers were starting to consider materials for Grenfell Tower.\nDespite \"bad behaviour\" in fires, the company believed the product could still be sold in countries with less restrictive regulations.\nThese included the UK where it was the standard type of cladding the company sold.\nThe UK sales manager involved in the discussions explained to the inquiry that she could not remember being told about the change to the specification, or it being discussed at meetings.\nArconic sold raw aluminium cladding sheets, which were formed into \"cassettes\" - rectangular folded panels - for fixing on the outside of buildings.\nIn 2010 Arconic published a specification for its cladding, which contained a fire classification of class B out of a possible A1 to F.\nBut in 2011 the \"cassette\" version of the product was put through a standard European fire test where it achieved a poor result, classified E out of a possible A1 to F.\nThe test went so badly it had to be stopped early, with the panel on fire.\nAs a result in 2012, the flammable version of the cladding was removed entirely from the specification sheet published by Arconic, despite the fact that it continued to be the main type sold in the UK.\nOnly a less common fire-retardant version was included in the information.\nThe BBC previously revealed that poor test results were withheld from the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment which issues independent safety certificates relied on by construction firms and architects.\nA witness statement provided by a French technical manager, Claude Wehrle, said: \"The intention was for customers to be informed of the position when asking about the fire performance of the cassette variant of the product.\"\nHowever, Arconic continued to sell the product to construction projects involving tall buildings.\nIn a meeting note, Mr Wehrle wrote that \"for the moment, even if we know the PE (polyethylene material) in cassette has a bad behaviour exposed to fire, we can still work with national regulations who are not as restrictive\".\nArconic's UK sales manager, Deborah French, was asked by the inquiry's lead counsel: \"Do we take it... that if the customers didn't ask, they didn't get told?\"\n\"Yes,\" she answered, adding that they would not have known unless they had been told.\nThe cassette version of the cladding, formed from flammable materials, has been shown to pose a particular risk in fires on tall buildings and was the type eventually used at Grenfell Tower."

      "tags": "Race and ethnicity,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Black people in England have been no more likely than white people to die of Covid-19 in the second wave of the pandemic, official data shows.\nDuring the first wave, people belonging to ethnic minorities experienced higher death rates than white people.  \nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that, for black people, this gap had closed.\nBut Bangladeshi and Pakistani people still experienced three times the risk.\nResearchers from the ONS, University of Oxford, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and University of Leicester said widespread reports that people belonging to ethnic minorities were disproportionately affected by Covid-19 may have raised awareness.\nBut for South Asian people, particularly from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds, the raised mortality rate remained \"alarming\". \nThe study used official data on 28.9 million people aged between 30 and 100 living in private households in England between the first wave (from January until the end of August 2020) and the second wave (from September to the end of December 2020).\nIn the first wave, people from a black African background had the highest age-standardised Covid-19 mortality rates - with the rate for black African men almost five times higher than the rate for white British men.\nBut in the second wave, black people were not at higher risk of dying than white people, as they had been during the first wave.\nThe researchers said this showed \"ethnic inequalities in Covid-19 mortality can be addressed\".\nHowever, South Asian people had up to about a five-times greater risk of death with coronavirus compared with white British people - ranging from a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of dying for Pakistani men to 1.6 times higher for Indian women. \nThe findings were presented in a preprint but have not been formally published yet.\nA number of different factors have been suggested for why some ethnic groups have been hit harder than others by the pandemic:\nThese factors will be different for different groups - but they also appeared to change during the pandemic. \nDuring the first wave, \"geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in Covid-19 mortality,\" said the team, lead by Vah\u00e9 Nafilyan at the ONS and Nazrul Islam at the University of Oxford.\nIn other words, people from minority ethnic groups were more likely to live in areas harder hit by the virus.\nBut this was not the case in the second wave - and even after they adjusted for factors like health status, income and deprivation, the risk of dying of Covid remained \"substantially higher\" for people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds.\nThis suggested, the paper said, that \"focusing on treating underlying conditions, although important, may not be enough in reducing the inequalities in Covid-19 mortality.\" \nIt said \"a focused public health policy as well as community mobilisation and a participatory public health campaign involving community leaders may help reduce the existing and widening inequalities.\""

      "text": "Home Secretary Priti Patel could face a charge of contempt of court after failing to follow an order to house an Iranian sex offender.\nThe High Court said it wants to know why the Home Office had failed to comply with the mandatory injunction.\nIt is exceptionally rare for judges to threaten ministers and their officials with contempt of court over a failure to follow a court instruction.\nA Home Office spokesman said the department had already apologised. \nThe row with the court emerged in a judgment published on Tuesday about a failure to provide emergency housing to Kharajan Arshad Fathula Mohammad in the north west of England. \nThe Iranian national was jailed in 2016 for 20 months for a sexual offence involving a child. \nForeign national offenders jailed for more than 12 months typically face deportation from the UK - but Mohammad was bailed from immigration detention in May 2018.\nLast October he asked the Home Office for basic emergency housing under a law for destitute people whose claims to stay in the UK have been rejected, but who are also not likely to be removed from the country in the near future.\nA week later Home Office officials told him he would be found a bed. \nBut, according to a High Court judgment, that did not happen. \nA fortnight before Christmas, officials said they were still struggling to find suitable accommodation because of both the applicant's criminal conviction and the enormous pressures that the pandemic had placed on the Home Office-managed accommodation system. \nOn 29 January, a High Court judge ordered the home secretary to act because Mohammad was still sleeping rough and support workers said he was at risk of killing himself or contracting coronavirus. \nAfter five days, still nothing had changed. \nThat lack of action triggered a new court order, from a second senior judge, demanding the home secretary explain what was going on. \nA senior government lawyer then confirmed there had been a failure to comply. \n\"The delay in providing accommodation to the claimant was due to difficulties the [home secretary] has faced with compliance in the light of the current demand on the asylum support system,\" said the lawyer in a letter. \n\"I accept that... [the home secretary] should have made the appropriate application to the court for an extension of time once it became clear that she could not comply with the previous order.\"\nImmigration officials then proposed putting Mohammad in a London hotel. That plan required an unrealistic late night round-trip by taxi from Manchester, at their expense. As a result, he slept on the streets again. \nOfficials have now told the court that suitable accommodation has been found in north-west England. \nBut Mr Justice Chamberlain, the second of the two judges to intervene in the case, said the home secretary must now provide a full account of what happened - and the court would consider whether the failure should lead to a full contempt of court hearing. \nThis is the ancient offence of disobeying or ignoring a court and its orders. The government's own guidance says anyone found to be in contempt \"could go to prison for up to two years, get a fine, or both.\"\nIn practice, warnings of contempt of court are sometimes a means to publicly force an individual or organisation into properly complying with an instruction. \nIn his highly critical ruling, Mr Justice Chamberlain said: \"Breach of an injunction is a matter which can result in proceedings for contempt. This is so even where the breach is by a minister.\n\"If the evidence provides sufficient reassurance that the breach was not intentional and that measures have been put in place to avoid any recurrence, further proceedings may be unnecessary.\"\nThe home secretary has until 16:00 GMT on 22 February to respond. \nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We have apologised to the court for failure to comply with the order in time and will be submitting a full statement, which explains the reasons for this delay.\n\"Sourcing accommodation for individuals with convictions of this nature can be particularly challenging and we have also seen increased pressure on the asylum system due to the pandemic. It is standard practice for Secretaries of State to be named in court documents for legal actions brought against their departments.\"\nThe BBC has contacted Mr Mohammad's lawyer for comment.   "

      "text": "The supermarket price-war has edged up a notch after Sainsbury's followed Tesco's Aldi price-match scheme.\nThe major supermarkets are fighting the German discount chains for business and price is their chosen battleground.\nTesco launched its Aldi price-match in March 2020 and extended it to around 500 products in September.\nSainsbury's - the UK's second-largest supermarket - has now joined the fray, saying: \"It will help shoppers who are working hard to balance budgets\".\nIt has promised to slash the cost of hundreds of essential groceries to match Aldi.\nPrices will be cut on 250 popular items including meat, chicken, fresh fruit and vegetables and dairy.\nThe price match is the first part of chief executive Simon Roberts' plan announced in November to put food back at the heart of the business.\n\"We are making great progress delivering our Food First plan and I'm determined that in these tough times, we do even more to help our customers save money,\" he said.\nThe grocery chains are under political pressure with rumours circulating that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering a levy on them for making \"excess profits\" during the pandemic.\nBut while people are buying more food to eat at home, the supermarkets say they are making less money.\nMr Roberts has said that that the pandemic has led to customers switching from its most profitable channel - convenience stores - to its least profitable - online shopping.\nSupermarkets make less money out of online shopping because of delivery and higher staffing costs.\nThe latest price-war will hit profit margins already squeezed to between 2-4%.\nBut on the other hand, the move to online has benefited the traditional supermarkets as Aldi's smaller online offering has left it unable to take advantage of the booming demand for home deliveries.\nIn fact Aldi has seen its sales growth fall behind some of its rivals during the pandemic.\nFigures from retail analysts Kantar for the 12 weeks to 24 January 24 revealed that Aldi sales grew by just 5.7% compared with 12.2% growth across the UK grocery market as a whole.\nThe price war has seen rival supermarkets set up their own discounts and deals to try and attract customers through their doors or onto their online sites.\nAs well as its Aldi Price Match, Tesco offers savings through its Club Card Prices and said: \"We know that our customers want competitive prices for the products and brands they buy regularly.\"\nAldi pointed out that \"Consumer group Which? recently found that Sainsbury's were over 31% more expensive than Aldi\". An Aldi spokesperson said: \"Shoppers know that the only place you can get Aldi prices is at Aldi.\"\nLidl, contrarily, avoids price drop campaigns in favour of low prices, although it does have a Pick of the Week special offer.

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

The US will also enforce strong export controls. \n\"The people of Burma are making their voices heard and the world is watching,\" he said, vowing to take further action if needed. \n\"As protests grow, violence against those exerting their democratic rights is unacceptable and we're going to keep calling it out,\" he added. \nThere have been reports of serious injuries as police have increased their use of force, but no deaths so far.\nMeanwhile, dozens of police officers joined protesters in eastern Kayah state.\nTens of thousands have turned out in street protests against last week's coup, which overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's democratically-elected government in the South East Asian country, despite a recent ban on large gatherings and a night curfew.\nDemonstrations re-started on Wednesday morning, for a fifth consecutive day, with a large group of civil servants gathering in Nay Pyi Taw to protest.\nOn Tuesday, police used water cannon in Nay Pyi Taw against protesters, who refused to retreat.\nWarning shots were reportedly fired into the air before rubber bullets were used. Doctors later said it appeared live ammunition had hit protesters.\nAccording to BBC Burmese, who spoke to an unnamed medical officer from a Nay Pyi Taw hospital, Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing suffered a serious head injury and another demonstrator had chest injuries. \nMya Thwe Thwe Khaing, who turns 20 on Thursday, is now in intensive care. \nHer sister, Mya Tha Toe Nwe, who was also at the protest, said the chances of her sister surviving are slim.\n\"It's heart breaking,\" she said. \"We only have our mother, our dad is already dead.\n\"I'm the eldest of four siblings, she's the youngest. I can't comfort mum, we have no words.\"\nThe injured woman's brother Ye Htut Aung told the Reuters news agency she had insisted on protesting, and that he spoke to her on the phone shortly before she was shot. \n\"What are you going to do if they shoot?\" he reportedly asked.\n\"No, they wouldn't,\" she replied. \"It's OK. Even if they fire, it should be fine.\"\nAccording to a report by Human Rights Watch, a doctor from the hospital said the teenager had a \"projectile lodged in her head and had lost significant brain function\".\nThe unidentified doctor said the wound was consistent with the use of live ammunition, and that a metal bullet had penetrated the back of the injured woman's right ear. A man wounded at the same protest also appeared to have similar injuries.\nA separate report by Fortify Rights quoted a doctor who said the woman was brain dead from an \"imminently fatal gunshot wound to the head\".\nEarlier, a clip purportedly showing a woman being shot circulated online. The footage shows the woman wearing a motorbike helmet collapsing abruptly.\nSeparately, pictures on social media showed what appeared to be a blood-stained helmet. The BBC has not verified the authenticity of the images. \nThe United Nations special rapporteur on Myanmar has warned the country's security forces that they face prosecution under international law if they use excessive force against demonstrators. \n\"Myanmar military personnel and police need to know that 'following orders' is no defence for committing atrocities and any such defence will fail, regardless of their place in the chain of command,\" Thomas Andrews said in a statement issued in Geneva.\nHe said that \"hundreds of arbitrary detentions\" had been recorded since the coup.\nPrevious protests against the country's decades-long military rule, in 1988 and 2007, saw large numbers of demonstrators killed by the security forces. At least 3,000 protesters died in 1988 and at least 30 people lost their lives in 2007. Thousands were imprisoned during both sets of events. \nLate on Tuesday, Myanmar's military also raided Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party headquarters in the country's largest city, Yangon, the party said.  \nBBC Burmese understands that security forces broke down the doors by force. No party members were present in the building at the time. Footage of the headquarters filmed by the AFP news agency showed damaged computer servers and ransacked cupboards. \nThe raid took place during a nationwide curfew, which lasts from 20:00 to 04:00 (13:30 to 21:30 GMT).\nIn eastern Kayah state, dozens of police officers appeared to have joined the protesters' cause and staged their own demonstration.\nAccording to the local news outlet Myanmar Now, they were holding posters that read \"We stand with the people\" and \"We don't want the dictatorship\". \nOne protester at the scene told the BBC that as many as 40 officers took part and they were later seen trying to protect the demonstrators from other police. \nAnother eyewitness said some of the police protesters were later arrested.\nMeanwhile, large crowds continued to gather in various cities, including Nay Pyi Taw and Yangon. \nSeveral groups of young people staged colourful protests wearing ball gowns and sitting in inflatable tubs.\nThe military seized control on 1 February following a general election which the NLD won by a landslide.\nThe armed forces had backed the opposition, who were demanding a rerun of the vote, claiming widespread fraud. The election commission said there was no evidence to support these claims.\nThe coup was staged as a new session of parliament was set to open.\nMs Suu Kyi is under house arrest and has been charged with possessing illegally imported walkie-talkies. Many other NLD officials have also been detained."

      "text": "Twitter has posted record revenues for the last quarter of 2020, capping off what its chief executive said was \"an extraordinary year\" for the platform. \nThe social messaging platform said revenue grew 28% to $1.29bn (\u00a3930m) compared to the last quarter of 2019.\nIn January, Twitter banned Donald Trump from the platform which analysts felt could have an impact this quarter.\n\"We're a platform that is obviously much larger than any one topic or any one account,\" boss Jack Dorsey said.\nTwitter's fourth-quarter results beat analysts' expectations for earnings and revenue, but failed to meet them for user growth.\nOn 8 January, Twitter decided to permanently suspend the account of former President Donald Trump after the riots in Washington DC.\nThe removal of the avid Twitter user has prompted fears that it could affect the platform's popularity for the current quarter.\nIn response, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey said users are able to follow more than 6,000 different topics, explaining that those topics drive growth. \nHe added that 80% of Twitter's audience is outside the US. \n\"We have a global service. We are also not just dependent upon just news and politics being what drives Twitter,\" Mr Dorsey said.\nTwitter's total \"monetisable\" daily active users grew by 5 million from the third quarter to 192 million. While this was up 26% compared to a year ago, it fell below analysts' expectations of 193.5 million. \nThe company warned that its total costs and expenses would rise at least 25% this year as it plans to raise headcount by 20%. It ended 2020 with more than 5,500 employees."

      "tags": "Poverty,Food banks,Child poverty,Hartlepool,Parenting",
      "text": "The boot of the red car lifts up to reveal a sea of plastic bags. Inside each one are the essentials for bringing up young children: nappies, wipes, baby food and shampoo, as well as sanitary items for their mums - all free to those in need. \nWithin a minute or two, the first customer arrives. Soon followed by another, and another. Since the first lockdown, on every Thursday Emilie de Bruijn runs this \"baby bank\" out of the back of her car in Hartlepool. \nCovid has put paid to the indoor space she used in normal times. It's also increased demand amongst families now suffering real and deepening hardship.  \nHer parking spot is beside a church which doubles up as a food bank. On the freezing Thursday we visited, almost 100 people queued in the cold for several hours for the food parcels on offer there. Among them were parents with pushchairs and young children, who stepped out of the queue to collect some baby basics before rejoining it as it crept towards the church door.\n\"It's just getting harder and harder,\" Emilie told me. \"We are increasingly finding people who have been furloughed or laid off work coming to us and saying, 'I'm so sorry. I never thought I'd see myself in this position. Can you help me?'\"\nEmilie recalls how one mother got in touch to ask for help after being put on furlough since the end of her maternity leave.\n\"She cried on her doorstep because I gave her nappies, wipes and winter clothes for her child. I went away with a lump in my throat.\"\nA report from London-based baby bank charity Little Village and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, seen first by BBC Newsnight, outlines the scale, depth and persistence of poverty in families with children aged under five across the UK.  \nIt finds one-third (34%) of these children live below the poverty line - meaning their family lives on less than 60% of the median household income in the UK.\nThat equates to 1.3 million under-fives, according to the analysis. Two in five of these families have seen a reduction in their earnings as a result of the ongoing Covid crisis.\nLondon has the worst rates of poverty in the UK for children in this age group. The North East of England runs the capital a close second, which doesn't surprise Kay - one of Emilie's regulars. \nKay moved to Hartlepool from London in search of cheaper rents and a better life for her young children. She's worked in supermarkets but is now a single parent with four children, aged between seven months and seven years old. Struggling on benefits, and after housing costs, Kay's left with around \u00a3600 for the month. \n\"That's got to pay your gas, your electric, your water, your council tax and any other bills that may pop up,\" she says. \"And your food. So within a week my money's gone. \n\"I've gone without meals, without clothes. I have one meal a day providing my children have three. It's basic chicken nuggets and chips, fish fingers and chips. The diets are really poor because the money's not there to buy fresh food, to cook fresh meals.\"\nLittle Village founder Sophia Parker, who wrote the report, says Covid had made things \"much worse\" for families who were already struggling.\n\"People have used up savings. People have gone to their families and friends and borrowed what they can,\" she says. \"As a result, we're seeing families who are falling into rent arrears. We're seeing families who are having to rely on high-cost loans.\n\"We're just very worried about where this is going to land for families that are already in a difficult situation.\"\nRachel, not her real name, is a trained nursery practitioner who spent six months in a refuge after fleeing an abusive relationship. \nShe now lives in cramped temporary accommodation with her three-year-old son and nine-month-old daughter. She is employed for a few hours a week by Little Village, but relies for now on universal credit.  \n\"When we came out of the refuge, I looked for full-time work but I couldn't make it pay because of childcare costs,\" she tells me. \"My rent is so high, after bills I'm left with \u00a310 a month for us to live on. I don't drink, smoke or buy clothes. \n\"If my son is invited to a child's birthday party, I die, as I know I have to say no. I can't afford a present. It's very embarrassing to keep asking for help. Little Village did our Christmas. Otherwise there would have been nothing under the tree. \n\"The pandemic has made things more expensive.  We're always home, so electric and gas costs more. Food shopping online costs more too. My children are my reason for everything. But I can't see a way out. I am stuck in a trap.\"\nThe government said it was committed to \"making sure every child gets the best start in life, and this is central to our steadfast determination to level up opportunity across the country\".\nA spokesman said it had targeted its support to families most in need by raising the living wage and spending hundreds of billions to safeguard jobs.\n\"Additionally, we have boosted welfare support by billions, introduced the \u00a3170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme to help children and families during the coldest months, and in April we will be increasing the value of our Healthy Start vouchers by over a third to help those in need with young children.\""
