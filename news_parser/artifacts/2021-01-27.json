      "title": "Covid: Ten South African coronavirus variant cases in Wales",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Merthyr Tydfil,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 10 cases of the South African coronavirus variant identified in Wales, a senior official has said.\nWales' Chief Scientific Adviser Dr Rob Orford said all had been cases recorded in people who had travelled abroad.\nThere are concerns vaccines may not work as well against the variant.\nIt comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that UK nationals and residents returning from a 'red list' of Covid hotspots will have to quarantine in a hotel.\nThe Welsh Government says the move does not go far enough.\nAt least 77 cases of the South Africa variant have been identified in the UK.\nMeanwhile the overall seven-day coronavirus case rate has fallen in Wales to 203.8 cases for every 100,000 individuals - down from 650 before Christmas.\nIt is the lowest point since late November.\nCovid-19 case rates in south Wales in particular have been showing improvements in the last couple of weeks, as lockdown restrictions appear to be having an effect.\nPublic Health Wales said it was confident there was a \"consistent downward\" trend, although numbers were still high and putting pressures on hospitals.\nThe south Wales valleys, Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot have perhaps seen the most dramatic reductions.\nThese include areas which recorded the highest case rates in the UK before Christmas.\nMerthyr Tydfil continues to fall from a peak of 1,349 cases per 100,000 and the UK's highest a week before Christmas. It now has less than 200 cases per 100,000 for the first time since September.\nThere has been a large fall in case rates in Blaenau Gwent as well - from 1,020 cases per 100,000 in mid-December to its lowest rate since early October.\nThere are also encouraging signs in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), where the case rate has dropped below 200 per 100,000 - also its lowest point since September.\nIn Bridgend, the case rate peaked just before Wales was put into a pre-Christmas lockdown on 18 December.\nBut it has fallen back sharply and is just under 226 cases per 100,000 for the first time since the end of November. Its positivity rate has also dropped to below 17%.\nSimilar patterns can be seen in Neath Port Talbot (NPT) - at its lowest point for case rates since mid-October.\nDespite the figures, Chief Medical Officer Frank Atherton said his current advice is that the headroom to relax restrictions is \"really quite limited\".\n\"The emergence of these new variants pose new challenges for us,\" added Dr Orford at Wednesday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, \"because of their potential to alter the course of the pandemic\".\n\"The concern is that a new variant will emerge that won't respond to treatment and vaccines, putting us back to where we began.\"\nThree variants from South Africa and Brazil are being monitored, he said.\nThe Kent strain - which was identified in the UK and is thought to be more contagious - is the dominant strain across Wales, Dr Orford said.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson had said that early evidence suggested it may be more deadly.\nDr Orford did not refer to the prime minister, but he said three studies looking at death rates had \"not been able to say that definitively\".\nHe also said the Kent variant does not appear to have more impact on young and healthy people.\n\"It doesn't seem to have any difference in the way it infects people across the ages, which is really positive\", he said.\nDr Atherton said it is believed that the R number - the rate that coronavirus reproduces - is below 1 - between 0.7 and 0.9.\nHe said that means the size of the current outbreak is \"shrinking rather than growing\", but he said rates were still \"way too high\".\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford is expected to announce the outcome of a 21-day review of lockdown restrictions on Friday.\nBut Dr Atherton said towards the end of February would be the \"time to think about further relaxations\".\n\"We will look again at where we are with community transmission, where we are with the NHS capacity and the business of the NHS, and where we are with vaccination,\" he said.\nA total of 312,305 people have been given their first dose in Wales - 9.9% of the population.\nDr Atherton said the Welsh Government was on course to meet the target of vaccinating everyone in the four priority groups by mid-February.\nThe medical adviser said lessons had to be learned from how restrictions were eased before.\nDr Atherton added: \"What I do say to the first minister and health minister is that we need to learn from what happened when we came out of previous lockdowns - the first lockdown in March, the firebreak in November.\n\"What we saw there was even though rates had come down quite well when we released things, we released them in a way which allowed the virus to re-establish itself very, very quickly.\"\nThe encouraging news from the scientists is that lockdown is working and infection rates are steadily decreasing - so the sacrifices so many people are making are having an impact.  \nBut Frank Atherton made clear he had told ministers, in advance of the latest lockdown review, that there was little room for manoeuvre.\nWhy? First, although the position is much better now than in the spring, infection rates, and positivity rates are still too high.\nThe other big issue is the prevalence of variants. The so called Kent-variant is now dominant across most of Wales, it spreads more easily.\nAlso 10 cases of the South African variant have been confirmed here, and that's a strain which is also causing a lot of concern internationally. \nThe fear is if restrictions are eased too quickly the presence of these variants could make it even more likely that infection could spiral out of control.\nAsked whether he regretted any of the advise he had given in light of the milestone of 100,000 deaths across the UK, the chief medical officer said: \"It took a while for us to learn about the virus.\"\nDr Atherton said different decisions would have been made on protecting care home residents earlier in the pandemic had it been known Covid-19 behaved very differently from flu.\nBut he said he did not think it \"was a mistake\" but was the \"limits of what we knew\".\n\"We started off treating it rather as we treated pandemic flu,\" he said.\n\"This virus has behaved very differently,\" he said. \"I think, had we known that, we would have made some different decisions about, you know, looking after people in care homes.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The EU has warned Covid vaccine producers they must deliver agreed supplies, amid fears reductions could seriously hamper its inoculation drive.\nAstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech have both said production problems mean they cannot supply the expected numbers.\nThe EU warned it could restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc, with Germany's health minister demanding \"fair distribution\".\nThe UK's vaccine minister warned of \"the dead end of vaccine nationalism\".\nAstraZeneca is mainly produced in the UK, while the UK's supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine come from the company's Belgian plant.\nVaccine supply has become a critical issue as nations seek to stem high infection rates.\nSeparately, the German health ministry joined AstraZeneca in strongly denying some reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for its vaccine among older people.\nLast week, AstraZeneca told the EU it was falling behind on its supply target because of production problems and Pfizer-BioNTech has also said supplies of its vaccine will be lower.\nIn response, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has now said companies making Covid vaccines in the bloc will have to \"provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries\".\nShe said the 27-member EU bloc would \"take any action required to protect its citizens\".\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn backed her call, saying: \"This is not about EU first, this is about Europe's fair share.\"\nChancellor Angela Merkel told the virtual version of the annual World Economic Forum, usually held in Davos, there should be a \"fair distribution\" across the world.\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told forum: \"Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines. And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations.\"\nThe row could affect supplies to the UK of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nResponding to the EU's comments, the UK's Minister for Covid Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawi said on Tuesday that supplies were \"tight\" and warned against what he called \"the dead end of vaccine nationalism\", adding: \"No-one is safe until the whole world is safe.\"\nHe said he was confident the UK would receive enough doses to meet its targets - a first dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn.\nThe EU has already faced criticism for the slow rollout of vaccines, which it buys on behalf of all member states.\nMs Kyriakides tweeted that Monday's talks with AstraZeneca \"resulted in dissatisfaction with the lack of clarity and insufficient explanations\".\nShe said the EU had requested \"a detailed planning of vaccine deliveries\" and the next meeting with the company would be held on Wednesday.\nAstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish multinational headquartered in England, said it was \"doing everything it can to bring its vaccine to millions of Europeans as soon as possible\".\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine is being used already in the UK but has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to green light it at the end of this month. \nThe bloc signed a deal in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March.\nLast week, AstraZeneca said \"reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain\" meant the number of initial doses for EU member states would be lower.\nOfficials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year.\nAn AstraZeneca partner plant in Belgium involved in the \"viral vector\" process - the delivery of genetic material into cells - is thought to be the problem.\nBut one German member of the European Parliament, Peter Liese, told Reuters news agency that the statement that there were difficulties in the EU supply chain but not elsewhere was \"flimsy\" and there should be \"no problem to get the vaccine from the UK to the continent\".\nEuropean officials familiar with Monday's EU-AstraZeneca meeting said the company had offered to bring forward deliveries by a week to 7 February, but this did not mean an increase in supplies for the quarter.\nThe Serum Institute of India also produces a large amount of AstraZeneca jabs, but has no immediate plans to divert to the EU.\nOther nations, including Australia and Thailand, have said they have also been told of a drop in AstraZeneca supply.\nThe AstraZeneca reduction is a serious blow in the wake of Pfizer-BioNTech's statement.\nPfizer-BioNTech said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian plant.\nThe EU has ordered 600 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, which is already being used on patients around the bloc.\nUrsula von der Leyen has pledged to inoculate 70% of adults in the EU by the end of August.\nBy Stephanie Hegarty, BBC Population correspondent\nAs the diplomatic tussle goes on between vaccine-producing countries in Europe there could be a rare bit of good news for the rest of the world, including the lower-income countries already struggling to secure a supply. \nCovax, an initiative spearheaded by the World Health Organization that aims to distribute vaccines around the world more fairly, says it doesn't expect its supply of vaccines to be affected. \nMost of that supply is coming from a producer in India with some also manufactured in South Korea. \nCovax says it's on schedule to deliver its first vaccines in lower-income countries in February, helped by the fact that the US under President Joe Biden recently committed $4bn (\u00a33.5bn) to the scheme.\nGermany's health ministry on Tuesday firmly denied reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for AstraZeneca among the elderly.\nThe reports, including in the Handelsblatt economic daily, cited sources saying the efficacy was as low as 8% in the over 65s.\nBut the ministry said its review of the data in the reports \"did not allow this assumption\" and that it \"appears that two things have been mixed up in the reports\".\nAstraZeneca issued a statement saying the reports were \"completely incorrect\", adding: \"In November, we published data in The Lancet demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100% of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose.\"\nUK Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the reports had created \"confusion and concern\" and risked \"adding to the spread of disinformation\"."

      "text": "Tesla reported record deliveries in the fourth quarter, boosted by increased demand for electric vehicles.\nBut its shares fell in after-hours trading after profit fell short of analyst expectations.\nWhile many car firms were hit hard in 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic, Tesla bucked the trend.\nIts shares surged nearly 700% over the year, making it the world's most valuable carmaker.\nGovernments around the world have been \"setting tougher targets for switching to electric vehicles\", helping to increase interest in Tesla, said Rebecca Crook, chief growth officer at digital agency Somo.\n\"Tesla had an incredibly successful 2020, joining the likes of Amazon as the unofficial 'winners' of a turbulent year,\" she said.\n\"It's been a challenging past 12 months for car manufacturers,\" she said. \"It's critical for Tesla to maintain this momentum because its success sends optimism into the wider automotive industry.\"\nTesla, which is led by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, saw steady sales and profitable quarters in 2020 as other car manufacturers were hit by the effects of the Covid-19 crisis.\nBut the race is on in the car industry to develop electric vehicles to meet emissions targets and challenge Tesla's market lead.\nThe company delivered 180,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a quarterly record, even though it narrowly missed its overall 2020 goal of half a million deliveries.\nNet income, excluding share-based compensation payouts to Mr Musk, rose to $903m (\u00a3660m) from $386m last year, falling short of average analyst expectations for a $1.08bn quarterly profit.\nThis combined with a lack of a clear target for 2021 vehicle deliveries sent shares down 4% in after-hours trade. Investors had hoped for a significant increase over the company's 2020 delivery goal of half a million vehicles.\n\"Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. In some years we may grow faster, which we expect to be the case in 2021,\" Tesla said in a statement.\nBut investor focus was \"always going to be on profitability\", which was lower than the market had expected, said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"We think that reflects the shift from premium Model S and X vehicles to lower priced Model 3s and Model Ys,\" he said.\n\"Tesla will argue... as more vehicles are fed through production lines profitability will improve. That's true, but it relies on global demand for an ever-increasing number of Teslas.\"\nThe good news for Tesla is that electric vehicles have caught the public imagination, said Mr Hyett, adding that Joe Biden's entrance to the White House will probably mean more focus on electric vehicles.\n\"However, an increasingly competitive landscape means Tesla will have to work harder in the future,\" he said.\nAt present Tesla is heavily reliant on selling carbon credits to rivals, but as those rivals begin producing electric vehicles of their own, that demand will fall, he added."

      "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has forced the cancellation of many much-loved events and traditions but the good people of New Orleans were not going to let it ruin their annual Mardi Gras.\nWhen the mayor of the Louisiana city announced that the raucous, crowd-filled street carnival parades would not be going ahead, residents decided to turn their houses into floats instead. \nThousands have been transformed for the two-week long carnival that runs until Ash Wednesday on 17 February. In the picture below, you can see The Queen's Jubilee House.\nA special project was set up encouraging home-owners to hire the many artists who would normally have months of work preparing for the event. \nRen\u00e9 Pierre's company usually looks after 75 floats during Mardi Gras and he has managed to get contracts to build 53 house floats. \n\"My wife and I were trying to sleep one night, and we kept hearing notifications coming from the website. It was like instant success. It was incredible,\" he told CNN.\nThere were a variety of themes such as this reference to the Bernie Sanders meme from last month's presidential inauguration. \nAnd this homage to influential women including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who died last year. \nThe idea for the house floats came from a carnival regular, Megan Joy Boudreaux, who had suggested it in a post on Twitter after the mayor's announcement in November.\n\"It doesn't matter if your budget is zero and you're recycling cardboard boxes, or whether your budget is tens of thousands of dollars and you've got a mansion on St Charles. We want everyone who wants to do this to participate,\" she told the New York Times.  \nShe said she had expected a few friends and neighbours to join in, but by the beginning of January more than 9,000 people had signed up - some as far afield as the UK and Australia, the AP reports.\nSome homes were decorated in honour of musicians, like this house below that paid tribute to former New Orleans resident and jazz clarinet payer Pete Fountain.\nAnd this house which referenced country music star Dolly Parton. \nThere were also tributes to musician Dr John.\nAnd others evoked Zydeco music pioneers Boozoo Chavis and Clifton Chenier and the 'Cajun Hank Williams', DL Menard.\nAn online map of the decorated houses is being made available for people to visit in their own time and, it is hoped, in a socially-distanced way.\nAll pictures subject to copyright."

      "text": "Ministers are being urged to reveal more information about the coronavirus milestones they need to see for children to return to classrooms.\nThe children's commissioner for Wales said \"calm, reassuring\" messages would be helpful to address pupils' anxiety.\nMeasures including school and college closures will be reviewed on Friday.\nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford has already said even after the February half-term, all pupils are unlikely to return full time.\nCommissioner Sally Holland said she did not expect the Welsh Government to provide a timetable, but more information was needed about the evidence being considered.\n\"I think what would be most helpful now would be to hear from government some transparent, calm and reassuring information about how they will make those difficult decisions going forward,\" she said.\n\"So what evidence will they be looking for and what milestones will they have had to achieve in order to have partial or full return of children and young people to school?\n\"I think that there's a lot of anxiety out there and we're hearing that from children and young people but also of course staff need to know where they are, as do parents,\" she added.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams has said she would look at \"every possible option\" in order to resume some face-to-face teaching, including prioritising some year groups.\nJane Jenkins, headteacher of Moorland Primary School in Cardiff, believes with virus levels high it still feels \"very risky\" to have classrooms full with 30 children and two adults.\nWhen there is a move to start getting children back to face-to-face-teaching, she would prefer a rota system rather than focusing only on some year groups.\n\"I think that causes a lot of problems for families where they've got a child in a year group that comes in every day, other children that never attend - I think that's a tricky model, certainly from a primary perspective,\" she said.\n\"I think, for me, the best way forward would be to look at a part-time return to school for all children so we could be looking at maybe half size classes - children would attend half the week. \n\"That might be a more realistic model than having certain year groups in and others not.\"\nThere are ongoing discussions between the government, local authorities and unions.\nThe National Education Union Cymru (NEU) said there needs to be distancing of at least one metre between pupils in all schools and colleges instead of \"bubbles\" which can sometimes be the size of whole year groups. \n\"We need to ensure that there are reviews of all risk assessments in light of the new and evidently more transmissible and possibly more dangerous variants,\" Mary van den Heuvel, the NEU's Wales policy officer, said.\n\"We need to see rotas in place, so we can have fewer children in the classroom and ensure that they're social distancing and we need to see masks worn by everybody in the classroom particularly in secondary schools\".\nThe unions as well as opposition parties continue to call for school staff to be prioritised in the vaccination programme.\nSuzy Davies MS, the Welsh Conservatives' education spokesperson, said vaccinating school and college staff after the four main priority groups is the key to \"rescuing education\".\nShe said if the review of restrictions concludes that schools and colleges are to remain closed to most pupils, then the education minister must set out a clear plan.\n\"That means the minister making decisions about specific year groups going back, rotas, using other community facilities to help manage social distancing,\" she said.\n\"Delays beyond half-term take us beyond too many tipping points; learning, children and young people's social skills, their mental health, the mental health of staff and parents trying to fight an ever more difficult battle to supervise learning at home.\"\nPlaid Cymru Shadow Education Minister, Si\u00e2n Gwenllian MS, said: \"Good communication is essential but unfortunately clarity is lacking when it comes to the reopening of schools in Wales. \n\"This is causing confusion and undermining confidence. \n\"Welsh Government must issue its plan on how and when it intends to open schools safely to give parents the reassurance that, when schools are reopened, their children will be as safe as possible.\"\nMs Williams said rotas \"potentially have a part to play\" - an approach previously suggested by unions. \nWhether pupils took turns daily or weekly to go to school, it would mean fewer pupils on site at any one time, potentially allowing more distancing or smaller contact groups.\nPriority for some year groups has also been discussed, such as older children studying for important qualifications and the very youngest children who struggle to learn remotely. \nOr could schools in areas with lower Covid-19 case rates return first? This has been mentioned as a potential approach to get as many pupils as possible back in the classroom as quickly as possible.\nAdjusting school term times has been mentioned by Ms Williams on more than one occasion, but plans to shift term times hit the buffers last year.\nA proposal to move the summer holidays earlier so children could return to school last August was abandoned due to unions' concerns, and only three local authorities ended up adding an extra week to the summer term.\nHowever Ms Williams has said \"changes to the pattern of the school year is long overdue\" and a long summer away from the classroom \"does huge damage particularly to our most disadvantaged learners\".

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The PM has said he hopes a \"gradual and phased\" relaxation of Covid restrictions can begin in early March.\nBoris Johnson told MPs he intended to set out a plan for how the lockdown in England could be eased and the criteria involved in the final week of February.\nFactors will include death and hospitalisation numbers, progress of vaccinations and changes in the virus.\nHe has ruled out schools in England re-opening after the February half term, instead setting an 8 March target. \nIn a statement to Parliament, Mr Johnson said the scientific data was not sufficiently clear to make any decisions now but he hoped to publish a detailed roadmap in just under a month's time as the \"picture became clearer\". \nHe also announced plans for tighter border restrictions to combat new variants of Covid, confirming all those arriving from high-risk countries will have to quarantine in hotels and other accommodation for 10 days. \nThe PM, who is under pressure from Tory MPs to spell out how the current lockdown will end, said relaxing restrictions would depend on emerging data about how effectively the vaccine stops virus transmission.\nHe signalled any easing of restrictions would start with schools, setting a potential re-opening date of 8 March - when he said he hoped the 15 million or so people in the top four vulnerable groups earmarked for vaccinations by mid-February will have had their jabs and have full protection.\n\"Our aim will be to set out a gradual and phased approach to easing the restrictions in a sustainable way,\" he said, adding that the \"first sign of normality\" should be pupils returning to school.\nHe added: \"We hope it will be safe to begin the re-opening of schools from 8 March with other economic and social restrictions being removed thereafter as the data permits.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said reopening schools should be a national priority and urged the government to vaccinate teachers and support staff during the February half term.\nLabour is also calling for the government to prioritise key workers in critical professions, seeing them added to the first phase of the vaccination programme, alongside those might likely to become seriously ill.\nCases are falling and the vaccination programme is going well. So why is the government waiting?\nFirstly, there are doubts about how fast infections are falling. \nWhile the daily figures show they have almost halved in just over a fortnight, the government's surveillance programmes which involve random testing suggest the drop may be slower.\nIt is unclear why there is this discrepancy, but understanding the true trajectory is crucial to knowing what will happen to pressures on hospitals.\nWhat impact the vaccination programme has will also be vital.\nEarly results from Israel, which is leading the world on vaccination, suggest cases in older age groups start falling three weeks after significant numbers are vaccinated. But ministers want to see that pattern repeated here.\nThey also want to know what effect vaccination has on transmission - it is possible vaccinated people can still transmit the infection even if they are protected from illness.\nThis will not be completely clear by March, but scientists should at least have a better idea. \nWhen a plan for exiting lockdown is set out, the government wants to be certain it can be kept to. But given the cost of lockdown the pressure to lift restrictions will grow if progress keeps being made.\nLast week, chair of the Covid Recovery Group Conservative MP Mark Harper said if the government meets its 15 February vaccination deadline, then ministers should begin easing lockdown by 8 March.\nHe welcomed the announcement from the prime minster.\nUnder the current lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons such as food shopping and exercise.\nSimilar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nEngland's lockdown laws are due to end on 31 March. Mr Johnson has previously said this date is to allow for a \"controlled\" easing of restrictions back into local tiers.\nUnder the tier system, different rules are applied to different parts of the country, depending on factors such as pressure on the NHS, number of cases and rates at which case numbers fall.\nPupils in England are not expected to return to school before the February half term. Mr Johnson has said schools will be reopened \"as soon as we can\" but did not guarantee that would happen before Easter.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said restrictions in Scotland will continue until mid-February at the earliest. \nIn Wales, the lockdown will be reviewed at the end of January, but the government has previously said it does not see \"much headroom for change\".\nNorthern Ireland's lockdown has been extended until 5 March."

I'm furious.\"\nMr Gething responded by saying: \"Don won't be forgotten.\"\n\"We've got very clear priorities so people over the age of 80, our care home residents and our front-line health and care staff are the priority in this phase of the vaccination,\" he added.\n\"Don will be hearing shortly because we're confident that we're going to make much more progress, we're confident that we're going to be inviting over 70s for vaccinations in every area of Wales before the end of the week.\"  \nHe said more than 9% of the population in Wales had received a vaccine, adding: \"We have the fifth best vaccination programme in the world.\"\nThe Senedd leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies said: \"Sadly, they had a stuttering start here in Wales.\n\"All the vaccinators and the teams are working tirelessly and dedicatedly across Wales to make sure this programme is a success, but regrettably they've been led very poorly by the Welsh Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay.\"\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said he did not think \"blaming snow over the weekend holds water\".\n\"Snow did cause problems in certain areas but the problem was that you were still on 24% of over-80s in the middle of last week,\" he added. \"There was too high a mountain to climb.\""

      "text": "Scotland could introduce tougher quarantine rules for international travellers than other parts of the UK, the first minister has said. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that UK arrivals from regions with new virus variants will be provided accommodation for 10 days to isolate.\nNicola Sturgeon said she was \"concerned the proposal does not go far enough\".\nScotland will \"initially emulate\" the UK government measures, she said.\nBut further Scottish rules will be set out next week if the four nations do not reach an agreement on a UK-wide approach - which Ms Sturgeon said would be preferable. \nThe prime minister has said there are 22 countries with the risk of known new variants, including the South American nations, Portugal and South Africa.\nMr Johnson said anyone travelling from these countries who cannot be refused entry to the UK - such as British citizens - will be provided accommodation for 10 days to isolate \"without exception\".\nThey will be met at the airport and transferred to specific places, such as hotels.\nFurther details of the plan are expected to be outlined by Home Secretary Priti Patel later. \nHowever Ms Sturgeon - who was briefed on the UK government proposals in advance - told her daily coronavirus briefing that a \"comprehensive system of supervised quarantine\" was required in the next stage of the pandemic.\nAnd she said she was \"seeking urgently\" to persuade the UK government \"to go much further\" while providing additional support to the aviation industry. \nThe first minister said: \"Our best route back to greater domestic normality right now, as we continue with the vaccine programme, is firstly to suppress the virus here to as low as level as possible - as we did over the summer - then give ourselves a better chance of controlling it through test and protect, and next by doing much more than we did last year to protect our borders.\"\nThe Welsh government has also said the PM's proposals do not go far enough.\nWhen questioned by journalists, Ms Sturgeon said she would \"not give arbitrary dates\" on when the travel restrictions might come to an end.\nBut she said people \"might not be able to go on holiday overseas\" in order to \"get domestic normality\" back - including the reopening of schools and allowing people more interactions with loved ones.\n\"I'm not saying that's easy but maybe that might be a price we all need to be prepared to pay,\" she added.\nScottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross told the BBC that he believed that countries with higher infection rates and strains with quicker transmission should be prioritised.\n\"We've got to look at dealing with this in stages,\" he said. \"This doesn't need to be dragged into a Scotland versus England issue or the rest of the UK issue.\n\"This is as big an issue within Scotland. We shouldn't be moving around local authority areas so whether it's north or south of the border or within our own communities we've got to reduce travel as much as possible.\"\nIt comes as the deaths of a further 92 people who had tested positive for coronavirus were recorded in Scotland - bringing the total to 5,888.\nThe total number of deaths across the UK by that measure passed the grim milestone of 100,00 on Tuesday.\nMs Sturgeon said she was \"truly sorry\" for any mistakes that had been made in the handling of the pandemic. \nShe added: \"She said the death toll should make all political leaders \"think very hard about what more we could have done and what lessons we must continue to learn\".\nShe added: \"I know that I, and everyone in my government, have tried every day to do everything we possibly can.\n\"But I don't think any of us, reflecting on numbers like these, can conclude that we have always succeeded.\"\nA total of 1,330 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, representing 6.2% of people tested.\nMeanwhile 462,092 people have received the first dose of the vaccine in Scotland - including 56% of the over 80s and 95% of people in care homes."

      "tags": "Department for Work & Pensions,Nottingham",
      "text": "Authorities who dealt with a benefits claim from a single mother, who took a fatal overdose after her payments were cut, made 28 errors in managing her case, a coroner has found.\nPhilippa Day, 27, was found collapsed at her Nottingham home beside a letter rejecting her request for an at-home benefits assessment in August 2019.\nShe died after two months in a coma.\nNottingham Coroner's Court heard the way her claim was dealt with was the \"predominant factor\" in her overdose.\nRecording a narrative conclusion, coroner Gordon Clow said he could not determine whether she intended to die rather than put her life at risk.\nMiss Day, who had been diagnosed with unstable personality disorder, had been receiving disabled living allowance (DLA) payments as she had type 1 diabetes. \nThose payments stopped in January 2019 after she made an application for a personal independence payment (PIP), reducing her income from \u00a3228 a week to \u00a360. \nThis, the inquest heard, was because a form she had sent went missing and her payments were not reinstated for months, despite her eligibility. \nThis led to her taking out short-term loans and ending up in debt.\nThe court heard in June, she called the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to say she was \"starving\" and \"couldn't survive like this for much longer\".\nShe was then asked to attend a face-to-face assessment despite it being \"distressing\" for her, Mr Clow said. \nThe coroner added Miss Day's mental health problems were \"exacerbated\" by the benefits process.\nHe accepted it had been \"the last straw\" for Miss Day who was already experiencing a range of stressors. \nHe said: \"Were it not for this problem, it is not likely that she would have [overdosed] on the 7th or 8th of August.\"\nCall handlers repeatedly failed to flag that the case required \"additional support\" due to her mental health problems, the coroner said.\nThe DWP did not tell her community psychiatric nurse that she had not returned the form before refusing her application, which could have resolved the issue.\nThe coroner said call handlers received little to no training on personality disorders like Miss Day's - all that was available was a factsheet.\nCapita was made aware of the risks to Miss Day's health from a face-to-face interview by her community psychiatric nurse, but did not act on it, he added.\nMr Clow said: \"Given the sheer number of problems in the handling of her claim, I am unable to conclude that each of these was attributable to individual human error.\"\nHe concluded the failure to administer her benefit claim in a way that avoided exacerbating her mental health problems was the \"predominant factor\" that caused Miss Day to overdose.\nMr Clow recommended changes at both the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Capita, the authorities involved.\nIn a prevention of future deaths report, Mr Clow said the DWP should consider timely mental health training for call handlers and address \"poor record keeping\".\nThe DWP and Capita were also directed to review the change of assessment process so that it does not \"create unnecessary distress\". \nA spokesman for the DWP said: \"This is a deeply tragic case. Our sincere condolences are with Miss Day's family and we will carefully consider the coroner's findings.\"\nA Capita spokesman said the company also apologised for the mistakes made.\n\"We have strengthened our processes over the last 18 months and are committed to continuously working to deliver a high-quality, empathetic service for every claimant,\" he said. \n\"In partnership with the DWP, we will act upon the coroner's findings and make further improvements to our processes.\"   \nThis conclusion amounts to a near dismantling of the process for applying for the main disability benefit for people with psychiatric problems.\nWhile around 40% of claimants for personal independence payments have mental health conditions, the inquest found that call handlers for the DWP didn't receive adequate mental health training.  \nThe coroner found there was an \"institutional assumption\" in the DWP that problems with a claim were the claimants' fault.  \nLast year a report from the National Audit Office (NAO) found the department had investigated 69 suicides of benefit claimants since 2014-15.  \nThere were more cases they could have looked into, said the NAO, but in any case the department couldn't demonstrate any improvements from their investigations had actually been implemented.  \nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "title": "Covid deaths: Why is the UK's death toll so bad?",
      "tags": "Mers virus,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 100,000 people in the UK have died from a virus, that, this time last year, felt like a far-off foreign threat. How did we come to be one of the countries with the worst death tolls?\nThere is no quick answer to that question, and there is sure to be a long and detailed public inquiry once the pandemic is over. But there are plenty of clues that, when pieced together, help build a picture of why the UK has reached this devastating number.\nSome will point a finger at the government - its decision to lock-down later than much of western Europe, the stuttering start to its test-and-trace network and the lack of protection afforded to care home residents.\nOthers will spotlight deeper rooted problems with British society - its poor state of public health, with high levels of obesity, for example.\nOthers, still, will note that some of the UK's great strengths - its position as a vibrant hub for international air travel, its ethnically diverse and densely-packed urban populations - exposed its vulnerability to a virus that spreads effortlessly between people.\nIn some people's eyes, the UK's island status might have helped it.  New Zealand, Australia and Taiwan managed to stop the virus getting a foothold and deaths have been kept to a minimum - Australia has seen fewer deaths throughout the pandemic than the UK is recording every day on average.\nAll introduced strict border restrictions immediately and lockdowns to contain the virus before it had spread. The UK did not. It was not until June that quarantine rules were introduced for all arrivals and even then travel corridors were soon set up, relaxing the rules for travellers from certain countries. Only this month were these scrapped.\nProf Devi Sridhar, an expert in public health from Edinburgh University, is one of those who has been critical of the approach the UK has taken from the start.\nShe says the UK, like much of Europe, was \"complacent\" about the threat of infectious disease -  choosing to treat the new coronavirus \"like flu\" and allowing it to spread, while talking about the desire to achieve herd immunity.\nThis all changed in late March, when a full lockdown eventually came. But there was a crucial delay of a week which is estimated to have cost more than 20,000 lives, according to government modeller Prof Neil Ferguson, because of how quickly infection rates were doubling at that point. \nThis, of course, is said with the benefit of hindsight. Government modellers themselves acknowledge the data was \"really quite poor\" making it difficult to make a decision that would have significant repercussions. It is a point acknowledged by Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser. Speaking in the summer he said there had been \"very limited information\" in early March.\nBy then, the virus was ripping through care homes. Around 30% of deaths in the first wave happened in care homes; 40% if you include care home residents who died in hospital.\nThose at the heart of government acknowledge mistakes were made. UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said recently: \"The lesson is go earlier than you think you want to, go harder than you think you want to, and go a bit broader than you think you want to in terms of applying the restrictions.\"\nBy May, restrictions were beginning to be eased. But was this too soon?\nThe government seized on the relative lull to focus on building what the prime minister promised would be a \"world-beating\" test-and-trace system. The idea was that new outbreaks could be nipped in the bud, with comprehensive tracking by a centralised team of tracers.\nThe mere fact this had to be done some months after the virus had struck, illustrates another factor behind the high number of deaths - the UK was simply not prepared for a pandemic of this nature in the way some Asian nations had been. Countries such as South Korea and Taiwan had established test-and-trace systems in place that were ready to be activated.\nThe UK had a chance to bed in its system in the summer but it was riven with teething problems, with tracers struggling to reach many contacts and the testing capacity slowing down as demand rose.\nLow levels of infection over the summer had created a false sense of security.\nDesperate to boost the economy, the government launched the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, offering people discounted meals out during August. To what extent it contributed to the rise in the autumn is much argued about but certainly some doctors blame it in part for an increase in patients seen.\nThe truth is the virus never went away. Testing in the summer showed even at the lowest levels there were still around 500 cases a day being diagnosed - and random testing in the population subsequently showed the true level may have been twice that.\nIn late August around 1,000 people a day were testing positive. By mid-September that had trebled and from there it rose five-fold to 15,000 by mid October. The numbers testing positive have never returned below 10,000 a day on average since.\nAnother decision that has been heavily criticised was the refusal of ministers to introduce a short two-week lockdown, or \"circuit breaker\", in September - despite their advisers on Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) recommending such a step. The argument was it would have set the spread of the virus back by at least a month, giving test and trace time to regroup.\nWales, however, did introduce its own \"fire-breaker\" - a 17-day lockdown in October. It got infection rates down, but as soon as it was lifted they rebounded. This is, of course, why lockdowns have been criticised.\nEdinburgh University infectious diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, one of the modellers who feeds data into Sage, is on the record in the autumn questioning the logic of them for this very reason. It remains up for debate how effective a circuit-breaker would actually have been.\nThis after all is the time of year when respiratory illnesses start to increase. Schools had returned as had university students, creating new environments for the novel coronavirus to spread.\nWhen a lockdown was eventually introduced in England in November it was to last four weeks, with Sage members lamenting the delay. \"The absence of a decision is a decision in itself,\" says Wellcome Trust director Sir Jeremy Farrar.\nBut even before that lockdown was lifted cases had started going up in the south-east of England. Within weeks it became clear what was happening. The virus had mutated and a new faster-spreading variant was on the rise. \nBy mid-December the clamour for lockdown was growing again, but the plan for a Christmas relaxation of restrictions had already been announced. In every nation of the UK, ministers waited.\nAt the start of 2021, with hospital admissions rising rapidly, the UK's four chief medical officers intervened, issuing a joint statement warning the NHS was at \"material risk\" of being overwhelmed. Within hours the UK was back in lockdown.\nWhat has struck some is just how similar the mistakes have been in terms of locking down late. \n\"It will take years to unpick why Covid has gone so badly in the UK,\" says University College London infectious diseases expert Dr Neil Stone. \"But the failure to learn from wave one stands out.\"\nBut it must also be recognised that there are factors outside the control of the government - certainly in terms of its pandemic response - that have contributed to the high number of deaths.\nOne of the reasons the virus was able to take a hold and spread so quickly was because of geography and the fact the UK - and London in particular - is a global hub. Genetic analysis has shown the virus was brought into the UK on at least 1,300 separate occasions, mainly from France, Spain and Italy, by the end of March. \nIt was here before we knew it. That's not something Australia or New Zealand had to deal with on such a scale. \nDensity of population is also a factor. The UK is among the 10 most densely populated big nations - those with populations of more than 20 million. What is more, our cities are more inter-connected than they are in many places.\nIt meant the virus was able to seed everywhere quite quickly. Contrast this with Italy which saw the vast majority of cases in the north of the country in the first wave.\nThe ageing population also needs to be taken into account. Once you do this, and adjust for the size of the population - known as age-standardised mortality - deaths have risen, but not by as much as some of the headline figures suggest.\nThe health of the nation has also been a factor. The UK has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world. And obesity increases the risk of hospitalisation and death, according to Public Health England. One study found the risk of death was almost double for those who are severely obese.\nConditions such as diabetes, kidney disease and respiratory problems also increase the risk - a fifth of Covid deaths have listed diabetes on the death certificate.\nAgain the UK has relatively high rates of these illnesses.\nBut many have argued that these high levels of ill-health have been compounded by the levels of inequality in the UK.\nLevels of ill health and life expectancy have always been worst in the poorest areas, but the pandemic certainly seems to have exacerbated this.\nOffice for National Statistics data shows mortality rates have been twice as high in deprived areas as they have been in wealthy areas. The Health Foundation is carrying out its own inquiry into the issue, arguing the Covid death toll needs to be seen through the \"lens\" of inequality to fully understand it.\nIt is something that has also been raised by Prof Michael Marmot, one of the country's leading experts on health inequalities. \"The UK's dismal record is telling us something important about our society.\"\nAll photographs subject to copyright\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by bereavement, here is a list of organisations that may be able to help."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from France have to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. \nThe government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. \nFrench authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France.\nBeta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa.\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants.\nThese tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. \nMost are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. \nSome of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations.\nBeta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled \"variants of concern\". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on.\nBeta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. \nAnother mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. \nThere is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people.\nAs with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions.\nVaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. \nThere is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections.\nBut experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary.\nA trial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK.\nSome of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. \nThe Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. \nSo far, the UK has recorded just over 1,000 cases of Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. \nSouth Africa has reported higher cases of Beta.\nWhen it was first identified in the UK, the government recommended surge testing in the community in some regions to help stop the spread. \nA system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. \nAlthough adults who were fully jabbed in the UK now no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. \nThey will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious. \nUK scientists are tracking variants, including Beta, to learn more and are providing genomic sequencing help to other countries so that they can do the same.

      "text": "When Kim Kingston lost her husband to cancer, she had no idea she could be cut out from government support because she inherited money from his pension.\nWhen the coronavirus crisis struck, Kim's work was cut off by the lockdown.\nBut she has received nothing from government schemes designed to help support the self-employed.\nKim, from Southsea in Portsmouth, is among millions shut out from help, many of whom could easily be included if the government chose to, research shows.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which carried out its research for the BBC, concludes there is \"clear unfairness\" in some of the exclusions. \nThe government said it had \"designed and provided one of the most generous self-employed income support schemes in the world\".\nThe Treasury's position is that self-employment support has been targeted at lower earners and those most reliant on trading income, and that many people may be eligible for other government support.\nKim, who is also a make-up artist, lost her husband David to cancer in November 2018, \nShe refused to let her clients down, keeping up her work between visits to her husband David as he lay in hospital with a brain tumour. \n\"I don't think you can ever fully adjust to losing someone who's been in your life for so long. \n\"We did everything together; we had a good marriage. He was my best friend - he was a wonderful, wonderful man.\" \nWhen he died Kim poured energy into her work, even as she grieved and supported her children, using money passed to her from David's pension scheme to redevelop The Beauty Shed, her business premises in the rear garden of her family home in Southsea. \n\"I had a little wooden shed and used that as my treatment room. It was always my dream to have something bigger that was purpose-built for everything I needed it to do.\n\"By using that pension to build my dream - and David's dream as well - was amazing because I know if he was here he would think: 'This is fantastic'.\"\nIn 2019 her business took off. \"In 2019 I did 54 weddings, travelling all over the south coast. It's a job I thoroughly enjoy doing - it's great to be part of someone's biggest day of their lives. But then in 2020 because of the pandemic it collapsed - I've only done four.\"\n\"[Chancellor] Rishi Sunak stood up and said no-one would be forgotten. No one would be left behind. So I felt a massive sense of relief, because I could work, that my business would be looked after - which clearly it hasn't been because I've been excluded from any help.\" \n\"Boris Johnson keeps saying the government's doing 'everything we can'. But they are not - they're just not.\"\nWhen the pandemic struck in the spring of 2020, she was shocked to learn that the money from David's pension ruled her out of the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme. \nHer Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) treated it as income, and because it was slightly larger than her income from self-employment in 2018/19, she fell foul of a rule excluding people who earn less than 50% of their income from self-employment. \n\"I still can't get my head round the fact that a dead person's money can be seen as an income. My accountant couldn't explain it to me. The rule is supposed to stop people claiming because they have another job. So basically I'm being told my dead husband's pension money is another job.\"\nHMRC estimates that 1.4 million people aren't eligible for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme because their income from self-employment is less than half of their overall income.\nMany are ruled out because they top up modest pension incomes with part-time jobs or self-employment.\nResearch body the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there was \"clear unfairness\" in some of the exclusions.\nThe IFS found 1.3 million people excluded by that rule could be included at a cost of less than \u00a3800m for three months. \nA further 225,000 people are excluded by a rule that means you are ineligible if you earn more than \u00a350,000. \nThey could also be included at a cost of \u00a31.3bn over three months - or less if support was reduced for higher earners. \nThat compares to around \u00a390bn that the government expects to spend on furlough and self-employment. \nIFS director Paul Johnson told the Today programme that for some people, their self-employment pay \"is very small indeed, but for some its an important part of their income\" and that losing it all is \"creating  serious hardship\".\nThe money needed to support those excluded is \"a very small percentage of the self employment scheme itself and 1% of the self employment scheme and the furlough scheme together.\"\n\"The Treasury have drawn a line, in a sense very generously for most, and then just put a complete cut off for other groups,\" he said.\nTo extend it \"would be relatively cheap and it would certainly help some people who are clearly in significant trouble.\"\nHe told the BBC: \"It may be a minority but it's certainly left some people with real, big problems. If your income goes down from \u00a355,000 to nothing through no fault of your own, you are clearly in big trouble,\" he said.\nResearch by Standard Life Foundation suggests that 3.8 million adults have lost earnings because of anti-virus measures yet received nothing from either the furlough or the self-employed schemes.\nThis includes those excluded from the self-employed schemes and those denied furlough and instead made redundant. \nStandard Life Foundation chief executive Mubin Haq said: \"At the start of the pandemic the Chancellor promised workers they would be supported. Millions have but far too many, who've worked hard and paid their taxes have been left high and dry. Too many are struggling to pay for food and everyday essentials.\"\nA Treasury spokesperson said: \"As the IFS acknowledge, the government has designed and provided one of the most generous self-employed income support schemes in the world which has helped nearly 3 million people claim almost \u00a320bn pounds.\n \"The scheme is targeted to provide support to those most in need - lower earners and those that rely solely on their self-employment income.\n\"Many of those who do not qualify will benefit from other measure in our unprecedented \u00a3280bn package of support, such as furlough.\n\"We acknowledge that it has not been possible to support everyone in the way they might want, but we continue to work with stakeholders and keep our schemes under review.\"\nDo you think that you've been unfairly excluded from government support during the pandemic?

      "text": "The limit on a single payment using contactless card technology could rise to \u00a3100 - more than double the current limit.\nThe coronavirus pandemic led to larger amounts spent via contactless payments on debit cards, credit cards, and cards connected to smartphones.\nIt has been less than a year since the limit was raised from \u00a330 to \u00a345.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it will consult \"shortly\" on a change in the rules.\n\"It is important that payments regulation keeps pace with consumer and merchant expectations,\" the regulator said. \n\"Recognising changing behaviour in how people pay, as part of a wider consultation, we will shortly be seeking views on amending our rules to allow for a possible increase in the\u00a0contactless\u00a0limit to \u00a3100.\"\nThe FCA can set the boundaries for payments, under its rules, but the card issuers would have the power to set the actual limits.\nThe use of contactless technology by consumers has risen sharply in recent years, with more services adopting the technology and most shops offering it as an option.\nTo protect workers and consumers during the Covid outbreak, an increase to the current limit of \u00a345 was rushed through by the regulator in April last year.\nThe latest figures show that the proportion of contactless payments had fallen slightly compared with pre-pandemic levels, because lockdown measures hit the use of pubs, restaurant, and public transport. They accounted for 41% of card transactions.\nHowever, there was a 16% increase in the total value of contactless payments in the UK in October, compared with the same month a year earlier, the latest data from UK Finance - which represents banks - shows.\nThe amount spent on contactless hit a monthly record in August, boosted by the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and fewer coronavirus-related restrictions. A total of \u00a38.4bn was spent on credit and debit cards using contactless during that month.\n\"The industry believes that a more flexible approach could be merited in future, which takes into account consumer demand, fraud prevention, security and convenience,\" said a spokesman for UK Finance.\n\"Contactless is one of a range of payment methods and the industry will also continue to work closely with the regulator to ensure that customers can pay in a way that suits them.\"\nHowever, there may be less enthusiasm from some shopkeepers concerned about higher-value theft as a result of the proposed changes.\nAndrew Cregan, payments policy advisor at the British Retail Consortium, said: \"We have concerns about raising the contactless limit, with losses from incomplete contactless payments at self-checkouts currently costing retailers millions in lost revenue. \n\"Card companies should take measures to reduce incomplete payments and we urge customers to make sure their own transactions always go through. However, the overwhelming priority at the moment must be for the government to address the rocketing card fees.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The PM has said he hopes a \"gradual and phased\" relaxation of Covid restrictions can begin in early March.\nBoris Johnson told MPs he intended to set out a plan for how the lockdown in England could be eased and the criteria involved in the final week of February.\nFactors will include death and hospitalisation numbers, progress of vaccinations and changes in the virus.\nHe has ruled out schools in England re-opening after the February half term, instead setting an 8 March target. \nIn a statement to Parliament, Mr Johnson said the scientific data was not sufficiently clear to make any decisions now but he hoped to publish a detailed roadmap in just under a month's time as the \"picture became clearer\". \nHe also announced plans for tighter border restrictions to combat new variants of Covid, confirming all those arriving from high-risk countries will have to quarantine in hotels and other accommodation for 10 days. \nThe PM, who is under pressure from Tory MPs to spell out how the current lockdown will end, said relaxing restrictions would depend on emerging data about how effectively the vaccine stops virus transmission.\nHe signalled any easing of restrictions would start with schools, setting a potential re-opening date of 8 March - when he said he hoped the 15 million or so people in the top four vulnerable groups earmarked for vaccinations by mid-February will have had their jabs and have full protection.\n\"Our aim will be to set out a gradual and phased approach to easing the restrictions in a sustainable way,\" he said, adding that the \"first sign of normality\" should be pupils returning to school.\nHe added: \"We hope it will be safe to begin the re-opening of schools from 8 March with other economic and social restrictions being removed thereafter as the data permits.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said reopening schools should be a national priority and urged the government to vaccinate teachers and support staff during the February half term.\nLabour is also calling for the government to prioritise key workers in critical professions, seeing them added to the first phase of the vaccination programme, alongside those might likely to become seriously ill.\nCases are falling and the vaccination programme is going well. So why is the government waiting?\nFirstly, there are doubts about how fast infections are falling. \nWhile the daily figures show they have almost halved in just over a fortnight, the government's surveillance programmes which involve random testing suggest the drop may be slower.\nIt is unclear why there is this discrepancy, but understanding the true trajectory is crucial to knowing what will happen to pressures on hospitals.\nWhat impact the vaccination programme has will also be vital.\nEarly results from Israel, which is leading the world on vaccination, suggest cases in older age groups start falling three weeks after significant numbers are vaccinated. But ministers want to see that pattern repeated here.\nThey also want to know what effect vaccination has on transmission - it is possible vaccinated people can still transmit the infection even if they are protected from illness.\nThis will not be completely clear by March, but scientists should at least have a better idea. \nWhen a plan for exiting lockdown is set out, the government wants to be certain it can be kept to. But given the cost of lockdown the pressure to lift restrictions will grow if progress keeps being made.\nLast week, chair of the Covid Recovery Group Conservative MP Mark Harper said if the government meets its 15 February vaccination deadline, then ministers should begin easing lockdown by 8 March.\nHe welcomed the announcement from the prime minster.\nUnder the current lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons such as food shopping and exercise.\nSimilar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nEngland's lockdown laws are due to end on 31 March. Mr Johnson has previously said this date is to allow for a \"controlled\" easing of restrictions back into local tiers.\nUnder the tier system, different rules are applied to different parts of the country, depending on factors such as pressure on the NHS, number of cases and rates at which case numbers fall.\nPupils in England are not expected to return to school before the February half term. Mr Johnson has said schools will be reopened \"as soon as we can\" but did not guarantee that would happen before Easter.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said restrictions in Scotland will continue until mid-February at the earliest. \nIn Wales, the lockdown will be reviewed at the end of January, but the government has previously said it does not see \"much headroom for change\".\nNorthern Ireland's lockdown has been extended until 5 March."

      "tags": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,UK climate change protests,Paris climate agreement,Climate change,Schools' climate change protests",
      "text": "Despite the pandemic, almost two thirds of people around the world now view climate change as a global emergency.\nThat's the key finding from the largest opinion poll yet conducted on tackling global warming. \nMore than a million people in 50 countries took part in the survey, with almost half the participants aged between 14 and 18.\nConserving forests and land emerged as the most popular solution for tackling the issue. \nThe poll, called the \"People's Climate Vote\", has been organised by the United Nations Development Programme in conjunction with Oxford University.\nThe organisers distributed poll questions through adverts in mobile gaming apps across 50 countries, between October and December last year. \nAround 1.22 million people of all genders, ages, and educational backgrounds took part, but with significant numbers of younger people. \nSome 550,000 people aged 14-18 took part. \nAcross all countries, 64% of participants saw climate change as an emergency, requiring urgent responses from countries.  The margin of error was +/- 2%.\nThis result varied somewhat by age and location.\nIn the UK and Italy, 81% agreed with the question, while this dropped to 50% among those responding from Moldova.\nNewly installed US President Joe Biden can take some comfort that 65% of those in the US taking part now view climate change as an emergency.\nOverall, younger people were more likely to agree with the view that rising temperatures were an emergency, with nearly 70% in favour. \nFor people over the age of 60, this dropped to 58%. \n\"People are scared, they are seeing the the wildfires in Australia and California, they're seeing the category five storms and in the Caribbean, they are seeing flooding in in Southeast Asia,\" said Cassie Flynn, strategic adviser to the UNDP.\n\"And they're looking around them and they're saying, this is a real problem. We have to do something about this.\"\nThe actions that people tend to favour when it comes to tackling climate change depend, to some extent, on where people live. \nIn eight of the 10 countries with the highest emissions from generating electricity, there were majorities in favour of using more green energy.\nBut in countries with bigger emissions from deforestation and land use changes, there was majority support for conserving forests and land. \nThis emerged from the overall survey as the most popular policy for dealing with climate change, by a narrow margin.\nThe least-favoured options for tackling climate change in this survey were a plant-based diet, with only 30% of respondents believing it to be the best. \nGermany, with 44%, and the UK, with 43%, were the countries where plant-based diets received the strongest support. \nThe authors say that across all countries, remarkably few people declined to support any policy.\nPakistan emerged as the country with the greatest number of people not favouring any policy, at 5%.\nIt was followed by the United States, with 4%.\nOne of the key differences that emerged in the data was the level of education. \n\"When it comes to demographics, something that we saw very clearly was that there is a high correlation between a level of education and belief in the climate emergency. The more educated you are, the more likely you are to believe that there is a climate emergency,\" said Cassie Flynn.\n\"And this is really, really powerful, because it doesn't matter where you're from, it doesn't matter your age, education really, really is important.\"\nWhile the overall findings show roughly the same responses from men and women, there were quite pronounced differences at the country level.\nIn Canada, women and girls were 12% more likely to say that climate change is an emergency than men and boys.\nThe US, UK and Australia had smaller differences in the same direction. \nIn contrast, India, Georgia, Vietnam and Nigeria went in the opposite direction, with men and boys being 9-12% more likely to say that warming is an emergency. \nWith a new president in the White House who is making climate change a priority, and with a key global conference taking place in Glasgow later this year, the organisers of the poll believe that it is an important time for world leaders to hear a wide range of voices on climate change.\n\"How they respond to the climate crisis, how they respond to the Covid crisis, is really going to chart an entirely new pathway. And so in many ways, it is this moment of choice,\" said Cassie Flynn from UNDP.\n\"And what we wanted to do with the people's climate vote is to bring people's voices to that decision making, to bring people's voices to the climate debate.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Roman Catholic Church",
      "text": "The historic records of mother-and-baby homes in Northern Ireland should be released in full, the Bishop of Derry has said.\nA Stormont-commissioned report estimated around 10,500 women entered homes here between 1922 and 1990. \nHowever, due to incomplete records this figure may be much higher.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said on Tuesday that the voices of survivors would be heard \"loudly and clearly\" with a new independent investigation.\nThe report examined eight mother-and-baby-homes, a number of former workhouses and four Magdalene Laundries. They were operated by both Catholic and Protestant churches as well as other religious organisations. \nMother-and-baby institutions housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage while laundries were Catholic-run workhouses that operated across the island of Ireland.\nBishop Donal McKeown said that \"disclosure has to be a duty, any records that are there should be made available to any inquiry\". \nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Bishop McKeown said he is \"ashamed\" the experiences of women in mother-and-baby-homes have not been taken more seriously in the past. \n\"If anyone is trying to hide records or destroy records - that is a crime - of course there is no reason why records should be withheld because people want to know who they are.\n\"They mightn't like what they find out when they discover who they are, the parent may not want to know them, but people have to have access to as much information as possible.\"\nSpeaking to Good Morning Ulster on Wednesday, First Minister Arlene Foster would not commit to a public inquiry and said whether to do so or not would be shaped by the input of victims. \n\"I think a lot of those involved in the process do want a public inquiry and if that's what comes out of the discussions \u2026 then we will proceed with that.\"\nHowever, Mrs Foster said the findings that some women and girls were victims of sexual crime should be looked at further. \n\"I think there is a need to get to the bottom of some of those cases because there may well be criminal acts that weren't investigated at that particular point of time, again because of society of that time.\"\nRead more on the report's contents here.\nJudith Gillespie, who chaired the executive's independent inter-departmental working group on the homes said she was shocked by the age of the girls who were in these institutions. \n\"Many were very na\u00efve and didn't understand what had happened to them, didn't receive any sex education in any circumstances.\n\"That's what shocked me the most, the judgement on these girls who were victims, certainly not preparators, had no reason at all to feel shame or guilt, yet that shame or guilt was hoisted on them.\" \nChurch of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, the Most Reverend John McDowell, said he \"acknowledged with shame that members of the Church of Ireland stigmatised women and children in a way which was very far removed from Christian principles and which resulted in an unloving, cold and judgmental attitude towards pregnant women who deserved better\".\n'The birth of a child should always be a time for happiness, and that many young women experienced it as joyless and cold is a matter for bitter regret.  \n\"I am sorry and apologise for the role we played in treating unmarried women and their children in this way. They deserved much better.\"\nA Londonderry woman who had her daughter in a mother-and-baby home said the report into the institutions is a \"stepping stone\" to a full public inquiry. \nAs a teenager, Catroina Cunningham was sent to Marianvale mother-and-baby home in Newry, County Down.\nThe report found that about a third of those admitted were under the age of 19, with the youngest child to be admitted aged 12.\n\"Women are very scared to talk to people because they wonder where their testimonies are going,\" said Ms Cunningham.\n\"But due to this (report) if they are able to take part then hopefully this will lead to a statutory inquiry down the line.\n\"No stone unturned, no secrets, just open it up and just shine a light on everything that has happened.\"\nShe added: \"I am one of the lucky ones - I got my daughter back.\n\"A lot of people didn't get their children back, a lot of people found their mothers had died before they could track them down. \n\"My daughter is very aware of everything that happened. She is aware that I was there and that she was fostered for three months. \n\"As a family we are very open - there is no shame - I did ask her if she was ever embarrassed and she said: 'Why would I ever be embarrassed? I am proud of you mum.'\""

      "tags": "Archbishop of Canterbury,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "\"A legacy of poor decisions\" by the UK before and during the pandemic led to one of the worst death rates in the world, scientists have said.\nLabour also criticised \"monumental mistakes\" by the prime minister in delaying acting on scientific advice over lockdowns three times.\nAfter UK deaths passed 100,000, Boris Johnson said he took \"full responsibility\" for the actions taken.\nBut he said it was too soon to learn the lessons from the pandemic response.\nProf Linda Bauld, public health expert from the University of Edinburgh, said the UK's current position was \"a legacy of poor decisions that were taken when we eased restrictions\". \nShe told the BBC the lack of focus on test and trace and the \"absolute inability to recognise\" the need to address international travel had also led to a more deadly winter surge.\nProf Sir Michael Marmot, who carried out a review of inequalities in Covid-19 deaths, said the UK had entered the pandemic \"in a bad state\" with rising health inequality, a slowdown in life expectancy improvements and a lack of investment in the public sector.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth rejected Mr Johnson's claim that he had done \"everything we could\" to minimise the death toll, adding: \"I do not accept that.\"\nHe said the prime minister had been given scientific advice to impose lockdowns and \"pushed that back\" - not only in March but again in September and December. \nThe government also failed to create a working contact-tracing system, did not introduce effective health controls at the borders and still did not offer \"proper sick pay\", he said.\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: \"I mourn every death in this pandemic and we share the grief of all those who have been bereaved. I and the government take full responsibility for all the actions we have taken to fight this pandemic.\"\nHe said there would be time to reflect on the decisions taken, but he did not think the right time was in the middle of the pandemic when \"37,000 people are struggling with Covid in our hospitals\". \nThe government needed to focus on keeping the virus under control and continuing the fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe, he said.\nHe said his message to grieving families was that he \"deeply, personally\" regretted the loss of life and that the best way to honour the memory of those who had died and honour those who were currently grieving was \"to work together to bring this virus down, to keep it under control in the way that we are\".\nAsked about the government's \"legacy of poor decisions\", Mr Johnson said ministers followed scientific advice and did everything they could to minimise suffering. He said there were \"no easy solutions\" but the UK could be proud of its efforts to distribute the vaccine.\nAfter leading a minute's silence in the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was \"truly sorry\" for any mistakes, as Scotland recorded a total of 5,888 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test.\nShe said the government did everything it could, but added: \"I don't think any of us, reflecting on numbers like these, can conclude that we have always succeeded.\"\nNext month, the prime minister hopes to publish a document giving details of the criteria he will use to start lifting the lockdown, a senior government source told the BBC.\nIt will include factors such as the number of hospitalisations and deaths, the progress of the vaccination programme, any changes to the virus and the impact easing restrictions might have on the epidemic - but will be dependent on emerging data about how effectively the vaccine stops the virus spreading.\nThe UK is the fifth country to pass 100,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico.\nA scientist advising the government has warned the UK could face as many as 50,000 more coronavirus deaths. \nProf Calum Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the BBC's Newsnight: \"It would really not surprise me if we're looking at another 40-50,000 deaths before this burns out. \n\"The deaths on the way up are likely to be mirrored by the number of deaths on the way down in this wave. Each one again is a tragedy and each one represents probably four or five people who survive but are damaged by Covid.\" \nHe said the UK had experienced some \"bad luck\" with the emergence of a new, more transmissible variant but had also suffered from \"decades of underinvestment\" in the NHS and \"a public health authority that's been eroded\" .\nMeanwhile, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell asked people, regardless of whether they had faith, to reflect on the \"enormity\" of the pandemic and join in a \"prayer for the nation\" at 18:00 GMT every day from 1 February.\nThey said the death statistics were were not \"just an abstract figure\", saying: \"Each number is a person: someone we loved and someone who loved us.\"\nMuslim leaders backed the call for a daily prayer. Qari Asim, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said Muslims and wider black, Asian and minority ethnic communities had been disproportionately affected by the \"tsunami of pain, grief and devastation\" - with many unable to properly mourn due to Covid restrictions.\nOn Tuesday, a further 1,631 coronavirus deaths were recorded, taking the total number of people who had died within 28 days of a positive test to 100,162. \nSeparate figures from the Office for National Statistics, which are based on death certificates, show there have been nearly 104,000 deaths since the pandemic began.\nA further 20,089 coronavirus cases were recorded on Tuesday, continuing a downward trend in the number of UK cases seen in recent days. The number of people in hospital remains high, as do the UK's daily death figures.\nSpeaking alongside the prime minister, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said the number of people dying would come down \"relatively slowly\" over the next two weeks - and would probably \"remain flat for a while now\".\nElsewhere, bereavement support charities have written to the health secretary calling for more funding in the light of what they call \"the terrible toll of 100,000 deaths\". \nThe National Bereavement Alliance, representing a range of charities, said many families had been unable to be with loved ones as they died or to support one another. \nThey called for \u00a3500m allocated to mental health in England to be used to support the bereaved. \nMinister for bereavement Nadine Dorries said the government had given more than \u00a310.2m to charities since March to ensure services were available to those who needed them. \nIf you would like to send us a tribute to a friend or family member who died after contracting coronavirus, please use the form below.\nPlease remember to include a photo of your loved one and their name.

Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nMr Johnson said he would set out more detail in \"the next few days and weeks\" about \"when and how we want to get things open again\".\nIt's a terrible milestone - and one that represents unimaginable loss.\nMost of the deaths have come in two waves - the sharp, sudden surge in the spring followed by a slow and sustained rise throughout autumn and winter.\nMistakes have been made - the delay locking down back in March is one that is often cited even by the government's own advisers.\nThe UK, like much of Europe, was also woefully underprepared with limited testing and contact tracing systems.\nBut the ageing population, high rates of obesity, the fact the UK is a global hub and its inter-connectedness with Europe are also factors that meant we were tragically never going to escape lightly once the virus got a foothold.\nSpeaking alongside the prime minister, Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, described it as a \"very sad day\".\nHe said the number of people dying \"will come down relatively slowly over the next two weeks - and will probably remain flat for a while now\".\nProf Whitty added the new coronavirus variant had changed the UK's situation \"very substantially\" with infection rates \"just about holding\" due to lockdown restrictions. \nBut he said the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK \"has been coming down\" and the number of people in hospital with Covid has \"flattened off\" - including in London, the South East and East of England.\nHowever, there were \"some areas\" where the hospital figures were \"still not convincingly reducing\", he said.\nNHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said there had been \"continuing improvements in hospital treatment for severely sick coronavirus patients\". \nHe said he expected more treatments within the next six to 18 months, adding: \"We can see a world in which coronavirus may be more treatable, but for now, it's a combination of reducing infections and getting vaccinations done.\"\nOne day there will be a public inquiry - maybe several - seeking to understand why so many died.\nLast summer, back when the government was subsidising people to eat out at restaurants, Boris Johnson said there would be an independent inquiry into the government's handling of Covid, but gave no details or dates.\nHe still hasn't, despite a recent call from bereaved families, trade unions and charities for lessons to be learnt now.\nThe gravest public health crisis for a century would have tested any government.\nBut as the pandemic has worsened, the criticisms and questions have mounted - about the timing of lockdowns, the rollout of test and trace and the failure to protect care homes last spring. \nThere is now pressure on Boris Johnson from some Tory MPs to ease restrictions as soon as the most vulnerable are vaccinated.\nBut this evening a sombre prime minister said the government would first do everything it could to minimise further loss of life.\nDr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said it was a \"sobering moment in the pandemic\", saying: \"Each death is a person who was someone's family member and friend.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was a \"national tragedy\" to have reached 100,000 deaths.\nThe government had been \"behind the curve at every stage\" of the pandemic and had not learnt lessons over the summer, he added.\nThe epidemiologist whose modelling in part prompted the UK's first national lockdown said more action in the autumn of last year could have saved lives.\nProf Neil Ferguson told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"Had we acted both earlier and with greater stringency back in September when we first saw case numbers going up, and had a policy of keeping case numbers at a reasonably low levels, then I think a lot of the deaths we've seen, not all by any means, but a lot of the deaths we've seen in the last four or five months, could have been avoided.\" \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the death toll was \"heartbreaking\" and warned there was a \"tough period ahead\".\n\"The vaccine offers the way out, but we cannot let up now,\" he added.\nMore than 6.8 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest figures.\nIf you would like to send us a tribute to a friend or family member who died after contracting coronavirus, please use the form below.\nPlease remember to include a photo of your loved one and their name.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scientists in South Africa say there is a \"reasonable concern\" that the new variant of Covid-19 sweeping across the country might prove to be more resistant to current vaccines being rolled out in the UK and elsewhere, and warn that it makes the need for a global roll-out of vaccines \"even more critical\".\n\"It's a theoretical concern. A reasonable concern\u2026 that the South African variant might be more resistant,\" Prof Shabir Madhi, who has led trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, told the BBC. \nProf Madhi was responding to comments by the UK government and scientists. He said a definitive answer would probably come in a matter of weeks, with extensive testing already under way in South Africa. \nThe concern arises from the fact that the virus here has mutated far more than the variant in the UK, and one of those mutations might mean it can evade attack by antibodies that would normally fight coronavirus. \nVaccines teach the body to mount an immune response - which includes creating antibodies - to fight the coronavirus, should it ever encounter it. \nAntibodies are small proteins made by the immune system that stick to the surface of viruses, effectively disabling them. If that ability to connect is weakened, then the antibodies created following the introduction of a vaccine might not be as effective.\nProf Madhi said it was \"unlikely\" that the mutation in South Africa would make the current vaccines useless, but might \"weaken the impact\".\nA vaccine expert at Wits University, Prof Helen Rees, said: \"Fortunately, should further modifications of the vaccine be required to address the new variants, some of the vaccine technologies under development could allow this to be done relatively rapidly.\"\nSouth Africa recently pushed back against suggestions from the British government that its variant was more transmissible than the one in the UK. Scientists insist there is no evidence of that, nor that the mutations here have made the virus deadlier.\nProf Rees said concern about the mutations in South Africa should add to global pressure for a swift roll-out of vaccines across the world, and not just to wealthier nations.\n\"As the new variants are already spreading to other countries, the importance of ensuring that vaccines remain effective against new variants is a global imperative,\" said Prof Rees.\nProf Barry Schoub, who chairs the government's advisory committee on vaccines, said the \"preliminary evidence\" from tests did not suggest that mutations would allow the virus to \"escape\" the impact of the current vaccines. \n\"The vaccines seem to be very effective,\" he said, citing laboratory tests that appeared to show the current vaccines still \"neutralise this new variant\".\nProf Madhi said the crucial laboratory experiments were yet to start and the efficacy of the vaccines would only be known \"over the next few weeks\"."

      "text": "A US gymnast's routine celebrating \"black excellence\" has gone viral, with millions of views on social media.\nThe floor routine by Nia Dennis, an athlete at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA), incorporated songs by artists including Kendrick Lamar, Beyonc\u00e9 and Missy Elliott.\nShe said Black Lives Matter protests inspired the performance, which saw her kneel with her fist in the air.\n\"I had to... for the culture,\" the 21-year-old wrote on Instagram.\nThe routine wowed the judges and earned her praise from celebrities, fellow athletes and fans.\nA video shared by UCLA Gymnastics was viewed more than nine million times.\nDennis told Washington Post publication The Lily that she wanted the routine to \"be a celebration of everything [black people] can do, everything we can overcome\".\n\"The subject of Black Lives Matter is so heavy. It is difficult for people to talk about - and sometimes you have to meet people where they're at, with a celebration,\" she said of the performance.\n\"Every single song is a major black artist, musician, from different time periods. They had a huge impact on black culture, which has also had a huge impact on me. So I'm just literally celebrating what they've done and having the time of my life,\" she added.\nSporting stars across the world took the knee in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement last year, after African-American man George Floyd was killed when a white police officer knelt on his neck.\nThe fist salute was used in the 1960s and 70s as a symbol of the Black Power movement and the struggle for civil rights. NFL player Colin Kaepernick started kneeling symbolically during the pre-game national anthem in 2016, in protest at oppression of African-Americans in the US.\nDennis said she was not able to attend the BLM protests last summer because she was recovering from shoulder surgery but was \"definitely out there in spirit\".\nThe judges awarded her a score of 9.95 out of 10 for the performance on Saturday, helping her team to victory against Arizona State.\nUS rapper Missy Elliott was among those to show her approval, sharing the video on social media and tweeting: \"Snappin\".\nFormer US First Lady Michelle Obama wrote: \"Now that's what I call fierce! You're a star.\"\nIt is the second time Dennis has gone viral for her gymnastics. Last year, she made headlines for a routine set to a medley of Beyonc\u00e9 songs."

      "text": "Goldman Sachs' chief executive David Solomon will get a $10m (\u00a37.3m) pay cut for the bank's involvement in the 1MDB corruption scandal.\n1MDB was an investment fund set up by the Malaysian government that lost billions due to fraudulent activity. \nThe global web of fraud and corruption led to a 12-year jail term for Malaysia's ex-prime minister Najib Razak which he is appealing. \nGoldman Sachs called its involvement in the scandal an \"institutional failure\".\nGoldman Sachs helped raise $6.5bn for 1MDB by selling bonds to investors, the proceeds of which were largely stolen. \nProsecutors alleged that senior Goldman executives ignored warning signs of fraud in their dealings with 1MDB and Jho Low, an adviser to the fund. Two Goldman bankers have been criminally charged in the scandal.\nMr Solomon's pay would have been $10m higher but for the actions its board of directors took in response to the 1MDB saga, Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday. \nWhile disclosing his salary had dropped to $17.5m for 2020, the bank stressed that Mr Solomon was unaware of the corruption.\nHe was not \"involved in or aware of the firm's participation in any illicit activity at the time...\u2009the board views the 1MDB matter as an institutional failure, inconsistent with the high expectations it has for the firm\".\nMr Solomon's package consists of $2m in cash base pay, a $4.65m cash bonus, and $10.85m in stock-based compensation.\nIn October, Goldman agreed to pay nearly $3bn to government officials in four countries to end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB. The bank collected $600m for arranging the bond sales in  2012 and 2013.\nIt has spent years being investigated by regulators across the globe including those in the US, UK, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.In total, Goldman's dealings with 1MDB cost the bank more than $5bn.\nDespite the costs and fines from the fallout from the 1MDB scandal, 2020 was a bumper year for Goldman's businesses with annual revenue of $44.6bn, its highest since 2009.\nThe US-based bank got a huge boost from the recovery in global stock markets from the depths of the coronavirus recession. \nYou might also like:\nIn 2018 Malaysian police raided the home of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, as part of their investigation in his involvement with 1MDB."

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The rollout of Covid vaccines in European Union (EU) countries is picking up speed, with more than 300 million jabs  administered.\nAs of 20 June, nearly half of the EU's adult population have had at least one one dose, while 28% have been fully vaccinated.\nEarlier this year, the rollout was hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.\nIn the week to 20 June 2021, Germany administered an average of 1 dose per 100 people a day, with Italy and France close behind on  0.9 dose per 100 people - all higher than the UK's 0.6 per 100.\nHungary - which is using Russian and Chinese vaccines as well as the EU-approved ones - has fully vaccinated 46% of its population, the same proportion as the UK. \nIn France, children who are 12 and over can be vaccinated, with parental consent. The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

He could be banned from ever running for office.\nDozens of people have been arrested and charged by the FBI.\nTwo members of the police board - former House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving and ex-Senate sergeant-at arms Michael Stenger, have resigned in the wake of the chaos.\nThe images of violence in the hallowed corridors of government shocked the nation and the world.\nThey have also led to much soul searching in the US over the state of the nation at the start of a new presidency."

      "tags": "Patrick Vallance,Manchester,Salford,NHS,Bereavement,Altrincham,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Already 100,000 people in the UK have died with Covid, according to the official count. The idea of 100,000 deaths is hard for many of us to comprehend. But each was a human being who lived and loved in their own unique way. This is the story of one of them.\nBy 3:01am, alone in a hospital room, Ann Fitzgerald reached for her phone. This would be her last chance to contact her husband of four decades, the man she'd raised two children with, her Tony - to Ann, he was always her Tony.\nThe couple had made a pact. So long as Ann was in hospital with Covid, Tony would spend his nights dozing upright in a chair at their bungalow in Pewfall, Merseyside. That way, he would wake up if there was a message alert. \nIt wasn't much of a sacrifice, Tony thought, not when the woman he'd loved for 47 years was all by herself and frightened. And besides, each time his phone bleeped Tony would know she was still alive, and silently he'd thank the stars.\nAnd so in the early hours of Tuesday 7 April, Ann's last message arrived. She'd summoned the energy to take a farewell selfie as she lay in bed wearing an oxygen mask. \"She must have thought: 'Here's something so you won't forget me,'\" says Tony.\nTwo-and-a-half hours later, Ann was dead. She was 65, a mother, a wife, a neighbour, a colleague and a friend, and one of 999 people in the UK who died that day with the novel coronavirus.\nSoon after the hospital rang and told Tony of her death, he was at her bedside, dressed from head to toe in PPE. No visitors had been allowed to see her while she was alive, but now she was gone it was apparently fine - for reasons he didn't understand.\nTony wept as he apologised to his wife's lifeless body for letting her go like this, with no loved ones by her side. Then he turned and cursed the sterile white hospital ceiling and walls, because they'd been with her at the end and he hadn't.\nBack then, few could have imagined the UK's death toll would reach 100,000, or anything close to it.\nAt that point, the tally stood at 10,000; three weeks previously the UK government's Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance had said limiting the final figure to twice that sum would be a \"good outcome\".\nNow, 10 months on, the total number of people in the UK who have died within 28 days of a coronavirus diagnosis has increased tenfold, while UK excess deaths in 2020 were at their highest level since World War Two. The UK has had one of the highest rates of recorded coronavirus deaths in the world so far.\nBy any measure, 100,000 is a devastating amount, roughly equivalent to two Premier League football grounds, or the number of people who attend the Reading festival every year. For many people, the sheer scale of loss conveyed by the figure will be impossible to grasp.\n\"Numbers with lots of zeros are very difficult to interpret, and can be made to look large or small,\" says Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge.\n\"If I say that 100,000 deaths is two months' worth of normal mortality, then it may not look so bad.  If I say that it is more than all the [UK] civilian deaths in WW2, or as if everyone in a city the size of Durham got killed, then it sounds worse.  It is challenging to adequately convey such a large number of individual tragedies.\"\nBut while many may have become numb to the daily death figures, behind every statistic is a real life lost - a real life like Ann's. \"That is why this arbitrary numerical milestone is important,\" says Hetan Shah, chief executive of the British Academy and a former executive director of the Royal Statistical Society. \"It is a chance to reflect again on the terrible toll this pandemic has taken on so many British families.\"\nIn a Manchester nightclub one evening in 1973, 18-year-old Tony felt a tap on his arm. It was Ann, a year his senior, whom he knew by sight as a barmaid in one of the city-centre pubs he sometimes drank in. She'd always stood out to him, with her olive skin and striking good looks, but he'd never dared imagine she might be interested in him romantically. \n\"I'm here with that fella over there,\" she told him, gesturing towards across the room. \"But I don't like him and I don't know what to do.\" \nTony walked over to Ann's date and told him to clear off. Then Tony returned to Ann, and the two of them had a drink together, and then another. Before long they were a couple and Tony decided he was the luckiest man in the world.\nSoon he learned all about Ann's background. Her Lithuanian-born Jewish father had died when she was two years old, and with her mother unable to cope she'd been passed between relatives throughout her childhood. By 16 she was living in a bedsit, supporting herself with waitressing and bar work - she'd also been employed at the legendary art-deco Kardoma caf\u00e9 on Market Street and at George Best's nightclub, Oscar's.\n\"As a consequence of her upbringing she was really, really independent,\" says Tony. \"She was really good at talking to people, and she was sharp - the sharpest, wittiest person I've ever met.\"\nThey rented a flat in Fallowfield together and made it their home. After Ann was offered relief work running bars around Manchester, Tony quit his job as a sales rep to join her. Eventually, in 1981, they took on their own pub. It was in what was then a tough part of Salford, but Ann had grown up nearby and knew how to handle the local characters: \"She could have you in stitches, but she could throw you a look, and you knew you had to behave yourself,\" Tony says.\nThe couple were offered the chance to take on another pub in Sale Moor. They thought they were going upmarket, but it turned out to be quite the reverse; Tony would joke that he should take away all the tables and chairs and install a boxing ring instead. \nBut Ann wasn't intimidated by anyone. According to Tony, when a notorious local villain turned up and demanded a free drink, Ann stood her ground: \"My husband's name is above the front door, and he pays for his drinks, so you're going to pay for yours,\" she told him. Impressed, the villain ended up buying one for Ann instead.\nShe and Tony knew it was time to quit when burglars broke in one night while their baby daughter slept in her cot upstairs. Tony went back on the road as a salesman; Ann worked variously as a debt counsellor, an incident manager for the RAC, and a sales trainer at a cotton firm. Their children, Gary, and Rachel, never once heard them argue, Tony says.\nFor six years the couple had a stall at Altrincham Market selling women's clothes. \"People would come, not necessarily to buy something - they just wanted to see Ann,\" says Tony. \"And as a consequence, they'd buy something they didn't really want.\" Each time this happened, Ann would give Tony a wink.\nBy the start of 2020, Ann and Tony were looking forward to a long retirement together. Both their children had left home, and they'd recently moved to the bungalow. The news broadcasts had begun describing a deadly pandemic that had spread from China. But Ann wasn't leaving the house much while she recovered from an operation to replace both hips.  \nThen one Thursday in March she went for a haircut; she asked for the colour to be darkened slightly too, and when he first saw her afterwards Tony told her how much he loved it. Ann mentioned that the hairdresser had been coughing.\nThree days later, Ann began coughing too, and soon afterwards so did Tony. But with a fever, she felt worse, and within a few more days she was barely able to stand. She asked Tony to call 999. \nThe paramedics helped her to the ambulance. It haunts Tony now that he didn't hug or kiss her as they said goodbye. \"Neither of us thought for one moment that it would be the last day I would ever see her alive,\" he says. She told him they'd probably give her antibiotics and he could come and pick her up in a few hours.\nBut later that day she phoned him to say the doctors suspected Covid and they would be keeping her in. As in many hospitals during the first wave, no visiting was allowed.\nTony could only stay in touch with her by phone. When a doctor told him the next 24 hours were critical, he didn't tell Ann, because he knew how scared she was already by then. \nBut he did pass on something else the medic had said - that they were deeply impressed by her upbeat attitude and fighting spirit. Tony told her, too, that he believed she would be home soon: \"I had to say that to keep her fighting, and fight she did for 10 days.\"\nThe last time they spoke was Saturday 4 April. Ann told Tony she thought she'd turned a corner; she'd eaten a sandwich and some yoghurt. After that, talking became too difficult for her; she wasn't in intensive care but the mask she wore to help her breathe was getting in the way.\nThree days after their last conversation, Tony was sitting in a white hospital room beside Ann's body. He sat with her there for an hour. He didn't just apologise, he also promised he'd make sure she was remembered properly. When it was time to leave, a nurse gave him a booklet about bereavement and a black bag in which to put Ann's belongings. Tony carried them along a hospital corridor, wondering how he would tell Gary and Rachel their mum was dead. \nThere are eight photographs of Ann in Tony's living room. In each of them she looks full of joy. \"Every time I look around, there's a picture of Ann somewhere,\" Tony says. \"She's smiling and I'm thinking, 'If only I could turn back the clock.' But I can't, you know, and nor can all those other families and relations, either.\"\nNearly 10 months after Ann's death, Tony finds himself resenting the home he's been left alone inside. If they hadn't moved there, he reasons, Ann wouldn't have gone to that hairdresser's that day and caught the virus - she'd still be alive, perhaps. \nHe feels robbed of the 20 additional years he hoped they'd spend together, as surely will thousands of other bereaved relatives. While the impact on the very oldest has been widely recognised, those who might have looked forward to a long retirement have been badly hit, too - during the pandemic, around 15% of all UK fatalities with Covid mentioned on the death certificate have been among those aged 65-74. \nTony desperately wishes his life would go back to how it was, but knows it won't.\nAnn's funeral didn't give him any closure. Tony would rather she had been buried, but the undertaker warned him to hurry - extra restrictions could be introduced any time - so he took the date that was offered by the crematorium. \nAs it was, under the rules that were already in force, only 10 mourners were permitted, spaced out around the chapel. No flowers or photographs on display, no hugging. \nTony understood why all this was necessary - but it wasn't the celebration of Ann's bright, gregarious, love-filled life that he thought she deserved. He'd have to plan another one when all this was over.\nAs the months went on, Tony joined online Covid support groups. It helped talking to others who understood how it felt to have lost someone. There was the family of a 19-year-old boy. A woman who was mourning both her mum and her dad. Another woman whose husband had died in the car as she drove him to hospital.\nHe thought of these stories each time he switched on the news and watched the Covid mortality figures climb higher and higher. Behind these cold statistics were human lives. And each was as unique as Ann, with a personality and backstory entirely of their own. \nIt would have been Ann and Tony's 41st wedding anniversary on 6 October, the day before the six-month anniversary of her death. The following month, a few days after the UK's Covid death toll reached 50,000, Tony once again felt Ann's absence bitterly on what would have been her 66th birthday.\n\"Christmas was a nightmare for me,\" he says. Under the rules for the festive season, Gary and Rachel and their partners were able to be there with him, and cooking lunch kept him busy most of the day. But afterwards, when he was on his own again, the reality hit that another celebration had gone by without Ann beside him, and Tony sat down and sobbed.\nFor millions the arrival of the Covid vaccines has brought hope, but it is a cold comfort for those who have lost someone. If every one of the 100,000 were loved by a dozen people, \"that's a million people in Britain who have been bereaved\", says the bioethicist and sociologist Prof Sir Tom Shakespeare. \"We need a national monument, some form of remembering.\"\nTony is not one of those who will find it hard to grasp the significance of this bleak milestone.\n\"To me it's 100,000 poor souls fighting for breath, and they've not had a hug from anyone in their family,\" he says. \"There's a name - there's a person behind that number. And then they've passed away, and the family goes through the grief that I've been through - the numbness, the shock, the anguish and the pain to come.\" \nFollow @mrjonkelly on Twitter\nPicture editor: Emma Lynch.

      "text": "Cough, fatigue, sore throat and muscle pain may be more common in people who test positive for the new UK variant of coronavirus, a study by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests.\nThe ONS findings are based on positive tests from a random sample of 6,000 people in England.\nLoss of taste and smell may be slightly less likely to affect those with the new form of the virus. \nHowever, it is still one of the three main symptoms of the virus.\nThe NHS website lists the symptoms as a high temperature, a new continuous cough and a loss or change to sense of smell or taste. \nMost people infected with the virus develop at least one of these symptoms.\nThe new variant, which was first spotted in Kent in September, spreads more easily than the previous form of the virus and has now spread across the UK, causing a surge in cases which prompted the current lockdown.\nThere is some evidence it could be more deadly than other variants, although the data isn't strong enough yet to say for certain.\nTwo other variants - one from South Africa and another from Brazil - are also circulating, although at lower levels.\nThe ONS analysis looked at the symptoms reported by people up to a week before testing positive for the new variant of coronavirus, compared with those testing positive for the old variant.\nThey were tested over two months between mid-November and mid-January.\nTest results compatible with the new variant show up as being positive for two genes, rather than three for the other variant.\nIn a group of about 3,500 people with the new variant:\nIn a group of 2,500 people with the old variant:\nThe study found 16% of those with the new variant experienced losing their sense of taste while 15% lost their sense of smell.\nThis was slightly lower than reported by people with the old variant (18% for both).\nThere was no difference found in levels of headaches, shortness of breath or diarrhoea and vomiting in both groups.\nProf Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick, said the new variant of the virus had 23 changes compared to the original Wuhan virus.\n\"Some of these changes in different parts of the virus could affect the body's immune response and also influence the range of symptoms associated with infection,\" he said.\nInfected people appear to produce more virus and this could result in more widespread infection within the body \"perhaps accounting for more coughs, muscle pain and tiredness\", Prof Young added. \nThe analysis is part of a long-term study to track coronavirus in the UK population, carried out jointly with Public Health England, the University of Oxford and the University of Manchester."

      "text": "Apple sales have hit another record, as families loaded up on the firm's latest phones, laptops and gadgets during the Christmas period. \nSales in the last three months of 2020 hit more than $111bn (\u00a381bn) - up 21% from the prior year.\nThe gains come as the pandemic pushes more activity online, fuelling demand for new technology.\nApple now counts more than 1.65 billion active devices globally, including more than 1 billion iPhones.\nApple's gains follow the release of its new iPhone 12 suite of phones, which executives said had convinced a record number of people to switch to the company or upgrade from older models.\nThe firm said growth in China - where the pandemic has already loosened its grip on the economy - was particularly strong, helped in part by demand for phones compatible with new 5G networks. \nSales in the firm's greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, jumped 57%. In Europe, sales roles 17%, and they rose 11% in the Americas.\n\"The products are doing very well all around the world,\" said Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer. \"As we look ahead into the March quarter, we're very optimistic.\"\nAnalyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said he thought the firm was just at the beginning of a \"super-cycle\" as Apple devotees finally trade in old phones, coinciding with upgrades to telecommunications networks.\n\"With 5G now in the cards and roughly 40% of its 'golden jewel' iPhone installed base not upgrading their phones in the last 3.5 years, [Apple chief Tim] Cook & Co have the stage set for a renaissance of growth,\" he wrote.\nBig Tech is having an exceptionally lucrative pandemic. \nIt's hard not to be wowed by some of these figures. \nThat Apple recorded more than $100bn in sales in just three months is simply astonishing.\nFacebook figures are also well up on where they were last year. \nAs other companies have struggled to survive, Big Tech has flourished. \nThere are other reasons for some of these incredible figures. Certainly it seems iPhone enthusiasts were holding out for the new 5G enabled iPhone12. \nBut it's not just Apple and Facebook, all of the massive tech companies are having a bumper year.\nCovid-19 means people are spending more time indoors - buying things online, watching things online and chatting online.\nPerhaps then it's no surprise that these companies are posting record breaking figures. \nBut others point to these figures as yet more evidence that Big Tech has become too big to fail. \nThese figures are impressive. But they also attract the attention of politicians who are increasingly asking difficult questions - like are these tech mega companies operating in a market that is fair and with enough competition?\nApple said profits in the quarter reached nearly $28.8bn, up 29% compared with the same quarter last year.\nThe gains seen by technology firms like Apple contrast with losses hitting many other economic sectors, as the virus restricts activity and keeps shoppers at home.\nOther tech firms, such as Microsoft and Facebook, have also enjoyed strong growth.\nFacebook on Wednesday said increased online shopping during the pandemic helped lift ad revenue in the quarter by 30%. \nThe number of people active on its apps - which also include WhatsApp and Instagram - also rose to 2.6 billion daily, up 15% compared to 2019.\nIt said ad spending could slow as the Covid crisis relaxes and shopper appetite returns for services like travel rather than products.\nIt also warned that plans by Apple to change how it shares user data could weigh on growth."

      "text": "The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has defended the inclusion of ransomware payments in first-party cyber-insurance policies.\nIt said insurance was \"not an alternative\" to doing everything possible to first minimise the risk.\nHowever, it added that firms could face financial ruin without the cover.\nProf Ciaran Martin, former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, said the UK needed to rethink its policies on ransomware.\nRansomware is a form of malware in which infected computers are remotely locked by cyber-criminals, who then demand a ransom, often in the form of Bitcoin, to unlock them and return the data they hold.\nThere are many examples of businesses and public bodies which have chosen to pay because they do not have the data backed up, or cannot afford - or do not have time - to rebuild their systems from scratch.\nThe Guardian reported that Prof Martin, now at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government, said he believed insurers were \"funding organised crime\" by accepting ransomware claims, but he told the BBC the issue of how to tackle ransomware was far broader than just the insurance sector.\nWhile official advice is not to pay the demand, it is not illegal to do so in the UK, he said.\n\"I have some sympathy with insurers, because as long as it's legal, there are incentives to pay.\"\nWhile the ransom demand may be high, the alternative impact can also be devastating.\nWhen the global aluminium producer Norsk Hydro was attacked in 2019, it cost the firm around \u00a345m, and its profits in the immediate aftermath plummeted by 82%, reported Reuters.  \nNorsk Hydro refused to pay the demand, which would arguably have been cheaper - but it did have insurance.\nA spokesman for the ABI said insurers do require that \"reasonable precautions\" are taken to prevent cyber-attacks from succeeding in the first place, just as cars and houses require security measures in place to deter thieves.\n\"Some might argue that any insurance that covers against a criminal act could lull the policyholder into a false sense of security,\" he said.\nProf Martin said he did not think that banning ransomware insurance claims would necessarily solve the problem.\n\"But it's worth a serious piece of consultation because if we continue as we are, things will get worse,\" he said."

      "tags": "Foreign & Commonwealth Office,Dumbarton,India",
      "text": "A Scottish man who has been held in an Indian jail without conviction for three years has told the BBC he was tortured to sign a blank confession.\nJagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror laws, accused of conspiring to murder a number of right-wing Hindu leaders.\nCourt documents allege he helped fund the crimes and claim he was a member of a \"terrorist gang\".\nMr Johal told the BBC via his lawyer he had been \"falsely implicated\".\nIn answers to BBC questions obtained by his lawyer during a virtual prison meeting, the 33-year-old says he was physically tortured into signing a blank confession and forced to record a video which was broadcast on Indian TV.\n\"They made me sign blank pieces of paper and asked me to say certain lines in front of a camera under fear of extreme torture,\" he said via his lawyer.\nMr Johal's legal team also shared a copy of what they say is a handwritten letter from shortly after his arrest in November 2017 in which he details allegations of how the torture took place.  \n\"Multiple shocks were administered by placing (the) crocodile clips on my earlobes, nipples and private parts,\" the letter says. \"Multiple shocks were given each day.\n\"Two people would stretch my legs, another person would slap and strike me from behind, and the shocks were given by the seated officers.\"\n\"At some stages I was left unable to walk and had to be carried out of the interrogation room.\"  \nThe BBC has been unable to independently verify these allegations of torture. \nThe Indian authorities strongly deny them, and have said \"there is no evidence of mistreatment or torture as alleged\".\nMr Johal travelled to India in October 2017 for his wedding.\nVideos of the occasion show the new groom jumping enthusiastically to Bhangra music as he celebrated.\nIn another he is seen holding his wife's hand, as they perform their first dance in front of friends and family.\n\"It was a cheerful day for us, it went exactly as planned,\" recalls his brother Gurpreet Singh Johal.\nBut a fortnight later, while on a shopping trip with his new bride in the North Indian state of Punjab, Mr Johal was taken away by police and has been in detention ever since.\nFollow Rajini on Twitter\nHis brother Gurpreet, who lives in Scotland, says Mr Johal was a peaceful activist and is convinced he was arrested because he had written about historical human rights violations against Sikhs in India.\n\"I believe my brother is being targeted because he was outspoken,\" Gurpreet says. \"I believe he is innocent and will be proved innocent once the trial starts.\n\"Otherwise Indian officials should release him and return him back to his country.\"\nCharge-sheets from the Indian authorities outline the case against Mr Johal and a group of men whom they believe were involved in a \"series of killings\" of right wing Hindu leaders.\nIt is claimed Mr Johal was a member of Khalistan Liberation Front (KLF), described in the documents as an international \"terrorist gang\". \nHe is accused of paying \u00a33,000 to the former head of the KLF to help fund the crimes. The documents claim he \"actively participated and had complete knowledge of the conspiracy\".\n\"There are very serious charges against him including murder and abetment of terrorism,\" an Indian government official told the BBC.\n\"The seriousness of charges against him have been shared with the British authorities,\" they added.   \nMr Johal's lawyer, Jaspal Singh Manjphur, who has represented him since he was first arrested, told the BBC he was concerned by the length of time it was taking for the case to go through the Indian legal system.\n\"He has been in custody for over three years,\" Mr Manjphur said. \"Normally, if the prosecution wants, they can complete the case in that much time.\"\nMr Manjphur said the authorities had yet to provide any him with any evidence linking his client to the crimes and feared he was being framed, a charge denied by officials.\nA few weeks ago, Mr Johal was accused of being involved in another crime. While in prison he has been arrested for helping to plot the murder of a man in October 2020.\n\"He is in a high security jail, he is under CCTV surveillance for 24 hours. How can he be in contact with anyone?\", Mr Manjphur said.\nMr Johal is being held at Delhi's maximum security Tihar jail. \nHe claims he is often forced to stay in solitary confinement and is denied the same facilities as other prisoners, such as hot water. \n\"By making me stay in these conditions, they are ensuring that my mental condition remains disturbed,\" he said.\n\"It is very tough to live here,\" he said.\nThe vast majority of inmates at the prison are, like Mr Johal, held before a conviction in what is known as an \"under-trial\" in India.\nAt the end of 2019, 82% of prisoners held in Tihar jail had yet to complete the trial process. \nIn India it can take many years before under-trial prisoners ever get to court, especially in terror cases where bail is hard to secure, a concern for Mr Johal's lawyer. \n\"He will languish in jail until the trial is completed, in such cases it could take anywhere between five to 10 years,\" Mr Manjphur said.\nThe human rights charity Reprieve has written to the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, asking that he calls for Mr Johal's immediate release.\nReprieve is also worried that some of the charges Mr Johal is awaiting trial for carry the death penalty as the maximum punishment. But experts stress that executions in India are extremely rare. \nThe UK's Foreign Commonwealth and Development office told the BBC that Mr Raab did raise the case with his Indian counterpart during his trip to India in December.\n\"We have consistently raised concerns about his case with the Government of India, including allegations of torture and mistreatment and his right to a fair trial,\" it said in a statement.\n\"Our staff continue to support Jagtar Singh Johal following his detention in India, and are in regular contact with his family and prison officials about his health and wellbeing.\"\nBut Mr Johal's brother Gurpreet said the family was still waiting for a meeting with the foreign secretary.\nHe said: \"We are calling for either Jagtar to be charged and a fair trial to take place or to be returned back to his country so he can spend his life with his wife in the UK.\" \nIn August last year Gurpreet Singh Johal was joined by dozens who protested outside Downing Street.\nJagtar Singh Johal's case has sparked protests around the world, from Westminster to Washington, Geneva to Toronto.\nIn his statement to the BBC, Mr Johal had this message for officials back home: \"I plead to the UK government to support me, I'm a British citizen and the government should understand that.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Merthyr Tydfil,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 10 cases of the South African coronavirus variant identified in Wales, a senior official has said.\nWales' Chief Scientific Adviser Dr Rob Orford said all had been cases recorded in people who had travelled abroad.\nThere are concerns vaccines may not work as well against the variant.\nIt comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that UK nationals and residents returning from a 'red list' of Covid hotspots will have to quarantine in a hotel.\nThe Welsh Government says the move does not go far enough.\nAt least 77 cases of the South Africa variant have been identified in the UK.\nMeanwhile the overall seven-day coronavirus case rate has fallen in Wales to 203.8 cases for every 100,000 individuals - down from 650 before Christmas.\nIt is the lowest point since late November.\nCovid-19 case rates in south Wales in particular have been showing improvements in the last couple of weeks, as lockdown restrictions appear to be having an effect.\nPublic Health Wales said it was confident there was a \"consistent downward\" trend, although numbers were still high and putting pressures on hospitals.\nThe south Wales valleys, Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot have perhaps seen the most dramatic reductions.\nThese include areas which recorded the highest case rates in the UK before Christmas.\nMerthyr Tydfil continues to fall from a peak of 1,349 cases per 100,000 and the UK's highest a week before Christmas. It now has less than 200 cases per 100,000 for the first time since September.\nThere has been a large fall in case rates in Blaenau Gwent as well - from 1,020 cases per 100,000 in mid-December to its lowest rate since early October.\nThere are also encouraging signs in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), where the case rate has dropped below 200 per 100,000 - also its lowest point since September.\nIn Bridgend, the case rate peaked just before Wales was put into a pre-Christmas lockdown on 18 December.\nBut it has fallen back sharply and is just under 226 cases per 100,000 for the first time since the end of November. Its positivity rate has also dropped to below 17%.\nSimilar patterns can be seen in Neath Port Talbot (NPT) - at its lowest point for case rates since mid-October.\nDespite the figures, Chief Medical Officer Frank Atherton said his current advice is that the headroom to relax restrictions is \"really quite limited\".\n\"The emergence of these new variants pose new challenges for us,\" added Dr Orford at Wednesday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, \"because of their potential to alter the course of the pandemic\".\n\"The concern is that a new variant will emerge that won't respond to treatment and vaccines, putting us back to where we began.\"\nThree variants from South Africa and Brazil are being monitored, he said.\nThe Kent strain - which was identified in the UK and is thought to be more contagious - is the dominant strain across Wales, Dr Orford said.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson had said that early evidence suggested it may be more deadly.\nDr Orford did not refer to the prime minister, but he said three studies looking at death rates had \"not been able to say that definitively\".\nHe also said the Kent variant does not appear to have more impact on young and healthy people.\n\"It doesn't seem to have any difference in the way it infects people across the ages, which is really positive\", he said.\nDr Atherton said it is believed that the R number - the rate that coronavirus reproduces - is below 1 - between 0.7 and 0.9.\nHe said that means the size of the current outbreak is \"shrinking rather than growing\", but he said rates were still \"way too high\".\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford is expected to announce the outcome of a 21-day review of lockdown restrictions on Friday.\nBut Dr Atherton said towards the end of February would be the \"time to think about further relaxations\".\n\"We will look again at where we are with community transmission, where we are with the NHS capacity and the business of the NHS, and where we are with vaccination,\" he said.\nA total of 312,305 people have been given their first dose in Wales - 9.9% of the population.\nDr Atherton said the Welsh Government was on course to meet the target of vaccinating everyone in the four priority groups by mid-February.\nThe medical adviser said lessons had to be learned from how restrictions were eased before.\nDr Atherton added: \"What I do say to the first minister and health minister is that we need to learn from what happened when we came out of previous lockdowns - the first lockdown in March, the firebreak in November.\n\"What we saw there was even though rates had come down quite well when we released things, we released them in a way which allowed the virus to re-establish itself very, very quickly.\"\nThe encouraging news from the scientists is that lockdown is working and infection rates are steadily decreasing - so the sacrifices so many people are making are having an impact.  \nBut Frank Atherton made clear he had told ministers, in advance of the latest lockdown review, that there was little room for manoeuvre.\nWhy? First, although the position is much better now than in the spring, infection rates, and positivity rates are still too high.\nThe other big issue is the prevalence of variants. The so called Kent-variant is now dominant across most of Wales, it spreads more easily.\nAlso 10 cases of the South African variant have been confirmed here, and that's a strain which is also causing a lot of concern internationally. \nThe fear is if restrictions are eased too quickly the presence of these variants could make it even more likely that infection could spiral out of control.\nAsked whether he regretted any of the advise he had given in light of the milestone of 100,000 deaths across the UK, the chief medical officer said: \"It took a while for us to learn about the virus.\"\nDr Atherton said different decisions would have been made on protecting care home residents earlier in the pandemic had it been known Covid-19 behaved very differently from flu.\nBut he said he did not think it \"was a mistake\" but was the \"limits of what we knew\".\n\"We started off treating it rather as we treated pandemic flu,\" he said.\n\"This virus has behaved very differently,\" he said. \"I think, had we known that, we would have made some different decisions about, you know, looking after people in care homes.\""

      "text": "Supplies of vaccines are \"tight\" but the UK believes it will receive enough doses to meet its targets, the vaccine minister has said.\nNadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast manufacturers were \"confident\" they would deliver for the UK amid warnings of production delays.\nIt comes as the EU said it might tighten vaccine export controls.\nCountries should avoid \"vaccine nationalism\" and ensure a fair global supply, Mr Zahawi said.\nMeanwhile, more than 100,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, after 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded in the daily figures.\nMr Zahawi said the vaccination programme was still on track to deliver a first dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn.\nHe said the UK had supplies of the Oxford vaccine manufactured domestically by AstraZeneca as well as the Pfizer one, which is made in Belgium.\nThe government is also planning to publish figures on the take-up of the vaccine by ethnicity from Thursday, following concerns that some black, Asian and ethnic minority communities were more hesitant to get the jab.\n\"I'm confident we will meet our mid-February target and continue beyond that,\" Mr Zahawi told the BBC.\n\"Supplies are tight, they continue to be, these are new manufacturing processes,\" he added. \"It's lumpy and bumpy, it gets better and stabilises and improves going forward.\"\nBut he declined to say that he had received guarantees about the number of doses the UK would receive from Pfizer or other manufacturers and refused to confirm how many doses had already arrived.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said AstraZeneca had committed to delivering two million doses a week to the UK, and the government was not expecting any changes to that supply.\nDowning Street also rejected German media reports claiming a very low efficacy rate for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine among older people, saying they had been denied by Oxford University, AstraZeneca and the German health ministry.\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the cabinet the trials showed similar immune responses in younger and older adults.\nAnd England's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has defended the UK's strategy of extending the time between first and second doses of coronavirus vaccines from three to 12 weeks in order to immunise more people. \nHe told the Downing Street coronavirus briefing on Tuesday that the \"great majority\" of protection came from the first dose.\nHe also said there was \"no evidence\" that immunity waned between three and 12 weeks after the first dose was administered.\nProf Whitty said: \"We thought very carefully about what the balance of this is, but the balance of risk in terms of reducing the number of deaths in the community - and I really want to stress that, that is the aim of this - is to maximise the number of people who get that first dose, where the great majority of protection comes from.\"\nThe latest tension over supply of the Covid vaccine is another illustration of just how fragile this issue is.\nThere are huge global demands for Covid vaccine, limited raw materials and constraints on manufacturing.\nThe UK already has enough vaccine to jab all the highest-risk groups by mid-February, although not all of it has been packaged up or been through the final safety checks.\nThis explains why ministers are confident about the immediate target for the over-70s, health and care workers and the extremely clinically vulnerable.\nBut what is in doubt is how quickly the UK can vaccinate in the medium term.\nWith the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in the UK those supply routes are more guaranteed.\nBut the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is made in Belgium. The UK, like the rest of Europe, is affected by the problems with manufacturing that are being experienced with that vaccine.\nWith Europe experiencing major problems rolling out its vaccination programme - per head of population five times fewer vaccines have been delivered - this is a story that is going to rumble on for months.\nThe UK has placed orders for 367 million doses of vaccines from seven manufacturers, Mr Zahawi said. \"As vaccines come along we will get more volume, millions more in the weeks and months to come,\" he added.\nThe tension over vaccine supplies increased after UK-based AstraZeneca warned the EU it would have to reduce planned deliveries because of production problems. Pfizer-BioNTech has also said supplies will be temporarily lower as it works to increase capacity at its Belgian factory.\nIt has prompted the EU to accuse AstraZeneca of failing to meet its commitments and to warn that it might require all companies producing Covid vaccines to provide \"early notification\" whenever they planned to export supplies out of the EU.\n\"The thing to do now is not to go down the dead end of vaccine nationalism. It's to work together to protect our people,\" Mr Zahawi said.\n\"No-one is safe until the whole world is safe.\"\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock subsequently said the UK government \"oppose protectionism in all its forms\" and urged all international partners to \"be collaborative\" and \"work closely together\" on vaccine distribution.\nHe added that the EU's warning that it could restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc was \"unfortunate and especially so in the midst of a pandemic\".\nMeanwhile, the head of NHS England earlier told MPs coronavirus could become a \"much more treatable disease\" over the next six to 18 months, with the hope of a return to a \"much more normal future\".\nSir Simon Stevens told the Health and Social Care Committee: \"The first half of the year, vaccination is going to be crucial.\n\"I think a lot of us in the health service are increasingly hopeful that in the second half of the year and beyond we will also see more therapeutics and more treatments for coronavirus.\"\nHe also said it \"would be great\" if the Covid vaccine and flu vaccine were combined into a single jab, if not for next winter then future ones.\nAnd he said vaccines were being used as fast as they arrived in the NHS, with more than half of those aged 75-79 having now had their first dose.\nThe UK aims to offer Covid vaccination to every adult by autumn. \nMr Zahawi said confidence in the vaccines was high, with 85% of people saying they would accept the jab.\nBut he said those who were hesitant \"skew heavily\" towards black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. \nThe government is providing \u00a323m of funding to 60 local councils and voluntary groups to boost vaccine take-up among groups such as older people, disabled people, and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.\nIt comes as celebrities such as comedians Romesh Ranganathan and Meera Syal and cricketer Moeen Ali appeared in a video urging people in their communities to get vaccinated.\nMr Zahawi told ITV's Good Morning Britain his uncle had died from Covid-19 last week. He had been eligible for vaccination but caught the virus before he could receive it, the minister said.\nThis \"grim and horrible\" experience made him determined to ensure that the most vulnerable were protected as quickly as possible, Mr Zahawi said.\nSir Simon said there was concern about vaccine hesitancy in some groups, where there were access problems as well as \"systematic attempts to misinform and lie about the vaccine programme targeted particularly at minority populations, and - in some cases - long-standing mistrust of public services\".\nHe said disruption to vaccine deliveries from EU export restrictions was not thought to be likely.\nIn other developments, the UK has offered to carry out genomic sequencing for other countries around the world to help identify further new variants.\nPublic Health England said it would give \"crucial early warning\" of any mutations that might cause the virus to spread faster, make people more ill or possibly reduce the effectiveness of vaccines."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Schools in England will not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March, the prime minister has said.\nBoris Johnson said this was the earliest schools could reopen and \"depends on lots of things going right\".\nThe BBC has been told the aim is for all schools and year groups in England to return at the same time. \nTheir return would mark the first stage in lifting the lockdown, the PM said.\nHe told a Downing Street news conference: \"The date of 8 March is the earliest that we think it is sensible to set for schools to go back and obviously we hope that all schools will go back.\"\n\"I'm hopeful, but that's the earliest that we can do it and it depends on lots of things going right, and... it also depends on us all now continuing to work together to drive down the incidence of the disease through the basic methods we've used throughout this pandemic,\" he added.\nThere was not enough data yet to decide when to end the lockdown, he said, but intended to set out a plan for how it could be eased - and the criteria involved - in the final week of February\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the 8 March date as \"very much a hope and certainly not a guarantee\".\nMeanwhile, a further 1,725 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures. The UK's official coronavirus death toll surpassed 100,000 on Tuesday. \nMr Johnson told MPs the country remained in a \"perilous situation\" as he said UK nationals and residents arriving from 30 high-risk countries would soon be ordered to quarantine in hotels.\nHe revealed a plan for the \"gradual and phased\" lifting of the lockdown in England could come in the week beginning 22 February.\nOther restrictions on daily life could be eased after schools reopen, but he explained this would depend on hitting vaccination targets, the capacity of the NHS, and deaths falling.\nAn earlier plan for mass testing for pupils and staff remains in place, the BBC has been told.\nEngland's schools have been closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers since the Christmas break.\nIn Scotland, it is hoped schools may begin a phased return in the middle of February. \nIn Wales, measures including school and college closures will be reviewed on Friday. In Northern Ireland, a review will take place on Thursday.\nThe prime minister said he understood frustration among pupils and teachers \"and for parents and for carers who spent so many months juggling their day jobs, not only with home schooling but meeting the myriad other demands of their children from breakfast until bedtime\".\nThe government initially planned to review England's lockdown measures - including school closures - on 15 February, which had raised hopes that pupils could return to classes after half term.\nAcknowledging the impact of continued school closures, Mr Johnson pledged to \"work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure that pupils have the chance to make up their learning\" before 2024.\nHe said \u00a3300m \"of new money to schools\" would fund a catch-up programme over the coming year, with financial incentives for providers to educate pupils who have missed lessons due to the pandemic. \nAfter complaints about confusion and drift about when schools in England are going back, Boris Johnson has sought to bring some certainty.\nThey won't be going back straight after half term - but the target date will be 8 March.\nSources say the aim is for all schools and year groups in England, in primary and secondary, to return back on that date - rather than it being the starting date of a phased or regional return.\nAlthough that could be subject to any changes in local Covid-19 levels.\nWhen schools do go back it is expected there will be mass testing for pupils and staff, in the scheme initially planned for the start of term.\nIt still leaves parents home schooling for another five weeks - and means most of this term will have been without face-to-face lessons.\nThis will be a particular worry for pupils heading for whatever replaces GCSEs and A-levels this summer, after almost a full year of stop-start lessons.\nHead teachers say the delay is \"no surprise\" - and reopening must be done safely.\nAnd Labour says half term should be used to vaccinate teachers to help schools stay open.\nBut the prime minister will hope that parents would rather have some clarity about what's happening with schools, even if that means a longer delay.\nTeachers' and head teachers' unions said they supported reopening schools but added that it must be safe and not rushed.\nMary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said that although the most vulnerable would be protected by March, most parents would not be.\n\"It fails completely to recognise the role schools have played in community transmission. The prime minister has already forgotten what he told the nation at the beginning of this lockdown, that schools are a 'vector for transmission',\" she said.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the government needs to work with head teachers to review safety measures and create a \"workable plan\" for schools to reopen fully.\n\"The government will also have to put effort into reassuring families that it is safe to send their children back to school - there is a confidence test the government must pass to make the return a success,\" he said.\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has insisted that Scotland's independence debate is \"irrelevant\" to most people as he urged the country to unite against Covid. \nThe PM was speaking during a trip to Scotland to emphasise the strength of the UK working together during the pandemic.\nThe SNP said he was panicking as opinion polls show declining support for the union.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon also questioned if his trip is essential.\nThe PM started his day-long visit by going to the Lighthouse Laboratory - which processes Covid tests - at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus in Glasgow.\nHe later visited troops who are setting up a vaccination centre in the Castlemilk area of the city, and toured the Valneva vaccine factory in Livingston.\nThe factory is expected to deliver 60 million doses to the UK by the end of the year if its vaccine is approved.\nMr  Johnson used the visit to argue that the priority should be \"fighting this pandemic and coming back more strongly together\" rather than arguing about the constitution.\nAnd he praised the \"amazing performance\" of Scottish people in the \"national effort\" to fight the pandemic. \nThe prime minister said: \"I think endless talk about a referendum without any clear description of what the constitutional situation would be after that referendum is completely irrelevant now to the concerns of most people\".\nMr Johnson also criticised the SNP's record in government, and added: \"We don't actually know what the referendum would set out to achieve.\n\"We don't know what the point of it would be - what happens to the army, what happens to the Crown, what happens to the pound, what happens to the Foreign Office. Nobody will tell us what it's all meant to be about.\"\nHe told reporters that \"the very same people\" who wanted independence \"also said only a few years ago, in 2014, that this was a once-in-a-generation event\".\n\"I'm inclined to stick with what they said last time,\" Mr Johnson said.\nUnder the current Covid regulations, people are only able to travel between Scotland and England for essential reasons, with similar regulations also in place to stop travel across council boundaries within Scotland.\nAsked at her daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday how she felt about the prime minister's visit while the strict travel restrictions were in place, Ms Sturgeon replied she was \"not ecstatic\" about it.\nShe argued that leaders should abide by the same rules they impose on the general public, adding that she had herself rejected a suggested visit to a vaccine centre in Aberdeen for this reason.\nDowning Street has insisted it is important for the prime minister to be \"visible and accessible\" across the whole of the UK during the pandemic.\nIn response to Ms Sturgeon's criticism, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"These are Covid-related visits. You've seen the prime minister do a number of them over the past few weeks.\n\"It is obviously important that he is continuing to meet and see those who are on the front line in terms of those who are providing tests, in terms of those who are working so hard to deliver the vaccination plan.\" \nMr Johnson's visit to Scotland is widely seen as being part of a \"charm offensive\" in response to polls indicating a rise in support for independence. \nHowever, polls have also suggested that the independence question is currently a lower priority for many people than other issues such as the pandemic, health and education. \nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said it was \"only right\" the prime minister visited people on the front line of the vaccine roll-out to make sure it is operating effectively.\nHe told BBC Breakfast Mr Johnson has visited other crucial locations in the UK's pandemic response, such as the Wrexham plant making the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, adding: \"No one thinks that's illegitimate.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also said he backed the visit. \"I'm with the prime minister on this one,\" he told LBC Radio.\n\"He is the prime minister of the UK. It's important that he travels to see what is going on, on the ground.\"\nIt comes as the Scottish government sets out its budget, described as the \"most important in the history of devolution\" in the wake of huge spending increases to support people and businesses during the pandemic.\nBoris Johnson had a clear purpose on his visit to Scotland - to talk up what he calls the power of cooperation across the UK. \nDressed in white lab coat and protective gear, he was happy to tell me how the UK government is supporting the fight against coronavirus in Scotland.\nThat includes spending lots of money supporting jobs and businesses, building test centres, and procuring vaccine supplies from companies like the one he was visiting in Livingston. \nBut here's the paradox.\nNo matter what the prime minister does, or that the UK and Scottish governments are following broadly similar Covid strategies - the public in Scotland perceives that Nicola Sturgeon and her team are handling the pandemic response better. \nThis visit was controversial because it happened during lockdown but it went ahead because the UK government recognises how much work it has to do to make the case for the union in Scotland, with Scottish elections due in May when the question of indyref2 will be to the fore. \nOn Sunday, the SNP revealed an 11-point \"roadmap to a referendum\" on Scottish independence, which sets out how the party intends to take forward its plan for another vote on the issue. \nIt says a \"legal referendum\" will be held after the pandemic if there is a pro-independence majority at Holyrood following May's election.\nAnd it says it will \"vigorously oppose\" any legal challenge from the UK government.\nMr Johnson has repeatedly stated his opposition to a referendum, and has suggested that another one should not be held for 40 years. \nOpposition parties in Scotland have also accused Ms Sturgeon and the SNP of putting the push for independence ahead of the Covid pandemic.\nBut SNP deputy leader Keith Brown said the prime minister's trip was evidence that he is in a \"panic\" about the prospect of another referendum."

      "tags": "Cardiff,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The family of a 40-year-old mother-of-five who died with coronavirus have urged people to respect lockdown rules.\nKaren Hobbs had a heart attack and died, weeks after testing positive for Covid-19.\nThe former EasyJet cabin crew member developed symptoms a week before Christmas, was not able to get out of bed and started struggling to breathe.\nShe was taken to hospital and died on 19 January.\nKaren's sister Rachel Hobbs said her normally healthy sister became very ill over Christmas.\n\"She just looked dreadful, Christmas Day she was laid up in bed, she couldn't do anything,\" she said.\n\"I knew she was really bad but I'd never seen anybody like that before, it was shocking, for someone that healthy to be barely able to walk to a car is quite shocking.\"\nOn 2 January, Karen was put into an induced coma.\n\"She was really terrified, she said 'I need to come out of this and see my children again'. She never came out of it,\" her sister added.\nThe family were told Karen's organs were beginning to fail and she was \"going downhill\" about a week before she died, and they were allowed to visit.\n\"She did look a little bit better, she had more colour, she was quite puffy - swelling and a bit of a rash on her. Her lungs were struggling, so we came home a little bit shocked.\n\"They started feeding her in a tube and were able to move her, I thought perhaps she's recovering a little bit and then I had the phone call to say that she'd gone.\n\"Her body just couldn't take it any more. I don't think it's sunk in. I think the children are still in a bit of shock as well, I thought she would come out of it but she just had it so severe. \"\nRachel said her sister, from Cardiff, was healthy with no underlying conditions.\n\"She didn't go anywhere - she did online shopping, she was in the house - so we don't even know where it could have come from, she was one of the ones who stayed safest.\n\"It's just shocking to think a young mum of five is no longer here. They've lost their mum and they lost their grandfather and nan a couple of years ago so they must feel 'who will be next'?\nRachel said her sister was a fantastic mother to her five children, aged 14, 11, nine, eight and four.\n\"I don't think the youngest understands, I think she thinks mummy's still just in the hospital.\n\"She was a very hands-on mum, she spent a lot of time with the children. She'd sit and play with them for hours, sit and colour, she was always there for them.\"\nRachel added that Karen had no patience with people who broke lockdown rules: \"She used to get quite annoyed about people who broke the rules and she wasn't slow on coming forward, she'd say it as well.\n\"It just goes to show how bad this virus is. She would say 'make sure you follow the rules because nobody is safe, it is real this virus, stay at home and only go out when you need to'.\"\nIn the days since Karen's death a fundraising page has been set up by friends to support her children and their dad, and has raised more than \u00a320,000.\n\"I'm absolutely amazed at how generous people have been and how kind people have been, the community has come together and I think she'd be proud too that it's raising awareness about the pandemic.\n\"That'll help the children going forward now. Out of a bad thing, it's been nice people getting in touch, kind words, messages, little things about what she was like.\""

      "tags": "Ministry of Justice,David Lammy,Criminal justice system,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Labour is calling for juries to be cut from 12 members to seven, to stem the \"gravest crisis\" in the justice system since World War Two.\nShadow justice secretary David Lammy said action was needed to clear the backlog of thousands of cases.\nHe argued that smaller juries and the use of more temporary courts would allow socially distanced trials. \nThe government has not ruled out such a move but insists measures it is taking to clear the backlog are working.\nLast week four criminal justice watchdogs warned that courts in England and Wales were straining under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic.\nJury trials ground to a halt at the start of the first lockdown, when people were advised to stay at home except in limited circumstances. \nWhen they resumed, there were severe delays and numerous cancellations due to social-distancing requirements. \nRecent figures revealed that the number of unheard cases in crown courts had reached a record 54,000.\nThe backlog means some from last year may not go before a jury until 2022, and it could be years before the courts get back on track. \nLabour wants the temporary return of so-called \"wartime juries\" of seven rather than 12 members to speed up the process. \n\"Victims of rape, murder, domestic abuse, robbery and assault are facing delays of up to four years because of the government's failure to act,\" Mr Lammy said.\nHe also urged the government to speed up the rollout of temporary \"Nightingale courts\" to hear civil, family and tribunals work, as well as non-custodial crime cases.\nTen of these were announced in July 2020 to help deal with the backlog in court proceedings, and 20 are now in operation across England and Wales.\nLeading lawyers are sceptical about Labour's proposal to reach back into wartime history. \nThe Criminal Bar Association - representing barristers who prosecute and defend trials - says a panel of seven may allow more courtrooms to be used, but it wouldn't solve what it says is chronic underfunding - and potentially undermines one of the most important safeguards in our society. \nThe Law Society, for solicitors, wants to see evidence that smaller panels would ease backlogs without risking injustices. \nThe Ministry of Justice's internal modelling calculated last year that reduced juries would lead to a 10% increase in cases - but that was before courtrooms received new Covid-proof screens that have allowed more trials to run. \nScotland's courts are using cinemas to host juries - and while that is not being actively discussed in England, it's not been ruled out either. \nEven if juries were slimmed, courts would still need to tightly control the number of defendants who can use their cells and courtroom docks to meet Public Health England's guidelines. \nIn April last year, the head of judiciary in England and Wales, Lord Burnett, backed the idea of reducing the number of jurors if social distancing continued.\nIn June, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told the BBC he was \"very attracted\" by the idea of smaller juries, as had happened in wartime, and judge-only trials in less serious cases.\nThe Ministry of Justice says it has now installed plastic screens in more than 450 courtrooms and jury deliberation rooms to reduce Covid risks.\nIt says the safety measures are designed for 12-person juries and that the impact of lowering the number of jurors would be negligible.\nHowever, a spokesman said nothing was being ruled out and ministers were continuing to consider every option available to ensure courts recover quickly. \n\"This approach is already delivering results, with magistrates' backlogs falling significantly and the number of cases being dealt with in the crown courts reaching pre-Covid levels last month,\" he added.\nThe spokesman also said: \"We know more must be done and are investing \u00a3110m into a range of measures to drive this recovery further, including opening more Nightingale courts.\""

      "tags": "Chris Whitty,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of daily coronavirus deaths in the UK is likely to come down \"relatively slowly\", England's chief medical officer has warned. \nProf Chris Whitty said the UK was going to see \"a lot more deaths\" over the next few weeks before the effects of the vaccination programme were felt. \nCurrent restrictions were \"just about holding\" in lowering infection rates, he told a Downing Street briefing. \nIt comes as the UK surpassed 100,000 coronavirus deaths on Tuesday. \nA further 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded in the daily figures.\nAnd 20,089 coronavirus cases were reported on Tuesday, continuing a downward trend in the number of UK cases seen in recent days. \nProf Whitty told a Downing Street news conference the rolling seven-day average for deaths was 1,242 - \"an incredibly high number\" - and unlikely to come down quickly. \n\"I think we have to be realistic that the rate of mortality, the number of people dying a day, will come down relatively slowly over the next two weeks - and will probably be flat for a while now.\" \nProf Whitty said the number of people testing positive for coronavirus was \"still at a very high number, but it has been coming down\".\nBut he cautioned against relaxing restrictions \"too early\", as Office for National Statistics data showed a \"rather slower\" decrease.\nThe number of people in hospital with Covid-19 in the UK had \"flattened off\", he said, but was still an \"incredibly high number\" and \"substantially above the peak in April\".\nProf Whitty said the new, more transmissible variant discovered in the south east of England at the end of last year had altered the UK's situation \"very substantially\" and had made it \"much harder\" to bring infection levels down.\n\"We were worried two weeks ago that the measures we have at the moment were not enough to hold this new variant,\" he told the news conference. \n\"I think what the data I showed you at the beginning of the slide sessions shows is that the rates are just about holding with the new variant, with what everybody's doing.\n\"It's going to be much harder because of this new variant and I think we have to be realistic about that.\" \nSir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said that more than a quarter of a million severely ill coronavirus patients have been looked after in hospital since the pandemic started last year.\n\"This is not a year that anybody is going to want to remember nor is it a year that across the health service any of us will ever forget,\" he said.\nThe daily Covid figures have seen the number of deaths top 100,000. But they also contain some signs of hope.\nJust over 20,000 new infections have been reported - down from 22,000 yesterday.\nThis compares to an average of 60,000 at the start of the year.\nIt is a sharp fall, although Prof Whitty cautions it may actually be a little slower than that. \nNot everyone who is infected comes forward for testing and the government surveillance programme which involves random testing of the population suggests the fall has not been quite so great.\nNonetheless, it is clear the infection rate is coming down - and that offers hope.\nHospital cases have plateaued and should soon start falling. That will eventually lead to a reduction in the number of deaths.\nThen, in February, the vaccination programme should start having an impact, leading, hopefully, to a rapid drop in deaths.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told the briefing the coronavirus infection rate remained \"pretty forbiddingly high\" to ease lockdown restrictions, which have been in place in England since 5 January.\nBut he said \"at a certain stage we will want to be getting things open\".\nHe added: \"What I will be doing in the course of the next few days and weeks is setting out in more detail, as soon as we can, when and how we want to get things open again.\"\nUnder the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons - including for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nMeanwhile, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the UK government to impose the first lockdown has told BBC Radio 4's PM he believes more action in autumn last year could have \"drastically reduced\" the number of lives lost in the second wave - some 60,000.\nProf Neil Ferguson said: \"They couldn't have been eliminated, but they could have been drastically reduced by earlier action, unfortunately.\n\"How much is difficult to judge, the new variant was unpredictable and did change our understanding of how much was needed to control spread, but we did just let the autumn wave get to far, far too high infection levels.\"\nReacting to the UK's death toll, Mr Johnson said he took \"full responsibility\" for the government's actions, but added: \"We truly did everything we could.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThe boss of vaccine maker AstraZeneca has defended his company - amid an ongoing row with the EU about delays to supply. On Monday, the EU health commissioner accused AstraZeneca of giving \"insufficient explanations\". But Pascal Soriot told Italian newspaper La Repubblica (English version) the delay was partly caused by the EU agreeing its vaccine deal relatively late. \"We've also had teething issues like this in the UK supply chain,\" he said. \"But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So with the UK we have had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced.\" You can read about the EU's vaccination problems here, see how its vaccine rollout compares with other countries here, and watch a video explainer below.\nAs we reported on Tuesday, the UK is to introduce \"hotel quarantine\" for some people entering the country. Yesterday, the government hadn't decided whether it would apply to all arrivals - or just those from \"high risk\" countries. Now, after a late night meeting, it seems it will apply only to \"high risk\" areas, including South America, southern Africa, and Portugal. Although each part of the UK sets its own travel rules, it's thought all four nations will introduce hotel quarantine. Yesterday, Scotland's deputy first minister, John Swinney, said it would go \"at least as far\" as England. Read the UK's travel rules here - and watch what one bored tennis player did in quarantine below.\nOn Tuesday evening, another 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a Covid test were announced in the UK - taking the total above 100,000 since the start of the pandemic. Now, the Church of England's archbishops have urged the public to reflect on the \"enormity\" of the figure. \"Each number is a person: someone we loved and someone who loved us,\" said Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell. They are calling on people to join in a daily \"prayer for the nation\" at 18:00 GMT from 1 February. Watch Boris Johnson announce the \"grim statistic\" below.\nLabour is calling for juries to be reduced from 12 members to seven, to help clear the backlog of crown court cases, partly caused by the pandemic. The party says smaller juries and more temporary courts would allow socially distanced trials. The government has not ruled out the move - but insists it is clearing the backlog.

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

They (the remaining demonstrators) aren't going to give up that easily,\" he said.\nThe Met Police confirmed a number of officers were sent to the eviction site at Euston Square Gardens to assist High Court enforcement officers should there be any breach of the peace and to uphold Covid legislation.\nThe force said five people who were arrested at the site remain in custody.\nA spokeswoman for HS2 said tunnel protests were \"costly to the taxpayer\".\nShe added: \"HS2 has taken legal temporary possession of Euston Square Gardens in order to progress with works necessary for the construction of the new Euston station.\n\"These protests are a danger to the safety of the protesters, our staff and the general public, and put unnecessary strain on the emergency services during a pandemic.\"\nHS2 is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. It is hoped the 20-year project will reduce rail passenger overcrowding and help to rebalance the UK's economy.\nThe campaign group alleges HS2 is the \"most expensive, wasteful and destructive project in UK history\" and that it is \"set to destroy or irreparably damage 108 ancient woodlands and 693 wildlife sites\".\nHowever, HS2 bosses have said seven million trees will be planted during phase one of the project and that much ancient woodland will \"remain intact\".\nBBC London Home Affairs correspondent Katharine Carpenter\nThere is a ring of security surrounding the square outside Euston Station and a crowd of journalists reporting on today's event.  \nEvery now and then there is a burst of singing through a loud hailer and motivational speeches echo from the trees. \nMost of the protesters we can see are among the branches, some have cut their safety lines, others are swinging in harnesses.\nEarlier, enforcement officers were lifted up in a cherry picker into one of the tree camps . They have spoken with the demonstrators and are now fixing ropes to the high level platforms.\nWe've been told at least four people are inside the tunnels HS2 Rebellion have dug under the site.\nPeople inside the fence have said they predict the eviction to \"take weeks\".\nThe atmosphere is calm but the police have begun to push back people watching, reminding them of Covid-19 regulations and asking to see press passes.\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has suggested that Boris Johnson should not visit Scotland as it is not an \"essential\" journey.\nThe prime minister is widely expected to travel to Scotland on Thursday.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said she was \"not ecstatic\" about the plan, saying leaders should abide by the same rules as they ask of the general public.\nAsked about the trip, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said Mr Johnson would go \"wherever he needs to go in his vital work against this pandemic\".\nAnd Downing Street has insisted that it is important for the prime minister to be \"visible and accessible\" during the pandemic. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman did not confirm details of the visit, but said: \"It remains the fact that it is a fundamental role of the PM to be the physical representative of the UK government\".\nThe spokesman added: \"It is right that he is visible and accessible to businesses, communities and the public across all parts of the UK, especially during the pandemic.\"\nReports have suggested Mr Johnson is due to visit Scotland on Thursday to thank staff involved in the fight against Covid-19, despite the \"stay at home\" lockdown in place across the country.\nSpeaking at her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon stressed that she was not saying Mr Johnson was unwelcome in Scotland, but added that she was \"not ecstatic\" about the idea of him travelling up from London. \nShe said: \"We are living in a global pandemic and every day I stand and look down the camera and say 'don't travel unless it is essential, work from home if you possibly can' - that has to apply to all of us.\n\"People like me and Boris Johnson have to be in work for reasons people understand, but we don't have to travel across the UK. We have a duty to lead by example.\"\nMs Sturgeon said her team had suggested she visit a mass vaccination centre in Aberdeen in the coming weeks, but that she had questioned whether the journey was \"genuinely essential\".\nShe said: \"If I'm standing here every day saying to all of you watching, don't leave your house unless it is essential, I have a duty to subject myself to that same discipline and decision making.\n\"I would say me travelling from Edinburgh to Aberdeen to visit a vaccine centre is not essential - Boris Johnson travelling from London to wherever in Scotland to do the same is not essential.\n\"If we're asking other people to abide by that then I'm sorry, I think it's incumbent on us to do likewise.\"\nThe Scottish secretary was asked about the move at Westminster by SNP MP Neale Hanvey, who described the trip as a \"futile\" attempt to bolster the union following a trend of polls suggesting majority support for independence.\nMr Jack replied: \"That's ridiculous - the prime minister is the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and wherever he needs to go in his vital work against this pandemic, he will go.\""

      "tags": "UK banking,Money,Personal finance,Contactless payment",
      "text": "The limit on a single payment using contactless card technology could rise to \u00a3100 - more than double the current limit.\nThe coronavirus pandemic led to larger amounts spent via contactless payments on debit cards, credit cards, and cards connected to smartphones.\nIt has been less than a year since the limit was raised from \u00a330 to \u00a345.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it will consult \"shortly\" on a change in the rules.\n\"It is important that payments regulation keeps pace with consumer and merchant expectations,\" the regulator said. \n\"Recognising changing behaviour in how people pay, as part of a wider consultation, we will shortly be seeking views on amending our rules to allow for a possible increase in the\u00a0contactless\u00a0limit to \u00a3100.\"\nThe FCA can set the boundaries for payments, under its rules, but the card issuers would have the power to set the actual limits.\nThe use of contactless technology by consumers has risen sharply in recent years, with more services adopting the technology and most shops offering it as an option.\nTo protect workers and consumers during the Covid outbreak, an increase to the current limit of \u00a345 was rushed through by the regulator in April last year.\nThe latest figures show that the proportion of contactless payments had fallen slightly compared with pre-pandemic levels, because lockdown measures hit the use of pubs, restaurant, and public transport. They accounted for 41% of card transactions.\nHowever, there was a 16% increase in the total value of contactless payments in the UK in October, compared with the same month a year earlier, the latest data from UK Finance - which represents banks - shows.\nThe amount spent on contactless hit a monthly record in August, boosted by the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and fewer coronavirus-related restrictions. A total of \u00a38.4bn was spent on credit and debit cards using contactless during that month.\n\"The industry believes that a more flexible approach could be merited in future, which takes into account consumer demand, fraud prevention, security and convenience,\" said a spokesman for UK Finance.\n\"Contactless is one of a range of payment methods and the industry will also continue to work closely with the regulator to ensure that customers can pay in a way that suits them.\"\nHowever, there may be less enthusiasm from some shopkeepers concerned about higher-value theft as a result of the proposed changes.\nAndrew Cregan, payments policy advisor at the British Retail Consortium, said: \"We have concerns about raising the contactless limit, with losses from incomplete contactless payments at self-checkouts currently costing retailers millions in lost revenue. \n\"Card companies should take measures to reduce incomplete payments and we urge customers to make sure their own transactions always go through. However, the overwhelming priority at the moment must be for the government to address the rocketing card fees.\""

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has called on the government to \"use the window\" of the February half-term to vaccinate all teachers and support staff.\nSpeaking at Prime Ministers Questions, the Labour leader said reopening schools must be a national priority.\nLabour wants to bring forward the vaccination of key workers alongside others in high risk groups.\nBut Boris Johnson said the proposal would \"delay our ability to move forward out of lockdown\".\nThe PM said teachers in the top nine priority groups would be vaccinated as a \"matter of priority\", adding: \"I know how deeply frustrating it is, the extra burden that we have placed on families by closing the schools.\"\nMr Johnson said he remained confident that the top four priority groups - taking in all over-70s, health and care staff and elderly care home residents - would receive a first jab by mid-February \"if we can get the supply\" of vaccines.\nBy the end of April those in the next five priority groups, including all over-50s and younger adults with underlying health conditions, should have been offered a jab, under the government's plans.\nLabour wants to see workers in critical professions - such as police officers, firefighters and transport workers, as well as teachers - vaccinated alongside these groups.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \"The NHS rightly deserve congratulations for their impressive and speedy roll out of vaccinations. \n\"But now we need to go further and faster. \n\"Not only will vaccination acceleration save lives it will help us to carefully and responsibly reopen our economy and crucially ensure children are back in school as transmission reduces.\"\nBut asked about the proposal in the Commons, Mr Johnson said it would \"take vaccines away from the more vulnerable groups and... delay our ability to move forward out of lockdown\".\nThe government has said it will prioritise the reopening of schools as it begins the process of lifting lockdown restrictions, but in a Commons statement after PMQs, Mr Johnson indicated that schools would remain closed until early March.\n\"We hope it will... be safe to begin the reopening of schools from Monday, 8 March, with other economic and social restrictions being removed thereafter as and when the data permits,\" he told MPs."

      "text": "The head of AstraZeneca has defended its rollout of the coronavirus vaccine in the EU, amid tension with member states over delays in supply.\nPascal Soriot told Italian newspaper La Repubblica that his team was working \"24/7 to fix the very many issues of production of the vaccine\".\nHe said production was \"basically two months behind where we wanted to be\".\nHe also said the EU's late decision to sign contracts had given limited time to sort out hiccups with supply.\nMr Soriot, chief executive of the UK-Swedish multinational, said a contract with the UK had been signed three months before the one with the EU, giving more time for glitches to be ironed out.\nHe told La Repubblica that problems in \"scaling up\" vaccine production were being experienced at two plants, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium.\n\"It's complicated, especially in the early phase where you have to really sort out all sorts of issues,\" he said.\n\"We believe we've sorted out those issues, but we are basically two months behind where we wanted to be.\"\nHe added: \"We've also had teething issues like this in the UK supply chain. But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So with the UK we have had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced.\n\"Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume. We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small.\"\nMr Soriot also said AstraZeneca was working on a vaccine with Oxford University that would target the South African variant of the coronavirus. \nScientists have warned there is a chance the South African variant may harm the effectiveness of current vaccines.\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine is already being used in the UK but has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to give it the green light at the end of this month.\nThe bloc signed a deal in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March.\nThe EU has ordered 600 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is already being used on patients around the bloc.\nBut Pfizer-BioNTech said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian plant.\nIn response to the delays, the EU has said it might restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc.\nHealth Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said companies making Covid vaccines in the bloc would have to \"provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries\".\nShe said the 27-member EU bloc would \"take any action required to protect its citizens\".\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, addressing the virtual version of the annual World Economic Forum (WEF), usually held in Davos, said:  \"Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Thursday morning.\nThe prime minister says 8 March is the \"earliest\" that schools in England could begin to reopen to all pupils. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Boris Johnson said he wanted a \"cautious\" approach to relaxing restrictions to ensure there would be no accompanying \"surge\" in coronavirus infections. He said he hoped other lockdown restrictions could begin to be gradually eased after schools reopened, adding that he intended to set out his \"roadmap\" in the final week of February which would allow people to \"steadily reclaim our lives\". Read about the plans for schools in the rest of the UK here.\nPeople wishing to travel abroad from the UK will be required to fill in a form explaining why their trip is necessary, the home secretary has said, with enforcement stepped up at airports to prevent people going on holiday. Priti Patel also confirmed British residents arriving in England from Covid hotspots will have to quarantine in hotels for 10 days, at their own expense. The measures will apply to people coming from most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal, amid concern over new variants of the virus. The Scottish and Welsh governments have said they are concerned the rules don't go far enough.\nThe latest twist in the row between the EU and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca over shortages has seen the EU urge the vaccine maker to supply it with more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine from UK plants. The bloc said UK factories, which have not experienced production problems, were part of AstraZeneca's deal to deliver 300 million doses. The company reportedly said last week the EU would get 60% fewer doses than promised in the first quarter of 2021, citing production issues at a Belgian plant.\nA cough, fatigue, a sore throat and muscle pain may be more common in people who test positive for the new UK variant of coronavirus. The findings come from a study by the Office for National Statistics based on positive tests from a random sample of 6,000 people in England. It also suggests that loss of taste and smell may be slightly less likely to affect those with the new form of the virus - although it is still one of the three main symptoms of the virus.\nGeoff Woolf, 74, is settling back into life at his home in north London after 10 months - or 306 days - in hospital. He is believed to have spent one of the longest periods in hospital of any coronavirus patient before being discharged. Read about how Geoff, despite his three sons being called into the hospital to say goodbye, defied the odds to return home.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nA growing number of people in the UK have received a Covid vaccination, we take a look at whether those who have had the jab still need to follow the rules.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has resumed at a plant after it was suspended when a suspicious package was received.\nThe Wockhardt UK plant on Wrexham Industrial Estate was evacuated and the Army sent a bomb disposal unit.\nPolice said the package had been made safe and its contents would be \"taken away for analysis\".\nWockhardt said staff had been allowed to return and its production schedule had not been affected.\nBoth Downing Street and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford had been receiving updates on the incident since police were called at about 10:40 GMT.\nA police cordon was put in place near the plant and the public were asked to keep away. There are no reports of any injuries.\n\"There are no wider concerns for public safety, however, some roads on the industrial estate will remain closed whilst we continue our investigations,\" North Wales Police said in a statement.\nForensic police officers were seen examining items on the road outside the plant, which remained closed after the cordon had been lifted.\nWockhardt UK said: \"We can confirm that the investigation on the suspicious package received today has been concluded.  \n\"Given that staff safety is our main priority, manufacturing was temporarily paused whilst this took place safely.  \n\"We can now confirm that the package was made safe and staff are now being allowed back into the facility. \n\"This temporary suspension of manufacturing has in no way affected our production schedule and we are grateful to the authorities and experts for their swift response and resolution of the incident.\"\nIn an earlier statement, the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology company confirmed it had \"partially evacuated\" its site to protect staff.\nThe Wrexham plant has the capability to produce about 300 million doses of the vaccine a year.\nEarlier on Wednesday, John Roberts, who runs CMS Wrexham Ltd, next door to the plant, said he heard a \"big bang\" at about 11:35 GMT - although he could not say where the noise came from.\n\"We're next door to Wockhardt. Three of us were talking then we heard a hell of an explosion or a bang,\" he said. \n\"I went outside, couldn't see anything. I looked the other side and two blokes were on the roof. \n\"The next thing the police had blocked off the road and were looking in the bushes.\"\nHis son Mark Roberts said: \"The police just closed the road off and we've heard there's a bomb disposal unit. \n\"They've been here about an hour or so - we're on tenterhooks.\n\"Boris Johnson toured the factory around December time, so I wonder if that's raised the profile, as it's where they make the Oxford vaccine.\"\nDave Picken, 53, who lives near Wrexham Industrial Estate, said: \"We've seen lots of police cars and a fire engine.\n\"Bomb disposal are here with a robot. We were closer to the factory but police told us to move and cordoned off a bigger area.\n\"I did ask an officer how big the bomb is but he said he couldn't say it's a bomb.\"\nVisiting the plant in November, Prime Minister Boris Johnson it could provide \"salvation for humanity\".\nWockhardt UK entered an agreement in August to help prepare the vaccine for distribution.\nWhen the company's contract was announced, Ravi Limaye, managing director, said: \"We are immensely proud to have been selected to partner with the UK government on this project.\n\"We have a sophisticated sterile manufacturing facility and a highly skilled workforce.\"\nOn Thursday, Wrexham council leader Mark Pritchard said teams had worked to ensure the vaccine was not lost in the floods. \nThe Welsh Government said there had been \"no adverse effects\" on the coronavirus vaccine roll-out."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "A decision to allow NI back office health workers to be vaccinated at an early stage goes against the guidance of the government's advisory body, its deputy chair has said.\nThese staff are part of phase one of NI's Covid-19 vaccine rollout. \nProf Anthony Harnden said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) had made front-line health workers the \"clear\" priority. \nHe said giving a dose to backroom staff took it away from those at higher risk.\nAs of Monday, 159,642 people in Northern Ireland had received a first coronavirus vaccine dose.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health daily figures reported an additional 16 Covid-19 related deaths and 550 new cases, bringing the total number of positive tests to 101,291. \nSince Monday, there has been a reduction in the number of inpatients, patients receiving intensive care treatment, and the number of patients ventilated. \nLast week, the Department of Health (DoH) confirmed staff in non-patient facing roles, including those in IT and accounts, were eligible for the vaccine in the first stage. \nIt also said that the decision \"does not go against JCVI guidance\".\nBBC News NI has contacted the department for a response to Prof Harnden's comments.\nSpeaking on BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Prof Harnden said vaccinating back office health staff did not follow the JCVI's guidance.\nIt advises the first priorities for any Covid-19 vaccination programme \"should be the prevention of Covid-19 mortality and the protection of health and social care staff and systems\".\nHe said that people have to \"remember that for every dose you give to somebody else who isn't hugely at risk, you're denying somebody at risk that first dose\". \nProf Harnden added the JCVI \"really feel quite strongly that it should be just front-line healthcare and social care workers\". \n\"We purposefully put the front-line worker into our advice and into our strategy.\n\"The reason we said that was threefold. One, because of their exposure risk; two, because of the possibility that they would transmit to vulnerable elderly people that they were looking after who we know are hugely at risk; and, third, to keep the NHS running at a time of crisis.\"\nLast week, a DoH spokesperson said the department took the decision to vaccinate staff in its Business Services Organisation (BSO) because they help ensure that health trusts and organisations \"can effectively deliver vital services\".\n\"Protecting BSO staff via vaccination to continue to deliver this support is essential for the smooth and continued functioning of the HSC (Health and Social Care system) during the pandemic and particularly at this time of extreme pressure on our health service. \n\"If the back office is down, the front line can't operate effectively.\"\nProf Harnden said this reason, of keeping the health system running smoothly by vaccinating back office staff, was a \"stretch of the argument\". \n\"One could argue that actually lots of systems in the UK need to work very smoothly and there are lots of different groups clamouring to receive the vaccine as soon as possible and I fully understand that.\n\"The JCVI took a really strong stance on this that what we wanted to do was protect [from] hospitalisations and deaths.\""

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The prime minister has responded to calls that were getting louder for clarity about what might happen next and when.\nHe pencilled in a date for the country's diary. But 8 March is the hoped-for beginning of the end of lockdown - far from a guarantee. \nPolitical demands for more information from his backbench MPs and the opposition were part of the reason for his announcement. But there was also the relentless march of the clock.\nThe government had promised it would give schools in England two weeks' notice of whether they would be able to open after half-term.\nWith Boris Johnson not expected in Westminster on Thursday, Wednesday was the last viable moment to keep that vow. \nWith cases still so high, and hospitals still so full, in theory the announcement wasn't that much of a surprise. \nNorthern Ireland is already in lockdown until 5 March, but will confirm its position on schools on Thursday.\nWales and Scotland are reviewing whether to extend closures beyond the middle of February in the next couple of days. Without dramatic falls in case numbers, they seem likely to be in step soon too. \nIn practice, though, Mr Johnson's announcement still felt like a big admission: that we're heading for 12 months of limits - starting last March - on our lives in one way or another.\nFirms and families around the UK will have had to cope with moving in and out of lockdown for a whole year. \nLike Tuesday's terrible 100,000-deaths mark, it's a milestone that at the beginning of all of this simply wouldn't have been imagined.\nBut as time as worn on, the pattern has become familiar: push the dates back, confront the worst rather than hope for the best.\nThe prime minister altered, maybe, too. You could hear it in his tone when asked what the chances of sticking to his date were. \"That's the earliest,\" he warned, suggesting that a long list of things have to go right. \nOne cabinet minister described the government's position: \"The decision making has been more and more cautious as they've been caught out so many times.\"\nNo one perhaps would be more delighted than Mr Johnson if the pace of the disease slows dramatically and the promise of the vaccine comes good very soon.\nBut at this time, with a buffer of several weeks to keep looking at the information, that's not a commitment that ministers are willing to make.

      "text": "Scotland could introduce tougher quarantine rules for international travellers than other parts of the UK, the first minister has said. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that UK arrivals from regions with new virus variants will be provided accommodation for 10 days to isolate.\nNicola Sturgeon said she was \"concerned the proposal does not go far enough\".\nScotland will \"initially emulate\" the UK government measures, she said.\nBut further Scottish rules will be set out next week if the four nations do not reach an agreement on a UK-wide approach - which Ms Sturgeon said would be preferable. \nThe prime minister has said there are 22 countries with the risk of known new variants, including the South American nations, Portugal and South Africa.\nMr Johnson said anyone travelling from these countries who cannot be refused entry to the UK - such as British citizens - will be provided accommodation for 10 days to isolate \"without exception\".\nThey will be met at the airport and transferred to specific places, such as hotels.\nFurther details of the plan are expected to be outlined by Home Secretary Priti Patel later. \nHowever Ms Sturgeon - who was briefed on the UK government proposals in advance - told her daily coronavirus briefing that a \"comprehensive system of supervised quarantine\" was required in the next stage of the pandemic.\nAnd she said she was \"seeking urgently\" to persuade the UK government \"to go much further\" while providing additional support to the aviation industry. \nThe first minister said: \"Our best route back to greater domestic normality right now, as we continue with the vaccine programme, is firstly to suppress the virus here to as low as level as possible - as we did over the summer - then give ourselves a better chance of controlling it through test and protect, and next by doing much more than we did last year to protect our borders.\"\nThe Welsh government has also said the PM's proposals do not go far enough.\nWhen questioned by journalists, Ms Sturgeon said she would \"not give arbitrary dates\" on when the travel restrictions might come to an end.\nBut she said people \"might not be able to go on holiday overseas\" in order to \"get domestic normality\" back - including the reopening of schools and allowing people more interactions with loved ones.\n\"I'm not saying that's easy but maybe that might be a price we all need to be prepared to pay,\" she added.\nScottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross told the BBC that he believed that countries with higher infection rates and strains with quicker transmission should be prioritised.\n\"We've got to look at dealing with this in stages,\" he said. \"This doesn't need to be dragged into a Scotland versus England issue or the rest of the UK issue.\n\"This is as big an issue within Scotland. We shouldn't be moving around local authority areas so whether it's north or south of the border or within our own communities we've got to reduce travel as much as possible.\"\nIt comes as the deaths of a further 92 people who had tested positive for coronavirus were recorded in Scotland - bringing the total to 5,888.\nThe total number of deaths across the UK by that measure passed the grim milestone of 100,00 on Tuesday.\nMs Sturgeon said she was \"truly sorry\" for any mistakes that had been made in the handling of the pandemic. \nShe added: \"She said the death toll should make all political leaders \"think very hard about what more we could have done and what lessons we must continue to learn\".\nShe added: \"I know that I, and everyone in my government, have tried every day to do everything we possibly can.\n\"But I don't think any of us, reflecting on numbers like these, can conclude that we have always succeeded.\"\nA total of 1,330 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, representing 6.2% of people tested.\nMeanwhile 462,092 people have received the first dose of the vaccine in Scotland - including 56% of the over 80s and 95% of people in care homes."

      "text": "An \"incredible\" recently-qualified teacher has died with coronavirus on her 25th birthday.  \nClaudia Marsh's death was described as \"sudden and unexpected\" by a charity which had helped her recover from an eating disorder several years ago.\nShe had gone on to volunteer for the organisation and became a \"beacon of hope\" for others.\nHer mother Tina Marsh, from Heswall in Wirral, said she was \"very proud\" and \"blown away\" by the many tributes.\nClaudia died at Liverpool's Royal University Hospital on Wednesday.\nWriting on Facebook, Ms Marsh said she was a \"beautiful daughter and incredible sister\" who was selfless in her work for Merseyside-based charities Talking Eating Disorders (TEDS) and The Whitechapel Centre.\nShe said: \"She loved giving back to people less fortunate than herself.\"\nFamily friend Leigh Best, who founded TEDS, described the death as \"heartbreaking\".\nShe added: \"Claudia was very special, kind, caring and a dedicated teacher.\n\"She supported countless families across the UK. Claudia made her own little packs to give out to others with eating disorders with positive affirmations.\n\"She was full of positivity, kindness and hope, and had a smile that would brighten up the whole room.\"\nIn a statement, the Whitechapel Centre, where Claudia also volunteered, said staff were \"devastated\", adding she would leave behind a \"legacy of care, dedication and enthusiasm\".\nThe charity said she put all of her time and energy into providing food and clothing to those who needed it during the pandemic.\n\"Claudia always put others before herself and her memory will live on through the impact and contribution she made to our organisation,\" the centre said.\n\"She was instrumental in bringing together our volunteer community.\"\nMs Marsh has set up an online fundraising page for the two charities, which has already garnered more than \u00a310,000. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,UK climate change protests,Paris climate agreement,Climate change,Schools' climate change protests",
      "text": "Despite the pandemic, almost two thirds of people around the world now view climate change as a global emergency.\nThat's the key finding from the largest opinion poll yet conducted on tackling global warming. \nMore than a million people in 50 countries took part in the survey, with almost half the participants aged between 14 and 18.\nConserving forests and land emerged as the most popular solution for tackling the issue. \nThe poll, called the \"People's Climate Vote\", has been organised by the United Nations Development Programme in conjunction with Oxford University.\nThe organisers distributed poll questions through adverts in mobile gaming apps across 50 countries, between October and December last year. \nAround 1.22 million people of all genders, ages, and educational backgrounds took part, but with significant numbers of younger people. \nSome 550,000 people aged 14-18 took part. \nAcross all countries, 64% of participants saw climate change as an emergency, requiring urgent responses from countries.  The margin of error was +/- 2%.\nThis result varied somewhat by age and location.\nIn the UK and Italy, 81% agreed with the question, while this dropped to 50% among those responding from Moldova.\nNewly installed US President Joe Biden can take some comfort that 65% of those in the US taking part now view climate change as an emergency.\nOverall, younger people were more likely to agree with the view that rising temperatures were an emergency, with nearly 70% in favour. \nFor people over the age of 60, this dropped to 58%. \n\"People are scared, they are seeing the the wildfires in Australia and California, they're seeing the category five storms and in the Caribbean, they are seeing flooding in in Southeast Asia,\" said Cassie Flynn, strategic adviser to the UNDP.\n\"And they're looking around them and they're saying, this is a real problem. We have to do something about this.\"\nThe actions that people tend to favour when it comes to tackling climate change depend, to some extent, on where people live. \nIn eight of the 10 countries with the highest emissions from generating electricity, there were majorities in favour of using more green energy.\nBut in countries with bigger emissions from deforestation and land use changes, there was majority support for conserving forests and land. \nThis emerged from the overall survey as the most popular policy for dealing with climate change, by a narrow margin.\nThe least-favoured options for tackling climate change in this survey were a plant-based diet, with only 30% of respondents believing it to be the best. \nGermany, with 44%, and the UK, with 43%, were the countries where plant-based diets received the strongest support. \nThe authors say that across all countries, remarkably few people declined to support any policy.\nPakistan emerged as the country with the greatest number of people not favouring any policy, at 5%.\nIt was followed by the United States, with 4%.\nOne of the key differences that emerged in the data was the level of education. \n\"When it comes to demographics, something that we saw very clearly was that there is a high correlation between a level of education and belief in the climate emergency. The more educated you are, the more likely you are to believe that there is a climate emergency,\" said Cassie Flynn.\n\"And this is really, really powerful, because it doesn't matter where you're from, it doesn't matter your age, education really, really is important.\"\nWhile the overall findings show roughly the same responses from men and women, there were quite pronounced differences at the country level.\nIn Canada, women and girls were 12% more likely to say that climate change is an emergency than men and boys.\nThe US, UK and Australia had smaller differences in the same direction. \nIn contrast, India, Georgia, Vietnam and Nigeria went in the opposite direction, with men and boys being 9-12% more likely to say that warming is an emergency. \nWith a new president in the White House who is making climate change a priority, and with a key global conference taking place in Glasgow later this year, the organisers of the poll believe that it is an important time for world leaders to hear a wide range of voices on climate change.\n\"How they respond to the climate crisis, how they respond to the Covid crisis, is really going to chart an entirely new pathway. And so in many ways, it is this moment of choice,\" said Cassie Flynn from UNDP.\n\"And what we wanted to do with the people's climate vote is to bring people's voices to that decision making, to bring people's voices to the climate debate.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "title": "Legal threat over bee-harming pesticide use",
      "tags": "Bees,Pesticides",
      "text": "The Wildlife Trusts is to take legal action against the UK government over its decision to allow a pesticide that is almost entirely banned in the EU.\nIn 2018, the EU banned the outdoor use of neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm pollinating insects such as bees.\nBut following Brexit, the government approved the emergency use of one neonicotinoid to combat a crop disease.\nThe charity has told Environment Secretary George Eustice of their intention to challenge the decision.\nIn a letter to Mr Eustice, the Trusts says it will push for a judicial review unless the government can \"prove it has acted lawfully\".\nMultiple studies, including large-scale field trials, have found that neonicotinoids harm pollinators and aquatic life. Research has also shown that they can be linked to the wider collapse in biodiversity. \nThe government says it allowed the use of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam because of the \"potential danger\" to the sugar beet crop from beet yellows virus, which is spread by aphids. \nThe virus can have a severe impact on sugar beet.\nIt stressed that use of the chemical would be strictly limited, and the risk to bees was \"acceptable\" because sugar beet doesn't flower. Alternative chemicals should be used to kill any wild flowering plants in and around the crops, the government said.\nNeonicotinoids are the most widely-used class of insecticides in the world and they work by disrupting the insect central nervous system.\nTwo years ago, the EU's ban was supported by then-Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who said the weight of evidence was \"greater than previously understood\". Unless the evidence changed, he said, the restrictions would be maintained post-Brexit. \nThe government says the change in policy is based on \"new evidence\". But, so far, they haven't made this science public.\nHowever, Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said there was no new evidence to justify the change in policy. \nHe said: \"The government refused a request for emergency authorisation in 2018 and we want to know what's changed. Where's the new evidence that it's okay to use this extremely harmful pesticide?\n\"Using neonicotinoids not only threatens bees but is also extremely harmful to aquatic wildlife because the majority of the pesticide leaches into soil and then into waterways. Worse still, farmers are being recommended to use weedkiller to kill wildflowers in and around sugar beet crops in a misguided attempt to prevent harm to bees in the surrounding area. This is a double blow for nature.\"\nIt was the National Farmers' Union (NFU) and British Sugar that applied for the authorisation. Victoria Prentis, a minister with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told BBC News that it \"wasn't ideal\". But she was \"convinced it was appropriate\" and that the government was \"committed to reducing pesticide use and integrated pest management\".\nThe pesticide will be authorised for use if there is a large enough outbreak of the disease. And it can only be used for a period of up to 120 days. Around a dozen other EU countries, including France and Germany, have also agreed emergency permits.\nMs Prentis said the authorisation was very specific, and \"targeted at a non-flowering crop, which bees are not attracted to\".\nHowever research, shows that the highly toxic chemicals can persist in the wider ecosystem for some time, potentially to be absorbed by wildflowers that pollinators then visit. \nProf Glen Jeffery, from University College London (UCL), said he felt \"horror\" when he learned of the government's decision.\n\"We've slowly moved away from it and yet it's creeping back in,\" he told BBC News. \n\"It's very prevalent in other parts of the world, but then you find in other parts of the world vast numbers of pollinating insects have just vanished and they've just gone through heavy pesticide use. We reach the ridiculous situation where in parts of California thousands of beehives are trucked from Texas and from Florida into California to pollinate crops.\"\nThere has been one full sugar beet harvest since outdoor neonicotinoid use was banned. According to the NFU, the 2019-20 harvest was largely unaffected by beet yellows disease. This year's sugar beet harvest is currently underway, and yields are expected to be down by around 25% compared with the five-year average, with some farmers losing as much as 80% of their crop. \nAccording to the NFU, there are 3,000 farmers who grow sugar beet, and the wider industry supports around 9,500 jobs in England, largely in the East. \nThe NFU has called the situation \"unprecedented\" and its sugar board chairman Michael Sly said: \"I am relieved that our application for emergency use of a neonicotinoid seed treatment for the 2021 sugar beet crop has been granted.\"\nNeurobiologist and environmental pharmacologist Dr Chris Connolly said that, since 2018, when neonicotinoids were banned in the EU, around 400 papers had been published looking into thiamethoxam, and none said they were less harmful.\nHe said he could be in favour of using it: \"But rarely, and when it's really needed - when it's an emergency. It's not an emergency if you apply for it before an emergency.\nHe added: \"Is adding pesticides to pesticides the way to go towards better sustainability?\"\nWhen they were introduced in 2005, neonicotinoids were seen as a good alternative to traditional pesticides. They are systemic, which means they are absorbed by the plant, so are applied to seeds as a coating - instead of being sprayed. However, it has become clear they are highly toxic to invertebrates such as insects.\nThe government recently committed to spending \u00a33bn of international climate finance to \"supporting nature and biodiversity\".\nSeveral hundred thousand people have now signed various online petitions against the move. Earlier this month, more than 30 wildlife and environmental organisations, including Pesticide Action Network and the RSPB, wrote a joint letter to Mr Eustice calling on the government to publish the new evidence that led to the derogation being approved.\nFollow Claire on Twitter."

      "tags": "Conservation,Extinction,Sharks,Oceans",
      "text": "Scientists say sharks and rays are disappearing from the world's oceans at an \"alarming\" rate.\nThe number of sharks found in the open oceans has plunged by 71% over half a century, mainly due to over-fishing, according to a new study.\nThree-quarters of the species studied are now threated with extinction.\nAnd the researchers say immediate action is needed to secure a brighter future for these \"extraordinary, irreplaceable animals\".\nThey are calling on governments to implement science-based fishing limits.\nStudy researcher, Dr Richard Sherley of the University of Exeter, said the declines appear to be driven very much by fishing pressures. \nHe told BBC News: \"That's the driver for the 70% reduction in the last 50 years. For every 10 sharks you had in the open ocean in the 1970s, you would have three today, across these species, on average.\"\nSharks and rays are caught for their meat, fins and liver oil. They are also captured for recreational fishing and turn up by accident in the catch of fishing boats that are targeting other stocks.\nOf the 31 species studied, 24 are now threatened with extinction, and three shark species (the oceanic whitetip shark, and the scalloped and great hammerhead sharks) have declined so sharply they are now classified as critically endangered - the highest threat category, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nProf Nicholas Dulvy of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, said oceanic sharks and rays are at exceptionally high risk of extinction, much more so than the average bird, mammal or frog, despite ranging far from land.\n\"Overfishing of oceanic sharks and rays jeopardises the health of entire ocean ecosystems as well as food security for some of the world's poorest countries,\" he said.\nThe researchers compiled global data on sharks and rays found in the open oceans (as opposed to reef sharks or those found close to shore).\nOf the 1,200 or so species of sharks and rays in the world, 31 are oceanic, travelling large distances across water.\n\"These are some of the big, important, open ocean predators that people will be familiar with,\" said Dr Sherley. \"The kind of sharks that people might describe as awe-inspiring or charismatic.\"\nHe said political will is needed to reverse the trends. \n\"The science is there, there needs to be the desire to do those stock assessments, to implement the measures that are needed to reduce the take of sharks and that political will has to come from pressure from citizens,\" Dr Sherley explained.\nDespite this \"gloomy\" picture, the scientists said a few shark conservation stories give cause for hope.\nSonja Fordham, president of Shark Advocates International, a non-profit project of The Ocean Foundation, said a couple of species, including the great white, have started to recover through science-based fishing limits.\n\"Relatively simple safeguards can help to save sharks and rays, but time is running out,\" she said. \n\"We urgently need conservation action across the globe to prevent myriad negative consequences and secure a brighter future for these extraordinary, irreplaceable animals.\"\nSharks are at the top of the food chain, and crucial to the health of the oceans. Their loss impacts other marine animals as well as human livelihoods.\n\"Oceanic sharks and rays are vital to the health of vast marine ecosystems, but because they are hidden beneath the ocean surface, it has been difficult to assess and monitor their status,\" said Nathan Pacoureau of Simon Fraser University.\n\"Our study represents the first global synthesis of the state of these essential species at a time when countries should be addressing insufficient progress towards global sustainability goals.\n\"While we initially intended it as a useful report card, we now must hope it also serves as an urgent wake-up call.\"\nThe research is published in the journal, Nature.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Schools in England will not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March, the prime minister has said.\nBoris Johnson said this was the earliest schools could reopen and \"depends on lots of things going right\".\nThe BBC has been told the aim is for all schools and year groups in England to return at the same time. \nTheir return would mark the first stage in lifting the lockdown, the PM said.\nHe told a Downing Street news conference: \"The date of 8 March is the earliest that we think it is sensible to set for schools to go back and obviously we hope that all schools will go back.\"\n\"I'm hopeful, but that's the earliest that we can do it and it depends on lots of things going right, and... it also depends on us all now continuing to work together to drive down the incidence of the disease through the basic methods we've used throughout this pandemic,\" he added.\nThere was not enough data yet to decide when to end the lockdown, he said, but intended to set out a plan for how it could be eased - and the criteria involved - in the final week of February\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the 8 March date as \"very much a hope and certainly not a guarantee\".\nMeanwhile, a further 1,725 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures. The UK's official coronavirus death toll surpassed 100,000 on Tuesday. \nMr Johnson told MPs the country remained in a \"perilous situation\" as he said UK nationals and residents arriving from 30 high-risk countries would soon be ordered to quarantine in hotels.\nHe revealed a plan for the \"gradual and phased\" lifting of the lockdown in England could come in the week beginning 22 February.\nOther restrictions on daily life could be eased after schools reopen, but he explained this would depend on hitting vaccination targets, the capacity of the NHS, and deaths falling.\nAn earlier plan for mass testing for pupils and staff remains in place, the BBC has been told.\nEngland's schools have been closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers since the Christmas break.\nIn Scotland, it is hoped schools may begin a phased return in the middle of February. \nIn Wales, measures including school and college closures will be reviewed on Friday. In Northern Ireland, a review will take place on Thursday.\nThe prime minister said he understood frustration among pupils and teachers \"and for parents and for carers who spent so many months juggling their day jobs, not only with home schooling but meeting the myriad other demands of their children from breakfast until bedtime\".\nThe government initially planned to review England's lockdown measures - including school closures - on 15 February, which had raised hopes that pupils could return to classes after half term.\nAcknowledging the impact of continued school closures, Mr Johnson pledged to \"work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure that pupils have the chance to make up their learning\" before 2024.\nHe said \u00a3300m \"of new money to schools\" would fund a catch-up programme over the coming year, with financial incentives for providers to educate pupils who have missed lessons due to the pandemic. \nAfter complaints about confusion and drift about when schools in England are going back, Boris Johnson has sought to bring some certainty.\nThey won't be going back straight after half term - but the target date will be 8 March.\nSources say the aim is for all schools and year groups in England, in primary and secondary, to return back on that date - rather than it being the starting date of a phased or regional return.\nAlthough that could be subject to any changes in local Covid-19 levels.\nWhen schools do go back it is expected there will be mass testing for pupils and staff, in the scheme initially planned for the start of term.\nIt still leaves parents home schooling for another five weeks - and means most of this term will have been without face-to-face lessons.\nThis will be a particular worry for pupils heading for whatever replaces GCSEs and A-levels this summer, after almost a full year of stop-start lessons.\nHead teachers say the delay is \"no surprise\" - and reopening must be done safely.\nAnd Labour says half term should be used to vaccinate teachers to help schools stay open.\nBut the prime minister will hope that parents would rather have some clarity about what's happening with schools, even if that means a longer delay.\nTeachers' and head teachers' unions said they supported reopening schools but added that it must be safe and not rushed.\nMary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said that although the most vulnerable would be protected by March, most parents would not be.\n\"It fails completely to recognise the role schools have played in community transmission. The prime minister has already forgotten what he told the nation at the beginning of this lockdown, that schools are a 'vector for transmission',\" she said.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the government needs to work with head teachers to review safety measures and create a \"workable plan\" for schools to reopen fully.\n\"The government will also have to put effort into reassuring families that it is safe to send their children back to school - there is a confidence test the government must pass to make the return a success,\" he said.\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Companies,Boeing 737 Max 8,Boeing,Aviation safety,Lion Air plane crash,Air travel",
      "text": "Boeing's 737 Max plane is safe to return to service in the UK and the European Union, regulators have said.\nIt ends a 22-month flight ban for the jet, which followed two crashes which caused 346 deaths. \nThe plane had already been cleared to resume flying in North America and Brazil. \nBut this week a senior manager at Boeing's 737 plant in Seattle warned that recertification had happened too quickly.\nRegulators in the US and Europe insist their reviews have been thorough, and that the 737 Max aircraft is now safe.\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency (Easa), which regulates aviation in 31 mainly EU countries, said it now had \"every confidence\" in the plane following an independent review.\n\"But we will continue to monitor 737 Max operations closely as the aircraft resumes service,\" said executive director Patrick Ky.\n\"In parallel, and at our insistence, Boeing has also committed to work to enhance the aircraft still further in the medium term, in order to reach an even higher level of safety.\"\nThe UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which oversees UK aviation now Britain has left the EU, said the work to return the 737 Max to the skies had been \"the most extensive project of this kind\". \nIt said it was in close contact with Tui, currently the only UK operator of the aircraft, as it returned the plane to service. \n\"As part of this we will have full oversight of the airline's plans including its pilot training programmes and implementation of the required aircraft modifications.\"\nThe 737 Max's first accident occurred in October 2018, when a Lion Air jet came down in the sea off Indonesia.\nThe second involved an Ethiopian Airlines version that crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, just four months later.\nBoth have been attributed to flawed flight control software, which became active at the wrong time and prompted the aircraft to go into a catastrophic dive.\nEasa said it had done a full investigation independent of Boeing or the US Federal Aviation Administration and \"without any economic or political pressure\".\nAs a result, it demanded software upgrades, electrical working rework, maintenance checks, operations manual updates and crew training. \n\"We asked difficult questions until we got answers and pushed for solutions which satisfied our exacting safety requirements,\" Mr Ky said.  \nThe CAA said it had based its decision on information from Easa, the US Federal Aviation Agency and Boeing, as well as \"extensive engagement\" with airline operators and pilots. \nIt comes days after a report by Ed Pierson, a former Boeing manager, claimed that regulators and investigators had largely ignored factors that may have played a direct role in the accidents. \nMr Pierson said that further investigation of electrical issues and production quality problems at the 737 factory in Seattle was badly needed.\nOn Wednesday Naoise Connolly Ryan, whose husband Mick died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said that the families of victims \"still do not have a full accounting of what happened and why\".\n\"Ultimately we are more determined than ever to find out exactly what Boeing knew about this dangerous aircraft, and hold them accountable for the deaths of our loved ones.\"\nBoeing has already agreed to pay $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) to settle US criminal charges that it hid information from safety officials about the design of the planes.\nThe US Justice Department said the firm chose \"profit over candour\", impeding oversight of the planes.\nAbout $500m of that will go to families of the people killed in the tragedies.\nHowever, attorneys for the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash have said the deal would not end their pending civil lawsuit against Boeing.\nOn Wednesday, Boeing posted a record $12bn annual loss after it delayed its all-new 777X jet for the third time, incurring huge charges. \nThe coronavirus crisis has caused demand for the industry's largest jetliners to fall, with airline customers shunning deliveries of planes due international travel restrictions.\nThe 737 Max has already been cleared to fly in North America and Brazil - now it has the go-ahead from European regulators as well.\nIt's a major step for Boeing - although with the current travel restrictions in place, it's likely to be a while before the decision has much practical effect.\nBut the controversy won't end there. Relatives of those who died in the Ethiopian Airlines accident have made it clear they haven't heard enough to be sure the aircraft - modified in accordance with regulators' wishes - is truly safe.\nAnd this week, a former senior manager at the 737 factory told the BBC why he thought existing planes might still be carrying potentially dangerous manufacturing defects.\nThat may explain why Easa has also chosen to publish a report setting out the detailed reasoning behind its decision.\nUltimately, the 737 Max may we'll have decades of successful service ahead of it. But for the moment, winning back passenger confidence will be a formidable challenge."

      "text": "The UK has identified 77 cases of the coronavirus variant first detected in South Africa, the health secretary has said.\nCases are linked to travellers arriving in the UK, rather than community transmission, Matt Hancock added.\nHe told the BBC's Andrew Marr cases were under \"very close\" observation and enhanced contact tracing was under way.\nMinisters are due to meet on Monday to consider imposing tougher restrictions on people arriving from abroad. \nScientists have said there is a chance the South African variant may harm the effectiveness of current vaccines.\nMeanwhile, Mr Hancock said that \"three quarters of all the 80-year-olds in the country and a similar number of care homes\" have received their first doses of the vaccine.\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses, and figures so far reflect those given the first dose.\nMr Hancock said that it was \"far too early to say\" what proportion of the population needed to be vaccinated before lockdown restrictions could be eased.\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, mutate, and variants have been first located in the UK, South Africa and Brazil.\nThe South Africa variant has been found in at least 20 other countries, including the UK.\nMr Hancock said that all the South Africa variant cases in the UK were linked to travel.\n\"That's why we have got such stringent border measures in place against movement from South Africa,\" he added.\nThe UK closed all travel corridors last week until at least 15 February, with almost all travellers arriving in the country now required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has not ruled out bringing in tougher measures at UK borders, telling a Downing Street news conference on Friday: \"We don't want to put that (efforts to control Covid) at risk by having a new variant come back in.\"\nMinisters are set to discuss whether to tighten border restrictions further, including the possibility of hotel quarantines for travellers.\nMr Hancock said: \"We have got to be cautious at the borders.\"\nAsked for a date on when lockdown restrictions might end, Mr Hancock said it was \"one of the many things that we don't yet know the answer to\".\nGovernment data on 14 January showed there were 35 confirmed cases of the South Africa variant identified in the UK, and a further 12 \"probable\" cases.\nMr Hancock said nine cases of the Brazil variant had been found in the UK, adding \"we are monitoring each and every one very closely\".\nShadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that Labour had been \"pushing the government to take tougher measures at the border since last spring\".\nShe said: \"We would fully expect the government to bring in tougher quarantine measures, we would expect them to roll out a proper testing strategy and we would expect them as well to start checking up on the people who are quarantining.\n\"Only three out of every hundred people who are asked to quarantine when they arrive into the UK actually face any checks at all - that's just simply not sufficient.\"\nOn Friday, Mr Johnson said there was \"some evidence\" the UK variant may be associated with \"a higher degree of mortality\".\nThe UK government's chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, said there was \"a lot of uncertainty around these numbers\" but that early evidence suggested the variant could be about 30% more deadly.\nThe PM said on Friday that there was evidence that both the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine and Oxford-AstraZeneca jab were effective against the variant first detected in the UK. \nSir Patrick has warned that the variants in South Africa and Brazil might \"have certain features which means they might be less susceptible to vaccines\".\nBut he said \"there is no evidence\" that the two variants have transmission advantages over those already in the UK and so having cases here doesn't mean \"they will take off\".\nMeanwhile, England's deputy chief medical officer warned that people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine could still pass the virus on to others and should continue following lockdown rules.\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam stressed that scientists \"do not yet know the impact of the vaccine on transmission\".\nHe said vaccines offer \"hope\" but infection rates must come down quickly.\nIt's a key question but the fact is that no one can be sure. \nThat's because the trials of the vaccines explored the safety of the drugs and how well they prevent people from becoming ill - with good results for both. \nBut they did not investigate whether vaccination also stops infection and therefore whether people who've been immunised can still spread the virus to others. \nIf a vaccinated person did become infected, they probably wouldn't realise because they wouldn't have any symptoms. That's why health officials and ministers are so concerned. \nIt's possible that the antibodies boosted by the vaccine suppress the effects of the virus but don't eliminate it from the upper airway.  \nMany scientists are cautiously hopeful that in this scenario, the amount of virus would be reduced but they're waiting for the results of studies under way now.\nAnd until there's an answer, it's difficult to calculate how and when it's safe to ease restrictions and allow people to mix again. \nA further 610 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK on Sunday - down from 671 deaths last Sunday - in addition to 30,004 new infections.\nThe number of positive cases has fallen for the fourth day in a row and is the lowest figure since before Christmas.\nThe death figures tend to be lower on a Sunday and Monday because of weekend lags in reporting of the data.\nMeanwhile, more than six million people have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine - with the figure now standing at 6,353,321.\nNadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said on Twitter that 6,353,321 of the \"most vulnerable and frontline heroes\" had received a first dose of the vaccine, but there was still \"much more to do\".\nThere were 4,076 Covid patients in mechanical ventilation beds in UK hospitals as of Friday, according to government data.\nThat is higher than during the first wave, when the peak was 3,301 on 12 April.\nIn other developments:"

      "text": "A man shouted \"help me\" and \"get off me\" as he was restrained face-down by police officers hours before he died, an inquest heard.\nLeon Briggs, 39, died in 2013 after being detained under the Mental Health Act at Luton police station.\nA jury was told one witness described the father-of-two as \"like a child crying out for a toy\" as he was held down by officers.\nAnother said he looked her in the eyes and said \"please help me\".\nThe jury has been shown CCTV of Mr Briggs skipping between shops and across roads, before two Bedfordshire Police officers handcuffed him and placed him in leg restraints on Marsh Road in Luton on 4 November 2013.\nMr Briggs was detained in a cell at about 14:25 GMT, but he became unconscious and was pronounced dead in hospital at about 16:15.\nThe inquest heard his primary cause of death was \"amphetamine intoxication with prone restraint and prolonged struggling\" with a secondary cause of coronary heart disease.\nThe inquest heard Wendy Hamilton was shopping when she saw one officer restraining Mr Briggs on his lower legs, with another on his shoulders, and a third appeared to be looking through his wallet.\nMs Hamilton said she \"thought the amount of pressure being used was not needed\", adding she heard Mr Briggs shout \"get off me\" and \"why are you doing this to me?\".\n\"He lifted his head from the pavement, he looked me in the eyes and said 'please help me',\" she said.\nShe added when two paramedics arrived \"around 45 minutes\" after she first saw Mr Briggs, she was \"surprised\" they \"did not check Leon at all\".\nShe said he was later lifted into a police van \"front first\" and \"face down\", \"like he was a bag of potatoes\" or \"like they were picking up a dog\".\n\"They lifted him not in a rough way... but it was not very dignified,\" she said.\nAnother witness, Raja Khan, said: \"Mr Briggs was crying out... but not in an aggressive manner... in a similar way to a child crying out for a toy.\n\"I'm not going to forget what I saw in regard to the restraint... I do not agree with how Mr Briggs was treated... it would have been fair enough if he was being violent but from what I saw, he was not.\"\nFormer chairman of the College of Paramedics, Andrew Newton, said paramedics on Marsh Road were likely to have had \"inadequate knowledge\" of dealing with acute behavioural disorder patients like Mr Briggs in 2013, due to a lack of national guidance.\nBut Mr Newton added Mr Briggs \"received no meaningful medical care\" because they failed to properly check his vital signs, and this \"fell below the standards of care\".\nHe said Mr Briggs should have been taken to hospital in an ambulance.\nThe inquest heard part of a statement from Sgt Loren Short, who said he told paramedics Mr Briggs had been detained under the Mental Health Act when they arrived.\nPolice Community Support Officer (PCSO) James Collings described Mr Briggs as \"aggressive\" and \"nonsensical\", and \"shouting 'no, no' and snarling\" while in the police van.\nPCSO Collings said when he questioned whether Mr Briggs was on drugs, one officer said: \"[He is] mental\", and Mr Briggs replied: \"Don't take the [expletive]\", to which the officer said: \"I'm not taking the [expletive], I just want to get you back and get you some help.\"\nThe inquest continues.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents.\nThis winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again.\n\"There's a sense of fatigue,\" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own \"concentration levels have fallen dramatically\".\n\"It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,\" she says of the latest lockdown and the \"silent struggle\" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated.\nThere might have been some guilty enjoyment at the start of the year when the school term was initially delayed, not having to get up and out on cold January mornings. \nUntil it dawned on them that this was becoming something much longer than a few weeks. \nIt's morphed from early January to half term in mid-February and now maybe Easter in early April or even later. And Jacqueline says, as a matter of \"respect\", parents need to know what's happening about schools.\nThe confusion over a return date seems to have further frayed the nerves of parents.\nThe mother, who lives outside Canterbury in Kent, says she worries about the pressures building up on young people.\nFor teenagers like her sons, she says this \"should be a pivotal time in their lives,\" when they're beginning to get some independence and when social lives are hugely important - but instead they're stuck inside with their parents.\n\"We can't live like the Waltons forever,\" she says, referencing the US TV series of a folksy family relying on each other.\nThe first lockdown created an unexpected sense of togetherness, an \"enforced bonding\" that she says turned out to be a \"massive positive\".\nBut Jacqueline, who works as a writer, sees no such upside to the latest lockdown. There is a collective frustration - and she says it has been made even worse by the confusion about when schools will go back.\nThe online home-schooling seems to be working, she says, with teachers trying to boost the enthusiasm levels, but it's no real substitute for being in school. And she wants much more clarity about when they will go back.\n\"I've tried not to be political about decisions being made, but you can't help but feel disappointed. They don't seem to understand how real people are living,\" she says.\nShe says when politicians say maybe schools will or won't be back by Easter, they don't realise how much that uncertainty affects families trying to plan for what comes next.\nEducational psychologist Dan O'Hare says the \"key word is 'uncertainty'\".\nNot knowing what is coming next adds to the pressure, he says, and children out of school are already facing big unknowns such as what's going to happen about exams or when will they see their friends and teachers.\n\"It's really stressful for children and their families,\" says Dr O'Hare, who is co-chair of the British Psychological Society's division for educational and child psychology. \"They need a sense of a plan.\"\nThis lockdown is also in the depths of winter - and he says employers need to think about making sure staff working from home are able to take a break in daylight hours, so that families can get outside.\nIt's no use asking parents to answer work emails all day and expect them to go out when it's dark.\nFor some families it has got very difficult.\n\"It's affected her emotionally a lot,\" says Dave in Bolton, who is worrying about his six-year-old daughter, who has been crying because she misses her friends.\n\"It's awful, you can't put a positive spin on it. She's at that age where she's enjoying her friends, becoming more socialised,\" he told BBC 5 Live.\n\"She's quite a confident little girl and I can't help worry that being stuck at home is going to impact her in the longer term.\"\nThe father says many of her classmates are still going into school - and that makes it even harder when she sees her friends on school Zoom calls.\nJen Locke in Newcastle makes the point that women can often be \"the most adversely affected by the decision to keep schools closed\". \nShe says home schooling has \"fallen squarely on my shoulders\", helping her children in the day and then shifting her work with an IT company into the evening, so it's an early start through to a very late finish.\n\"It's a huge mental strain\u2026 I'm knackered from it all,\" she says, right down to trying to get children to bed who aren't tired because they're not going out.\nA lockdown weariness seems to be out there, despite the best efforts of schools.\nSimon Armstrong in Bristol, whose son is in secondary school, says: \"Virtual lessons, no matter how well delivered, are a woeful substitute for real lessons.\"\n\"I am at the end of my tether,\" he says.\nThe Department for Education said: \"We are committed to reopening schools as soon as the public health picture allows, and will inform schools, parents and pupils of plans ahead of February half term.\" \nBut Labour has accused the government of causing \"chaos and confusion\" for parents and schools.\nThe National Association of Head Teachers said: \"Now is the moment for calm heads to decide on a sustainable return to school, not another chaotic and last-minute set of decisions that could easily result in a yo-yo return to lockdown.\""

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has warned Russian leader Vladimir Putin about election meddling in their first call as counterparts, the White House says.\nThe conversation also included a discussion about the ongoing opposition protests in Russia.\nA Kremlin statement did not refer to any points of friction, saying the call was \"businesslike and frank\".\nBoth sides reportedly agreed to extend the countries' last remaining nuclear deal during the call.\nFormer US President Donald Trump sometimes undercut his own administration's tough posture on Russia and was accused by some of being too deferential to Mr Putin.\nBut Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served as vice-president - was also criticised for failing to check Russia as it annexed Crimea, supported rebel forces in eastern Ukraine and backed the government of warn-torn Syria.\n\"President Biden made clear that the United States will act firmly in defence of its national interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us or our allies,\" the White House said in a statement, referencing the main talking points of Tuesday afternoon's call but listing no further details.\nThe US said that the two presidents also discussed the massive SolarWinds cyber-attack, which has been blamed on Moscow; reports that the Kremlin placed bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan; and the poisoning of Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny.\nThe Kremlin statement about the call said their president had \"noted that the normalisation of relations between Russia and the United States would meet the interests of both countries and - taking into account their special responsibility for maintaining security and stability in the world - of the entire international community\".\nThe leaders also discussed the New Start treaty, an Obama-era accord that limits the amounts of warheads, missiles and launchers in the two countries' nuclear arsenals.\nIt had been due to expire on 5 February, but both sides reportedly agreed to extend the treaty during Tuesday's call.\nThe Trump administration, however, had refused to sign it and talks over an extension stalled.\nOn Wednesday, Russia's parliament ratified a five-year extension of the treaty. Mr Putin said the move was a \"step in the right direction\" to reducing global tensions.\nJoe Biden had indicated he would be tougher on Vladimir Putin than Donald Trump, who refused to take on the Kremlin and frequently cast doubt on Russian interference in the 2016 elections. \nOn that matter Mr Biden made his sharpest break with Mr Trump, reportedly telling Mr Putin that he knew Russia had tried to meddle in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. He also warned the Russian president that the US was ready to defend itself against cyber-espionage, and any other attacks. \nDespite Mr Trump's conciliatory approach, the Kremlin did not benefit from his presidency, because his administration heavily sanctioned Russians for issues ranging from Ukraine to attacks on dissidents. Joe Biden and his foreign policy team will take a robust position on human rights and Mr Putin's intentions in Europe. \nBut they are not looking for a confrontation. \nRather, they hope to manage relations and co-operate where possible. In that vein, the two presidents agreed to work at completing the extension of the New Start arms control treaty before it expires next month.\nThe treaty, signed in 2010, limits each side to 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous deal. \nEach country is allowed, in total, no more than 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear arms.\nAnother 100 are allowed if they are not operationally deployed - for example, missiles removed from a sub undergoing a long-term overhaul.\nAgain, this is a significant reduction from the original treaty."

      "tags": "Natural Resources Wales,Wildlife,Welsh government,Environment,Renewable energy in the UK,Aberystwyth University,Curlews",
      "text": "Wales is using up its natural resources at an \"unsustainable rate\" and is yet to meet any of the long-term aims it has set to tackle the issue, its environment watchdog has said.\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) said a \"transformation\" of the food, energy and transport systems was needed.\nIt warned time was running out to \"avoid a catastrophic situation for Wales and the world\".\nThe Welsh Government said all of society had a part to play.\nBy law, NRW has to produce an assessment of the country's natural resources every five years including everything from clean air and water to soil, rocks, minerals and habitats for wildlife.  \nIts latest report makes for \"bleak reading\", according to Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe.\nDue to the pandemic it is being published in a phased way - with key headlines and recommendations now.\nThere will be more detail about the state of each of Wales' ecosystems from our coastline and seas, to rivers, woods and farmland, in March.\nVery few of the habitats wildlife rely on in Wales are in good condition - even in areas where there is meant to be more protection, the report says.\nTake rivers for example - more than 60% of all river Special Areas of Conservation were found to be failing targets around phosphate pollution - which can be washed in from farmland or sewers.  \nJust 31% of the country is considered to be semi-natural habitat - and at least 40% of this is spread out in such small patches it is not seen as \"resilient\" enough.\nWildlife needs these areas to be joined up if it is to thrive - but this connectivity is also being lost.\nIt means several iconic species such as the curlew are at risk of extinction from the Welsh countryside within the next 20 years.\nThe situation is also threatening people's lives with poor air quality estimated to cause up to 2,000 deaths annually in Wales, 6% of the total number.\nAnd 245,000 Welsh properties are at risk of flooding - a problem likely to get worse as a result of climate change.\nThe report concludes not one of four long-term aims NRW set in 2016 to measure progress towards achieving sustainable management of natural resources has been met.\nBut it said this was not surprising in just a few years, and the problems were not unique to Wales.  \nWales needs to \"trial ideas, launch experiments and support innovation\", and urgently transform three key areas of the economy, the report says.\nThey are the food, energy and transport systems.\nIt wants to see a lot of work done to encourage lifestyle changes - from what we eat to how we travel.\nIf everyone on Earth used natural resources at the same rate as Wales, two and a half planets would be needed, it claims.\nIt said the pandemic provided a \"once in a generation opportunity to reset our values and priorities\u2026 and create a more sustainable future\".\nMore technology in agriculture should be used to help cut fertiliser use, prevent pollution and limit the amount of land needed for farming, the report says.\nIt also suggests there would be a \"positive impact\" from society reducing its consumption of carbon-intensive foods such as meat and dairy.\nDr Hefin Williams, of the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences at Aberystwyth University, said this was \"at its heart a decision for individuals\" and livestock production was \"the backbone of agriculture in Wales\".\nWhile the report outlined the challenges faced by the sector, he said it also highlighted opportunities that the industry here was \"well-placed\" to grasp. \n\"Increasing use of crops such as white and red clover, peas and other legumes would ultimately allow farmers to have greater control over feed costs [for their animals], cut down on imports and provide environmental benefits by reducing the amount of synthetic fertilisers needed,\" he said.\nWales must move away quickly from energy generation that relies on fossil fuels with more renewable energy developments, according to the report.\nBut it cautions that these, too, can contribute to pressures on the environment if not enough consideration is given to planning and building.\nJess Hooper, of Marine Energy Wales, said Wales could \"lead the world\" in this emerging field. \n\"At the moment we have 16 marine renewable developers that are active in the sector, helping deliver a low carbon economy with its own jobs, skills and prospects - an industry we can call home grown and that we could export to the world,\" she said.\nThe report also calls for a major focus on efficiency measures in buildings, saying Wales has some of the oldest and least thermally efficient housing stock in Europe.  \nWales also has high rates of car use for commuting and has seen only a small reduction in carbon emissions from transport since 1990, the report says.\nBut simply moving everyone over to using electric vehicles is \"not a sustainable solution\".\n\"A systemic change is needed to how and why people travel and what is transported,\" it says.\nIt promotes the concept of a 20-minute neighbourhood - pioneered by Melbourne in Australia - where urban society is designed so residents can meet virtually all their needs a short walk from home.\nMs Howe said this was \"not just about carbon emission targets - these solutions have wider benefits\".\n\"We have an obesity crisis so the last thing we want is people sitting in their cars.\"\nWelcoming the report, Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths said it provided a \"comprehensive set of evidence on the state and trends of Wales' natural resources and ecosystems\".\n\"As we continue to face the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, we in Welsh Government have repeatedly committed ourselves to an environmentally-responsible response to the pandemic, and this is our opportunity to focus on a green recovery during this challenging time\".\nShe also said it offered an opportunity to discuss \"the part we all have to play in improving the resilience of our ecosystems, so we can ensure they support the wellbeing of generations to come\"."

      "text": "Health workers in Northern Ireland are to get a \"special recognition\" payment for their work during the pandemic.\nIt is intended that all staff will receive a payment of \u00a3500, said Health Minister Robin Swann.\nHowever, it will be subject to approval from the Department of Finance.\nThere had been calls from some political parties and health unions for staff to be recognised for their efforts.\nScotland has already announced a similar one-off payment and Mr Swann said it would reflect the \"principle of parity\".\n\"There are no words to properly convey what health workers have done for us, we will never be able to repay that debt,\" added the minister.\nThe development comes as Northern Ireland's Department of Health has recorded 16 more coronavirus-related deaths, taking its toll so far to 1,779.\nA further 527 people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours.\nThere are 775 people in Northern Ireland's hospitals who are being treated for the virus - 68 of them are in intensive care and the number of people requiring ventilators has risen to 56.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, 54 more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded on Wednesday. It brings the Republic of Ireland's death toll to 3,120.\nThe Irish Department of Health also confirmed 1,335 more Covid-19 cases.\nSpeaking at the weekly health news conference on Wednesday, Mr Swann said the pandemic had caused \"destruction\" and left \"heartbreak in its wake\".\n\"Staying at home is making a difference. The R-number has been moving in the right direction,\" he said.\n\"We have to sustain and build on that progress.\"\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 after Christmas relaxations.\nIt has been falling since lockdown restrictions were introduced on 26 December, and Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said NI's R-number for hospital admissions has now fallen back below one.\nBut he warned that the pressure on the system was still significant and would continue for several more weeks.\nHe added that there would need to be a \"sustained\" drop in the figures before relaxations of the lockdown could be considered by the executive.\nIt has also been confirmed that the number of people in Northern Ireland who have received their first Covid-19 now stands at 168,140.\nMore than 50,000 people aged over 80 have been vaccinated.\nOn the payment to health workers, Mr Swann said it would \"not be without its challenges\" but that he valued all staff in the health service.\n\"For some people, especially some of our lower paid workers, it may in fact have an adverse impact on their social security payments or supports that recipients may be claiming,\" he added.\n\"I have written to the ministers of finance and communities asking them to urgently consider the issue and to engage with the tax and benefit authorities in Great Britain to request that these payments are excluded from consideration in this regard.\"\nThere will also be a one-off payment of \u00a32,000 for all non-salaried students on clinical placements in the health service.\nMr Swann added that he intends to provide a one-off payment for carers as well, describing them as \"among the greatest unsung heroes\" of the pandemic.\nBut he said: \"There is still more work to be done in this regard and it will be significantly more complex to administer than the staff payment.\"\nKevin McAdam, who is from Unite the union, said the \"recognition payments\" will be allocated with assurances that this will not affect pay negotiations with healthcare workers.\nMr McAdam welcomed that health care workers and non-salaried students on placements will be \"receiving something more tangible than applause\".\n\"The student payment is a recognition payment, it does not solve the problems around whether student placements should be paid, I think that is an argument for another day.\"\nMeanwhile, a senior Department of Finance official has warned there is \"a higher than usual risk\" of some \u00a3430m unspent by the NI Executive being returned to the Treasury.\nMinisters must submit further funding bids, or risk it being handed back at the end of the financial year.\nA department official, Jeff McGuinness, said the Treasury was being pressed to show flexibility in carrying unspent money over but added that it was \"imperative\" Stormont pressed ahead, rather then rely on agreement from Treasury.\nHe said the other devolved administrations were also asking the Treasury for similar levels of carry-forward of unspent fiscal allocations."

      "text": "A decision to allow NI back office health workers to be vaccinated at an early stage goes against the guidance of the government's advisory body, its deputy chair has said.\nThese staff are part of phase one of NI's Covid-19 vaccine rollout. \nProf Anthony Harnden said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) had made front-line health workers the \"clear\" priority. \nHe said giving a dose to backroom staff took it away from those at higher risk.\nAs of Monday, 159,642 people in Northern Ireland had received a first coronavirus vaccine dose.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health daily figures reported an additional 16 Covid-19 related deaths and 550 new cases, bringing the total number of positive tests to 101,291. \nSince Monday, there has been a reduction in the number of inpatients, patients receiving intensive care treatment, and the number of patients ventilated. \nLast week, the Department of Health (DoH) confirmed staff in non-patient facing roles, including those in IT and accounts, were eligible for the vaccine in the first stage. \nIt also said that the decision \"does not go against JCVI guidance\".\nBBC News NI has contacted the department for a response to Prof Harnden's comments.\nSpeaking on BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Prof Harnden said vaccinating back office health staff did not follow the JCVI's guidance.\nIt advises the first priorities for any Covid-19 vaccination programme \"should be the prevention of Covid-19 mortality and the protection of health and social care staff and systems\".\nHe said that people have to \"remember that for every dose you give to somebody else who isn't hugely at risk, you're denying somebody at risk that first dose\". \nProf Harnden added the JCVI \"really feel quite strongly that it should be just front-line healthcare and social care workers\". \n\"We purposefully put the front-line worker into our advice and into our strategy.\n\"The reason we said that was threefold. One, because of their exposure risk; two, because of the possibility that they would transmit to vulnerable elderly people that they were looking after who we know are hugely at risk; and, third, to keep the NHS running at a time of crisis.\"\nLast week, a DoH spokesperson said the department took the decision to vaccinate staff in its Business Services Organisation (BSO) because they help ensure that health trusts and organisations \"can effectively deliver vital services\".\n\"Protecting BSO staff via vaccination to continue to deliver this support is essential for the smooth and continued functioning of the HSC (Health and Social Care system) during the pandemic and particularly at this time of extreme pressure on our health service. \n\"If the back office is down, the front line can't operate effectively.\"\nProf Harnden said this reason, of keeping the health system running smoothly by vaccinating back office staff, was a \"stretch of the argument\". \n\"One could argue that actually lots of systems in the UK need to work very smoothly and there are lots of different groups clamouring to receive the vaccine as soon as possible and I fully understand that.\n\"The JCVI took a really strong stance on this that what we wanted to do was protect [from] hospitalisations and deaths.\""

      "text": "The UK government has given its support to a project to use oral contraceptives to control grey squirrel populations. \nEnvironment minister Lord Goldsmith says the damage they and other invasive species do to the UK's woodlands costs the UK economy \u00a31.8 billion a year.\nThe bizarre-sounding plan is to lure grey squirrels into feeding boxes only they can access with little pots containing hazelnut spread.\nThese would be spiked with an oral contraceptive.\nLord Goldsmith says the damage from squirrels also threatens the effectiveness of government efforts to tackle climate change by planting tens of thousands of acres of new woodlands.  \nOn Tuesday, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told BBC News: \"We hope advances in science can safely help our nature to thrive, including through the humane control of invasive species.\"\nA partnership of conservation and forestry organisations called the UK Squirrel Accord (UKSA) is behind the proposal. \nIt says grey squirrels, which were first introduced from North America in the late 19th century, cause huge damage to woodlands by stripping bark from trees aged between 10-50 years, the younger trees in a forest.\nThey particularly target broad-leafed varieties including oak, which are particularly ecologically important because they support so many other species.\nIt is estimated the UK is home to some three million of these invasive rodents.\nThey have displaced the native red squirrel across most of the UK.  \nLord Goldsmith says the government supports the plan as well as a longer-term effort to breed infertility into female grey squirrels to reduce their numbers. \nInvasive non-native species such as grey squirrels threaten our native biodiversity, he argues. \nWhen regulating grey squirrels with oral contraceptive was first proposed in 2017, the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency said it thought it could reduce their numbers by as much as 90%.\nThe project also has royal approval.\nPrince Charles was instrumental in founding the UK Squirrel Accord with the objective of \"managing the negative impacts of invasive grey squirrels in the UK\".\nHe has written of the importance of protecting Britain's remaining red squirrels.\n\"These charming and intelligent creatures never fail to delight\", he wrote last week in his capacity as patron of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, describing red squirrels as the \"symbol and benchmark\" of healthy woods.\nJason Gilchrist, an ecologist from Edinburgh Napier University, has written in defence of the grey squirrel but he says he supports the oral contraceptive plan.\nHe acknowledges there is a need to manage grey squirrel populations. \n\"It is better than the alternative: a shotgun\", he told BBC News.\nIt is the same argument the UKSA makes: dosing the animals with contraceptives provides a humane alternative to culling them.\nLast week, the Royal Forestry Society, a member of the Squirrel Accord, called for just such a cull. \nSimon Lloyd, its chief executive, says efforts to tackle global warming and improve biodiversity will be undermined unless grey squirrel numbers can be reduced.\nNew trees will not survive to \"deliver the carbon capture or biodiversity objectives if grey squirrels cannot be controlled\", he told the Daily Telegraph.\nThe UKSA has been experimenting with ways to deliver oral contraceptives to squirrels for more than three years now.\nLast year, it tested special feeding stations designed so only grey squirrels can gain access in woodland in East Yorkshire.\nInstead of contraceptives, the hazelnut paste bait was dosed with a dye that, when ingested, causes squirrel hair to fluoresce under UV light.\nThe researchers found that more than 90% of the grey squirrel population being studied visited the traps.\nThey concluded that it was possible to deliver repeat doses of a contraceptive to the majority of grey squirrels in a wood.\nFollow Justin on Twitter."

      "tags": "France,Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The EU has urged pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca to supply it with more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine from UK plants, amid a row over shortages.\nThe company has infuriated the bloc by saying it can deliver only a fraction of the doses it promised for the first quarter of the year.\nIt blames production issues at European plants, but the EU says doses made elsewhere should make up the shortfall.\nThe EU has been criticised for the slow rollout of its vaccinations.\nThe contract between the EU and AstraZeneca contains a confidentiality clause but the EU has asked the company to release the details nevertheless.\nReports said last week that the EU would get 60% fewer doses of the vaccine than promised for January-March 2021.\nThe EU reiterated its position after the two sides met on Wednesday evening to try to resolve the issue.\nHealth Commissioner Stella Kyriakides tweeted that the EU regretted the \"continued lack of clarity on the delivery schedule\".\n\"We will work with the company to find solutions and deliver vaccines rapidly for EU citizens,\" she said.\nAn AstraZeneca spokesman said the company had \"committed to even closer co-ordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months\".\nPfizer/BioNTech, which has an even bigger vaccine-production deal with the EU, is also experiencing delays. \nFrench drug maker Sanofi has announced that it will help produce 125 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab by the end of the year.\nThe company will allow Germany-based BioNTech to use its facilities in Frankfurt from July, Sanofi said in a statement, having delayed the development of its own vaccine.  \nAt a news conference earlier on Wednesday, Ms Kyriakides said UK factories, which have not experienced problems, were part of its deal with the company and had to deliver.\n\"The 27 European Union member states are united that AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments in our agreements,\" she said.\nIn an interview on Tuesday with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said the contract compelled it to make its \"best effort\", rather than obliging it to meet a set deadline for delivery of the vaccines.\nMs Kyriakides said this characterisation of the deal was \"not correct or acceptable\", and called on the company to be \"open and transparent\" about its production of vaccines.\n\"We signed an advanced purchase agreement for a product which at the time did not exist and which still today is not yet authorised and we signed it precisely to ensure that the company builds a manufacturing capacity to produce the vaccine early so that they can deliver a certain volume of doses the day that it is authorised,\" she said.\nShe added that the EU rejected \"the logic of first-come first-serve\". \n\"That may work at the neighbourhood butcher's but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements.\"\nShe appeared to be responding to Mr Soriot, who said that the UK had signed its contract with AstraZeneca three months before the EU and that this extra time had been used to \"fix all the glitches we experienced\" regarding the UK.\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"I'm confident of our supplies and we'll keep rolling out vaccines as fast we possibly can. \n\"I am very pleased at the moment that we have the fastest rollout of vaccines in Europe by some way.\"\nIn a nutshell, here is why EU officials are furious with AstraZeneca. They say the contract between them and the pharmaceutical giant clearly stipulates that the two main vaccine production factories in the UK are to be classed as primary manufacturing sites, and the production sites in Belgium and the Netherlands are secondary priorities.\nThe vaccine production issues are in Belgium and the Netherlands (they have been producing lower yields). So, this is a no-brainer to EU officials - the UK sites should be used to transport the vaccines across the continent.\nAnd today's impromptu news conference by the EU's Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides shows that any tolerance of the company's previous explanations has worn thin. \nIn fact, EU officials point out to me that EU money went into upgrading the facilities in the UK and that they fully expected it to be operational for them. This has turned into a deeply unpleasant row, and sets the stage for a difficult meeting with the UK-Swedish company.\nThe EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the company has reported production delays at two plants, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium.\nMr Soriot said production was \"basically two months behind where we wanted to be\".\nItaly was among the countries threatening to sue over the delays. \nThe AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to give it the green light on Friday.\nThe EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March.\nOfficials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year.\nThe EU has also ordered 2.3 billion doses of vaccines from four other companies, of which only those of Pfizer/BioNTech (600 million) and Moderna (160 million) have been approved.\nPfizer has not been able to supply the 12.5 million vaccines it promised the EU by the end of 2020, saying last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant.\nAs a result of delays, on Wednesday Spanish officials said the Madrid region was halting almost all vaccinations for two weeks and supplies in Catalonia were also threatened.\nThe EU has threatened to restrict the exports of vaccines made within the bloc to deal with the shortfall.\nHave you been affected by vaccine supply issues?

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,UK government,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic,New Zealand,Australia",
      "text": "UK nationals and residents returning from \"red list\" countries will be made to quarantine in accommodation such as hotels for 10 days, Boris Johnson has said. While exact details of the policy remain unclear, similar schemes are already in place elsewhere, including in Australia and New Zealand. So how does it work?\nAfter finally securing her family's place in Australia's quarantine system, Keri McMenamin prepared for the worst - and ordered a vacuum cleaner.\nThe 38-year-old was returning to the country with her husband and two children after securing a job offer - leaving the UK in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic last year.\n\"It is literally luck of the draw,\" she says of where her family would spend 14 days together once they arrived. \"You didn't know what to expect.\" Having done some research, Keri discovered Facebook groups busy with people relaying their experiences of quarantine.\n\"A lot of people were saying, 'Look, just expect the worst and then whatever you get is a bonus.'\"\n\"There were people who had, like, filthy hotel rooms, appalling food, you know, really sort of tiny spaces, no opening windows, no balconies,\" she adds.\nThat's when she ordered the vacuum for a friend to deliver when the time came.\nIn the end, the family was taken to a hotel in Surfers' Paradise on the Gold Coast and given an interconnecting room. But still, the windows were sealed and their only time outside was 20-minute stints every two to three days.\n\"I think what kept us sane was having a routine,\" she adds. \"Joe Wicks in the morning and our yoga in the evening and sort of keeping up your 12,000 steps a day walking around in loops.\" The vacuum came in useful.\nThere are strict caps on the numbers travelling to countries using hotels to quarantine arrivals.\nBetween July and October 2019, 7.5m people arrived into Australia to live, work and visit. But over the same period last year, when enforced quarantine was in place, just 72,111 people arrived, according to government figures.\nPeople like Keri who have been through quarantine in Australia told BBC News that airlines will only confirm seats once a spot in a hotel is secured - leading to last-minute scrambles.\nOnline forums suggest expats desperate to get home are facing months of delays, cancellations and uncertainty - around 39,000 have said they want to return.\nQuarantine hotel stays themselves are costly - with fees paid for by travellers.\nIn New South Wales, it costs the equivalent of around \u00a31,700 per adult and \u00a32,800 for a family of two adults and two children - billed after the quarantine is completed.\nArrivals into New Zealand are charged \u00a31,630 for the first adult, with an extra \u00a3500 for each additional adult and \u00a3250 for each child.\nThe costs include the accommodation and a basic food service and even more basic cleaning - perhaps once per week, or not at all, with one change of linen and towels, depending on the facility.\nBut it comes on top of airfares, which have increased due to the pandemic. Fees can be waived for those who cannot pay and there are some exemptions.\nEach region has its own rules. In Australia, packages can be brought in from outside, and in New Zealand some of those in quarantine are taken to fields to exercise.\nMark Dickinson, from Liverpool, has lived in New Zealand with his wife Lisa for four years but returned to the UK to see their newborn granddaughter in December - he spoke to the BBC 10 days into a 14-day isolation near Auckland.\n\"We had to have a test on day zero, then day three, then we're having a test tomorrow on day 11,\" Mark says.\n\"The area at the front of the hotel is surrounded by a double-guarded fence. It may have cost us \u00a32,000 but if that means New Zealand stays safe, then we're happy doing it.\"\nMany of those isolating found life does not stop in quarantine. Australian Brad Thiele started a new job and celebrated his 51st birthday alone in a 300 sq ft room at the Novotel in central Sydney. \nAfter being asked by a person wearing a full hazmat suit at Sydney airport whether he had any concerns about being held in a room for 14 days, Brad was taken to the hotel with a blue-light police escort. On arrival, the military were on hand to ensure he checked in.\n\"I quite like practising meditation. So I was able to just sort of just sit and be at peace with the fact this was the first two weeks of the rest of my life having lived abroad in Britain for the past 23 years,\" he says.\n\"I had some regimen, it was important to get up in the morning, make the bed, shower, iron a shirt and be smart casual for work. Just finding a rhythm and a pattern in the day.\"\nHe's yet to decide whether to take the Novotel up on an offer of a 30% discount on a future stay.\nOther countries' experience of setting up a hotel quarantine system provides an insight into the sort of challenges politicians and civil servants in the UK may soon be grappling with. \nInitially those in quarantine across the world complained about the quality of food being provided.\nThen outbreaks at just two hotels in the Australian state of Victoria were traced to 99% of cases in a second wave across Melbourne that led to around 750 deaths.\nA public inquiry found a lack of training, cleaning and contact tracing seeded infections into the local community. \nReports at the time suggested encounters between private security staff and those staying in quarantine caused the virus to spread. The inquiry did not find evidence to back up the claims.\nBut former judge Jennifer Coate criticised a lack of \"health focus\" in the quarantine system in Melbourne, saying risks \"were foreseeable and may have actually been foreseen\".\nMeanwhile, New Zealand is investigating after a woman who had served 14 days in quarantine and tested negative twice went on to develop symptoms which were confirmed to be the South Africa variant of Covid-19.\nThe 56-year-old woman had recently returned from Europe and is said to have visited almost 30 places in New Zealand before her case was detected. Local officials say she is likely to have been infected by a fellow returnee.\nBack in Australia, knowing why the quarantine system is in place and the benefits it brings - the country has largely eradicated the virus - helps motivate people to keep to the rules, Keri McMenamin says.\nShe has just spent a public holiday going about the sort of activities many of us in the UK can but dream of - and her children will be in school this week.\n\"We went to a local gym and had a group workout with 30 people,\" she says. \n\"And then we went to the countryside, and the kids built little boats out of wood and mingled around and there were families picnicking.\n\"I almost feel guilty for having gone through this process and now living a normal life,\" she adds. \"I feel like I don't want to talk to my friends in the UK about how easy our life here is and how normal it is.\""

      "text": "Cough, fatigue, sore throat and muscle pain may be more common in people who test positive for the new UK variant of coronavirus, a study by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests.\nThe ONS findings are based on positive tests from a random sample of 6,000 people in England.\nLoss of taste and smell may be slightly less likely to affect those with the new form of the virus. \nHowever, it is still one of the three main symptoms of the virus.\nThe NHS website lists the symptoms as a high temperature, a new continuous cough and a loss or change to sense of smell or taste. \nMost people infected with the virus develop at least one of these symptoms.\nThe new variant, which was first spotted in Kent in September, spreads more easily than the previous form of the virus and has now spread across the UK, causing a surge in cases which prompted the current lockdown.\nThere is some evidence it could be more deadly than other variants, although the data isn't strong enough yet to say for certain.\nTwo other variants - one from South Africa and another from Brazil - are also circulating, although at lower levels.\nThe ONS analysis looked at the symptoms reported by people up to a week before testing positive for the new variant of coronavirus, compared with those testing positive for the old variant.\nThey were tested over two months between mid-November and mid-January.\nTest results compatible with the new variant show up as being positive for two genes, rather than three for the other variant.\nIn a group of about 3,500 people with the new variant:\nIn a group of 2,500 people with the old variant:\nThe study found 16% of those with the new variant experienced losing their sense of taste while 15% lost their sense of smell.\nThis was slightly lower than reported by people with the old variant (18% for both).\nThere was no difference found in levels of headaches, shortness of breath or diarrhoea and vomiting in both groups.\nProf Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick, said the new variant of the virus had 23 changes compared to the original Wuhan virus.\n\"Some of these changes in different parts of the virus could affect the body's immune response and also influence the range of symptoms associated with infection,\" he said.\nInfected people appear to produce more virus and this could result in more widespread infection within the body \"perhaps accounting for more coughs, muscle pain and tiredness\", Prof Young added. \nThe analysis is part of a long-term study to track coronavirus in the UK population, carried out jointly with Public Health England, the University of Oxford and the University of Manchester."

      "tags": "Wind power,Green economy,Climate change,Oil,US Congress,United States,Natural gas,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has signed a series of executive orders designed to address climate change, including a new ban on some energy drilling.\nThe orders aim to freeze new oil and gas leases on public lands and double offshore wind-produced energy by 2030.\nThey are expected to meet stiff resistance from the energy industry and come as a sea change from Donald Trump, who cut environmental protections.\n\"Today is climate day at the White House,\" said Mr Biden on Wednesday.\n\"We have already waited too long,\" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House. \"And we can't wait any longer.\"\nMr Biden said the US \"must lead\" a global response to the climate change crisis.\n\"Just like we need a unified national response to Covid-19, we desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis because there is a climate crisis,\" he said.\nHe added that neither challenge could be met by the US alone.\nThe series of executive orders that Mr Biden signed on Wednesday establishes a White House office of domestic climate policy and announces a summit of leaders to be held in April on Earth Day.\nClimate change, under Mr Biden's plan, will become both a \"national security\" and \"foreign policy\" priority, officials say.  \nMr Biden is also calling upon the US director of national intelligence to prepare an intelligence report on the security implications of climate change.\nMr Biden is using his presidential powers to make climate change a central issue of his administration. \nThe executive orders and memorandum - which cannot go as far as congressional legislation in combating climate change - can be undone by future presidents, as he is currently doing to Mr Trump.\nAccording to a White House statement, Mr Biden is directing the Department of the Interior to pause oil and gas drilling leases on federal lands and water \"to the extent possible\" and to launch a review of existing energy leases.\nMr Biden aims to conserve at least 30% of federal lands and oceans by 2030. \nAccording to the New York Times, fossil fuel extraction on public lands accounts for almost a quarter of all US carbon dioxide emissions.\nMr Biden's order does not specifically address private property owners or state-held public lands.\nHe has signed more than three dozen executive orders in his first week in office, more than any of his predecessors.\nCritics note he told ABC News while campaigning last October that only a \"dictator\" would use executive orders excessively. \"We're a democracy,\" said Mr Biden, whose fellow Democrats now control all of Congress. \"We need consensus.\"\nMr Biden's \"whole-of-government\" approach, the White House says, creates the position National Climate Advisor who will lead the office of Domestic Climate Policy at the White House.\nThe presidential climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, conceded to reporters on Wednesday that it would make little difference in the global climate change fight if the US reduced its emissions to zero.\n\"He [Mr Biden] knows Paris [climate accord] alone is not enough,\" Mr Kerry said. \"Not when almost 90% of all of the planet's global emissions come from outside of US borders. We could go to zero tomorrow and the problem isn't solved.\"\nThe orders also direct federal agencies to prepare for the impact of climate change on their operations and improve access to information on the issue. \nMr Biden also directed agencies to only make \"evidence-based decisions guided by the best available science and data\".\nPausing the extraction of oil and gas from federal lands is the Biden administration's tremulous first step onto the toes of the US oil and gas industry.\nFederal drilling is a key part of their output - providing around 22% of US oil production and 12% of gas, according to the American Petroleum Institute (API).\nThe API is unhappy with the move, suggesting that any ban will lead to greater reliance on imports as the US economy recovers and needs more energy.\nBut experts reject that argument, pointing out that drilling on public lands is likely to continue to expand even if a moratorium becomes a ban.\nThat's because only half of applications for extraction approved between 2014 and 2019 have actually been used.\nMoving towards a ban on federal leases fulfils a campaign pledge and will reassure environmentalists that Joe Biden is the real deal when it comes to climate change. But making significant inroads into US carbon output will probably require legislation to be put before Congress.\nThat will be the true test of the Biden climate commitment. \nMr Biden's critics say his climate initiatives will cut jobs as the US already suffers from record unemployment numbers because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHe received a storm of criticism for last week's executive order halting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, that would have transported oil from Canada through the US.\nBut the Biden White House is trying to get ahead of more criticism by addressing job creation. \n\"When I think of climate change, I think of jobs,\" Mr Biden said, arguing that \"millions\" of Americans will be able to get jobs \"modernising our water systems, transportation, our energy infrastructure - to withstand the impacts of extreme climate\". \nHis plan directs federal agencies to \"identify new opportunities to spur innovation, commercialisation, and deployment of clean energy technologies and infrastructure\".\nIt calls for the creation of a \"Civilian Climate Corps Initiative\" -  an initiative Biden officials say will \"put a new generation of Americans to work conserving and restoring public lands and waters\".\nDuring his four years in office, Mr Trump expanded the number of energy leases on environmentally sensitive national lands.\nThe US achieved a level of energy independence in his term, becoming a net petroleum exporter, a milestone for which he claimed credit.\nMr Trump also rolled back dozens of rules designed to ensure access to clean air and water, protections for wildlife, and the containment of dangerous chemicals and pollutants.\nSome of the changes, including one that sought to relax pollution rules affecting coal and gas-burning power plants, were overturned by federal courts.\nMr Trump - who once called climate change a hoax - also took the US out of the Paris climate accords, whereas Mr Biden made moves to re-join the global agreement on his first day in office.

      "tags": "Euston,Rail travel,HS2",
      "text": "People campaigning against the HS2 rail project have dug a tunnel near Euston station, in a bid to prevent their eviction from a protest camp. \nIn September, members of HS2 Rebellion set up a Tree Protection Camp in Euston Square Gardens in central London to protest against the \u00a3106bn scheme.\nThey claim the tunnel is 100ft (30m) long and has taken two months to dig.\nActivists say the tunnel - codenamed \"Kelvin\" - is their \"best defence\" against being evicted.\nOne protester, identified only as Blue, told the BBC: \"It is all very dangerous and life-threatening but it is all worth it. This is the only way I can effect change, I would sacrifice everything for the climate ecological emergency to not be happening.\"\nThe 18-year-old added: \"We want to be as safe as possible. It is not about us martyring ourselves, it is about delaying and stopping HS2.\"\nA spokeswoman for HS2 said tunnel protests were \"costly to the taxpayer\".\nShe added: \"These are a danger to the safety of the protesters, HS2 staff, High Court enforcement officers and the general public, as well as putting unnecessary strain on the emergency services during the pandemic. \n\"Safety is our first priority when taking possession of land and removing illegal encampments.\"\nBritish Transport Police said it was aware of the tunnel but it was a matter for the Met Police, which said no complaint yet had been made.\nHS2 is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. It is hoped the 20-year project will reduce rail passenger overcrowding and help to rebalance the UK's economy.\nThe campaign group alleges HS2 is the \"most expensive, wasteful and destructive project in UK history\" and that it is \"set to destroy or irreparably damage 108 ancient woodlands and 693 wildlife sites\".\nHowever, HS2 bosses have said seven million trees will be planted during phase one of the project and that much ancient woodland will \"remain intact\".\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs in September that the first phase of the high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham would not open until 2028 at the earliest.\nThe second phase, to Manchester and Leeds, was due to open in 2032-33 but that has been pushed back to 2035-40.\nNetwork Rail, which owns the land, has been approached for a comment about the tunnel.\nBy BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards\nTunnelling as a form of environmental protest has a long history in the UK. \nIn the 1990s it was one of the ways that pushed environmental concerns into the headlines and changed perceptions.\nIn one of the environmental protesters' tunnelling guides, written by \"Disco Dave\", it says: \n\"In the world of NVDA (non-violent direct action) there are few defence tactics that can compare with the protest tunnel. Dangerous, laborious and time consuming, tunnelling is the ultimate and desperate tactic of desperate people in desperate times.\"\nThe first protest tunnel goes back to the M11 and 1993 but they only really developed during the Newbury Bypass protests in 1996. \nProtest tunnels against the A30 in Devon and Manchester Airport's second runway then followed.\nNot only did they make household names of environmental campaigners like \"Swampy\" but they arguably changed transport policy - road-building reduced massively. \nWe have seen tunnels more recently in 2017 in Coldharbour in Surrey in a protest against fracking so it's not a massive surprise we are seeing tunnels again.\nTunnelling in particular as a direct action slows down developers and it is expensive to dig out protesters safely.\nDisco Dave wrote: \"That ultimately is the purpose of tunnels and tree houses. To act as a deterrent warning the authorities that should they decide to evict, then it will hurt them where for them it hurts most - in the pocket.\"\nWhat will be interesting is if these tunnels have the same impact on HS2 as they did on the road-building programme of the late 1990s.\nWill it reframe HS2 so it will be seen in the same way as fracking or road building? Or can the argument still be made that it is a low-carbon form of travel even though it does cause some destruction of habitat?"

      "text": "People wishing to travel out of the UK will first be required to declare their reason for travel and prove it is essential, the home secretary has said.\nPriti Patel said declarations would be checked by carriers and there would be increased police at airports and ports.\nThe PM said earlier that UK nationals and residents returning from \"red list\" Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in government-provided hotels.\nBut Labour described the measures as \"too little, too late\".\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said protecting the UK's borders was one of the key areas where the government had \"fallen short\" and he was \"deeply concerned\" the latest measures were \"yet another example of this - too little, too late\".\nHe added proposals to limit hotel quarantine to the specific \"red list\" of countries did \"not go anywhere near far enough\", adding the measures left \"huge gaps\" in the UK's defences against emerging variants of the virus.\nIt comes as a further 1,725 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK on Wednesday, as well another 25,308 new infections, according to the government dashboard.\nThe data also shows that up to and including 26 January, more than seven million people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\nIn a statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday, Ms Patel said England's lockdown rules were \"clear [that] people should be staying at home unless they have a valid reason to leave. Going on holiday is not a valid reason.\"\nShe said the new rule would require people wishing to leave the UK to go abroad to first \"make a declaration for why they need to travel\", which would then be \"checked by carriers prior to departure\".\nMs Patel said: \"Anyone who doesn't have a valid reason for travel will be directed to return home or they will face a fine.\"\nUnder the national lockdown, people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. \nThese are the same as the \"reasonable excuses\" for domestic travel, including:\nShe said it was \"clear that there are still too many people coming in and out of our country each day\" and other border measures would be toughened up to \"reduce passenger flow\" and protect the UK's \"world-leading\" vaccination programme.\nPolice checks at home addresses will be increased to ensure arrivals are complying with self-isolation rules, and the UK will continue to refuse entry to non-UK citizens from \"red list\" countries which were already subject to the travel ban.\nThe list of travel exemptions would also be \"urgently\" reviewed, she added, to make sure \"only the most important and with exceptional reasons are included\".\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that UK nationals and residents returning from 30 high-risk countries would have to quarantine in government-provided hotels.\nThe measures will apply to people coming from most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal, amid concern over new variants of the virus. Most overseas visitors from those countries are already barred from entering the UK. \nBritish nationals and those with residency rights who arrive from high-risk countries will be required to quarantine in a hotel at their own expense for up to 10 days, in a bid to improve compliance with self-isolation rules. \nKeri McMenamin was returning to the country with her husband and two children after securing a job offer - leaving the UK in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic last year.\n\"It is literally luck of the draw,\" the 38-year-old said after securing her family's place in Australia's 14-day quarantine system. \"You didn't know what to expect.\" Having done some research, Keri discovered Facebook groups busy with people relaying their experiences of quarantine.\n\"A lot of people were saying, 'Look, just expect the worst and then whatever you get is a bonus.'\"\nIn the end, the family was given an interconnecting room. But the windows were sealed and their time outside limited to 20-minute stints every two to three days.\nMr Johnson told the House of Commons on Wednesday that arrivals who could not be refused entry would be required to isolate in government provided accommodation, such as hotels, \"without exception\".\nThese arrivals would be escorted from the airport and \"transported directly into quarantine\", with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) working to set up these facilities \"as quickly as possible\", he said.\nMs Patel said the DHSC would \"set out further details\" on the hotel quarantine policy next week.\nIan Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, told the Commons that the Scottish and Welsh governments wanted \"to go further\" than what the UK government was proposing on quarantine measures, and challenged the PM to \"stop his half measures\" and bring in \"stricter enforcement on international travel\".\nA spokesman for the Welsh government said \"the need for a joint approach\" to border measures had been agreed between the UK's four nations and the Republic of Ireland, but it did not believe the approach outlined by the UK government went \"far enough\".\n\"Further discussions on the details of the proposals will take place as soon as possible,\" he added.\nIn response to the government's announcement, Airport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee welcomed the news that the new hotel quarantine policy would only apply to a limited number of countries, but questioned what \"additional public health benefit\" it would have, given strict travel rules were recently introduced.\nShe called on the government to set out \"when and how we can ease all these measures safely and provide people with reassurance that travel will be possible again in the future\".\nAt the moment, incoming travellers have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test on departure, taken in the previous 72 hours. Then they still have to quarantine for up to 10 days, although this can be done at home.\nThose who do not comply will face a fine of \u00a3500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks. \nIn England, the self-isolation period can be cut short with a second negative test after five days. \nQuarantine rules are set separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but have tended to differ only slightly.\nHotel quarantine is already in use in countries including New Zealand and Australia. \nAre you a UK national in one of the countries affected?

      "text": "US actress Jane Fonda is to be honoured with a lifetime achievement award at next month's Golden Globes, which celebrate excellence in film and TV.\n\"Her undeniable talent has gained her the highest level of recognition,\" said the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) - the ceremony's organiser.\n\"While her professional life has taken many turns, her unwavering commitment to evoking change has remained.\"\nFonda, 83, has had a glittering acting career spanning six decades. \nThe HFPA said she would be given the Cecil B deMille Award at the annual ceremony in Beverly Hills, California, on 28 February.\nThe Oscar-winning actress made her debut in 1960, later becoming one of the brightest Hollywood stars with films like Barbarella, Nine to Five and On Golden Pond. \nHer most recent performance was in the Netflix comedy series Grace and Frankie.\nFonda is also well known as a political activist, most recently as a campaigner against climate change. In 2016, she spent Thanksgiving among the protesters at Standing Rock, demonstrating against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.\nIn the 1960s she vocally opposed the Vietnam War. \nThe actress - who has written a book about how people can get involved in such activism - has been arrested several times during protests, and hopes her actions have raised awareness."
