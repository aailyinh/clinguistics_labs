      "title": "Covid: Hard months to come in pandemic for UK, says Van-Tam",
      "tags": "Jonathan Van-Tam,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "\"Very high\" coronavirus rates in the UK at present mean there are hard months to come, England's deputy chief medical officer has warned.  \nProf Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC it was a concern that Covid levels were \"running this hot, this early in the autumn season\".\nHe said too many people believed the pandemic was now over. \nChristmas and the winter months are \"potentially going to be problematic\", Prof Van-Tam warned. \nThe UK recorded 33,865 Covid cases on Tuesday and 293 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn a question and answer session with BBC Breakfast and BBC Radio 5 Live, Prof Van-Tam said that while cases appeared to have stabilised, they were very high, and above most of Europe. \nHe also said deaths were rising and there were signs infections were starting to \"penetrate\" older age groups.\nThe current levels of coronavirus meant caution was now needed, he said, adding that experts would be continuing to analyse the data over the next days and weeks.\nHow Christmas is affected would depend on a \"whole range of behaviours\", he said.\nFace coverings and the caution people took in interacting with others, along with the speed of vaccinations, would be \"a big determinant between what happens now and the darkest months of the winter\".\nUsing a football analogy, as he has often done while commenting on the pandemic, he said: \"I would say we're kind of half-time in extra time, and I think the final whistle in terms of - I can't predict it - but my personal view is that we've got a few more months to run, and I think we'll be in a much calmer set of waters by spring.\"\nBBC health reporter Philippa Roxby\nJonathan Van Tam warned this morning that people should not assume the pandemic was over, or let their guard down.\nHe urged caution, particularly when meeting other people, and the wearing of face coverings in appropriate places.\nHe added that vaccinating young children from the age of five is not a priority in the UK - unlike in the US. He believes boosters and first doses for the five million unvaccinated are much more important.\nBut it's not just Covid he's worried about.\nFlu and other winter respiratory viruses are returning this season after a complete absence last year when no one was mixing - and anything we can do to protect against Covid will protect against these viruses too.\nProf Van-Tam urged people to get their Covid jabs, boosters and flu vaccines, adding that it was \"very important\" this winter.\nExperts have warned that people are at increased risk of death and serious illness if they are co-infected with Covid and flu. \nMore than 40 million people in the UK are being offered a flu jab this year.\nFor the first time this includes all secondary school children up to the age of 16.\nA booster jab programme for the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions is currently being rolled out, but he urged the NHS and the government to make it clearer to people when their turn may be coming up. \nAsked whether people will need a booster every six months, Prof Van-Tam said it was likely it would provide protection for longer than the first two doses, but this was not yet fully known. \nProf Van-Tam's comments come after a member of a group of scientists advising the government on coronavirus announced he had stepped down from the role.\nSir Jeremy Farrar, who had been part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) since the start of the pandemic, said he was stepping down to focus on his work at the Wellcome Trust - a medical research centre - but warned the high level of infections in the UK remained concerning. \nAmid speculation that Sir Jeremy was unhappy with the way ministers handle scientific advice, Prof Van-Tam said he did not read any more into his resignation other than he wants to concentrate on other work.\nHe added: \"It's a tribute to Sir Jeremy and so many other scientists that they have supported us so hard and for so long and given such invaluable, independent advice.\" \nMeanwhile, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which provides advice to the government, said that while the infection rate is \"high\", he does not believe the current case numbers of coronavirus are \"out of control\".\nProf Jeremy Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the country was at a \"relatively important crux point\". \nIf infection rates and hospitalisations went down it would be \"very encouraging\", but if they started going up it would be \"a different situation completely\"."

      "text": "A formal complaint made by Health Secretary Humza Yousaf about a nursery he accused of discriminating against his daughter has been upheld.\nA statement from the Care Inspectorate said it had found that Little Scholars in Broughty Ferry \"did not promote fairness, equality and respect\" when offering placements.\nMr Yousaf and his wife say they were told there was no space for their child but said applicants with \"white Scottish-sounding names\" were accepted. The nursery had denied the accusations.\nA spokeswoman for Little Scholars said: \"Whilst the Care Inspectorate found our admission procedure could be improved, this had nothing to do with discrimination or equality.\n\"Within a few days of becoming aware of Mr Yousaf and Ms El-Nakla's complaint, we reviewed and updated our system for dealing with admissions.\"\nA statement from the solicitor of Mr Yousaf and Nadia El-Nakla said the couple felt \"vindicated\" by the Care Inspectorate ruling.\nIt said: \"They are first and foremost loving parents who would do anything to protect their children. \n\"Humza and Nadia were left deeply upset when they believed their young daughter Amal was being discriminated against and that is why they took action they did.\"\nWhen Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia El-Nakla applied for a space for the couple's two-year-old daughter, Amal, she said she was told there was no availability. \nBut the couple said applications submitted by friends and family for \"white Scottish-sounding names\" were accepted.\nSpeaking at the time he reported the nursery in August, Mr Yousaf told the BBC: \"I'm really upset that at the age of two, my daughter, though she's oblivious to it all, has suffered discrimination.\n\"Tell us why three Muslim-sounding families were rejected and in some cases, less than 24 hours later, white Scottish families were accepted.\n\"There can be no reasonable explanation for that, and if there is one, then tell it to us.\n\"But so far, the nursery has failed to do so.\"\nA spokesperson for the Care Inspectorate said: \"We have upheld a complaint in relation to this matter. \n\"We found that the service did not promote fairness, equality and respect when offering placements. \n\"Every child in Scotland has the right to good quality care that meets their needs and respects their rights.\"\n\"We have identified areas for improvement and we will follow up on these to check on progress.\n\"We continue to monitor this service. If we are not satisfied that the improvements required have been met, we will not hesitate to take further action.\"\nFollowing the initial concerns from Mr Yousaf and his wife, a Daily Record investigation submitted applications with identical requirements to the nursery under the names Aqsa Akhtar and Susan Blake.\nThe newspaper said Aqsa Akhtar had her application rejected, but Susan Blake's was accepted and offered spaces.\nMs El-Nakla said she had emailed nursery bosses in May, asking if there were any available places.\nThe couple alleged they were told there were \"no available spaces in the nursery\" - the second time they said they had been turned down.\nBut they claimed that two days later when a white friend asked if there were spaces for her two-year-old son, the nursery told her places were available on three afternoons a week.\nLittle Scholars Day Nursery said back in August that any claim that it was not open and inclusive to all was \"demonstrably false\".\nIt said that its owners were of Asian heritage and it had regularly welcomed children and staff from a range of backgrounds \"including two Muslim families currently\"."

      "text": "The family of a mother who died after a series of errors with her benefits has agreed a \"substantial settlement\".\nPhilippa Day, 27, was found collapsed at her Nottingham home with a letter rejecting an assessment in August 2019.\nAn inquest heard the way her claim was dealt with was the \"predominant factor\" in her overdose.\nThe family said the settlement would provide for Miss Day's son, but that nothing can \"put right the wrong that contributed to Philippa's death\".\nThe exact amount of the settlement has not been disclosed.\nThe inquest heard the authorities who dealt with Miss Day's benefits claim made 28 errors in managing her case.\nAt one point Miss Day, who had been diagnosed with unstable personality disorder, saw her income go down from \u00a3228 a week to \u00a360. \nThe court heard in June, she called the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to say she was \"starving\" and \"couldn't survive like this for much longer\".\nThere were failings at both the DWP and contractors Capita, the coroner found.\nMiss Day's sister, Imogen, said: \"Capita's wall of bureaucracy, with no consideration for Philippa's mental state, exacerbated her despair at her debt and poverty. \n\"She was met with cold, uncaring call operators who would not listen to her cries for help.\n\"This settlement will in some measure provide for Philippa's family and a materially stable upbringing for Philippa's son, but he has lost his mother, and there is nothing Capita can do to put right the wrong that contributed to Philippa's death.\"\nHowever, the family said they welcomed an offer to meet with Capita to discuss improvements to their service.\nMerry Varney, from Leigh Day solicitors - who represented the family - said: \"Capita has shown acceptance of their failures and a willingness to ensure their mistakes are not repeated, however there remain too many examples of the DWP, which controls the financial circumstances of the majority of people too sick to work, acting inhumanely to those receiving benefits and a continued resistance by the DWP to transparent investigations into benefit-related deaths. \n\"Until the DWP changes its attitude, people like Philippa and her family remain at risk of gross human rights violations and 'benefit-related deaths' are just another example of preventable deaths of people with disabilities occurring without any proper investigation or scrutiny.\"\nA Capita spokesperson said: \"We are very sorry for the mistakes we made in processing Philippa's Personal Independence Payment claim and the additional stress this caused her.\n\"In partnership with the DWP, we have considered and reviewed the coroner's report and we are implementing all the recommendations that are relevant to us.  \n\"Following this incident, we have strengthened our processes and we are working to continuously improve and deliver a professional, efficient and kind service for every PIP applicant we assess.\"\nIn response to the regulation 28 Prevention of Future Death (PFD) report stemming from the inquest, the DWP wrote to coroner Gordon Clow and pledged to ensure all of its staff handling PIP and employment and support allowance (ESA) would undertake training in mental health, behaviour and relationships as well as \"supporting vulnerable customers\".\nFollowing a Freedom of Information request by the BBC Shared Data Unit, the DWP said all of its 7,000 staff had received the training by the end of June \"other than a small number absent for reasons such as maternity leave and therefore not currently working in the business\".\nImogen Day described the training as a \"positive step\", but said she continued to \"have concerns over the culture at DWP, which the coroner referred to as showing a lack of compassion\". \nA DWP spokesperson said: \"Our condolences remain with the Day family.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has criticised the leaders of China and Russia for not turning up to the COP26 climate summit. \nIn a speech on Tuesday night, Mr Biden said climate was \"a gigantic issue\" and China \"walked away\" - adding it was the \"same thing with Russia and Putin\".\nNeither Russian President Vladimir Putin nor Chinese leader Xi Jinping are at the summit in Glasgow. \nBoth countries however have sent delegations to the talks, which are due to run for two weeks until 14 November.\nChina is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, followed by the US. Russia is the fifth largest after the EU and India. \nMore than 120 leaders turned up at the conference in Scotland's largest city. \nCountries have already announced major deals, including a global pledge to slash methane levels by 2030 as well as to end and reverse deforestation by the same year. \nBoth China and Russia are signatories of the pledge to reverse deforestation. Before Mr Biden's speech, Mr Putin virtually addressed a meeting on forest management at the COP26 summit on Tuesday, saying that Russia takes the \"strongest and most vigorous measures to conserve\" woodlands, according to a Kremlin press release.\nThe US president made his comments when asked about the role that other countries - including China, Russia and Saudi Arabia - had played in talks so far. \n\"The fact that China is trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader - not showing up, come on,\" Mr Biden said, adding that Xi Jinping's absence was a \"big mistake\".\nHe said the same about Mr Putin, saying that Russia's wilderness was burning and their president \"stays mum\" about the issue. \nMr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov gave no reason why the Russian leader would not attend when they announced the decision in October, although he said climate change was an \"important\" priority for Russia. \nThe same month officials warned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson that China's President Xi Jinping was not expected to attend. It is thought that President Xi has not left China since early 2020.\nIn September Mr Xi announced China will aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, with a plan to hit peak emissions before 2030.\nPresident Putin said Russia would also strive to reach carbon neutrality \"no later than 2060\" in an international energy forum speech on 13 October. \nNet zero, or becoming carbon neutral, means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nRead more about the COP26 summit here\nSimple guide to climate change\nWhat will climate change look like for you?\nWill the UK meet its climate targets?\nHow extreme weather is linked to climate change"

      "tags": "Companies,Agriculture,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "UK meat producers have started sending carcasses to the EU for butchering before re-importing them as they continue to combat a labour shortage. \nThe British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) say producers are sending beef to the Republic of Ireland amid local shortages of butchers. \nMeanwhile, pork producers are set to begin sending pigs to the Netherlands for butchering and packing.\nMeat exported in this way cannot be labelled as British pork for UK sale.\nAccording to the BMPA, the move will cost an additional \u00a31,500 for each lorry load of carcasses. This includes transport fees, as well as Brexit customs requirements, such as an export health certificate for each consignment.\nMeat exported from the UK currently undergoes checks in the EU, however, the introduction of post-Brexit import controls on food and animals products in the UK has been delayed until July 2022.\n\"It is what needs to be done to counteract the problem,\" a spokesperson for BMPA told the BBC. \nThe move - which was first reported by the Financial Times - comes after post-Brexit staff shortages, and a lack of capacity at abattoirs, have led to the culling of more than 10,000 healthy pigs so far.\nA shortage of skilled workers, as well as exporting issues, Covid-19, and reduced demand from China, has left the sector with a growing backlog of pork, of which the UK is a significant exporter. \nStaffing levels are reported to be at least 15% below the normal level.\nThe BMPA said: \"Immigration rules need to be relaxed so we can get experienced people without having to train them to help solve the immediate short-term problem.\n\"Then we need to be attracting, recruiting, and training people in the UK. This is not an instant fix, however, as we are looking at 18 months or longer to train these people.\n\"The government also needs to add key level courses to the support they have already given. As far as we can see there are no food related courses, or they are not the ones we need.\"\nMeanwhile, National Farmers Union vice president Tom Bradshaw said: \"Farm businesses have done all they can to recruit staff domestically, but even increasingly competitive wages have had little impact because the labour pool is so limited.\"\n\"A short term Covid Recovery Visa, alongside a permanent Seasonal Workers Scheme, would be an effective and, frankly, vital route to help the pressing needs of the industry today. It would also give us time to invest in the skills and recruitment of our domestic workforce.\"\nLast month, the UK government agreed to issue 800 temporary visas for skilled overseas butchers to work in Britain for six months. However, farmers and meat processors, who are waiting for them to arrive, do not expect them before the end of November.\nNick Allen, chief executive of the BMPA said: \"We have been saying we are between 10,000 and 12,000 short of these types of workers, 800 doesn't go very far, it has been made very clear it is only for six months and they go again.\"\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) refused to comment on the number of applications they had received so far.\nThe government also pledged to fund cold storage for carcasses, while the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board has launched a cull and render scheme, dedicating a plant to the disposal of animals. \nBut farmers have criticised the move as not being enough, or not providing a long-term solution, raising concerns about the supply of a number of popular Christmas food products such as pigs in blankets.\n\"We are in limbo,\" Zoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pig Association, said. \"Some processors are saying they won't come until mid-December, and some are worried some won't come at all as it is just before Christmas.\"\n\"Butchers are the most meaningful thing we can have. If we get them on the floor we will start moving more pigs.\"\nShe told the BBC: \"Sadly this whole situation could have been avoided if the government had acted sooner. While the package of measures announced in October was very welcome, we have yet to see any benefit and even if the measures operate as intended, it will be some time before any meaningful impact is seen on farms. \n\"For many this will come too late.\""

      "text": "A typical UK home costs more than \u00a3250,000 for the first time after prices rose by 9.9% in the last year, according to the Nationwide.\nThe building society said the average house price was \u00a3250,311 in October, up 0.7% on the previous month.\nIt said this was an increase of \u00a330,728 since the start of the pandemic. Covid has coincided with intense demand from buyers unmatched by supply.\nOfficial forecasters say the pace of house price rises will slow.\n\"The dynamics of the housing market may be about to shift slowly once again, but make no mistake, the boom still isn't over,\" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country.\nUK house prices have risen sharply over the last 18 months owing to changing preferences of buyers, who are now looking for more indoor and outside space, but those properties have not been plentiful on the market.\nThat has led to intense competition among potential buyers in some areas, particularly in rural and coastal spots.\nThe market also been buoyed by tax incentives, with ministers introducing stamp duty holidays, as well as cheap borrowing costs.\nThose tax breaks are now over, and there is widespread speculation that mortgage rates will rise from the ultra-low levels of recent times.\n\"We expect house prices to continue to beat expectations in the near term before a gradual rise in mortgage rates applies the brakes in the second half of 2022,\" said Andrew Wishart, property economist at Capital Economics.\nThe outcome of Thursday's Bank of England interest rate decision will be one factor affecting house prices in the months ahead.\n\"The outlook remains extremely uncertain,\" said Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner.\n\"If the labour market remains resilient, conditions may stay fairly buoyant in the coming months - especially as the market continues to have momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts in housing preferences.\"\nThe government's official, independent forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - said that house prices would continue to rise in the coming years, albeit at a slower rate.\nIt means potential first-time buyers are facing another period of difficulty if they wish to buy a home, especially if the cost of borrowing rises.\nThe OBR has now predicted that house prices will go up by 8.6% this year, compared with a year earlier. The annual rise would then slow to 3.2% in 2022, before decelerating further to 0.9% in 2023, it said.\nThis would be followed by rises of 1.9% in 2024, 2.9% in 2025, and 3.5% in 2026, although longer-term forecasts and more difficult to make accurately."

In return, it got a lifting of sanctions.\nBut Mr Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 and reintroduced the sanctions after failing to get Iran to agree to provisions to curb its ballistic missile programme and end its involvement in regional conflicts.\nSince the re-introduction of sanctions, Iran has been unable to access billions of dollars of its assets held in foreign banks. \nWorld powers don't trust Iran: Some countries believe Iran wants nuclear power because it wants to build a nuclear bomb - it denies this.\nSo a deal was struck: In 2015, Iran and six other countries reached a major agreement. Iran would stop some nuclear work in return for an end to harsh penalties, or sanctions, hurting its economy.\nWhat is the problem now? Iran re-started banned nuclear work after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. Even though new leader Joe Biden wants to rejoin, both sides say the other must make the first move."

      "text": "Investigators say \"low adhesion\" between the track and train wheels was the most likely cause of the crash between two trains in Salisbury.\nThe trains collided on the approach to a tunnel near Salisbury station at about 18:45 GMT on Sunday.\nOne of the drivers is believed to have suffered \"life-changing\" injuries. \nInvestigators say the GWR train was \"protected by a red signal\" before being hit by a South Western train.\nAndrew Hall, from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, said the South Western train was \"required to stop\" but \"it did not stop\".\nInitial evidence was that the driver did attempt to brake at a red signal before the train suffered \"wheel slide\".\n\"Unfortunately, it did not stop and struck the side of the Great Western train at an angle such that both trains derailed and ran alongside each other into the tunnel.\n\"We are continuing to pursue this as a line of investigation amongst others,\" he added.\nThe Rail Delivery Group said low adhesion can be caused by \"moisture on the rail mixing with the film produced by 'leaves on the line' or other contaminants, such as rust or grease.\"\nThey add the problem can be worse in autumn and that \"it can also cause safety risks, such as signals passed at danger and station overruns\".\nMr Hall said the initial results of the investigation would be made public later in the week.\nThe crash has caused major disruption, with lines through the city expected to remain closed until at least the end of Monday.\nOf the 92 passengers on board the two trains, 14 required hospital treatment for minor injuries. \nThe South Western Railway (SWR) train was running from London to Honiton, Devon, while the Great Western Railway (GWR) service was travelling from from Southampton to Cardiff as they both collided at Fisherton Tunnel.\nBoth trains had passed a Y-shaped junction, close to the entrance of the tunnel, before the collision.\nMartin Frobisher, Network Rail's safety and engineering director, said: \"Sunday's accident was incredibly frightening for everyone involved and our thoughts are with everyone injured or affected in any way.\n\"Initial findings suggest that low adhesion played a key part in causing the collision.\n\"It's an issue that affects railways across the world and is something that we, and our train operator colleagues, work hard to combat - so that we can run trains safely and reliably throughout autumn, and why incidents such as the one in Salisbury at the weekend are incredibly rare.\"\nTransport minister Chris Heaton-Harris paid tribute to those injured in the crash.\n\"There are plenty of lessons I am sure that will be learned but we are at the very early stages of the investigation,\" he added.\nWiltshire Police deputy chief constable Paul Mills said: \"Although thankfully no-one lost their lives, it is hard to imagine the shock and distress this incident would have had caused those onboard both trains.\"\nSWR and GWR are offering alternative train services and rail replacement buses, but people are being advised not to travel on that part of the network until the lines have fully reopened.\nSalisbury MP John Glen said the closure of the line was \"hugely disruptive\" and his thoughts were with the driver and all those affected.\n\"It was obviously a shocking event and one doesn't expect this sort of thing to happen. \n\"It's a key line and there's a significant commuting population, and this disruption is hugely damaging to people's lives.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Ikea is to raise prices as the disruption to global supply chains is expected to last into next year.\nOn Wednesday, Ikea reported a drop in full-year profit due to higher transport and raw material costs.\nIn the coming year it will pass some of these costs on to its outlets, which will be free to then charge customers more, the Reuters news agency reported.\nBusinesses have been struggling with supply chain problems as economies recover from the Covid pandemic.\nThe Swedish furniture giant saw record demand during the pandemic as people spent more time at home.\nHowever, pre-tax profit at Ikea Group, which makes most of its money selling goods to its franchisees, fell 16% in the year to September to \u20ac1.7bn (\u00a31.4bn).\nCompared with 2019, before the pandemic, profit was down 4%.\nThe biggest hit to its income came from \"the steep increase in transport and raw material prices in the second half of the financial year,\" it said.\n\"Keeping Ikea stores and warehouses stocked has been a challenge. Supply chain disruptions led to a substantial drop in the availability of products that we have yet to recover from. We expect this will continue far into [Ikea's 2022 fiscal year],\" it added.\nChief Financial Officer, Martin van Dam, said that the effects of the global supply chain crisis and high energy prices could last for some time, saying he expected 2022 to be \"a more difficult year with more challenges\".\nIkea didn't hike its product prices to retailers in the year to September but indicated it would pass on some of the higher raw material and transport costs to store owners this fiscal year.\n\"Though we can't continue to secure fixed prices to the retailers under these challenging conditions, we also plan to absorb part of the increased costs during FY22,\" it said.\nMr Van Dam said store owners would have some freedom to decide whether, or to what extent, they would pass on higher prices to shoppers.\nThe Ikea announcement comes after chief executive Jesper Brodin said in mid-October that congestion at ports had led to supply problems.\n\"We need to live with disturbances for the year to come,\" he said.\nIkea has been forced to buy additional shipping capacity to address product shortages."

      "text": "Facebook has announced it will no longer use facial recognition software to identify faces in photographs and videos.\nThere have been growing concerns about the ethics of facial recognition technology, with questions raised over privacy, racial bias, and accuracy.\nRegulators had not yet provided a clear set of rules over how it should be used, the company said.\nIt has faced a barrage of criticism over its impact on its users.\nUntil now, users of the social media app could choose to opt in to the feature which would scan their face in pictures and notify them if someone else on the platform had posted a picture of them.\nIn a blog post, Jerome Pesenti, vice president of artificial intelligence at the firm said: \"Amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate.\"\nIn 2019, a US government study suggested facial recognition algorithms were far less accurate at identifying African-American and Asian faces compared to Caucasian faces. \nAfrican-American women were even more likely to be misidentified, according to the study conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\nLast year, Facebook also settled a long-running legal dispute about the way it scans and tags photos. \nThe case has been ongoing since 2015, and it was agreed the firm would pay $550m (\u00a3421m) to a group of users in Illinois who argued its facial recognition tool was in violation of the state's privacy laws.\nOther tech firms such as Amazon and Microsoft have both suspended facial recognition product sales to police as the uses for the technology have become more controversial. \nFacebook, which as well as running the world's largest social media network also owns Instagram and the messaging service Whatsapp, has come under growing pressure from regulators and politicians.\nIt is facing increased scrutiny from regulators including the US the Federal Trade Commission, which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices.\nAnd last month, a former employee accused the company of unethical behaviour. Frances Haugen released a cache of internal documents which she said showed Facebook had put profit before user safety.\nChief Executive Mark Zuckerburg said Ms Haugen's claims were part of a co-ordinated effort to \"paint a false picture\" of the company.\nThe firm recently announced a new name, Meta, for the broader parent company following a series of negative stories about Facebook.\nMr Zuckerberg said the existing brand could not \"possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future\" and needed to change."

I told him it was time to rest,\" she said, remembering the moment he died.\nAndrea said she knew she would not be judged on the group when she discussed things like taking her husband's ashes to bed with her when she could not sleep.\n\"They know exactly what I am going through.\"\nWhen Terry Andrews, a retired psychiatric nurse, died at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Denbighshire, in April, his family was unable to be at his bedside.\nThe 75-year-old had been ill for some time and on haemodialysis in hospital, but died after testing positive for coronavirus.\n\"It just goes through my head that we weren't there for him,\" his daughter Samantha Andrews-Pierce said.\nSamantha, from Denbigh, said she had found comfort in the group and had struggled with not being able to say goodbye to her father properly due to restrictions.\n\"We haven't been able to bury him,\" she said.\n\"We haven't had a wake, which I think is a massive thing when you're grieving. We had 10 at the funeral [but] we weren't allowed to sit with our mum.\"\nMandy Howells, from Pentre in Rhondda Cynon Taf, said the death of her father, 79-year-old Dennis Kierle, in April still \"didn't seem real\".\n\"I try to put a brave face on when I'm with my mum,\" she said.\n\"I feel that, on this group... they know exactly what you are feeling and thinking because they are going through it themselves. \n\"It's helped me - emotionally.\"\nThe group is now trying to get members access to counselling, but Nicola Thomas from Swansea said there was a waiting list for support.\nHer father, John Bennett, a project manager for Tata Steel, died aged 69 after contracting the virus in April.\n\"In relation to bereavement, there is a feeling that the GPs tend to offer you anti-depressants or diazepam to help you sleep, but counselling is important as well,\" she said.\n\"The effects on the bereaved doesn't get talked about very much on the news.\n\"As soon as we are able, we want to get together as a group - even if it's just a coffee and share stories. We can gain something from that kind of friendship.  \n\"We've got a common aim that we want our relatives remembered.\"\nThe Welsh Government said it had provided \u00a3900,000 of support to hospices and bereavement providers to increase the level of support.\nIt comes after an announcement earlier this year of an additional \u00a31m for bereavement services from April next year.\n\"We send our heartfelt condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one to this cruel virus,\" a spokesman said.\n\"We are also developing a national bereavement framework to support the establishment of clear referral pathways, bereavement standards and a directory of available bereavement provision.\""

      "tags": "Cities,HM Treasury,COP26,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "Most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to show how they intend to hit climate change targets, under proposed Treasury rules.\nBy 2023, they will have to set out detailed public plans for how they will move to a low-carbon future - in line with the UK's 2050 net-zero target.\nAn expert panel will set the standards the plans need to meet to ensure they are not just spin. \nAny commitments will not be mandatory. Green groups say this is not enough. \nNet zero is when a business or a country achieves an overall balance between the amount of carbon it is emitting and the carbon that it's removing from the atmosphere.\nFirms and their shareholders will be left to decide how their businesses adapt to this transition, including how they intend to decarbonise.\nAnd although the plans will need to be published, the government said \"the aim is to increase transparency and accountability\" and the UK was not \"making firm-level net-zero commitments mandatory\".\nThe market will decide whether firms' plans are credible, the Treasury said.\nSpeaking at the COP26 climate summit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the UK was leading the world in becoming the \"first-ever net zero aligned global financial centre\".\nHe said the changes would mean: \"Better and more consistent climate data; sovereign green bonds; mandatory sustainability disclosures; proper climate risk surveillance; and proper global reporting standards.\"\nIn total, 450 firms controlling 40% of global financial assets - equivalent to $130tn (\u00a395tn) - have agreed to commit to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nHowever, campaign group Global Witness said that without regulation the pledges were \"doomed to fail\".\n\"Banks and financiers are the lifeblood of the fossil fuel companies and destructive agribusinesses fuelling the climate crisis - so it's right that focus should be on them at COP26. \n\"However, today's announcement by banks risks amounting to more greenwashing if it's not legally binding,\" said Veronica Oakeshott, head of forests policy and advocacy at Global Witness.\nDavid Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, said the intention was positive, but that financial firms were still \"pouring billions into environmentally harmful projects.\"\nMark Campanale, founder and executive chair of Carbon Tracker Initiative, praised the ambition of the plans, but said details of how it would work were still unclear.\n\"None of the financial assets announced are currently aligned with net-zero and no group of companies can say they are meeting the Paris target by continuing to invest in fossil fuels, so that needs to change considerably before London can be lauded as the world's first net-zero financial centre and a model for the world,\" he said.\nShaun Spiers, executive director of environmental think tank Green Alliance, said that more UK public sector funding was needed. \n\"Private sector investment is vital, but it will be much easier to achieve on the back of serious investment by the chancellor,\" he said.\nHowever, a coalition of finance groups led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said there was enough finance committed to keep global warming to 1.5C.\nThe Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) said more than $130trn (\u00a395trn) of private capital \"is now committed to transforming the economy for net zero\".\nIn practice, this means that bank loans which would go to an oil field, or a coal mine, are diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes.\nBank bosses will also be expected to have tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. \nUnder the proposed Treasury rules, financial institutions and companies with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange must come up with net-zero transition plans, which will be published from 2023.\nThe strategies will need to include targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and steps which firms intend to take to get there.\nA taskforce made up of industry leaders, academics, regulators and civil society groups will set a science-based \"gold standard\" for the plans in order to guard against so-called \"greenwashing\" - where environmental initiatives are more about marketing than substance.\nHowever, the government said there was \"not yet a commonly agreed standard for what a good quality transition plan looks like\".\nMeanwhile, Mr Sunak also pledged that a target for developed countries to send $100bn (\u00a3720m) a year to those that are less developed - to help support their transition to net zero - will be achieved by 2023. \nAlison Rose, chief executive of Natwest, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the bank had started measuring the emissions on its balance sheet to help it track progress, saying \"transparency was critical\".\nShe said the bank was working with the oil and gas industry \"to develop credible transition plans so we can track progress and work with our customers\".\nBut Ms Rose said its main focus was helping small firms where there were \"real business opportunities\" in \"adopting sustainable supply chain [and] sustainable business practices\".\nKay Swinburne, vice-chairman of financial services at KPMG UK, said the announcement on UK firms would provide the financial services industry with a \"valuable set of unified metrics to measure progress towards decarbonisation\". \n\"It is brave to put a gold standard in place for all companies raising funding,\" she added.  \nAnd Dr Ben Caldecott, director of the UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment, said the plans would \"spur demand for green finance and accelerate decarbonisation, not just in the UK but wherever UK firms do business\".\nFollow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130tn, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C.\nThis means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from \"brown holdings\" of investments in coal, oil and gas. \nBut can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. \nBy changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for children aged five to 11, clearing the way for millions of young Americans to get vaccinated.\nThe decision by Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Wolensky comes after careful consideration from US drug regulators.\nThe US is already giving the vaccine to those aged 12 and over. This approval affects some 28 million US children.\nExperts argue that jabbing the young is necessary for a return to normal life. \nThe authorisation comes after expert panels at the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) weighed the risks and benefits of vaccinating children against Covid-19.\nFDA officials determined that the vaccine was around 91% effective in preventing Covid in young children, and that their immune response was comparable to that seen in people aged 16 to 25. No serious side effects were found by researchers. \nChildren aged five to 11 are given a jab with a third of the dosage given to adults, creating a new logistical challenge for drug suppliers and doctors. Smaller needles are also used and the second jab is required three weeks after the first. \nIn a statement, President Joe Biden said the child vaccine \"will allow parents to end months of anxious worrying about their kids, and reduce the extent to which children spread the virus to others\".\nCovid has led 2,300 schools to close this year, affecting 1.2 million pupils and 78,000 teachers since August, NBC reported on Tuesday, citing a senior CDC official.\nAmong those between five and 11 years old, there have been about 1.8 million Covid cases confirmed in the US, according to the CDC. Fewer than two hundred have died, and most of those had underlying medical conditions.\nSome medical experts say that, given the persistence of the Delta variant and the return to in-person schooling, vaccinating children is a crucial next step in fighting the pandemic.\n\"Parents need to understand the urgency of vaccination because the pandemic is not over,\" said Dr James Versalovic, pathologist in chief at Texas Children's Hospital (TCH).\nDr Versalovic estimates at least 1,500 children have been diagnosed since the beginning of the pandemic with the virus at TCH, the largest children's hospital in the US. \"No age group has been spared,\" he said.\nVaccine hesitancy remains a challenge for US medical authorities. Uptake in the adult population has stalled below 60% over the past several months.  \nOnly a third of parents in a poll last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they would get their children vaccinated \"right away\". Another third said they would like to \"wait and see\".\nSome parents have expressed concern about hundreds of cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, that have been reported predominantly in young adults who took the vaccine, mostly after the second jab.\nDr Liz Mumper, chief executive of the Rimland Center for Integrative Medicine, thinks \"children should not be given treatments they do not need\", pointing to their low risk of contracting Covid and to the lack of long-term data on Covid vaccines.\n\"I am opposed to rolling these vaccines out to all children in a one size fits all model,\" she said. \"The vast majority of children already have mild cases.\"\nA legal immunity protection offered to drug companies during the Trump administration has also made it nearly impossible to sue drug manufacturers for any side affects suffered from vaccination until 2024. \nOn Monday, the White House said that it had already purchased enough vaccine to jab all 28 million children who have just become eligible to receive it. \nWhite House Covid Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients told reporters that 15 million low-dose children's jabs had already been moved from Pfizer storage facilities to distribution centres.\nThe decision to begin preparing the shipments was made last week after the FDA granted approval, Mr Zients said, adding that jabs will probably begin before the end of the week.\nLast month, the US announced plans to distribute the jabs via more than 25,000 paediatric offices and 100 children's hospitals, as well as through pharmacies, school-based clinics and community health centres.\nThe plan is designed to take into account that, for this age group, everything from dosing to counselling support from clinicians to the post-jab waiting period looks different than for other age groups, and parents will need a trusted voice in the room.\n\"It's one thing to have Dr Fauci on the national news say you should get your kid vaccinated, but it's another thing for a trusted physician in the community to have that direct conversation with families,\" says Amy Wimpey Knight, president of the Children's Hospital Association.\nMass vaccination sites are not good settings for jabbing young children, Ms Knight tells the BBC, so state and local health officials will need to quickly link up with schools, community centres and doctors' offices instead.\n\"All plans are local. That's what we learned the first time,\" she says. \nPatients at Texas Children's Hospital participated in Pfizer's clinical trials for children. Any side effects were \"easily treatable and monitored\", said Dr Versalovic.\n\"We are fully confident in the paediatric Covid vaccines. It's been tailored to children,\" he said, referring to the reduced dosage.\nFor a large provider like TCH, ensuring adequate supply at multiple care locations will be of primary concern, he said.\nAt smaller paediatric practices, physicians are a bit more circumspect.\nDr Robert Dracker, medical director of Summerwood Pediatrics in upstate New York, warned that a vaccine rollout for kids will collide with other realities: the onset of flu season, the mental health crisis of school children, and staffing shortages.\n\"Paediatricians' offices have been struggling terribly over the last few years,\" he said.\nDr Dracker says state health officials have set out guidelines and plan to dispense 300-dose allotments to his office. But he is frustrated by the lack of co-ordination.\n\"We have to try and contact all of our parents to find out how many of them might want their child vaccinated, and then set up separate clinic times,\" he explained.\n\"Instead of dictating what we have to do, [government officials] really need to listen to the input of practising physicians,\" he said."

It's hard to understand sometimes why the investigation process take so long. \nWhen you look at its judgements over the years on different MPs, sometimes critics have wondered if its decisions compare coherently. \nBut given that Boris Johnson has become fond of football metaphors lately: one of their team was given a serious red card, but rather than follow the decision, they've decided to sack the referee and the player can finish the match. \nIt's true that most of the public don't pay much attention to political and parliamentary process - although If you're reading this blog, you may be one of those that does. \nBut with around 100 Tory MPs staying away from the vote, defying the orders of party bosses, it's obvious there are plenty of Conservatives who are well aware that these kinds of shenanigans have political risk. \n\"One rule for them, and one rule for the rest\", is Labour's charge. \nRemember just how much damage the expenses scandal did to the reputations of all MPs, even though the number caught up in truly awful behaviour was small. \nThat's not to suggest that events today are anything like the scale of that intense political crisis.  \nBut every MP who backed today's move can expect to have it used against them on political leaflets or Facebook campaigns. \nThere could be serious consequences in Parliament if the opposition parties decide to use this moment to withdraw cooperation on other committees or ways of working. \nSome ministers already fear this is an episode that Downing Street may come to regret. \nOwen Paterson is adamant that he did nothing wrong, and has been denied natural justice. \nBut with this Tory response, voters may well come to wonder, what's fair about this?"

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said there is \"a long way to go\" in the fight to curb climate change - but he is \"cautiously optimistic\". \nSpeaking at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, he said the doomsday clock \"is still ticking\", but \"we've got a bomb disposal team on site\". \nWorld leaders are leaving the summit, with negotiators for each nation taking over to agree on climate pledges.\nMore than 100 countries agreed on Tuesday to cut emissions of methane. \nThe US-EU global partnership aims to limit the emissions by 30%, compared with 2020 levels. \nAs the second full day of the pivotal summit concluded:\nDespite some notable absences, senior figures championed the breakthroughs made as world leaders began to depart Glasgow, leaving behind teams of country negotiators for the next 10 days.\nMr Johnson said a pledge by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi to switch half the country's power grid to renewable sources by 2030 was a \"massive commitment\".\n\"I've seen more energy and more commitment and more urgency than I've ever seen and I've been doing this since 1988,\" US climate envoy John Kerry said.\nBut there is some way to go if leaders are to get an agreement that would keep alive the prospect set out in the Paris Agreement of restricting global temperature rises to 1.5C, according to the prime minister. \nChina is said to be one of those pushing back against a focus on limiting warming to 1.5C.\nMr Johnson told a news conference \"one thing that gives me optimism - for the countries who find it most difficult to transition from fossil fuels, we're starting to form those coalitions to help them\". \nBut he added that \"if we don't fix our climate, it will be an economic catastrophe as well as a environmental catastrophe\". \nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nHe said the public \"may not listen to me, but they certainly listen to Sir David Attenborough (who spoke at the summit on Monday) and they look at what's actually happening around the world\", referring to natural disasters in recent years.\nAhead of the summit, hosted by the UK, he had compared the fight against further climate change to a football match - suggesting humanity was 5-1 down at half-time. \nWith the world already experiencing dangerous heating, it's vital for this conference to produce more than what the activist Greta Thunberg calls \"blah blah blah\". \nToday world leaders have announced initiatives of some significance.\nIn one declaration, more than 100 countries promised to reverse deforestation by 2030. The pledge includes almost \u00a314bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds.\nAnother major announcement is a pact to cut emissions of methane by 30% by 2030.\nThe third eye-catching action was an agreement between 40 nations, including the UK, China, India and the US, to work together to create standards and incentives for new technologies.\nAnd in a fourth announcement, the governments of France, Germany, the UK, the US, and the EU, have outlined a partnership to get South Africa off coal, with an initial funding of \u00a36bn ($8.5bn).\nThese actions together won't solve the climate problem. But they do demonstrate some valuable new thinking. \nThe prime minister said: \"We've pulled back a goal, or perhaps even two, and I think we are going to be able to take this thing to extra-time, because there's no doubt that some progress has been made.\"\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband responded by saying: \"The score that really matters is whether we cut carbon emissions by half this decade.\"\nMr Johnson also said that while the \"doomsday clock was still ticking\" - having previously said it is at a minute to midnight - there was now a bomb disposal team on site and \"they're starting to snip the wires - I hope some of the right wires\".\nAs he prepared to return to London, Mr Johnson told the teams remaining in Glasgow: \"The eyes of the world are on you - the eyes of the British government and all the other governments that care about this - and we have got your numbers.\" \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

But the SWR train went through the red after \"low adhesion\" caused it to slip through. \nMr Tandy, who has been driving services in the area for around 50 years, did apply the brakes, investigators said. He suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in the crash. \nSWR said in a statement that he has an \"excellent professional track record\" and \"stayed at the controls throughout\". \n\"We thank him for his actions and we wish him a speedy recovery as he continues to be treated in hospital,\" the operator added. \nSWR said it hoped the early assessment by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), showing the driver reacted correctly to the signals, would help \"stop speculation\".\nThe RAIB confirmed preliminary analysis showed the driver initially applied service braking to slow the train before reaching the stop signal and that around 12 seconds after, he made an emergency brake demand. \nThis was followed by a second emergency brake demand made by the train protection and warning system.\nIts investigation will look at the level of wheel to rail adhesion on the approach to the tunnel junction and also consider how Network Rail managed the risk of wheels slipping on rails where the accident happened, it said.\nSouth Western Railways policies towards low adhesion between the wheels and the track will also be analysed.\nMeanwhile, work to remove wreckage at the scene of the crash is due to begin later.\nNetwork Rail said it would bring in cranes to lift the wreckage, BBC South Transport Correspondent Paul Clifton said.\nThe SWR train was running from London to Honiton, in Devon, while the GWR service was travelling from Southampton to Cardiff when they collided at the tunnel.\nBoth trains had passed a Y-shaped junction, close to the entrance of the tunnel, before the collision.\nInvestigators said further results would be made public later in the week.\nThe crash has caused major disruption, with lines through the city expected to remain closed until at least the end of Monday.\nOf the 92 passengers on board the two trains, 14 required hospital treatment, with most suffering minor injuries. \nThe Rail Delivery Group said low adhesion can be caused by \"moisture on the rail mixing with the film produced by 'leaves on the line' or other contaminants, such as rust or grease.\"\nThey add the problem can be worse in autumn and that \"it can also cause safety risks, such as signals passed at danger and station overruns\".\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "Owen Paterson: Anger as Tory MP avoids suspension in rule shake-up",
      "tags": "Owen Paterson,Parliamentary Standards Commissioner ",
      "text": "Conservative Owen Paterson has avoided punishment for now as the government ordered its MPs to back a review of standards investigations. \nThe result of the vote was met with cries of \"shame\" from opposition MPs.\nMr Paterson was found to have misused his position as an MP to benefit two companies he worked for.\nBut he said the probe into his conduct had been unfair - and the government backed plans by his allies to overhaul the system.\nLabour, the SNP and Lib Dems voted against the plans, along with 13 Conservative MPs, but it was carried by 18 votes after a heated Commons debate. \nIn a statement after the vote, Mr Paterson said: \"After two years of hell, I now have the opportunity to clear my name.\"\nIn an interview with the BBC, he thanked the MPs who voted for the overhaul, acknowledging they had \"taken a political hit\".\n\"But we will at last now be able to create a proper system, based on the rules of natural justice,\" he added. \nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the Conservatives of being \"rotten to the core\" and called the move an \"absolute disgrace\".\nShe said Labour would \"not be taking any part in this sham process or any corrupt committee\", with the SNP and Lib Dems also saying they would boycott the overhaul.\nThe controversy comes after a committee of MPs recommended Mr Paterson be suspended from the Commons for 30 days, following a damning report into his conduct by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone.\nThe report said the former Northern Ireland secretary had breached Commons rules by lobbying government bodies about Randox and Lynn's Country Foods, which employed him as a paid consultant.\nAfter the vote not to uphold the committee's recommendation, the BBC understands Ms Stone will not be resigning as standards commissioner.\nThe government did not order its MPs to uphold the proposed suspension, which could have led to Mr Paterson facing a by-election in his North Shropshire constituency. \nInstead, they were told to back an amendment drawn up by Tory former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom to pause his suspension and set up a new Tory-majority committee to look at how investigations are carried out.\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said MPs found to have broken the rules should get a right of appeal, as would happen with doctors and teachers found guilty of misconduct.\nBut the SNP's Pete Wishart accused the government of \"attempting to turn back the clock to the worst examples of 1990s Tory sleaze\". \nAhead of the vote, the committee's Labour chairman Chris Bryant told MPs Mr Paterson had lobbied ministers \"time and again, in a way that conferred a direct benefit on his paying clients\".\n\"That is expressly forbidden. It is a corrupt practice,\" he added.\nHe said Mr Paterson had been given \"every opportunity\" to put his case across - and his arguments had been heard \"respectfully and fairly\".\nEvery MP who backed today's move can expect to have it used against them on political leaflets or Facebook campaigns. \nThere could be serious consequences in Parliament if the opposition parties decide to use this moment to withdraw cooperation on other committees or ways of working. \nSome ministers already fear this is an episode that Downing Street may come to regret. \nOwen Paterson is adamant that he did nothing wrong, and has been denied natural justice. \nBut with this Tory response, voters may well come to wonder, what's fair about this?\nRead Laura's full blog\nThe Commons standards committee found that Mr Paterson had used his parliamentary office on 16 occasions for meetings relating to his outside business interests and sent two letters relating to business interests on House of Commons-headed notepaper.\nIt described the MP's actions as \"an egregious case of paid advocacy\".\nHowever Mr Paterson denied any wrongdoing, and argued his approaches had been within the rules because he was seeking to alert ministers to defects in safety regulations.\nHe said the investigation had \"a major contributory factor\" in the death of his wife, Rose, who took her own life last year.\nHe claimed he had been pronounced guilty \"without being spoken to\" and that \"no proper investigation was undertaken\".\nThirteen Conservatives voted against Ms Leadsom's amendment, while 98 had no vote recorded - either by a deliberate abstention or because they were not able to vote. \nTory MP Angela Richardson appeared to confirm she was no longer a parliamentary aide to ministers after defying government orders to vote for the amendment and abstaining instead.\nAs a parliamentary private secretary, she would normally be expected to resign in order to oppose the government.\nWriting on Twitter, she said: \"I abstained on the Leadsom amendment aware that my job was at risk, but it was a matter of principle for me.\"\nAaron Bell - a Tory who opposed the amendment - said the proposals made it look \"like we're moving the goalposts\" and that any reform of the rules needed support across the Commons. \nLiberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain described the amendment as a \"stitch-up\", adding: \"You expect in a tin-pot dictatorship, not the home of parliamentary democracy.\""

      "text": "What is historically the UK's longest lasting patch of snow has disappeared for \"only the eighth time in 300 years\".\nDubbed the Sphinx, the patch on remote Braeriach in the Cairngorms has melted away more frequently in the last 18 years.\nSnow patch expert Iain Cameron said climate change was a likely factor.\nAccording to records, the Sphinx previously melted fully in 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2017 and 2018.\nBefore 1933, it is thought to have last melted completely in the 1700s.\nThe Sphinx had shrunk to the size of an A4 piece of paper in recent weeks before finally disappearing in mild weather.\nStirling-based Mr Cameron has been studying snow patches in Scotland for 25 years and is author of the book The Vanishing Ice, which he describes as a \"lament\" to snow and ice that lingers high in Scotland's hills.\nHe worked alongside the late Dr Adam Watson, a biologist dubbed Mr Cairngorms because of his many years studying the mountains.\nSome of Dr Watson's research on the Sphinx drew on information handed down by generations of people who worked and visited the Cairngorms, which suggests the patch may have only melted a few times in the last 300 years.\nFrom the 1840s the Scottish Mountaineering Club began noting the fortunes of the patch, and more recently scientists and ecologists have gathered information. \nMr Cameron told BBC Scotland that historically the Sphinx was the UK's \"most durable\" snow patch.\nBut he said: \"That is being challenged because it is disappearing more often.\"\nMr Cameron said warmer weather due to climate change \"seemed to be the logical\" explanation for the increased rate of melting.\nHe added that the conditions were affecting snowy areas high on other Scottish mountains including in the Ben Nevis range in Lochaber.\nAonach Beag, near Ben Nevis, also has a patch of snow that has often survived from one winter to another.\nBut Mr Cameron said: \"What we are seeing from research are smaller and fewer patches of snow.\n\"Less snow is falling now in winter than in the 1980s and even the 1990s.\"\nSeparately from Mr Cameron's research, a report commissioned by Cairngorms National Park Authority and published last year said declining snow cover, and fewer days when it snowed had been observed on Cairngorm mountain since the winter of 1983-84.\nResearchers also noted a trend for increasingly warmer weather since the 1960s, and suggested that by the 2080s there would be some years with very little or no snow at all on Cairngorm.\nLauren McCallum, of international climate change campaign group Protect Our Winters, said the Cairngorms - and wider world - needed to be protected from further rises in temperature.\nShe said: \"We have to maintain a healthy temperature for our ecosystems and communities to survive.\"\nThe Sphinx lies in Garbh Choire Mor, a hollow known as a corrie formed by ice or a glacier during the last ice age, on 1,296m (4,252ft) Braeriach - Britain's third highest mountain.\nGarbh Choire Mor is described as Scotland's snowiest corrie because of the amount of snow it can hold even through summer months.\nThe Sphinx is the name of a climbing route near the snow patch.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Thursday.\nThe UK has \"hard months to come\" due to its current \"very high\" rate of coronavirus cases, England's deputy chief medical officer has warned. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC too many people believed the pandemic was now over. The UK recorded 41,299 Covid cases on Wednesday and 217 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nA member of the group of scientists advising the government on coronavirus has stepped down from the role. Sir Jeremy Farrar said he left the independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) so he could focus on his work as director of medical charity the Wellcome Trust. But in a statement, he warned the crisis was \"a long way from over\".\nBooster vaccines are seen as the single most important way to control Covid as we head into the winter months. From this week anyone eligible - six months after their second dose - can turn up at a walk-in centre to get their booster in England. But doctors have told the BBC that complacency, and changes to the way jabs are offered, could leave millions at greater risk of serious illness this Christmas.\nIkea will raise its prices as the disruption to global supply chains caused by coronavirus is expected to last into next year. The Swedish furniture giant saw record demand during the pandemic as people spent more time at home. But it said the biggest hit to its income came from \"the steep increase in transport and raw material prices in the second half of the financial year\". Profit was down 4% compared with 2019, before the pandemic, it said.\nRemember the local council that went viral after a fractious Zoom meeting was shared on social media during the pandemic? Well it's changed its name. Handforth Parish Council's online row made a star of stand-in clerk Jackie Weaver as the chairman Brian Tolver told her she had \"no authority here\". It's been renamed Handforth Town Council to \"move away from the toxic side of Handforth\".

      "tags": "Cities,HM Treasury,COP26,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "Most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to show how they intend to hit climate change targets, under proposed Treasury rules.\nBy 2023, they will have to set out detailed public plans for how they will move to a low-carbon future - in line with the UK's 2050 net-zero target.\nAn expert panel will set the standards the plans need to meet to ensure they are not just spin. \nAny commitments will not be mandatory. Green groups say this is not enough. \nNet zero is when a business or a country achieves an overall balance between the amount of carbon it is emitting and the carbon that it's removing from the atmosphere.\nFirms and their shareholders will be left to decide how their businesses adapt to this transition, including how they intend to decarbonise.\nAnd although the plans will need to be published, the government said \"the aim is to increase transparency and accountability\" and the UK was not \"making firm-level net-zero commitments mandatory\".\nThe market will decide whether firms' plans are credible, the Treasury said.\nSpeaking at the COP26 climate summit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the UK was leading the world in becoming the \"first-ever net zero aligned global financial centre\".\nHe said the changes would mean: \"Better and more consistent climate data; sovereign green bonds; mandatory sustainability disclosures; proper climate risk surveillance; and proper global reporting standards.\"\nIn total, 450 firms controlling 40% of global financial assets - equivalent to $130tn (\u00a395tn) - have agreed to commit to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nHowever, campaign group Global Witness said that without regulation the pledges were \"doomed to fail\".\n\"Banks and financiers are the lifeblood of the fossil fuel companies and destructive agribusinesses fuelling the climate crisis - so it's right that focus should be on them at COP26. \n\"However, today's announcement by banks risks amounting to more greenwashing if it's not legally binding,\" said Veronica Oakeshott, head of forests policy and advocacy at Global Witness.\nDavid Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, said the intention was positive, but that financial firms were still \"pouring billions into environmentally harmful projects.\"\nMark Campanale, founder and executive chair of Carbon Tracker Initiative, praised the ambition of the plans, but said details of how it would work were still unclear.\n\"None of the financial assets announced are currently aligned with net-zero and no group of companies can say they are meeting the Paris target by continuing to invest in fossil fuels, so that needs to change considerably before London can be lauded as the world's first net-zero financial centre and a model for the world,\" he said.\nShaun Spiers, executive director of environmental think tank Green Alliance, said that more UK public sector funding was needed. \n\"Private sector investment is vital, but it will be much easier to achieve on the back of serious investment by the chancellor,\" he said.\nHowever, a coalition of finance groups led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said there was enough finance committed to keep global warming to 1.5C.\nThe Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) said more than $130trn (\u00a395trn) of private capital \"is now committed to transforming the economy for net zero\".\nIn practice, this means that bank loans which would go to an oil field, or a coal mine, are diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes.\nBank bosses will also be expected to have tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. \nUnder the proposed Treasury rules, financial institutions and companies with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange must come up with net-zero transition plans, which will be published from 2023.\nThe strategies will need to include targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and steps which firms intend to take to get there.\nA taskforce made up of industry leaders, academics, regulators and civil society groups will set a science-based \"gold standard\" for the plans in order to guard against so-called \"greenwashing\" - where environmental initiatives are more about marketing than substance.\nHowever, the government said there was \"not yet a commonly agreed standard for what a good quality transition plan looks like\".\nMeanwhile, Mr Sunak also pledged that a target for developed countries to send $100bn (\u00a3720m) a year to those that are less developed - to help support their transition to net zero - will be achieved by 2023. \nAlison Rose, chief executive of Natwest, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the bank had started measuring the emissions on its balance sheet to help it track progress, saying \"transparency was critical\".\nShe said the bank was working with the oil and gas industry \"to develop credible transition plans so we can track progress and work with our customers\".\nBut Ms Rose said its main focus was helping small firms where there were \"real business opportunities\" in \"adopting sustainable supply chain [and] sustainable business practices\".\nKay Swinburne, vice-chairman of financial services at KPMG UK, said the announcement on UK firms would provide the financial services industry with a \"valuable set of unified metrics to measure progress towards decarbonisation\". \n\"It is brave to put a gold standard in place for all companies raising funding,\" she added.  \nAnd Dr Ben Caldecott, director of the UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment, said the plans would \"spur demand for green finance and accelerate decarbonisation, not just in the UK but wherever UK firms do business\".\nFollow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130tn, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C.\nThis means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from \"brown holdings\" of investments in coal, oil and gas. \nBut can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. \nBy changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord."

      "text": "The reintroduction of some Covid-19 restrictions cannot be ruled out, the health minister has said.\nHowever, Robin Swann said he and his executive colleagues would do \"all that we can\" to avoid another lockdown.\nLast month Mr Swann said Northern Ireland was \"facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced\".\nEmergency departments reported high numbers of patients over the weekend, with one patient at the Ulster Hospital waiting 44 hours to be admitted.\nMany hospitals are currently operating over capacity.\nOn Sunday nightclubs reopened in Northern Ireland and legal requirements on social distancing were also scrapped.\nPeople can now move around venues and stand to have a drink or eat food, and face coverings are not required when customers are dancing.\nSpeaking to Good Morning Ulster, Mr Swann encouraged people to keep coming forward for vaccination.\n\"I hope that we don't get into a position where we have to go down the lengths of a further lockdown,\" he said.\n\"Will we have to look at further restrictions? Possibly. But I'll always take that advice from the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser in regards to where we are.\"\nMr Swann added that a lockdown would be a \"detrimental step that I wouldn't want to recommend\" but \"having to downturn services again\" is also something the health minister does not want see happen.\n\"We must realise we are seeing levels of pressure that we have never seen before,\" he said.\n\"That's why we're pushing the vaccination programme as much as we can to get people to still come forward to get their first vaccine and their second vaccine and their booster programme.\" \nMr Swann said the shortage of front-line staff was a result of years of underinvestment in Northern Ireland's health service.\n\"As we see that increase in pressure across all our service areas and all our trust areas we are working to mitigate them as best we can,\" he said.\n\"But we have limited staff to be able to do that, so it really is about working in partnership with the general public.\"\nHe added: \"I don't have enough nurses, I don't have enough doctors, I'm on record saying that.\n\"Unfortunately it's not about producing staff out of nowhere, we can't do that. \n\"So it's about supporting the current staff that we have, doing the job they are doing.\"\nJenny Nicholson, lead emergency department nurse at the Ulster Hospital, told Good Morning Ulster about the pressure facing front-line healthcare workers.\n\"We have 76 in our department at the moment and 57 of those patients are waiting on a hospital ward bed.\n\"Forty-seven of those patients are waiting more than 12 hours and we do have one patient who has been waiting 58 hours.\n\"This is really exceptional, we don't often have patients waiting that long, but over the last few days we have seen sustained pressure and over the last couple of weeks, it has been sustained pressure now for some time.\n\"Staff are working extremely hard, they're under a lot of pressure, extreme pressure daily, they're going home exhausted and, yes, we have seen some of our staff in tears.\n\"Staff are staying on after their shifts to try and help their colleagues on the incoming shifts, they are picking up extra shifts - they're just working above and beyond, doing everything they can and they are exhausted.\"\nMr Swann said that he would consider again asking the military for medical staff if needs be.\n\"I'm quite content to ask for them and it is something we currently keep under review,\" he said.\n\"But it also depends on the Ministry of Defence as well, it's not a standing pool of people that we can utilise all the time, they are there when they are available.\"\nThe health minister acknowledged there had been a slow start to the booster vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, but said he expected it to pick up pace.  \n\"I think our vaccine programme and the people working on it actually should be commended for the work they have done with a vaccine that only became available less than 11 months ago,\" he said\n\"Our booster programme had been slow to start, but when you listen both to community pharmacies and GPs, it's a programme that's well in place, it's a programme that's actually ramping up as well.\n\"I would encourage people to come forward and not just get their booster vaccine but actually get their first and second doses as well.\"\nDolores McCormick, associate director at the Royal College of Nursing, said some of the extra money being allocated to the health service should go to boosting staff levels.\n\"If we're to fix this absolute crisis that we're all facing at this minute in time, it's staff that we need,\" she said\n\"We can't create staff overnight, we've got over 2,700 nursing vacancies posts across the health and social care system and a similar percentage probably in the nursing home sector.\n\"We're haemorrhaging staff, some of that money needs to be spent on how we retain that staff.\""

What data is at stake? Does it include financial details or other sensitive information?\nNo doubt IT teams will be in full crisis mode trying to assess how bad the hack is.\nThey are also not saying what type of attack it is, but the statement makes it pretty clear that it is likely to be a ransomware attack.\nWhich means, someone, somewhere is demanding a ransom in exchange for safe return of the databases they have taken control of.\nLike thousands of organisations in the last year, Labour - or rather the company that stores its data - is faced with the horrendous and controversial decision - to pay or not to pay cyber criminals.\nA spokesman for the NCSC said: \"We are aware of this issue and are working with the Labour Party to fully investigate and mitigate any potential impact.\n\"We would urge anyone who thinks they may have been the victim of a data breach to be especially vigilant against suspicious emails, phone calls or text messages and to follow the steps set out in our data breaches guidance.\""

Director Joel Souza was injured.\nA police investigation is under way, with the Santa Fe county sheriff saying there had been \"some complacency\" in how weapons were handled.\nOther crew members have criticised the safety measures, with chief electrician Serge Svetnoy writing on Facebook that he blamed \"negligence and unprofessionalism\" for the tragedy.\nIt has also emerged that some crew members walked off set before the accident in a dispute over accommodation and hours.\nDavis said the team had \"several safety meetings, sometimes multiple per day\", and that \"concerns were heard and addressed\".\nAccidental discharges are \"more common than you think\", she added.\nDavis defended the film's weapons expert, armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who handed the gun to assistant director David Halls before he gave it to Baldwin.\nRust was Reed's second film in the role. \"How do you suppose anyone will get that experience? We all had a first and second job at one point or another,\" Davis wrote.\nOn Wednesday, Reed's lawyer suggested the incident was an act of \"sabotage\".\n\"We're afraid that could have been what happened here, that somebody intended to sabotage this set with a live round intentionally placed in a box of dummies,\" Jason Bowles told ABC TV's Good Morning America.\n\"We're not saying anybody had any intent there was going to be a tragedy of homicide, but they wanted to do something to cause a safety incident on set. That's what we believe happened.\"\nMeanwhile, Davis also refused to criticise Halls, writing: \"Our AD [assistant director] never seemed flippant about safety... I won't jump on the bandwagon and pretend that he was uncaring about our safety the whole way through.\"\nEarlier this week, Halls said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the death of Hutchins.\n\"It's my hope that this tragedy prompts the industry to re-evaluate its values and practices to ensure no one is harmed through the creative process again,\" he added.\nHalls had shouted \"cold gun\", indicating it was safe, before handing it to Baldwin, according to court documents.\nDavis said she would fight for live guns never to be allowed on film sets again in Hutchins's name.\nShe added her voice to dozens of Hollywood's most prominent cinematographers, who have this week called on the industry to \"ban all functional firearms on set\".\nGreig Fraser (who has worked on Dune), Rachel Morrison (Black Panther), Mandy Walker (Mulan) and Alice Brooks (In the Heights) were among 200 people to have signed a statement.\n\"We vow to no longer put ourselves and our crew in these unnecessarily lethal situations,\" it read. \"We have safe alternatives in VFX [visual effects] and non-functional firearms.\n\"We won't wait for the industry to change. We have a duty to effect change within the industry ourselves.\"\nProduction on Rust has been halted indefinitely while authorities investigate the shooting.

      "text": "The reintroduction of some Covid-19 restrictions cannot be ruled out, the health minister has said.\nHowever, Robin Swann said he and his executive colleagues would do \"all that we can\" to avoid another lockdown.\nLast month Mr Swann said Northern Ireland was \"facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced\".\nEmergency departments reported high numbers of patients over the weekend, with one patient at the Ulster Hospital waiting 44 hours to be admitted.\nMany hospitals are currently operating over capacity.\nOn Sunday nightclubs reopened in Northern Ireland and legal requirements on social distancing were also scrapped.\nPeople can now move around venues and stand to have a drink or eat food, and face coverings are not required when customers are dancing.\nSpeaking to Good Morning Ulster, Mr Swann encouraged people to keep coming forward for vaccination.\n\"I hope that we don't get into a position where we have to go down the lengths of a further lockdown,\" he said.\n\"Will we have to look at further restrictions? Possibly. But I'll always take that advice from the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser in regards to where we are.\"\nMr Swann added that a lockdown would be a \"detrimental step that I wouldn't want to recommend\" but \"having to downturn services again\" is also something the health minister does not want see happen.\n\"We must realise we are seeing levels of pressure that we have never seen before,\" he said.\n\"That's why we're pushing the vaccination programme as much as we can to get people to still come forward to get their first vaccine and their second vaccine and their booster programme.\" \nMr Swann said the shortage of front-line staff was a result of years of underinvestment in Northern Ireland's health service.\n\"As we see that increase in pressure across all our service areas and all our trust areas we are working to mitigate them as best we can,\" he said.\n\"But we have limited staff to be able to do that, so it really is about working in partnership with the general public.\"\nHe added: \"I don't have enough nurses, I don't have enough doctors, I'm on record saying that.\n\"Unfortunately it's not about producing staff out of nowhere, we can't do that. \n\"So it's about supporting the current staff that we have, doing the job they are doing.\"\nJenny Nicholson, lead emergency department nurse at the Ulster Hospital, told Good Morning Ulster about the pressure facing front-line healthcare workers.\n\"We have 76 in our department at the moment and 57 of those patients are waiting on a hospital ward bed.\n\"Forty-seven of those patients are waiting more than 12 hours and we do have one patient who has been waiting 58 hours.\n\"This is really exceptional, we don't often have patients waiting that long, but over the last few days we have seen sustained pressure and over the last couple of weeks, it has been sustained pressure now for some time.\n\"Staff are working extremely hard, they're under a lot of pressure, extreme pressure daily, they're going home exhausted and, yes, we have seen some of our staff in tears.\n\"Staff are staying on after their shifts to try and help their colleagues on the incoming shifts, they are picking up extra shifts - they're just working above and beyond, doing everything they can and they are exhausted.\"\nMr Swann said that he would consider again asking the military for medical staff if needs be.\n\"I'm quite content to ask for them and it is something we currently keep under review,\" he said.\n\"But it also depends on the Ministry of Defence as well, it's not a standing pool of people that we can utilise all the time, they are there when they are available.\"\nThe health minister acknowledged there had been a slow start to the booster vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, but said he expected it to pick up pace.  \n\"I think our vaccine programme and the people working on it actually should be commended for the work they have done with a vaccine that only became available less than 11 months ago,\" he said\n\"Our booster programme had been slow to start, but when you listen both to community pharmacies and GPs, it's a programme that's well in place, it's a programme that's actually ramping up as well.\n\"I would encourage people to come forward and not just get their booster vaccine but actually get their first and second doses as well.\"\nDolores McCormick, associate director at the Royal College of Nursing, said some of the extra money being allocated to the health service should go to boosting staff levels.\n\"If we're to fix this absolute crisis that we're all facing at this minute in time, it's staff that we need,\" she said\n\"We can't create staff overnight, we've got over 2,700 nursing vacancies posts across the health and social care system and a similar percentage probably in the nursing home sector.\n\"We're haemorrhaging staff, some of that money needs to be spent on how we retain that staff.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Agriculture,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "UK meat producers have started sending carcasses to the EU for butchering before re-importing them as they continue to combat a labour shortage. \nThe British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) say producers are sending beef to the Republic of Ireland amid local shortages of butchers. \nMeanwhile, pork producers are set to begin sending pigs to the Netherlands for butchering and packing.\nMeat exported in this way cannot be labelled as British pork for UK sale.\nAccording to the BMPA, the move will cost an additional \u00a31,500 for each lorry load of carcasses. This includes transport fees, as well as Brexit customs requirements, such as an export health certificate for each consignment.\nMeat exported from the UK currently undergoes checks in the EU, however, the introduction of post-Brexit import controls on food and animals products in the UK has been delayed until July 2022.\n\"It is what needs to be done to counteract the problem,\" a spokesperson for BMPA told the BBC. \nThe move - which was first reported by the Financial Times - comes after post-Brexit staff shortages, and a lack of capacity at abattoirs, have led to the culling of more than 10,000 healthy pigs so far.\nA shortage of skilled workers, as well as exporting issues, Covid-19, and reduced demand from China, has left the sector with a growing backlog of pork, of which the UK is a significant exporter. \nStaffing levels are reported to be at least 15% below the normal level.\nThe BMPA said: \"Immigration rules need to be relaxed so we can get experienced people without having to train them to help solve the immediate short-term problem.\n\"Then we need to be attracting, recruiting, and training people in the UK. This is not an instant fix, however, as we are looking at 18 months or longer to train these people.\n\"The government also needs to add key level courses to the support they have already given. As far as we can see there are no food related courses, or they are not the ones we need.\"\nMeanwhile, National Farmers Union vice president Tom Bradshaw said: \"Farm businesses have done all they can to recruit staff domestically, but even increasingly competitive wages have had little impact because the labour pool is so limited.\"\n\"A short term Covid Recovery Visa, alongside a permanent Seasonal Workers Scheme, would be an effective and, frankly, vital route to help the pressing needs of the industry today. It would also give us time to invest in the skills and recruitment of our domestic workforce.\"\nLast month, the UK government agreed to issue 800 temporary visas for skilled overseas butchers to work in Britain for six months. However, farmers and meat processors, who are waiting for them to arrive, do not expect them before the end of November.\nNick Allen, chief executive of the BMPA said: \"We have been saying we are between 10,000 and 12,000 short of these types of workers, 800 doesn't go very far, it has been made very clear it is only for six months and they go again.\"\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) refused to comment on the number of applications they had received so far.\nThe government also pledged to fund cold storage for carcasses, while the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board has launched a cull and render scheme, dedicating a plant to the disposal of animals. \nBut farmers have criticised the move as not being enough, or not providing a long-term solution, raising concerns about the supply of a number of popular Christmas food products such as pigs in blankets.\n\"We are in limbo,\" Zoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pig Association, said. \"Some processors are saying they won't come until mid-December, and some are worried some won't come at all as it is just before Christmas.\"\n\"Butchers are the most meaningful thing we can have. If we get them on the floor we will start moving more pigs.\"\nShe told the BBC: \"Sadly this whole situation could have been avoided if the government had acted sooner. While the package of measures announced in October was very welcome, we have yet to see any benefit and even if the measures operate as intended, it will be some time before any meaningful impact is seen on farms. \n\"For many this will come too late.\""

      "text": "Some large UK businesses will have to start disclosing their environmental impact, under new rules set to be brought in by the Treasury. \nThe requirements will also apply to investment products and pension schemes. \nIt comes ahead of November's COP26 meeting in Glasgow, where world leaders will discuss their climate commitments.\nExperts say the UK, which is hosting the event, is  not currently on track to meet its own emissions targets.\nBoris Johnson has pledged to cut emissions by 78% by 2035, compared with 1990 levels. \nThe Treasury said the new sustainability disclosure requirements (SDR) mean an investment product will now have to set out the environmental impact of the activities it finances. \nIn addition, a company's sustainability claims will have to be justified \"clearly\", and their net zero transition plans properly set out.\nThe aim is to combat \"greenwashing\", where firms make misleading claims about their environmental commitments.\nBut the government said the information will \"only be impactful\" if customers and investors actually use it. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"We want sustainability to be a key component of investment decisions, and our plans will arm investors with the right information to make more environmentally-led decisions.\"\nHe said the rules will \"set new global standards for sustainability that will boost the economy, protect the planet and support our net zero goals\". \nIt is unclear when the rules will come in, or what will happen to firms that do not comply. Details of the specific reporting requirements will only be developed after a public consultation.  \nMr Sunak first mentioned SDRs in July and has announced these next stages for the requirements in the report: \"Greening Finance: A Roadmap to Sustainable Investing\".\nSam Alvis, from the Green Alliance think tank, said it was a \"positive step in greening the private sector\". \n\"While new green finance is vital, stopping money going into environmentally destructive investments is key. The upcoming spending review is an opportunity for the chancellor to apply the same rules for public spending,\" he added. \nRain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said greater clarity on environmental impact \"will help investors channel finance into projects that are aligned with net zero targets and will reduce carbon emissions across our economy\". \nBut Heather McKay from E3G, an independent climate change think tank, told the BBC the government would need to send clear signals about \"what is green and what is not\" to ensure companies really change how they operate. \nShe said this would be a \"crucial step\" to tackling greenwashing. \nWithout the right information available, Jessica Fries, chairman of Accounting for Sustainability said that investors and pension funds have made decisions \"in the dark\".\n\"As a global centre of finance, it will be important that the recommendations align with emerging requirements globally,\" Ms Fries added. \nBarbara Davidson, of think tank Carbon Tracker, said better enforcement of current accounting requirements was also required to combat greenwashing. \n\"Without this, investors do not have the requisite information about the effects of climate change for their decision-making,\" she said. \nBoris Johnson's government is currently on track to cut only about a fifth of UK emissions by 2035, compared with 1990s levels, according to a group of experts that advises the government."

The UK government said that claim was \"incorrect\".\nPlaid Cymru called for a needs-based funding formula administered by the Welsh government. \nWales received \u00a3375m every year under the old EU arrangements aimed at helping poor regions.\nThe cash is being slowly phased out, with most of it ending next year.\nA full list is at the UK government website.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak has said that over time the UK government will match EU funding of \u00a31.5bn a year.\nIt is planning a new Shared Prosperity Fund (SPF), expecting to roll out from April 2022, and the Treasury has pledged it will \"at least\" match EU funding for the poorest region.\nThe \u00a3200m Community Renewal Fund has been launched as a pilot for the SPF, with England receiving \u00a3123m, Wales \u00a346m, Scotland \u00a318m and Northern Ireland \u00a312m.\nWales will get most funding per head, while in England the South West region will receive the largest sum.\nBut the CRF has been criticised for not giving Wales and other devolved governments a say in how it is spent.\nThe Welsh government had administered EU cash, and some of the money is used to fund apprenticeships and the Development Bank for Wales.\nMinisters have claimed that there could be 5,300 fewer apprenticeship placements supported every year if the money was not fully replaced.\nHowever, in turn, the Conservative Welsh secretary has claimed Wales had spent some EU money on \"vanity projects\".\nUK Secretary of State for Levelling Up Michael Gove said:\u202f\u202f \"We are determined to unite and level up our whole United Kingdom.\n\"The projects we are supporting today, from Wrexham to Caerphilly, will help communities across Wales realise their full potential, create new opportunities for the future and help us achieve net zero carbon emissions.\"\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"Throughout the Brexit debate, the UK government gave repeated assurances Wales would not lose 'a single penny' of EU funding should the UK exit the EU. \n\"Today's announcement by the UK government shows they are short-changing Wales by cutting the replacement funding we were promised.\n\"Instead of Wales receiving at least \u00a3375m annually in new money to invest from January this year, it confirms Wales will receive just \u00a346m. This is not \"levelling up\", it's levelling down.\n\"It is yet another clear demonstration the people of Wales have been misled by the UK government.\" \nPlaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts MP said Wales a whole was losing out \"by forcing local authorities to fight among each other for a smaller pot of money\".\n\"There is still an opportunity for the UK government to match its 'levelling up' rhetoric with action by committing to a needs-based funding formula for the Shared Prosperity Fund, administered by our devolved government in Wales.\"\nA UK government spokesperson said the Welsh government's claims were \"incorrect\". \n\"The EU structural fund programme will continue until December 2023 and the \u00a3200mn UK Community Renewal Fund [UKCRF] announced today is in addition to it.\n\"The UKCRF will help local areas prepare for the UK Shared Prosperity Fund in 2022, the scheme that will see UK-wide funding at least match EU money - reaching around \u00a31.5bn a year.\"\nThe Welsh government is standing by the figures it has highlighted."

      "tags": "University of Exeter,Merthyr Tydfil,Welsh government,Julie James,Coal mining",
      "text": "An early-warning system to detect movement in disused coal tips should be \"essential\", an expert has said.\nRemote monitors - used to pick up volcanic activity and tsunamis - would sense landslips and raise the alarm.\nPeople living nearby would also receive these alerts straight to their mobiles, according to Prof Karen Hudson-Edwards.\nClimate Change Minister Julie James said the Welsh government has been testing technology to issue such alerts via a mobile app.\nProf Hudson-Edwards, adviser in the Law Commission review into coal tips, said extra measures should be in place.\n\"Given that we had Aberfan in 1966 and the spill in Tylorstown last year, that thankfully didn't kill anybody, I believe such a system would be essential in Wales,\" she said.\n\"In a sense these are natural disasters, even though the coal tips are man and women-made.\n\"We definitely have things to learn from volcanoes because we often see a lot of landslide and debris from volcanos.\"\nProf Hudson-Edwards said probes should be added to the face of coal tips to monitor any sudden changes in temperature or movement, while satellite imaging would also be essential.\nAuthorities in Wales are currently trialling remote monitoring devices on a small number of higher risk tips and began using satellite imaging in September. \n\"We could actually map the locations of different land uses, like buildings and housing or schools and agricultural land,\" said Prof Hudson-Edwards, of the Camborne School of Mines at Exeter University.\n\"We can link that to where the coal tips are and work out what the path would be of any spilled material if there was to be a failure.\n\"In the mining industry we've talked about putting in warning systems for towns.\n\"You could definitely have a system that uses a phone app or even just a normal phone, where if you are monitoring a tip and you get the feeling it might be going, you could have evacuation plans and that kind of system in place.\"\nUsing Coal Authority data, the Welsh government estimates more than 40% of all UK coal tips are in Wales, with about one in seven classed as high risk.\nA recent study prompted by the landslide at Tylorstown, where 60,000 tonnes of debris collapsed from a former tip after heavy rain, identified 2,456 disused tips in Wales, with 327 in higher-risk categories.\nScientists have warned the safety of coal tips is affected by climate change and have predicted south Wales would face more \"extreme weather\" in the future. \nThe Welsh government wants the UK government to fund work to repurpose, reclaim and remediate tips. \nBut Westminster said the Welsh government was \"more than adequately funded\" to foot the bill, which could be as much as \u00a3600m over the next 15 years.\nAround 70% of coal tips in Wales are privately owned, meaning installing a nationwide warning system would be complicated and likely require negotiating with a large number of landowners. \nThe Welsh government released a council-by-council breakdown of where Wales' old coal tips are, but has not yet revealed the precise location of the tips despite pressure from opposition parties and residents.  \nScientists have also suggested computer modelling could be used to help predict increased rainfall and flooding events near coal tips. \nThe Welsh government and councils have previously raised concerns that climate change and extreme weather could increase the possibility of tips becoming unstable.\n\"Arguably we're seeing some of the effects of climate change now,\" said Prof Patrick Foster, who is involved in an EU-funded project looking at the impact of extreme weather events on coal mines. \n\"There's no doubt that we are having more intense weather events in terms of precipitation. That resulted in the events we saw last year at Tylorstown and Skewen.\"\nProf Foster said it was difficult to predict precise changes in rainfall, but studies had suggested a 6% increase during winters in south Wales by the 2050s - and he added increased rainfall could weaken tips and lead to \"instability issues\".\n\"We've seen what can happen with tip stability and flooding with extreme weather events in recent times,\" he said. \n\"If that trend continues then we want to do as much as possible to stop events like that from happening again.\"\nClimate change minister Ms James told Wales Live she hoped the early warning system would never have to be used, but it was important that people didn't \"live in fear\" of sudden landslips.\n\"We've been doing the tech tests that we need to make sure we've got the right equipment on the right tips,\" she said. \n\"That it detects the right kinds of issues and that we have the right kinds of alerts for people, so they get the information they need, but not information that's unduly alarmist.\n\"Hopefully, there will never be a problem because we are putting in the mitigation measures to make sure we don't have slips and movement. But we want people to be alerted if there is a problem.\"\nThe Welsh government hopes to publish data about coal tip locations in the first half of 2022.\nMs James acknowledged that insurance and housing could potentially be affected for some people.\n\"We will be looking to see what we can do with the insurance industry, [such as] speaking to people, as we do for floods, to make sure we have the right schemes.\n\"We are very aware that people need to have the right information at the right time.\""

I didn't do that. \n\"My recollection is that a flick of a switch happened and I recognised that I needed to eject immediately. \u00a0\n\"I recall saying a swearing word and then I didn't say eject more than once from what I remember.\n\"I think my instinct at the time is that if I had said eject twice, I probably wouldn't have survived.\"\nHe said he took \"no pride\" in having survived. He said he had \"perceived that the aircraft was going to crash and to a degree instinct took over\".\u00a0\nHe said it was his \"eternal regret\" the ejection system for both seats had not been controlled from his seat as pilot, as he could have taken Cpl Bayliss out with him.\u00a0\nAsked if he thought Cpl Bayliss, who was born in Dartford, Kent, would have realised the danger, he replied: \"I don't think\u00a0Jon\u00a0could have perceived that risk.\"\nEarlier, he was asked if he was satisfied if Jon Bayliss would have known how to operate the ejection system.\n\"I am satisfied that Jon would have known the practicalities of how to perform the ejection procedure and the action of pulling the ejector seat handle,\" Flt Lt Stark said. \u00a0\n\"What's not quantifiable is the speed at which that would be done.\u00a0That's not something I can assess, nor can I perceive his seeing the need to do so without a full command to eject.\"\nHe was asked about the warning systems, or lack of them, on Hawk T 1 jets.\nFlt Lt Stark said the aircraft dated from the 1970s and didn't have the same safety measures of more modern aircraft, but pilots were aware of this.\nIn 2019, a Service Inquiry Panel (SIP) investigation found the pilot was almost certainly fatigued and distracted during the incident.\nHe was asked if a call from the control tower at Valley, as he performed the ill-fated manoeuvre, had distracted him but he said his priority at the time would have been checking his position and gauges in the cock-pit.\n\"I have no issue with the radio call. I would hate for anyone to think that air traffic control shouldn't have made that call.\u00a0I understand why they did.\"\nThe hearing continues."

      "tags": "Genetics",
      "text": "The puzzle of why humans are growing taller and reaching puberty earlier than ever before can be explained by a sensor in the brain, scientists say.\nAverage height in the UK rose by 3.9in (10cm) during the 20th Century, and up to 7.8in in other countries, as nutritional health improved.\nBut exactly how this happens has never been understood.\nThe discovery could lead to drugs to improve muscle mass and treat delayed growth, UK researchers say.\nScientists have known for a long time that humans with good diets and reliable access to food tend to grow taller, and mature more quickly. \nIn South Korea, for example, adult height has rocketed as the nation transformed from a poor country to a developed society. Yet in parts of South Asia and Africa, people are only slightly taller than 100 years ago.\nIt's known that signals from food reach a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, telling it about the body's nutritional health, and triggering growth.\nThis new study, published in Nature, and led by researchers from the University of Cambridge alongside teams from Queen Mary University of London, University of Bristol, University of Michigan and Vanderbilt University, has discovered the brain receptor behind that process.\nIt's called MC3R and is the crucial link between food and sex development and growth. \n\"It tells the body we're great here, we've got lots of food, so grow quickly, have puberty soon and make lots of babies,\" said Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, study author, from Cambridge.\n\"It's not just magic - we have the complete wiring diagram for how it happens.\" \nWhen the brain receptor doesn't work normally in humans, the researchers found people tended to be shorter in height, and started puberty later than other people.\nThe team searched through the genetic make-up of half a million volunteers signed up to the UK Biobank - a huge database of genetic and health information - to confirm this was true.\nChildren found to have gene mutations which disrupt the brain receptor, were all shorter and weighed less than other children, which shows the effect starts early in life.\nThe research team found one person who had mutations in both copies of the gene for MC3R, which is extremely rare and damaging. This person was very short, and started puberty after the age of 20.\nBut humans are not alone in this - researchers studied mice to confirm that the same pathway is at work in animals.\nThe discovery could help children with serious delays in growth and puberty, as well as those who become frail with chronic diseases and need to build up muscle.\n\"Future research should investigate if drugs that selectively activate the MC3R might help redirect calories into muscle and other lean tissues, with the prospect of improving the physical functionality of such patients,\" Prof O'Rahilly said.\nScientists had already identified a brain receptor which controls appetite, called MC4R, and those who lack it are usually obese.\nThere is a ceiling for height and it's reached when people achieve their genetic potential.\nFactors such as health and diet have a huge impact on whether that happens.\nWhen children from poorer families get enough food and calories, they can grow to the height they inherit from their parents and grandparents.\nTaller people generally live longer and are less likely to suffer from heart problems, and may also end up earning more.\nBut humans can't keep on growing forever.\nLike many other countries in Europe, average height in the UK shot up during the last century - but there are signs in the last 10 years that it's flattening.\nElsewhere, the largest height rises over the past century have been in South Korean women and Iranian men.\nThe tallest people in the world are men born in the Netherlands (71.8in), while the shortest are women born in Guatemala (55.1in)."

      "tags": "New Jersey,New York City,Virginia,Boston,United States",
      "text": "Republican Glenn Youngkin has been elected as Virginia's next governor in a major upset, with his Democratic opponent conceding the race. \nThe ballot has been widely seen as a referendum on Joe Biden's presidency, and defeat will unnerve the Democrats. \nHe won by 10 points in Virginia in the presidential election just a year ago.\nBut rising inflation, a slow economic recovery, a deadlocked legislative agenda and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan have hit his popularity.\nIn a speech to cheering supporters, Mr Youngkin promised to get to work straight away to transform the state. \n\"We work in real people time, not government time,\" the Republican declared.\nMr McAuliffe served as governor from 2014-18. His opinion poll lead vanished in recent weeks, and in a statement after his loss said he had \"come up short\" but insisted the state remained on a path towards \"inclusion, openness and tolerance for all\".\nThe state's current, Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, was unable to stand for re-election as Virginia does not allow governors to serve consecutive terms in office. \nIn more potential good news for Virginia Republicans, their candidate, former US Marine Winsome Sears, is tipped to become the first black female lieutenant governor of the state, which was the former seat of the pro-slavery Confederacy during the American Civil War.\nThe Republican candidate for Virginia attorney general, Cuban American Jason Miyares, was also leading that vote count. And Republicans seemed to be closing in on control of the state's House of Delegates.\nIn other elections across the US on Tuesday:\nIn Boston, Asian-American candidate Michelle Wu was elected mayor, becoming the first woman and first person of colour to take the post.\n\"One of my sons asked me the other night if boys can be elected mayor of Boston,\" the Democrat told supporters. \"They have been, and they will again some day, but not tonight.\"\nMr Youngkin is the first member of his party elected to statewide office in Virginia since 2009.\nThe political newcomer focused during the bitterly fought election on crime and the economy, as well as how schools handle race, gender and mask mandates.\nMr McAuliffe campaigned on other cultural issues, such as abortion rights and voting reform.\nBut the Democrat's critics hammered him for saying during a debate: \"I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\"\nAccording to exit polls by the BBC's US partner, CBS, education and the school curriculum were top issues for slightly more than half of all voters. \nAt a news conference earlier on Tuesday, Mr Biden predicted his party would win the first major election since he took office 10 months ago, but he acknowledged \"the off-year is always unpredictable\".\nThe Democratic president's approval rating has fallen to 43%, according to an opinion poll average by RealClearPolitics.\nThe McAuliffe campaign tried to liken the challenger to former President Donald Trump, who remains unpopular in Virginia.\nBut Mr Youngkin, a mild-mannered private equity tycoon, sought to appeal to moderates by keeping Mr Trump at arm's length, while tapping into the former president's supporters in the state.\nHis balancing act may offer a template for Republicans seeking to win back suburban moderate voters who were turned off by Mr Trump's firebrand style of politics.\nThe race could shape party messaging and battle-plans for next year's mid-term elections, when the Democrats will defend their wafer-thin majorities in Congress, and the 2024 White House election.\nMr Trump thanked his supporters for \"coming out in force and voting for Glenn Youngkin\", saying the MAGA movement was \"bigger and stronger than ever before\".\nBy Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Fairfax, Virginia\nThe restaurant was crowded, with people angling for the best place to watch election returns on big screens, with American flags everywhere. \nThey had gathered hoping to see Glenn Youngkin win.\nOver the past several months, he has charted a course for conservatives - he talks frequently about race relations, and has denounced the teaching of critical race theory. \nHe ran on a law-and-order platform, and opposed mask mandates, and his messaging echoed the kind that Mr Trump uses. But Mr Youngkin kept his distance from the former president. \nIn this way, Mr Youngkin has appealed to voters who like Mr Trump's positions, but are uneasy about the man himself. \nHis win is likely to guide other conservatives in their campaigns for the congressional midterms."

      "text": "A new app which allows users to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination status within Northern Ireland has been launched by the health department.\nThe Covid Cert Check NI app will facilitate \"voluntary use\" of vaccine checks in hospitality and entertainment venues.\nThe department has also updated its COVIDCert NI app which allows people travelling abroad to prove vaccination. \nIt can now be updated to show the \"domestic use\" certificate. \nThe apps are free to download and can be used on smartphones and tablet computers.\nCurrently people in Northern Ireland are not required to prove their vaccination status in order to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.\nHowever Stormont ministers recently published a contingency plan which referred to the \"potential\" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in \"higher risk settings\".\nIt is one of a number of contingency measures which could be introduced over the winter if ministers feel such checks are necessary. \n\"Decisions on whether domestic certification would be introduced on a compulsory basis in Northern Ireland settings will rest with the Northern Ireland Executive,\" the department said in a statement. \nIt added that the new Cert Check NI app would be \"more user-friendly and reliable than using the printed vaccination cards to prove you have had both jabs\".\nThe earlier COVIDCert NI app was launched in July, in response to changes in international travel rules.\nSince then, more than 228,500 vaccine certificates have been issued to its Northern Ireland users.\nNow, people who have already downloaded the existing COVIDCert NI app for international travel will be given an option to activate their \"domestic certificate\".\nTo use this new feature, they will have to take a selfie photo with their phone or tablet computer which is then \"locked into the app\".\nThe purpose of adding the selfie is to prevent abuse of the system and it also avoids users having to present separate photo ID when they use the COVIDCert NI app as proof of vaccination status.\nThe department said users' selfie photos will stay on their device within the app but the image is \"not shared with or collected by anyone else\". \n\"Citizens are encouraged to download the app, and ensure that they have the necessary certificates downloaded, should they wish to present them,\" the statement said. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the app showed \"just how easy it would be to introduce mandatory vaccination certification across all our hospitality and entertainment businesses\".\nHe said while many businesses may choose to use the app, the decision should have been made at Stormont to protect the health service.\n\"The SDLP will continue to push for vaccine certification,\" he added.\nWhile it is not mandatory, Northern Ireland now has a Covid-19 certificate which can be used in domestic and social settings. \nIt looks a lot more professional than the current blue card that hardly resembles anything official. \nIt is available and good to go, but only on a voluntary basis. \nHowever, it does pave the way for the Northern Ireland Executive to introduce compulsory checks at the flick of a switch if and when it is required, for instance post-Christmas when health officials might need to call for greater control over the hospitality industry. \nThat might need to happen if the health service becomes overwhelmed, and by making vaccine certification checks mandatory it could mean avoiding another lockdown. \nThe new app was developed to assist Northern Ireland-based organisations to check their customers' vaccination status and can be scanned by participating venues."

      "tags": "Universities,University of Sussex,LGBT",
      "text": "A university professor accused of transphobia for her views on gender identity has said protests against her were like a \"terrible anxiety dream\".\nIn a BBC interview, Kathleen Stock, who rejects the claim, said she quit her University of Sussex post following \"reputation trashing from colleagues\".\nShe said it had been surreal to see her name \"plastered over every wall\" on student protest posters.\nThe university said it unequivocally defended her right to free speech.\nVice-chancellor Professor Adam Tickell told staff in an email he had hoped Prof Stock would have felt able to return to work, and she would have been supported.\nBut the philosophy professor told BBC's Woman's Hour the campaign against her was the \"end point\" of years of negative treatment by colleagues that had become \"exhausting\".\nProf Stock, who recently published a book questioning the idea that gender identity is more \"socially significant\" than biological sex,  said her views had been \"radically misrepresented\" to suggest she was bigoted or transphobic, something she categorically denies.  \nBut an online statement accompanying the campaign against her suggested Prof Stock \"has spent years campaigning for the exclusion of trans people from 'women's only spaces' and against trans and non-binary people's right to self-identify as any gender\".  \nIt also criticised her trusteeship of the LGB Alliance, which describes itself on Twitter as promoting \"the rights of lesbians, bisexuals & gay men, as recognised by biological sex\". The group is described by trans activists as transphobic, which it denies.\nIn the interview aired on Wednesday, Prof Stock said: \"In almost every university... there are a small group of people who are absolutely opposed to the sorts of things I say and instead of getting involved in arguing with me using reason, evidence - the traditional university methods - they tell their students in lectures that I pose a harm to trans students. \n\"They go on Twitter to say that I'm a bigot so thus creating an atmosphere in which students become much more extreme and much more empowered to do what they did, I guess.\"\nIn October, posters were put up near the university campus and an accompanying social media campaign claimed Prof Stock \"makes trans students unsafe\". Photos also showed a masked protester standing on the university's sign with a banner reading \"Stock out\".\nProf Stock told Woman's Hour presenter Emma Barnett the effect of the protests was \"head spinning\" and \"like some sort of surreal terrible anxiety dream to see your name plastered over every wall\".\nShe described a protest at an open day when about 100 students were holding placards saying \"Stock out\", ''Fire her\", with flares being set off.\n\"I don't know if I can explain it but you have to imagine yourself at your workplace\u2026 all eyes are on you, all fingers seem to be pointing at you, it's like a medieval experience,\" she said.\n\"At that point I wasn't scared so much as incredibly distressed.\"\nThe professor said she had received hundreds of letters of support and accused her critics of being \"out of step\" with the public.\nThe \"tipping point\" that led to her resignation, she said, was when the Sussex branch of the University and College Union (UCU) released a statement which \"basically backed the protesters and implicitly made it obvious that they thought I was transphobic and accused Sussex University of institutional transphobia\".\nShe had previously tweeted a screenshot of a message purportedly sent to all Sussex UCU members which didn't name her personally but urged university management to \"take a clear and strong stance against transphobia at Sussex\", including an \"urgent investigation\".\nThe national branch of the UCU released a follow-up statement saying it was a \"proud and unequivocal supporter of trans rights\", opposed harassment and bullying and was \"not calling for any staff to be dismissed from their post\".\nThe University of Sussex said it had publicly and internally fully supported Prof Stock's freedom of speech and would not tolerate the bullying and harassment of anyone in its community.\nEqualities minister Liz Truss and chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) Baroness Kishwer Falkner both criticised the attacks on Prof Stock.\nHigher and further education minister Michelle Donelan said the campaign of harassment against her was \"deplorable\" and the situation should never have got that far."

      "tags": "Britney Spears,Music",
      "text": "Britney Spears has said she blames her mother for the conservatorship that has controlled her life for 13 years.\nThe star's father Jamie has been the public face of the legal arrangement that means the pop star has minimal say in her personal and financial affairs.\nBut writing online, the singer claimed it was her mother Lynne's idea.\n\"What people don't know is that my mom is the one who gave him the idea,\" she said. \"I will never get those years back... she secretly ruined my life.\"\nIn the now-deleted Instagram post, she continued: \"You know exactly what you did. My dad is not smart enough to ever think of a conservatorship, but tonight I will smile knowing I have a new life ahead of me.\"\nSpears' post appears to have been prompted by her father requesting the \"immediate\" and \"unconditional\" termination of the conservatorship.\nThe arrangement is a form of legal guardianship normally granted for people who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses.\n\"Jamie unconditionally loves and supports his daughter. Full stop,\" his lawyers said in court documents obtained by the BBC.\n\"The fact is that 13 years ago, a conservatorship was necessary to protect Britney in every sense of the word. Her life was in shambles and she was in physical, emotional, mental and financial distress. \n\"Through the conservatorship, Britney has been able to return to a path towards stability in all of these phases of her life. The mission has been successful and it is now time for Britney to re-take control of her life.\"\nMr Spears' lawyers said the request came without \"any caveat\" and that he would hand over all documents related to arrangement, adding that he had \"nothing to hide\".\nIn her post on Tuesday, Britney also named her former business manager Lou Taylor as helping to orchestrate the conservatorship. Neither she nor Lynne Spears have responded to the comments.\nBritney Spears has been under the conservatorship since 2008, when concerns over her mental health prompted her father to petition a court for legal authority over his daughter's life.\nThe arrangement has come under intense scrutiny, and after years of silence, the singer finally shared her perspective in an explosive 23-minute statement to the Los Angeles Superior Court in June.\nLabelling the conservatorship \"abusive\", the 39-year-old claimed she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children.\n\"I just want my life back,\" she told Judge Brenda Penny via phone.\nHer father filed papers to have the conservatorship terminated in September, but did not set a time scale for the transition. Judge Penny temporarily suspended him as conservator of his daughter's estate that month (he had not been in charge of her personal affairs since 2019).\nThe next hearing in the case is scheduled to take place on 12 November. However, even if the star is released from the arrangement, the legal battle is unlikely to come to a close.\nThe singer's lawyer Mathew Rosengart has accused her father of financial misconduct and \"reaping millions of dollars from his daughter's estate\". \nIn September, he told reporters he had \"serious questions\" about \"potential misconduct, including conflicts of interest, conservatorship abuse and the evident dissipation of Ms Spears fortune\", and vowed a \"top-to-bottom\" examination of documents relating to the case.\nIn court filings this week, Mr Rosengart also accused Mr Spears of trying to avoid answering questions about the alleged surveillance of the singer inside her home.\nHe demanded \"all documents and communications relating to any recording or listening device in the home or bedroom of Britney Jean Spears, including all documents and communications relating to the decision to place any such recording or listening device and the records of any such recording\".\nJamie Spears has denied all allegations of wrongdoing, and says he always acted in his daughter's \"best interests\". His own filing suggests he will hand over any documents relating to the case.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by rebels in 2011 and the country has been beset by unrest since then.\nElections in 2014 left the country split, with rival centres of power in Benghazi in the east and Tripoli in the west.\nThe current Libyan government in Tripoli wants good relations with the US, and the US wants Mr Masud to be extradited. The BBC's Orla Guerin in Tripoli says the signs are that ultimately the new suspect will be handed over.\nUS officials also say Mr Masud conspired with another Libyan intelligence official, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. \nAl-Megrahi maintained his innocence until his death in 2012 and his son has vowed to clear his name in the UK courts. \nIn the US, Kara Weipz, whose brother was killed in the bombing, said putting Mr Masud on trial in the US would bring peace to the families of victims.   \n\"I think we all need that peace,\" she told the BBC.\nBut among bereaved relatives in the UK there are questions and doubts. Some believe Iran was to blame for downing the plane not Libya, and the new charges are a smokescreen.\nDr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the bombing, said he did not believe the new extradition request had any purpose \"other than maintaining the fiction that there is a meaningful ongoing criminal investigation still extant\"."

Netflix said that games would come to iOS devices \"in the coming months\".\nApple has previously resisted attempts by other companies to put \"stores inside stores\" - particularly around gaming.\nWhen Microsoft initially launched its Game Pass streaming service in 2020, Apple blocked the app from appearing in the iPhone App Store, arguing that the roughly 100 games included should all be listed in its store individually. Microsoft eventually resorted to streaming through Apple's mobile Safari browser instead.\nNetflix did not say it was facing any similar issues with Netflix Games, saying that Android arriving first was down to the launch being \"still in its early stages\".\nDespite the delay in reaching Apple customers, Microsoft has become the dominant figure in the game subscription market to date.\nIts Xbox Game Pass service includes most of Microsoft's own game studio releases on the day they go on sale, many of which can be played on an Xbox, a gaming computer, or streamed over the internet to phones and tablets.\nIt is estimated to have tens of millions of subscribers paying between \u00a37.99 and \u00a310.99 a month, depending on the features they need."

Under new Treasury rules most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to publish details, by 2023, of how they will move to low-carbon emissions. Though not mandatory, the government said the aim is to increase transparency and accountability. However, green groups say the proposals do not go far enough. This announcement comes as deals such as cutting methane emissions and boosting green technologies were agreed on Tuesday. To keep up-to-day with what's happening to today, follow our updates.\nThe vast majority of world leaders viewed COP26 as an opportunity to \"press the restart button\", US President Joe Biden said, hailing the progress of the conference as he left. His visit ended following the conclusion of the world leaders summit, which kickstarted the conference. He left Edinburgh Airport in Air Force One after saying: \"We showed up... and by showing up we've had a profound impact on how the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role.\" He added that the absence of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the summit was a \"big mistake\".\nTo help end its reliance on coal, South Africa is set to receive $8.5bn (\u00a36.2bn) from wealthier nations in what President Cyril Ramaphosa says is a \"watershed moment\". The deal could have global and local implications as the country is a major emitter of greenhouse gases, which cause the planet's temperature to rise. South Africa uses coal to generate electricity.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands - a sprawling nation of more than 1,200 low-lying atolls and isles in the Pacific Ocean - are only 2m above sea level.

      "title": "Covid: Hard months to come in pandemic for UK, says Van-Tam",
      "tags": "Jonathan Van-Tam,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "\"Very high\" coronavirus rates in the UK at present mean there are hard months to come, England's deputy chief medical officer has warned.  \nProf Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC it was a concern that Covid levels were \"running this hot, this early in the autumn season\".\nHe said too many people believed the pandemic was now over. \nChristmas and the winter months are \"potentially going to be problematic\", Prof Van-Tam warned. \nThe UK recorded 33,865 Covid cases on Tuesday and 293 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn a question and answer session with BBC Breakfast and BBC Radio 5 Live, Prof Van-Tam said that while cases appeared to have stabilised, they were very high, and above most of Europe. \nHe also said deaths were rising and there were signs infections were starting to \"penetrate\" older age groups.\nThe current levels of coronavirus meant caution was now needed, he said, adding that experts would be continuing to analyse the data over the next days and weeks.\nHow Christmas is affected would depend on a \"whole range of behaviours\", he said.\nFace coverings and the caution people took in interacting with others, along with the speed of vaccinations, would be \"a big determinant between what happens now and the darkest months of the winter\".\nUsing a football analogy, as he has often done while commenting on the pandemic, he said: \"I would say we're kind of half-time in extra time, and I think the final whistle in terms of - I can't predict it - but my personal view is that we've got a few more months to run, and I think we'll be in a much calmer set of waters by spring.\"\nBBC health reporter Philippa Roxby\nJonathan Van Tam warned this morning that people should not assume the pandemic was over, or let their guard down.\nHe urged caution, particularly when meeting other people, and the wearing of face coverings in appropriate places.\nHe added that vaccinating young children from the age of five is not a priority in the UK - unlike in the US. He believes boosters and first doses for the five million unvaccinated are much more important.\nBut it's not just Covid he's worried about.\nFlu and other winter respiratory viruses are returning this season after a complete absence last year when no one was mixing - and anything we can do to protect against Covid will protect against these viruses too.\nProf Van-Tam urged people to get their Covid jabs, boosters and flu vaccines, adding that it was \"very important\" this winter.\nExperts have warned that people are at increased risk of death and serious illness if they are co-infected with Covid and flu. \nMore than 40 million people in the UK are being offered a flu jab this year.\nFor the first time this includes all secondary school children up to the age of 16.\nA booster jab programme for the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions is currently being rolled out, but he urged the NHS and the government to make it clearer to people when their turn may be coming up. \nAsked whether people will need a booster every six months, Prof Van-Tam said it was likely it would provide protection for longer than the first two doses, but this was not yet fully known. \nProf Van-Tam's comments come after a member of a group of scientists advising the government on coronavirus announced he had stepped down from the role.\nSir Jeremy Farrar, who had been part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) since the start of the pandemic, said he was stepping down to focus on his work at the Wellcome Trust - a medical research centre - but warned the high level of infections in the UK remained concerning. \nAmid speculation that Sir Jeremy was unhappy with the way ministers handle scientific advice, Prof Van-Tam said he did not read any more into his resignation other than he wants to concentrate on other work.\nHe added: \"It's a tribute to Sir Jeremy and so many other scientists that they have supported us so hard and for so long and given such invaluable, independent advice.\" \nMeanwhile, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which provides advice to the government, said that while the infection rate is \"high\", he does not believe the current case numbers of coronavirus are \"out of control\".\nProf Jeremy Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the country was at a \"relatively important crux point\". \nIf infection rates and hospitalisations went down it would be \"very encouraging\", but if they started going up it would be \"a different situation completely\"."

      "tags": "Policing,Independent Office for Police Conduct,Metropolitan Police Service",
      "text": "Met Police officers facing allegations of assault and harassment were allowed on patrol because of staff shortages, BBC News has been told.\nA former internal investigations officer claims he was told the force did not have enough staff and restrictions needed to be eased. \nHe also said he witnessed interference in investigations during his work in 2017.\nThe Met said changes in restrictions are \"carefully considered\".\nJaysen Veeren, who revealed the claims, worked in the Serious Misconduct Investigation Unit within the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS), which is responsible for investigating the force's own officers and recommending actions such as a suspensions or restricted duties. \nDuring his 18 months in the department, he claims: \nMr Veeren says senior officers who were brought into the DPS in 2017 wanted to change the use of restrictions on officers under investigation.\nIn September, he secretly recorded a meeting with an officer responsible for making decisions on misconduct investigations, known as the 'appropriate authority'. BBC News has listened to it. \nAt the meeting, the officer explained a change in \"ethos\" within the department. \n\"We haven't got enough people,\" he said. \"We've now moved away from sacking everybody to only sacking people that we really need to sack.\"\nHe then referenced public comments by Met Commissioner Cressida Dick about shortages of officers within the force and said the use of restrictions needed to be addressed \"as a direct result of that\". He added the DPS was \"jumping on to the restrictions far too quickly\".\nIn June 2017, the Commissioner told BBC News the force was \"stretched\" and \"need[ed] the resources to do the job\". It's estimated the force lost more than 1,700 frontline officers from 2010 to 2017. \nDecisions over what restrictions officers should face while under investigation were made by a deputy assistant commissioner within the department based on evidence provided by Mr Veeren and other officers. \nBut Mr Veeren said he felt it was \"very clear\" he was being directed to present evidence which would lead to reduced restrictions. \nOne PC, who was on bail for breaching a non-molestation order, faced an additional complaint of harassing a woman working in a shop, according to Mr Veeren.  \nHe said despite these complaints and having previously broken restrictions relating to his duty, the officer was permitted to go on patrol as long as he wore a body-worn camera at all times. \nA different officer faced a gross misconduct hearing over the alleged assault of a woman, Mr Veeren said.\nHe said following a change in his restrictions, the PC was involved in a police chase which led to a moped crashing at a time when officers had been directed not to conduct such pursuits following a rise in incidents. The officer was not wearing body worn video at the time nor trained to drive a police car in pursuit, according to Mr Veeren. \nSenior officers also criticised cases even where they were not directly aware of the evidence, Mr Veeren claims. \nHe says a detective inspector had sexual relationships with multiple victims of rape or sexual assault who he had met through his work in Sapphire Command, a team specialising in rape and sexual offences cases at the time. \nWhile gathering evidence, Mr Veeren says his case officers were told the investigation was a \"witch hunt\" by two senior officers. He says he was also asked to defend concerns by a detective chief inspector about whether the investigation was \"justified or necessary\" with the force \"haemorrhaging talent\".\nShortly before leaving his department in late 2017, Mr Veeren complained to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), and was transferred to a different department. \nIn August this year, the watchdog told him it had made learning recommendations about how the Met could improve its internal investigations and said there were \"broken systems\" and \"a culture of mistrust\" in the unit. \nBut it said there was no evidence of corruption and in a number of cases where \"it appeared senior officers were interfering in cases, they were in fact managing the quality or timeliness of the investigation\".\nBBC News has learned a second officer made allegations about the handling of cases in the DPS during an employment tribunal.  \nThese allegations \"support\" some of Mr Veeren's claims and make further allegations of \"corruption and discrimination\" within the same unit, according to an IOPC document relating to Mr Veeren's complaint. \nThe IOPC said it has concluded an investigation into the officer alleged to have had relationships with sexual assault victims and found he has a case to answer for gross misconduct.\nThe Met declined to say whether any officers allowed to go on patrol wearing body worn video while facing allegations of misconduct had been accused of sexual offences or had subsequently been the subject of any complaints while on duty.\nIn a statement, the force said the IOPC investigation found allegations that members within the DPS had abused their position to affect ongoing investigations were either \"not corroborated or disproven\".\nIt said it was not willing to discuss the cases of individual officers but said allegations of misconduct are investigated robustly. It added that when considering the use of restrictions on an officer, \"the integrity of our professional standards investigations will always take primacy over any other business need\". \n\"At the centre of any investigation is the welfare and safety of those involved, including those who make allegations and the wider public,\" it said. \nLabour's Shadow Home Secretary, Nick Thomas Symonds, said \"these are incredibly serious accusations\".\n\"We must also be clear that pressures on police forces are a direct result of 11 years of cutting frontline officer and police staff numbers by the Conservatives\", he said.\nA Home Office spokesperson said the use of restrictions is an operational matter for forces. It said it had hired over 11,000 extra officers to bring crime down."

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "text": "A British woman has won a legal battle against Australia's so-called \"backpacker tax\", in a ruling that may have implications for other travellers.\nCatherine Addy argued she was unfairly taxed on pay she earned while working as a waitress in Sydney in 2017.\nThe tax - imposed that year - had discriminated against her on the basis of her nationality, she said.\nOther backpackers affected by the same rule have been waiting for the decision by Australia's highest court.\nThey may now be able to ask Australian authorities to review their tax assessments.\nThe ruling relates to a working holiday visa - known as the 417 - offered to foreigners aged between 18 and 31.\nThey are subject to a 15% tax on income up to A$37,000 (\u00a320,200; $27,500), which is paid from the first dollar they earn.\nThis is a higher rate than for Australians, who get a tax-free threshold of A$18,200.\nMs Addy's lawyers argued the rules were at odds with an international \"double tax\" agreement Australia has with Britain and several other nations. Citizens of those countries should be taxed like Australians, they said.\nIn a judgement delivered on Wednesday, the High Court of Australia said: \"The question is whether that more burdensome taxation was imposed on Ms Addy owing to her nationality. The short answer is yes.\" \nThe Australian Taxation Office (ATO) said the decision was only relevant in cases where the working holiday-maker had been resident in Australia for tax purposes since 2017. It applied only to people from the UK, Germany, Israel, Japan, Norway, Finland, Turkey or Chile.\n\"Most working holiday makers will be non-residents as they are in Australia to have a holiday and working to support that holiday,\" a spokesperson said. \nThe ATO had argued to the court that there was no discrimination based on nationality.\nIt had said the tax was designed to help backpackers avoid the higher rates of tax imposed on other foreign workers.\nMs Addy worked as a waitress in two Sydney pubs between January 2017 and May 2017 - earning A$26,576.\nCourt submissions said that while she had to pay tax of A$3,986, when an Australian on the same income would have paid $1,591.\nTaxback.com - which helped Ms Addy bring the case - said the controversial tax had been seen as a \"disincentive to working holiday-makers to take up much-needed seasonal picking work while visiting Australia\".\nReporting by the BBC's Simon Atkinson "

      "text": "A new app which allows users to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination status within Northern Ireland has been launched by the health department.\nThe Covid Cert Check NI app will facilitate \"voluntary use\" of vaccine checks in hospitality and entertainment venues.\nThe department has also updated its COVIDCert NI app which allows people travelling abroad to prove vaccination. \nIt can now be updated to show the \"domestic use\" certificate. \nThe apps are free to download and can be used on smartphones and tablet computers.\nCurrently people in Northern Ireland are not required to prove their vaccination status in order to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.\nHowever Stormont ministers recently published a contingency plan which referred to the \"potential\" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in \"higher risk settings\".\nIt is one of a number of contingency measures which could be introduced over the winter if ministers feel such checks are necessary. \n\"Decisions on whether domestic certification would be introduced on a compulsory basis in Northern Ireland settings will rest with the Northern Ireland Executive,\" the department said in a statement. \nIt added that the new Cert Check NI app would be \"more user-friendly and reliable than using the printed vaccination cards to prove you have had both jabs\".\nThe earlier COVIDCert NI app was launched in July, in response to changes in international travel rules.\nSince then, more than 228,500 vaccine certificates have been issued to its Northern Ireland users.\nNow, people who have already downloaded the existing COVIDCert NI app for international travel will be given an option to activate their \"domestic certificate\".\nTo use this new feature, they will have to take a selfie photo with their phone or tablet computer which is then \"locked into the app\".\nThe purpose of adding the selfie is to prevent abuse of the system and it also avoids users having to present separate photo ID when they use the COVIDCert NI app as proof of vaccination status.\nThe department said users' selfie photos will stay on their device within the app but the image is \"not shared with or collected by anyone else\". \n\"Citizens are encouraged to download the app, and ensure that they have the necessary certificates downloaded, should they wish to present them,\" the statement said. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the app showed \"just how easy it would be to introduce mandatory vaccination certification across all our hospitality and entertainment businesses\".\nHe said while many businesses may choose to use the app, the decision should have been made at Stormont to protect the health service.\n\"The SDLP will continue to push for vaccine certification,\" he added.\nWhile it is not mandatory, Northern Ireland now has a Covid-19 certificate which can be used in domestic and social settings. \nIt looks a lot more professional than the current blue card that hardly resembles anything official. \nIt is available and good to go, but only on a voluntary basis. \nHowever, it does pave the way for the Northern Ireland Executive to introduce compulsory checks at the flick of a switch if and when it is required, for instance post-Christmas when health officials might need to call for greater control over the hospitality industry. \nThat might need to happen if the health service becomes overwhelmed, and by making vaccine certification checks mandatory it could mean avoiding another lockdown. \nThe new app was developed to assist Northern Ireland-based organisations to check their customers' vaccination status and can be scanned by participating venues."

      "text": "The British trawler that was detained by France during the post-Brexit fishing row has been released by the French authorities.\nThe Scottish-registered scallop dredger Cornelis Gert Jan left the northern French port of Le Havre on Wednesday evening.\nThe trawler's owner, Macduff Shellfish, said it was \"delighted\" that the crew and vessel could return home.\nFrench authorities held the boat last week, saying it did not have a licence.\nMenna Rawlings, the UK's ambassador to France, welcomed the news, tweeting: \"Glad to hear the Cornelis is free to leave Le Havre and that the Brits on board are on their way home tonight.\"\nThe dispute over post-Brexit fishing licences flared up last month, after the UK and Jersey denied fishing permits to several French boats.\nFrance then threatened a series of measures against the UK unless more licences were granted by 2 November.\nBut French President Emmanuel Macron suspended the threats at the 11th hour ahead of more talks between UK and French ministers on Thursday.\nEarlier, the trawler's skipper Jondy Ward told the BBC they had been \"caught in the middle\" of the political row.\nMr Ward still faces trial in France next August regardless of Wednesday's court ruling that the boat can be released. \nHe has been charged with illegal fishing without a licence in French waters - but the case could be dropped before it reaches trial.\nAndrew Brown, the public affairs director of Macduff Shellfish, said the crew were in good spirits, looking forward to returning to their loved ones and grateful for all the messages of support.\nNo bail bond was needed to release the trawler, he said.\nIt comes after Mr Ward's lawyer said the French authorities had demanded a bond of 150,000 euros (\u00a3127,000), which he argued was excessive given the total value of the produce on board was around 5,000 euros (\u00a34,200).\nIn short, it's about how many French fishing boats can catch fish in UK waters.\nUnder the Brexit trade deal, the EU and UK agreed they would give licences to boats if they can show they have fished in each other's waters for years.\nBut there have been disagreements about how much evidence is needed.\nBig trawlers will routinely collect this information automatically.\nBut smaller vessels that come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, can find it harder to provide the proof needed.\nDowning Street acknowledged that France could reimpose its threats as Brexit minister Lord Frost prepared to hold talks with France's Europe minister Clement Beaune on Thursday.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"It's entirely up to the French government if they want to reimpose the threats that we saw they both announced and stood back from in recent days.\""

Covid has coincided with intense demand from buyers unmatched by supply.\nOfficial forecasters say the pace of house price rises will slow.\n\"The dynamics of the housing market may be about to shift slowly once again, but make no mistake, the boom still isn't over,\" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country.\nUK house prices have risen sharply over the last 18 months owing to changing preferences of buyers, who are now looking for more indoor and outside space, but those properties have not been plentiful on the market.\nThat has led to intense competition among potential buyers in some areas, particularly in rural and coastal spots.\nThe market also been buoyed by tax incentives, with ministers introducing stamp duty holidays, as well as cheap borrowing costs.\nThose tax breaks are now over, and there is widespread speculation that mortgage rates will rise from the ultra-low levels of recent times.\n\"We expect house prices to continue to beat expectations in the near term before a gradual rise in mortgage rates applies the brakes in the second half of 2022,\" said Andrew Wishart, property economist at Capital Economics.\nThe outcome of Thursday's Bank of England interest rate decision will be one factor affecting house prices in the months ahead.\n\"The outlook remains extremely uncertain,\" said Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner.\n\"If the labour market remains resilient, conditions may stay fairly buoyant in the coming months - especially as the market continues to have momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts in housing preferences.\"\nThe government's official, independent forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - said that house prices would continue to rise in the coming years, albeit at a slower rate.\nIt means potential first-time buyers are facing another period of difficulty if they wish to buy a home, especially if the cost of borrowing rises.\nThe OBR has now predicted that house prices will go up by 8.6% this year, compared with a year earlier. The annual rise would then slow to 3.2% in 2022, before decelerating further to 0.9% in 2023, it said.\nThis would be followed by rises of 1.9% in 2024, 2.9% in 2025, and 3.5% in 2026, although longer-term forecasts and more difficult to make accurately."

On the one hand it is a gripping saga, following the decline and fall of a white South African family over four decades. It is packed with incident - sex, drugs, shootings - and there is drama, discord and death. But there is also plenty of unexpected comedy to lighten the mood. It made me laugh.\nOn the other hand, through the lens of this one family, The Promise also deftly tells the story of South Africa and its troubled transition from apartheid state to multi-racial democracy. So it is rich with layers and yet it is compact, with fewer than 300 pages.\nIt is also technically superb. There is an invisible narrator, who acts like a film camera. So you move fluidly from one location to another, from one character's point of view to another, sometimes within the same paragraph or page. At one point we fly into someone's dreams. At another we dive into the feelings of a pack of hyenas and even a family dog. \nDamon Galgut nearly died from cancer as a young child. In 2010 he told me it was the central, cataclysmic event of his life. Books provided comfort during his illness. When he finally recovered he was left with the overwhelming need to write. Now he has won one of the biggest prizes in publishing.\nThe Promise begins in 1986 and revisits the family over the course of four funerals, each in a different decade and at a different point in the nation's journey.\nThe title refers to a pledge that the white family's black maid would be given the house she inhabits and the land it stands on.\nGalgut, 57, grew up in Pretoria and told the Today programme that it also refers to the unfulfilled promise in South Africa after apartheid, the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government.\n\"I'm far from alone in saying that I think, in 1994, in our first free elections, there was a sense of great promise in the air that South Africa could at last change its course and become a different sort of country, and I certainly don't think that promise has been fulfilled,\" he said.\nThe \"portrait\" his book paints of modern South Africa \"is not a happy one\", he told reporters after the ceremony.\n\"I had no agenda in describing it that way, but things are not great with us right now, so you could read that as a warning or a portrait, I don't know, but South Africa has seen better days.\"\nBut he said his win was a sign that more attention was being paid to African literature.\n\"The fact that the Nobel Prize winner this year came from Africa, the fact that the Booker has gone to an African, would suggest that the volume is going up on Africa,\" he said.\n\"I hope that's a process that will continue and that people will take African writing a little more seriously, because there's a lot of great writing coming from us.\"\nThe Promise was widely praised when it was published in the UK in June, with The Guardian calling it \"stunning\", The Sunday Times describing it as \"bleak but superbly narrated\" and The Financial Times declaring it \"a complex, ambitious, brilliant work\".\nThe other nominated books were:\nLast year's Booker Prize was won by Douglas Stuart for Shuggie Bain. The Scottish author said the victory \"changed everything for me\", with the novel shooting up best-seller lists as a result and now being adapted into a TV series."

      "text": "A medical student who faced dropping out after falling behind on tuition fees has crowdfunded \u00a324,000 in six days to help pay them off.\nMazvita Manzai, a fourth year Cardiff University student, said she had become \"overwhelmed\" by the fees and it was affecting her mental health.\nIt took TikTok dances and social media shares to reach her target, the 21-year-old said.\nMazvita said she was \"so humbled\" by the response.\n\"I got to a point where I was overwhelmed by tuition [fees]. It was affecting my ability to study, emotions and my mental health.\"\nShe said she was not able to talk to her mother because they were both worried about an outstanding fee of \u00a35,000 from her third year, as well as how to pay for the fourth year.\nCardiff University's fees for international students studying medicine, in Mazvita's entry year, is \u00a335,000 per year.\nHer mother, who works as a farmer in Zimbabwe, lost her job as an accountant in 2018 following political change in the country.\nMazvita said her mother had also started a chicken business and letting her car out for hire to raise extra money, but the pandemic had affected Zimbabwe's farmers' income.\nShe said her mother \"just can't sustain it on her own anymore\".\nMazvita and her sister Shingai have been working part-time to pay for their living expenses while at medical school, Mazvita as a carer and Shingai in a call centre.\nAfter exhausting bursary, scholarship and alternative funding options Mazvita considered crowdfunding, despite doubting it would work at first.\n\"I've got nothing to lose this way, I want to graduate and so this is my option,\" she said.\n\"I just kind of put my life out there with boldness, courage and a whole lot of nerves and I was just like - let's just see what happens.\"\nIf she was not able to transfer the fees by Christmas, Mazvita would have faced having to drop out.\nWhen she posted a video explaining her situation and fundraising target on 27 October, she had hit \u00a35,000 by the end of the day.\nBy the sixth day, she had reached her target.\n\"I've just been so overwhelmed by the love and support,\" she said.\nShe said on top of friends, university medical staff and strangers, a lot of the people who donated were students.\n\"I'm so grateful that I'm here and I've made such a family here. Welsh people, they just crawl right into your heart.\"\nMazvita also said her university had been \"so supportive\" in giving her time to pay the fees.\nAfter graduating, she hopes to stay in Wales to work as a doctor.\n\"I also want to help support people who find themselves in the same financial situation as me, when I get to a place when I'm more financially stable,\" she added."

      "tags": "Companies,Global supply chain management,COP26,Climate change,Shipping industry,Freight transport",
      "text": "Christmas trading will be safe from supply chain problems, the boss of shipping firm Maersk has told the BBC - adding, \"at least that's what I'm hearing from our customers\".\nThe company handles almost 20% of the world's shipping containers.\nChief executive Soren Skou, said the firm is chartering more ships, keeping ports open longer and has opened more warehouses to help.\nThe firm is doing \"everything\" it can to alleviate the problems, he said. \nThere have been recent warnings in the UK and the US that logjams at ports will lead to shortages at Christmas.\nMr Skou said that a shortage of workers in the ports to unload ships and a lack of truckers was behind the problems. \nA Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. That number includes thousands of drivers from European Union (EU) member states who were previously living and working in the UK. There are also shortages across Europe and the US.\nMr Skou estimated that approximately 300 large container ships around the world are sitting waiting outside ports. Almost 80 of these, he added, were in Los Angeles, with a \"few\" outside Felixstowe and others stuck by Chinese ports including Shanghai and Ningbo.\nThis widespread congestion was triggered by a collapse in demand during the early stages of the pandemic. That was followed by a period of frantic activity, as people who were forced to stay at home rather than travel or socialise, ordered large quantities of consumer goods.\nMr Skou, who runs the world's biggest shipping firm, said this shows no sign of easing: \"The reality is that consumer demand is strong and at the same time our customers inventories are low.\"\n\"They both need to serve the consumer here and now, but also rebuild inventories and that's why we have an unprecedented demand situation\".\nThe demand has meant Maersk and other shipping companies have been able to charge record prices. The Danish company's pre-tax profits rose fivefold to $5.9bn for the July to September period.\nLast week Japanese cargo line Ocean Network Express reported a more than eight fold jump in profits for the same period, to $4.2bn. \nOne of UK's biggest toy retailers, The Entertainer, recently warned delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. \nIn the US, the port of Los Angeles has started operating 24 hours a day to clear a backlog of cargo ships which has led to shortages. White House officials warned that there \"will be things that people can't get\" during the holiday season, despite President Biden appointing a bottlenecks Czar. \nSimon Heaney of the maritime research firm Drewry, said Maersk's mitigations might not be enough. Mr Heaney explained that \"port congestion is worsening while the number of ships waiting outside major ports around the world is increasing\".\nThe brief closure of some big container terminals due to China's coronavirus restrictions, extreme weather events and a rise in the Delta variant of coronavirus, are each playing a part Mr Heaney said. \nMr Heaney added that opening ports for longer won't help if there aren't enough staff to run them.\n90% of global trade is moved by sea and with demand having shown no sign of easing, the shipping industry is looking to tackle its impact on climate change.\nIt's responsible for about 2% of carbon emissions, meaning that if the industry was a country it would be the sixth biggest polluter, above Germany.\nThe UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is aiming for a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.\nAs world leaders meet to tackle climate change in Glasgow Mr Skou was critical of the targets set by the UN body that oversees his industry: \"The ambition level at the IMO so far has been quite limited\". \n\"We as Maersk certainly are pushing hard for that to be reducing by 100% in 2050 and we believe it can be done\".\nOn Monday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: \"We urge the IMO to take action to set ambitious targets to achieve zero emission shipping by 2050\". \n\"Carbon-neutral shipping is vital to reaching our climate goals,\" he added. Shipping was not included in the Paris climate agreement.\nThe International Chamber of Shipping has backed a $5bn fund to develop carbon free shipping and overcome a lack of investment in the technology required. Maersk plans to launch the world's first carbon neutral cargo ship in 2023.\nHowever, Mr Skou said the slow progress doesn't mean we need to move fewer goods around the world to tackle climate change. \n\"I think we just have to get to the point that we can use different fuels,\" he added.

      "tags": "David Cameron,Greensill Capital,UK Parliament",
      "text": "Westminster has been bursting with rebellions, U-turns and resignations this week after the Tory MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken parliamentary rules on lobbying. But what does the term mean? \nLobbying is when individuals, businesses, trade unions, groups or charities try to get a government to change its policies. \"Political persuasion\" might be a better term.\nLobbyists make their case to ministers, MPs or officials. They can write, email, text, phone, video call or turn up in person in Parliament to do it, although the latter hasn't happened much over the past two years due to Covid-19 restrictions.\nNot always. Changing politicians' minds can take a long time. That's why organisations and firms often hire professional lobbyists to make arguments on their behalf. Some of these are former politicians themselves and \"know the game\" - that is, who's who and where to find them.\nBut it's important to re-emphasise that individual citizens - unpaid - can also lobby politicians about issues that are important to them. Anyone can be a lobbyist, in other words.\nSupporters say professional lobbying is a vital and valid part of democracy - that it stimulates debate and keeps politicians in touch with the latest developments in areas like science and business.\nBut critics argue that the current system is open to corruption and that wealthy interests - the ones who can afford professionals to make their case - have an unfair advantage.\nMinisters and top civil servants are effectively banned from lobbying their former colleagues for two years after leaving government. Lobbyists also have to join a register, which was set up by David Cameron as prime minister.\nBut Mr Cameron, who left Downing Street in 2016, became the centre of a row about lobbying earlier in 2021 over his work for Greensill Captial. \nIn Mr Paterson's case, he was found to have broken the rules by approaching and meeting officials at the Food Standards Agency and ministers at the Department for International Development a number of times over issues involving two firms he was a consultant for. \nThe Commons Standards Committee also said he used his parliamentary office and stationery for his consultancy work and failed to declare his interests in some meetings.\nThe commissioner decided that the contact with officials and ministers were \"serious breaches\" of the rules.\nFollowing the disclosures about Mr Cameron's work, the government set up a review of lobbying, led by lawyer Chris Boardman. \nHe said some of the accusations that the government's processes for managing lobbying were \"insufficiently transparent\", had \"loopholes\" and allowed \"a privileged to few have a disproportionate level of access to decision makers in government\" were \"justified\". \nBut he said Mr Cameron did not break any of the rules. \nAfter the incident involving Mr Paterson, the focus from the government was not on his lobbying but in the need for an overhaul of the system policing MPs' conduct instead - giving members more chances to appeal findings against them.\nInitially, Downing Street backed an amendment to shake-up the watchdog and blocked Mr Paterson's suspension too. \nBut within 24 hours, and after a furious backlash from opposition MPs, No 10 U-turned, and now government is appealing to other parties to hold cross-party talks about any chances.\nThese would not be retrospectively applied to Mr Paterson's case though, and soon after the announcement, the MP resigned his seat. \nIt started long ago when members of the public turned up in Parliament's lobby areas to let MPs know what needed to change.\nIt's harder to get into that part of the building than it used to be because of tougher security, so meetings are just as likely to take place elsewhere, such as over dinner, in MPs' constituencies or via the phone."

They were later released on bail.\n\"No one wants to see this escalate and a return to images of the past\" said Simon Byrne.\nMr Byrne was speaking at a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.\n\"I think we want to see this in terms of a small-scale isolated incident and support the community in trying to dial down the rhetoric of what we saw yesterday,\" he said.\nA protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol had been planned in the area on Wednesday.\nPolice said less than a dozen people gathered for it.\nOfficers were deployed to Lanark Way shortly after 17:00 GMT.\nWheelie bins were burnt on the road and missiles were thrown at police officers and police vehicles.\nThere were no reports of any injuries to members of the public or police officers but a number of police vehicles were damaged after being attacked with masonry.\nPolice said order was restored by about 22:30 and an evidence gathering operation is under way.\nThree police vehicles were damaged during the incident and are now \"off the road\", according to Ch Supt Jones.\nSinn F\u00e9in assembly member (MLA) Pat Sheehan urged unionist politicians to call for an \"immediate end to these dangerous and provocative stunts at interfaces before someone is seriously hurt\".\n\"Tonight's trouble is a direct consequence of the dangerous and irresponsible stunt organised by loyalists at the Lanark Way interface this evening... with the sole intention of heightening tensions and causing trouble,\" he added.\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) MLA Mike Nesbitt said that if anyone had blocked Lanark Way as a protest of any kind it was \"wrong, illegal and counter-productive\".\nSDLP west Belfast representative Paul Doherty said fireworks and missiles were launched on both sides of the interface on Lanark Way.\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that he went to the area to \"try to talk people down\" but \"some listened, others were intent on creating carnage\".\n\"These actions do nothing but cause misery to the long-suffering people who live at these interface areas,\" he said.\nEarlier this week, a bus was set on fire after being hijacked by armed, masked men in Newtownards, County Down.\nPoliticians linked that attack to opposition to the protocol.\nThe protocol is the special Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods.\nThat also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses.\nUnionist politicians say the arrangement undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Rail travel,Social distancing,Welsh government,Transport for Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Rules asking fans to wear face masks to Wales' autumn rugby internationals are \"not effective\", an academic has said. \nSimon Williams from Swansea University said rules asking fans to wear masks in the stadium concourses but not in seats could be confusing. \nWearing masks on concourses is part of a number of Covid-related measures in place for Wales' four autumn matches. \nOn Tuesday, Principality Stadium manager Mark Williams urged fans to follow the rules on mask wearing. \nHe said: \"As we look to next weekend and the game against South Africa, I'd like to remind all supporters to wear their masks when inside the stadium.\n\"Masks are one of the important ways to stopping the spread of Covid-19, so we urge all supporters to respect their fellow fans and keep their masks on when on the concourses.\"\nUnder Welsh law, masks are mandatory on public transport, while Covid passes are needed for large events and nightclubs. \nThe Principality Stadium has asked people wear masks when moving around the ground, but these can then be removed while seated. \nOn Tuesday, Health Minister Eluned Morgan expressed concern about people mixing in Cardiff on matchday, citing high Covid case rates. \nDr Williams, a senior lecturer in people and organisation, said people could be struggling to follow rules such as these if they did not understand the rationale behind them. \nHe said: \"There's two problems. One is people aren't clear as to why, when you're moving through a concourse and seeing people for a few seconds, you have to wear a mask, whereas when you're sitting down next to people for an hour-and-a-half you don't. So people might think 'what's the point?'\n\"The second is, the act of putting it [a mask] on and taking it off again, people might forget. It's much easier to wear one constantly then remember to put it on and take if off again.\"\nDr Williams said people may choose not to wear a mask at the match if they had travelled there on a busy train.\nHe said: \"One thing I was concerned about was secondary mixing - trains, car sharing, bars and restaurants. It's not just the events themselves it's how people interact around the events.\"\nThere were reports on Saturday of packed trains with limited mask wearing. \nLeila Al-Baldawi tweeted a video of a busy train carriage as she travelled from Carmarthen to London, with the service carrying some match-goers from west Wales to Cardiff. \nShe said the train she travelled on was \"rammed\" and \"crazy\", adding: \"They'd known about this match for a long time and, regardless of Covid-19, people are paying a lot of money these days for tickets on trains.\n\"They've known that tens of thousands of people would be descending on Cardiff that day, I just don't understand why there weren't more carriages, there were two carriages on that scheduled trip.\"\nTransport for Wales (TfW) warned ahead of last weekend's match against New Zealand that social distancing would not be possible, and has issued the same advice ahead of Saturday's game against South Africa, and that all available carriages and some additional capacity would be in service.\nIt also said it gave 3,000 masks to passengers on Saturday. \nIt said: \"Travellers must wear face coverings on public transport in Wales and we continue to work closely with the British Transport Police (BTP). \n\"TfW staff and BTP officers will be engaging with passengers at stations and anyone refusing to wear a face covering without an exemption could be refused travel or removed from services.\"\nDr Williams added that although research showed the majority of people were supportive of mask-wearing laws in Wales, there was anecdotal evidence of this dropping, particularly on busy services where policing it becomes impossible. \nHe said: \"When there was this growing sense of measures not being enforced, those who were on the fence or not in agreement might say 'it's not being enforced, why bother'?\"\nFace masks are required by law in Wales on public transport, including taxis, which is not the case in England. \nThey are also required in indoor areas, such as shops, places of worships, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres. \nBut you do not have to wear them where food and drink is served, such as in pubs, cafes and restaurants."

      "tags": "House of Commons,Owen Paterson",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has backed a shake-up of the rules on MPs' behaviour, amid moves to prevent a senior Conservative being suspended from the Commons.\nOwen Paterson was found to have misused his position to benefit two companies he worked for.\nBut he says he got unfair treatment and his allies will seek to change the rules and scrap his punishment in Commons votes later on Wednesday.\nThe government has ordered all Tory MPs to back the suggested reforms.\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson also argued that a right of appeal must be introduced for cases such as Mr Paterson's to ensure \"natural justice\". \nBut Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said the Conservatives were \"wallowing in sleaze\" and accused them of changing the rules to suit their own ends.\nMPs are due to vote later on whether to endorse a recommendation from the Commons Standards Committee that Mr Paterson be suspended for 30 days - which could potentially trigger a by-election in his North Shropshire constituency.\nMr Paterson's supporters are trying to overturn the recommendation.\nThey are also calling for a new committee to be set up to consider changes to the process for investigating MPs. \nIf the Commons backs this - which is likely to happen, given the government's large majority - Mr Paterson's proposed suspension would be put on hold.\nAs the debate opened, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the issue was not, and should not become, \"partisan\".\nSince the 2009 expenses saga, or maybe even the scandals that plagued John Major's government in the '90s, the issue of policing politicians has tested every generation of MPs, who were plagued by the accusation that they were all too willing to let each other off the hook, for offences that would have much more serious consequences for ordinary folk. \nA decade ago Parliamentary careers were floundering over expenses claims which varied from the wildly self-indulgent to the outright fraudulent. \nBut maybe memories have dimmed - the influx of new MPs and the passage of time have softened memories of what was, at the time, a colossal institutional trauma.\nAt the moment, the system for examining breaches of the rules for MPs is a complicated one, with careers dependent on its verdicts. \nSo it's no surprise parliamentarians are deeply concerned about its workings. \nBut today's vote entangles an individual case with concerns about the working of the system - and entanglement may spell real trouble for Parliament. \nEarlier, Mr Johnson said he supported the proposed reforms and that MPs found to have broken the rules should get a right of appeal, as would happen with doctors and teachers found guilty of misconduct.\nPoliticians must \"consider the procedures of this House in a spirit of fairness\", he added.\nBut Ms Rayner said: \"It's one rule for everybody else and one rule for the Conservatives. When they break the rules, they just remake the rules.\"\n\"In no other profession in our country could someone be found guilty by an independent process and just have their mates vote them back into the job,\" she added.\nThe prime minister's spokesperson said the changes would not amount to MPs \"marking their own homework\".\nBut Liberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain called the government's \"support\" of Mr Paterson \"shameful\", adding that it would \"inevitably damage\" trust in the system.\nThe committee's recommendation on Mr Paterson followed an investigation by Parliament's standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone.\nIts report said the former cabinet minister had breached Commons lobbying rules in making approaches to the Food Standards Agency and Department for International Development ministers about Randox and Lynn's Country Foods, which employed him as a paid consultant.\nThe committee found that Mr Paterson had used his parliamentary office on 16 occasions for meetings relating to his outside business interests between October 2016 and February 2020 and sent two letters relating to business interests on House of Commons headed notepaper.\nIt described the MP's actions as \"an egregious case of paid advocacy\" adding that \"no previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of behaviour in failing to separate private and public interest.\"\nMr Paterson, a former cabinet minister, has denied any wrongdoing, and argued his approaches were within the rules because he was seeking to alert ministers to defects in safety regulations.\nHe has also said the process was \"a major contributory factor\" in the death of his wife, Rose, who took her own life last year.\nMr Johnson told the Commons: \"The issue in this case, which involved a serious family tragedy, is whether a member of this House had a fair opportunity to make representations in this case and whether, as a matter of a natural justice, our procedures in this House allow for proper appeal.\"\nIn its 175-page report, the cross-party committee considered Mr Paterson's criticisms of the investigation and rejected them.\nIt also said it had taken the circumstances of his wife's death into account when considering the MP's conduct.

He died and one of the people he hit was fatally injured.\nThe third person was left with non-life threatening injuries and was taken to hospital.\nNone of the victims have been named by police but the man who fell was said by police to be in his 80s and the other man in his 60s.\n\"We received a call about someone having either jumped or fallen from a high altitude,\" police spokesman Magnus Jansson Klarin told the AFP news agency. \nHe said officers were working to establish what exactly had happened, adding that it was too early to say whether a crime had occurred.\nThe concert hall was initially closed by police so witnesses at the scene could be questioned.\nMTLive, the events company that organised the show, wrote on their Facebook page that \"everyone is in shock\".\n\"Unfortunately, we have to announce that a terrible event has happened. What we know is that someone jumped [or] fell high in the arena and hit other people,\" the company said. \n\"Right now we don't know much more, everyone is in shock,\" it added.\nThe tragic incident comes just days before Abba are due to release their first new album in more than 40 years on Friday.

      "text": "Five activists have been arrested as hundreds of climate change protesters marched through Glasgow.\nScuffles broke out during an Extinction Rebellion demonstration outside the SSE energy company as two activists tried to force their way into the building.\nPolice said other arrests were made following \"assaults\" on officers who had paint sprayed in their faces.\nMost of the demonstrations against corporate \"greenwashing\" were peaceful as officers accompanied marchers.\nThe biggest protests of the summit so far began with hundreds of campaigners gathering in the city centre to highlight what they see as the exaggeration of green credentials by big businesses. \nSome then headed for the offices of SSE where police and security staff prevented activists entering the building, and four arrests were made including two people who, according to the police, sprayed paint at officers. \nGary Ritchie, Assistant Chief Constable of Police Scotland, said they received first aid at the scene before opting to return to the operation, which he described as \"very effective\" and \"very well planned\".\nAnother protest took place outside the offices of JP Morgan, where a green flare was let off. \nExtinction Rebellion said about 500 demonstrators were later \"kettled\" at St Vincent Street before being allowed to move off with a heavy police escort towards the city's Broomielaw next to the River Clyde.\nAmid shouting and pushing, several protesters fell and police medics helped at least one woman who was injured.\nACC Ritchie said most protesters had been \"fairly compliant\" with police \"in negotiations\" with the group about their intentions.\n\"They have told us they would like to proceed to another part of the city and we have agreed to that,\" he said. \"But for public safety reasons we will be escorting the protesters as they make their way to that location.\"  \nACC Ritchie said police would \"protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest or counter-protest at COP26, balanced against the rights of the wider community\". \nHe added: \"We will provide a proportionate policing response to any protest and violence will not be tolerated. \n\"Assaults on officers, who put their safety at risk every day to keep the public safe and have adopted a facilitative and rights-based approach to protest, is totally unacceptable.\"\nEyewitness: Cameron Buttle, BBC Scotland reporter in Glasgow city centre\nFor around two hours hundreds of public order police were chasing a group of protesters around the centre of Glasgow. \nIt was a hugely difficult operation to police; as soon as a street was blocked the protesters disappeared down a lane or backtracked and took a different route. \nEventually a group of about 150 were held in a block just off Renfield Street. \nIt was noisy, passionate and occasionally very tense.\nI did see some scuffles breaking out in front me but it calmed down very quickly.  \nEventually the police cordon moved slowly through the city taking the group down towards the main conference venue. \nSome protesters complained about the police operation, saying it was over the top and heavy handed. \nThe police said they feared that main routes were going to be blocked and said the action was proportionate.\nCampaigners also used the demonstrations to object to the planned Cambo oil field off Shetland,  on  the anniversary of the Queen inaugurating the flow of North Sea oil in 1975.\nFriends of the Earth Scotland, along with the campaign groups Platform and Stop Cambo, took part in protest events.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said an environmental review of the new Cambo oil field should be carried out before extraction begins.\nThe UK government's Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has backed the project, saying Cambo is \"priced in\" to the UK government's plans to reduce emissions.\nRosemary Harris, of Platform, said there should be no new investment in oil and gas.\nShe said: \"Any new oil and gas production is continuing to support a declining industry. There's a lot of talk about it being important for jobs, but they should be creating pathways for workers outside oil and gas.\"\nInside the conference hall, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak promised to cut carbon emissions by rewiring the \"entire global financial system\".\nHe said the plan would help persuade firms investing in fossil fuels to instead put their money into green energy and technologies.  \nAbout 450 of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension companies, which control about \u00a3100tn, have signed up. \nMore than 100 world leaders were in Glasgow for the first two days of the COP26 summit but most have now left, leaving delegations to continue the negotiations.\nUS President Joe Biden flew out on Tuesday night after a two-day visit.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

The incident could have happened without the loss of life to my brother had better procedures and safety measures been put in place.\"\nA lawyer representing the pilot said a \"systems failure\" posed a risk to the occupants of the aircraft, adding the MoD \"ought to have known as such\".\nAccording to an inquiry held by the MoD into the incident, the jet departed from RAF Valley with the intention of simulating an engine failure, before flying to RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire.\nDuring the training manoeuvre, the plane stalled and crashed near the runway as it was flying too low to recover.\nThe Service Panel Inquiry found Flt Lt Stark was almost certainly fatigued and distracted at the time of the crash.\nThe panel added he may have had \"an underlying level of fatigue\" that could have affected his decision making and reaction times during the critical stages of the accident sortie.\nBut Charlotte Law, legal counsel for the pilot, said while the primary cause of the crash was the aircraft stalling: \"That's not the end of the story. The question has to be asked why that occurred.\"\nShe said smoke pods fitted to the display team's Hawks could \"mask\" a warning vibration in the control column.\nRepresenting the MoD at the pre-inquest hearing, Edward Pleeth said the tragedy had been caused by the plane stalling, and there had been no evidence of \"systemic\" failure."

      "text": "The government has been defeated in the House of Lords over its one-year suspension of the \"triple lock\" formula to increase the state pension.\nMinisters plan to temporarily break the link between pensions and the rise in earnings, breaching a manifesto pledge.\nIt followed concern that a post-pandemic rise in average wages would have meant pensions increasing by 8%.\nPeers voted to restore a link with earnings. But MPs could still go on to reject their amendment.\nThe House of Lords backed an amendment by former Tory pensions minister Baroness Altmann to the law required to suspend the triple lock, by 220 votes to 178.\nIt will set up a vote in the House of Commons, where the government will have to decide whether to order its MPs to oppose her plan. \nUnder the triple lock, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5%, whichever is the greater.\nHowever, the government announced plans to suspend this for one year from April 2022, before restoring it. \nInstead, the rise will be the consumer inflation rate or 2.5%, whichever is higher.\nIt came after the exceptional circumstances of the Covid pandemic meant earnings between May and July were set to rise by more than 8%.\nAnnouncing the move in September, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said it would ensure pensioners did not \"unfairly\" benefit from a \"statistical anomaly\".\nShe argued that \"would not be fair\" during a period when the government had taken \"difficult decisions\" such as freezing public sector pay.\nUnder Lady Altmann's amendment, the government would have to continue to link pensions to an adjusted version of the official earnings figure. She has said this would be around 5%. \nAhead of the vote on her plan, she said the government's plan to suspend the triple lock would set a \"seriously dangerous precedent\".\n\"Pensioners are not a cash machine for chancellors to take money from when wanting to fund other projects or tax cuts elsewhere, especially not in the eye of a cost-of-living storm,\" she said.\n\"Yes, this is for one year only, but what a year to choose to do this, while older people are facing a cost of living crisis and the protection they rely on is being removed.\"\nIn response, Work and Pensions minister Baroness Stedman-Scott said the suspension was for one year only, and the commitment to restore the triple lock after that \"remains in place\".\nMPs endorsed the government's suspension of the triple lock, when they voted on the bill to enforce it in September. \nLabour and SNP MPs put forward amendments requiring the government to review its impact on pensioner policy, but these were defeated.\nMPs could reject the Lords' amendment on the grounds of financial privilege, which gives the Commons primacy on issues relating to tax and spending.

Initial disclosures in the case are due by 12 November.\nLast week, Prince Andrew's lawyers argued the \"baseless lawsuit\" should be dismissed because Ms Giuffre had failed to detail her claims against him sufficiently.\nIn the court document filed last Friday, the duke's lawyers said his \"sullied reputation\" was \"only the latest collateral damage of the Epstein scandal\" and that Ms Giuffre had launched her legal action \"to achieve another payday at his expense and at the expense of those closest to him\". \nLawyers for the duke and Ms Giuffre told the court on Wednesday that they would have between eight and 12 witness depositions each.\nDavid Boies, Ms Giuffre's lawyer, said there were several potential witnesses they could not yet identify because he was unsure if he'd be able to get them to appear voluntarily, pointing to timing and location issues.\nThe judge previously ruled depositions in the case must be submitted by 14 July.\nIn the US, depositions - or out-of-court testimony - see witnesses interviewed under oath by the other side's lawyers about their version of events.\nThe prince has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's claims and, in 2019, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened.\""

He was convicted but later had the decision overturned.\nPicton's portrait has been replaced in the Faces of Wales Gallery with another portrait titled Hedger and Ditcher: Portrait of William Lloyd.\nIt was painted by Dutch artist Albert Houthuesen who was fascinated with the working life of the colliers in Trelogan, Flintshire, while on holiday in the area with his wife in the 1930s."

      "text": "A civilian employee of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said she was let down by the force after making allegations of sexual assault against a serving officer. \nSinead McGrotty said she was subjected to inappropriate comments and touching over several years by Det Con Ronan Sharkie. \nAn internal disciplinary process was carried out over the allegations.\nThe officer was not suspended at any stage and retained his job.\nDet Con Sharkie accepted one allegation of inappropriate touching and was fined \u00a3250.\nMs McGrotty's other allegations were not considered by the disciplinary panel. \nHe is one of two serving officers to have such allegations upheld against them.\nSpeaking to William Crawley on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, Ms McGrotty said the officer's inappropriate behaviour started shortly after she joined the police as a civilian administrator. \n\"It was December 2008 that I had started and early 2009 was the first assault that I had,\" she said. \nMs McGrotty said on that occasion, Det Con Sharkie slapped her \"on the bum\".\n\"I'd never experienced anything like that in a working environment before in my life and had been in and out of a lot of different public roles outside of the force. \n\"I was stunned. But I also felt quite vulnerable in that I was in a minority there, as a young Catholic girl. \n\"If I told anyone, would they believe me?\" \nAccording to Ms McGrotty, the behaviour escalated to include inappropriate comments in front of colleagues and grabbing her breasts. \nOne of the most serious alleged incidents happened when Ms McGrotty was heavily pregnant and at a colleague's wedding. \n\"We were at a wedding of a couple that worked with us and he was very drunk. Everyone was very drunk, but I was 30 weeks pregnant at that time, sitting up on a wee stool by myself. \n\"He came over and he said: 'I'm going to F you when you've had that baby'. And I just felt totally violated. And I think that was the worst thing that ever happened for me,\" she said. \nMs McGrotty said the officer subsequently stopped her in the car park to tell her that - in spite of his drunkenness - he was sincere in what he had said to her at the wedding. \n\"At that point I was quite suicidal, because I genuinely believed that he was going to rape me and it was a threat to rape,\" she said. \nMs McGrotty went on to describe how Det Con Sharkie called at her home after the baby was born and her husband was out at work. \n\"I heard the knock at the door. I went and I looked out my window and I could see his car below,\" she said.\n\"I hid and I was also trying to keep my baby quiet as well because he was ringing the doorbell and he rang my mobile phone, and I hid in the house until he left.\" \nShe reported the officer in 2012. \nThere was an investigation, but the Public Prosecution Service decided there was not enough evidence to prosecute. \nBut an internal disciplinary process then took place. \nMs McGrotty said there were 11 specific allegations, but only one of these was placed before the disciplinary panel. \nA contact avoidance plan was put in place to try to ensure that the officer did not have access to Ms McGrotty.\nShe also took the PSNI to court over the way the allegations were handled. That court case was settled in 2017.\nIn 2019, a decision was made by the PSNI to change the terms of the contact avoidance plan, after Det Con Sharkie raised concerns that the plan was inconveniencing him. \nMs McGrotty feared this could lead to her having to work near the officer and she raised this at the highest levels in the PSNI. \nShe received a letter in August 2021 from the Chief Constable Simon Byrne.\nIn that letter, the chief constable apologises for the way Ms McGrotty has been treated. \n\"I do not believe you have been treated empathetically in relation to this matter over a course of a number of years,\" Mr Byrne wrote.\n\"My prevailing impression of the entire course of events, is that once a wrong course of action was decided upon it became increasingly difficult to unravel.\n\"Whether intentional or not, I am left with an impression that there was a real concern to assist an officer to overcome a sanction which is viewed as unfair or disproportionate at a certain point.  \n\"The rationale for doing so is not entirely clear to me. What is, however, clear is that you should have been provided with more support and been treated with greater empathy. \n\"On behalf of the Police Service, I extend a sincere apology for this and the impact that it has had on you personally and professionally.\" \nBBC News NI contacted the PSNI with a number of questions for the force, for the chief constable and for Det Con Sharkie. \nThe PSNI said in a statement: \"As this matter is currently the subject of legal proceedings it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.\"\nMs McGrotty is taking an industrial tribunal against the PSNI.\nDet Con Ronan Sharkie remains a serving police officer."

      "text": "A coroner has said it was \"very unsatisfactory\" that information the Fishmongers' Hall attacker was likely to carry out an assault was not shared.\nConvicted terrorist Usman Khan fatally stabbed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones at the London venue in November 2019.\nJudge Mark Lucraft QC, who acted as the inquest coroner, has made 22 recommendations in his prevention of death report.\nHe urged the security services to work more closely with other agencies.\nHe said the case gave \"cause for concern that counter-terrorism police may be in possession of intelligence or information which may be useful to the management of an offender\" by the public protection panel, MAPPA, \"but that such intelligence or information may not be brought to the knowledge of, or taken into account by, MAPPA agencies\".\nThe inquests earlier this year found failings by the police, the Probation Service and MI5 contributed to the deaths of Mr Merritt, 25, and 23-year-old Ms Jones.\nThe inquest jury concluded that both were unlawfully killed.\nKhan, 28, from Staffordshire, was chased from Fishmongers' Hall on to London Bridge by three men, before being shot at 20 times by armed police.\nJudge Lucraft QC said the Home Office and Ministry of Justice needed to consider how intelligence known only to the Security Service MI5 could be taken into account by the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) system.\nIn his report he said: \"A very unsatisfactory situation arose whereby there was a strand of intelligence received shortly prior to Usman Khan's release from prison that he intended to carry out an attack but the MAPPA panel participants were in the main entirely ignorant of that intelligence.\n\"This case gives cause for concern that counter-terrorism police may be in possession of intelligence or information which may be useful to the management of an offender by the MAPPA panel, but that such intelligence or information may not be brought to the knowledge of or taken into account by MAPPA agencies. \n\"This issue should be addressed, preferably by ensuring that a single police officer from any covert investigation is responsible and accountable for ensuring that intelligence and information is properly shared and taken into account.\"\nJudge Lucraft also recommended that when decisions were made to vary the licence conditions of an offender this should be properly recorded by the probation officer and the MAPPA panel. \nIn the case of Khan, he was not allowed to go to railway stations but he was given specific permission to travel to London alone on a train to attend the prisoner education event where he carried out his attack.\nJurors at the inquests for Mr Merritt and Ms Jones found there had been unacceptable management and a lack of accountability in the oversight of Khan.\nThey concluded there had been failures in the sharing of information between state agencies responsible for monitoring him.\nDeficiencies in the organisation of the event at Fishmongers' Hall, including inadequate security measures, were also found to have been a factor in the deaths."

      "text": "\"I will never forget 7 January 2020, when the police came to the door to tell me that Caio, my son, had died by suicide,\" said Rhian Wyn. \n\"When the officer left, there was no mention of any support,\" she said.\nRhian and other families are calling for a support service for parents who have been bereaved by suicide. The Scottish government is funding a similar pilot scheme to help families over the next two years.\n\"We really need a support scheme similar to Scotland,\" said Rhian, from Pontrhydfendigaid, in Ceredigion.\nThe Welsh government has said it plans to publish new guidelines for the delivery of bereavement care, which should improve support for those bereaved by suicide.\n\"I will never forget that young policeman coming to the house around 21:30, informing me that Caio had died in Cardiff,\" Rhian told BBC Cymru Fyw.\n\"I'm a single mother and was living with our young daughters. It was a terrifying experience, I was screaming on the floor while the girls were sitting on the stairs. \n\"Soon the policeman had to leave and that was it.\n\"Then the police in Cardiff rang me during the early hours with a tick list. \n\"I had to answer numerous questions - did Caio have epilepsy, did he have this, did he have that? I was completely traumatised and so lonely.\"\nShe added: \"We need constant support. You don't recover from losing a child. It's on my mind all day, every day.\"\nAmanda and Geraint Williams, from Aberystwyth, had a similar experience after their daughter Phoebe died in May 2019.\n\"This is really telling it as it is, the stark reality of a loss by suicide. The only people we saw were the two policemen who knocked on the door at 02:00 who told us Phoebe had died the way she had. They stayed for no longer than 15 minutes,\" Amanda recalled.\n\"At that moment we were rendered incapable of any competent action or rational thought, it was paralysing. And then that was it, they left. We saw nobody else at all and haven't since. We weren't even asked to give statements to the police.\n\"Thankfully we had each other.\"\nAmanda added: \"Those who have been bereaved by suicide become an at-risk group and need specialist practical support, not just in the immediate aftermath but in the many months after.\"\nGetting support is vital, according to Si\u00e2n Angharad Retter, from Tremain, near Cardigan. \nHer brother Steffan, 26, took his own life in November 2018.\n\"It was an absolutely terrifying experience for me and my parents and it is so important to get support,\" she said.\n\"Soon afterwards, I and two others who had lost loved ones in similar circumstances formed the west Wales branch of LISS [Living in Suicide's Shadow].\n\"We are a group where everyone understands the pain of losing close relatives by suicide - the group gives us the opportunity to go out together and talk about experiences. \n\"Without support the whole process can be an extremely lonely experience.\"\nThe 2 Wish Upon a Star charity was founded in 2012 by Rhian Mannings following the sudden and unexpected death of her son George. Days later her husband Paul, 33, killed himself.\nThe charity has supported many families who have lost loved ones under the age of 25 - many of them by suicide.\nIn 2019, Ms Mannings petitioned the Welsh government to provide better support for families who unexpectedly lose their child or young adult.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"The loss of someone by suicide is tragic and individuals bereaved by suicide may have particularly complex feelings.\n\"We will shortly be publishing our national framework for the delivery of bereavement care in Wales. \n\"This will be supported by a \u00a31m bereavement support grant, which will be available to third sector bereavement providers. \n\"As part of this work, the National Suicide Prevention Co-ordinator for Wales is also working with key agencies to develop specific guidance to improve the response and support for people bereaved by suicide.\"\nDyfed-Powys Police has been asked to comment. South Wales Police said a number of questions have to be asked after a sudden death.\nMore information on organisations that can offer support is available at BBC Action Line"

      "text": "The mother of a nine-year-old who died within hours of saying he had a headache has spoken of her heartbreak.\nRhian Grove's son Harvey suffered a brain haemorrhage in August, a month before his 10th birthday.\nA debate was held in the Welsh Parliament after a petition called for more grief support in Wales.\nThere is currently no official support in Wales but the Welsh government said it had launched a national framework for the delivery of bereavement care.\nA spokesman said it would be supported by a \u00a31m grant, adding: \"Losing a child is devastating and we want to ensure we provide families with the care and support they need.\"\nSpeaking at Harvey's graveside, 38-year-old Mrs Grove admitted there were times when she was an \"absolute mess\".\n\"Harvey woke up one morning saying he had a really bad headache and was crying,\" Mrs Grove, from Neath, said. \n\"I was in work. My husband knew there was something wrong, so they took him straight for a CT scan, which showed he had a bleed on the brain.\"\nThe youngster was transferred to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales to have fluid drained from his brain to ease pressure on it. \n\"The bleed was worse than they thought, and Harvey passed away the same day,\" said Mrs Grove.\n\"It just came out of the blue, and we were all totally shocked because he was such an active and healthy child with no underlying conditions. It was just an utter shock.\"\nWednesday's Senedd debate comes two years after bereavement charity 2Wish presented a petition on the matter.\nThe organisation has helped Mrs Grove and her family since Harvey's death.  \n\"I dread to think if 2Wish charity hadn't been there to support us,\" she said. \n\"They've seen what we've been through and it's almost like they've put their arms around us and said 'OK, this is what we can do to help you'. And you need that support. Especially as we lost Harvey so suddenly.\"\nMrs Grove said nobody should have to go through what they have without support.\n\"As a mum, it's the worst thing. Harvey was my only child. I've lost him and it's heart-breaking to know these things aren't funded as much as they should be when there's lots of other people in my position,\" she added.\n\"Harvey was rock a star, he loved his electric guitar and he loved making music and making videos and playing computer games.\n\"He was a very lively and energetic little boy. But so kind, loving and caring. Everyone loved him.\" \nThe 2Wish petition has gathered more than 5,000 signatures, and is calling on the Welsh Parliament to urge the Welsh Government to provide immediate support to families of children aged 25 and under who die suddenly.\nThere is currently no official bereavement support for these families in Wales - it is all provided by 2wish, which works with all health boards and police forces. \nIts support is funded by donations from the public and 2wish receives no public sector financing, although it does receive National Lottery funding.\nMore than 960 families have received help from the charity since 2015.\n2Wish was set up by Rhian Mannings in 2012 after she and her husband Paul experienced the heartache of losing their baby son George. They left the hospital heartbroken, confused and bewildered with no support. Five days later, Paul took his own life.\nMs Mannings said: \"When we lost George, we walked out of the hospital with nothing, alone and frightened. \n\"Nobody came, nobody reached out to support us, apart from family and friends who were grieving themselves.  \n\"Five days after we lost our son, my husband Paul took his own life. My two other children and I were once again left heartbroken - once again, nobody came. I am determined that this will never happen again to a family in Wales.\"\nOne person that will be there to support the petition is Nadine Marshall, whose son Conner was murdered in 2015.\nShe said: \"2Wish has given us the chance to live with grief in a positive and unique way. We have benefited from alternative therapy, counselling and friendship. \n\"Meeting other families who are sadly part of a grief-stricken community has been so helpful. Knowing we can reach out at any time is comforting and very much appreciated.\"\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"Over the last two years we have worked with many charities, including 2Wish, as part of our National Bereavement Steering Group to review and improve bereavement services for families across Wales. \n\"We also held a public consultation to seek people's views. Following this work we have recently launched a new bereavement framework. The new framework sets out the support people should expect to receive if they are facing or have experienced a bereavement.\n\"The new framework is supported by a \u00a31m Bereavement Support Grant that can be accessed by the third sector. An additional \u00a3420k will also be provided to health boards.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Ecology,Royal Dutch Shell,COP26,Green economy,Oil,Environment,Oil & Gas industry,Natural gas",
      "text": "The boss of oil giant Shell has insisted it can transition to net zero by 2050, but it will need the cash from its oil and gas business to pay for it. \nBen van Beurden dismissed splitting its legacy oil and gas business from its renewables investment, a move urged by activist shareholder Third Point.\nTalking exclusively to the BBC, he said the company's plans for greener energy could only be funded by oil and gas.\n\"At this point in time [the cash] comes from our legacy business,\" he said.\nMr van Beurden was speaking at Europe's biggest oil refinery at Pernis near Rotterdam, a facility he plans to transform from refining petrol and diesel, to making biofuels and hydrogen over the next decade.  \n\"These things can only be done if you have a facility (like Pernis) to work with and if you have the cash. \n\"If we have to build a hydrogen plant from a wind farm that we build in the North Sea for a billion dollars that is not going to be funded by a hydrogen business - it will be funded by the oil and gas business,\" he said.\nBut oil and gas is not just a legacy business. Shell wants to develop new oilfields including  Cambo in the North Sea which it hopes will produce 170 million barrels of oil.  \nHow does he justify that? \nMr van Beurden says the decision on the Cambo oilfield is ultimately one for government but says it makes no sense to substitute UK resources for foreign imports to satisfy domestic demand.  \nHe said: \"Why would you say: Let's not get our oil and gas demands from our own resources but let's import from somewhere else, probably with a larger carbon footprint. \n\"I don't think that it is going to contribute to the balance of payment for the UK and also will not help the carbon footprint of the world.\"\nShell currently has a global carbon footprint the size of Russia's if you include the emissions from customers using Shell products. \nIt plans to spend four times as much on oil and gas development as on renewables next year. This is why some doubt that Shell can hit either its own targets and those imposed by a Dutch court which require it to halve its own net emissions by 2030 and eliminate them entirely by 2050. Shell is planning to appeal part of the ruling. \nShell is also expected to make its best efforts to reduce the emissions of its customers - which make up 90% of Shell's overall carbon footprint. Shell intends to appeal that court judgement.  \nShu Ling Liauw from research firm Global Climate Insights  has analysed the oil firm's spending plans and estimates that Shell will be producing more emissions by 2030 than it is now as it intends to grow its gas business.   \n\"Even if you're very generous, and assume they get all the amounts of carbon capture and storage and offsets that they need, they might just miss their 2030 targets, and they will not be able to deliver on 2050.\n\"In fact, they will be increasing emissions until 2030, and still be producing significant amounts of emissions in 2050,\" she says.\nMr van Beurden says these estimates are speculative and insists Shell is on track, having cut the carbon intensity of its own operations by 17% since 2016. \nShell is a major component of the UK's leading share index. If you have a pension you are almost certainly a part owner of Shell, BP and other oil and gas companies.  \nThere is growing clamour on the part of many pension fund trustees and their scheme members to dump or divest shares in fossil fuel businesses to starve them of capital. That would be a mistake, according the world's largest asset manager Blackrock which looks after 13 trillion dollars in pensions and savings. \n\"You can't divest from the world. It's much better to engage with companies and use your influence as a shareholder. If you divest, you lose that influence,\" said Sandy Boss, head of investment stewardship.\nOthers point out that if Shell itself were to sell its oil and gas business, those assets would be hoovered up by companies that might be less transparent and less inclined to make the effort to decarbonise.  \nAs the recent energy crisis brutally exposed, the UK along with the rest of the world is still hugely reliant on fossil fuel. That reliance needs to be managed down over time according to Mr van Beurden otherwise we will see price shocks in the future that will be counterproductive.\n\"I think this energy transition can be done but it will require a lot of orchestration and a lot of faith of society that it can be done. `\n\"If you want to destroy the faith by driving up energy prices, by creating shortages or market failures, I think politicians are going to lose societal acceptance that this is actually doable.\"\nAs powerful as Shell is, its customers may be more powerful. \nAs long as there is demand for fossil fuels. Shell or someone else will supply it. That demand can be influenced by government carrot or stick, companies can be squeezed by financiers but consumer behaviour will ultimately determine whether the world can hit net zero by 2050.  "

      "text": "New figures have revealed the ongoing problems the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has in hiring more officers from a Catholic background.\nOf 193 officers recruited in 2020, 75% (144) were Protestant and 24% (46) were Catholic.\nIt comes as the PSNI launches a new recruitment drive in the week that marks 20 years since it was established.\nOne of its priorities has been increasing Catholic officer numbers.\nThe PSNI is hoping to hire 400 student officers from its latest recruitment campaign.\nIn 2001, under policing reforms, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), which was overwhelmingly Protestant, was renamed the PSNI.\nOne of the aims was to build broader community support and increase Catholic officers.\nFor that reason, it regularly publishes figures on the perceived religious background of applicants and officers.\nLegislation, which ran for a decade until 2011, saw Catholic officer numbers increase fourfold - they now make up 32% of the service's 7,000 officers.\nBut since the legislation ended the increase has stalled and there have been warnings numbers could begin to fall back.\nUnionist parties do not support its re-introduction.\nWhen the 2020 recruitment campaign launched, Sinn F\u00e9in politicians attended for the first time.\nIn terms of applications, 66% were from those of a perceived Protestant background, 31% Catholic and the remainder were undetermined.\nBut when it came to appointees, 75% were Protestant and 24% Catholic - though recruitment is said to be \"ongoing\".\nThe PSNI has remarked upon this issue previously and pointed out that Catholic applicants can drop out as a result, for example, of the prospect of having to leave the community they grew up in.\nSinn F\u00e9in's policing board member Gerry Kelly said there had been change within the PSNI.\n\"People have come to me for assistance to join the PSNI and I have given them every assistance I possibly can,\" said the North Belfast assembly member.\nHowever, Mr Kelly said he could not tie himself \"to every act the PSNI do\", adding the \"biggest issue\" facing the force was how to deal with legacy.\nMervyn Storey, chair of Stormont's justice committee, said he believed people \"from all sections of our community\" should be encouraged to join the police service.\n\"What we want to see is not political interference, it is effective, efficient policing so that whether you're in a loyalist community or a nationalist republican community, or whatever community you're in, you'll know that if you break the law there'll be a police service that will do all in their power to apprehend you,\" said the DUP assembly member.\nSDLP policing board member Dolores Kelly said her party had \"always encouraged Catholics to consider a career in the PSNI\".\n\"Despite attempts from some narrow-minded elements in our communities to dissuade Catholics from considering a career in policing it is a vocation to be proud of,\" said the Upper Bann MLA.\nLord Patten, who was chair of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland which delivered the recommendations on police reform, said that in \"structural terms\" the proposal of 50-50 recruitment, which ran until 2011, was probably the most innovative.\n\"It was difficult as we sold our vision of policing to persuade some elements in both cultures, in both sides of the community, to accept that they had to change as well - it wasn't just a question of policing change,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.\n\"It was important to persuade for example people in the republican/nationalist community that if they wanted to be police officers they should be doing their policing in Northern Ireland, not elsewhere, because there was no shortage of Northern Ireland recruits in policing in Glasgow, London, Birmingham, Manchester - they just weren't joining the police service in Northern Ireland.\n\"We thought that was something that had to change and it was important that the Catholic Church was as open as possible to the idea, as well as the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association).\"\nDeputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told Good Morning Ulster \"there are still issues in communities about how people feel about the police in both sides\".\nHowever, Mr Hamilton said there are \"huge differences\" between the RUC and the PSNI.\n\"There are so many things that are different for constables joining now, we are more visible, whenever I was a constable we very rarely drove around in a marked police car, now most of our police cars are marked,\" he said.\nAhead of the new recruitment campaign, Acting Assistant Chief Constable Bobby Singleton said: \"There is a role for wider society in terms of showing support to people who want to take that step and serve their communities.\n\"We want policing to be a career for everybody. We want it to be a reflection of our society.\"\nThe dissident republican threat against PSNI officers and how the organisation handles troubles legacy issues are both seen as factors which can affect Catholic recruitment.\nThe PSNI also faces challenges improving the number of officers from an ethnic minority background (currently below 1%) and the number of women in senior positions."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The COP26 climate summit is under way in Glasgow - one of the biggest ever world meetings on how to tackle global warming. \nBBC News Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris answers some of your questions.\nYou can send a question using the form at the bottom of this page.\nHow is the average family going to find the extra \u00a320,000 needed to buy an electric vehicle?  Nicola Hippisley, London\nYou don't necessarily need an extra \u00a320,000 to buy an electric vehicle. \nOverall, electric cars have been more expensive than petrol or diesel ones for some time, but the difference has been narrowing. \nThe average cost of an electric car in the UK is about \u00a344,000, but you can buy a basic one for less than \u00a320,000. That's partly because the price of the batteries which electric cars use has fallen sharply in recent years. \nAt the moment, the price of raw materials is threatening to push battery prices up again, but the industry expects that as electric car sales increase, economies of scale will kick in. \nExperts predict that new electric and petrol/diesel cars will cost the same within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market as well, where vehicles are much cheaper. \nThe UK government currently offers a grant of up to \u00a32,500 as a discount on the price of certain brand new low-emission vehicles including some electric models. \nYou can also claim a grant of up to \u00a3350 to help meet the cost of installing a chargepoint at your house if you have dedicated off-street parking. This is available whether you lease your car or own it outright. \nSeparately, the Scottish government offers interest-free loans to help people buy brand new or used electric vehicles. \nHow will the decisions made at COP26 change our day-to-day lives? I want to know what I can do to help move these policies forward. Matthew Hadley, Harpenden\nThe decisions made at COP26 are part of the wider ambition to decarbonise our economies - and that will certainly have an impact on daily life. \nThe cars we drive and the way we heat our homes are going to change. Buying an electric vehicle, or getting a heat pump installed at home, is going to become more and more common. The hope - and for many the expectation - is that as these technologies become more established, the costs will come down. \nThere are also personal choices to be made about what we eat (the Climate Change Committee which advises the government recommends a 20% reduction per person by 2050 in the amount of beef, lamb and dairy we consume), and how often we fly. \nThen there are practical issues like recycling and cutting down on waste as much as possible. \nWhy are we still referring to 2050 as some sort of end goal, since very little has changed in the last two decades? Wouldn't 2040 or perhaps even 2030 put a little more urgency into every little step humanity takes? Jake Kettmann, Bega, NSW, Australia\nThe year 2050 is the target date set by many countries for reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. But you're not alone in thinking that 2050 is much too far in the future to force some politicians or companies to take action now. \nThat's why there are also plenty of interim targets, and the 2020s have been identified as a critical decade for climate action - it can't all be delayed until the 10 years leading up to 2050.\nMany of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases have now set targets for 2030, and the UN says overall emissions need to fall by 45% [by that date]compared to 2010 levels, if the aim of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is to remain realistic. \nAt the moment, though, the world is nowhere near achieving that, even with the new pledges made at COP26.\nIf scientists have already considered a 1.5C reduction goal will not be achieved, why don't we set up a new goal, which we may able to achieve? Ana, Vietnam\nQuite a few scientists think it may already be too late to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but they'd rather have an ambitious target to aim for. \nThe Paris Agreement in 2015 set the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C. So \"well below 2C\" is already written into law as a secondary target. \nThere's also a growing awareness of the need to take action which will make a difference in the next five to 10 years. That's why many of the agreements made at COP26 - to reverse deforestation, for example, or to cut global methane emissions by 30% - set 2030 as their target date. \nThe challenge now of course is to turn those promises into practice, and to deliver urgent change.\nHow can we be sure the claims made about greenhouse gas emissions can be verified? What independent observer is measuring different countries' attempts to reduce their fossil fuel usage? Lee Gary, Spain\nChecking claims made about greenhouse gas emissions is one of the biggest issues for negotiators at COP26. \nAt the moment, countries only have to review and update their pledges for cutting emissions every five years. Many people argue that's not often enough, and some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change want to turn it into an annual process to keep the pressure on. \nThe role of independent observer is supposed to be filled by UN scientists. But a recent investigation by The Washington Post found multiple examples of flawed or inaccurate data submitted to the UN by individual countries. It is another example of climate promises falling short of what is required, as a process which relies so heavily on data needs to ensure that the data is accurate.\nLast month, a UN-backed body launched a scheme to verify net zero claims made by big companies, to ensure that corporate pledges can be easily compared and properly scrutinised.\nIs there a way to force countries in the UN, especially China and India, to cut back to net zero by 2050? Can sanctions or similar trade restrictions be used against them? Diana Butungi, Kampala\nOnly a few countries have made their net zero pledges legally binding. Many of the national pledges are non-binding targets, but there is a hope that as momentum towards net zero begins to accelerate it will provide an incentive for others to follow. \nIt would be possible in theory to impose trade or other sanctions on countries that are moving more slowly, but that could be counter-productive. The focus of meetings like COP26 is to try to encourage international cooperation. \nIt's also unfair to put all the blame on countries like India and China for the majority of carbon emissions, even though China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world today and India is the third largest. China and India have huge populations, and much lower emissions per person than more developed countries.\nIn any case, it's important to consider the historical role played by European countries and the United States which are responsible for far more cumulative emissions than China or India. \nThe damaging effects of emitting CO2 into the atmosphere linger for hundreds of years, and the rich world has acknowledged that it has the primary responsibility for tackling climate change.\nAre there plans for governments and countries to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? If not, why? Bernath Bence, Netherlands\nThe trouble with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is that the technology that does exist, won't be rolled out fast enough to make any significant difference this decade, when greenhouse gas emissions need to fall significantly.  \nIn 2020, for example, the UK allocated \u00a31bn to a CCS infrastructure fund, with the ambition of capturing the equivalent of 10m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. \nThat target has already been increased to capturing 20-30m metric tonnes by 2030. But, to put that in perspective, the UK is estimated to have produced the net equivalent of more than 450m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2019.\nGovernment investment varies hugely around the world. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia are relying very heavily on CCS to allow them to continue producing fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, but that means scaling up the technology in a way which has not yet been proven to work effectively.  \nHow do agricultural products like rice and sugar contribute to the increase of CO2? What can we do to help reduce emissions? Ng Wee Meng, Singapore\nMost forms of agriculture produce CO2 emissions in one way or another.  \nBeef is widely agreed to be the most carbon-intensive food to produce globally, but there are emissions from sugar and rice - these are connected with factors such as deforestation, animal feed, energy used in processing and transport, and packaging. \nOne study estimates that rice, for example, produces the equivalent of 4kg of CO2 emissions for every 1kg of rice produced. Given that 755 million tonnes of rice are produced every year around the world, that is a lot of CO2. On the other hand, rice is an essential staple food feeding billions around the world.  \nThe best way to help reduce emissions is to try to ensure you eat food which is produced as sustainably as possible - although many people may not have the luxury of that choice.\nWould enforcing quotas for meat consumption and flight travels be efficient and feasible? Anonymous, Geneva\nMeat eating (especially beef) and travelling by air both have a sizeable environmental impact. \nEating one or two hamburgers a week for a year creates the same amount of greenhouse gases as heating a UK home for 95 days.\nAnd a return economy flight from London to New York emits about 0.67 tonnes of CO2. That's 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK.\nIn theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption or flying would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. \nThe UK Climate Change Committee - which advises the government - has recommended that people should consume 20% less meat and dairy by 2030, and 35% less by 2050. People are also being urged to think about flying less. \nUsing taxation to make certain things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. \nWhy can't we have an international fund to help poorer countries attain zero carbon emissions? Robert Patterson, Darlington\nThat is partly what the current debate on climate finance is all about. \nIn 2009, rich countries said they would provide $100bn (\u00a373bn) every year to the developing world by 2020. But they have been unable to live up to their promise, and they are now suggesting they will only meet that target in 2023. \nPoorer countries need this money to help tackle the effects of climate change that they are already facing. But they also need it to make sure their economies become greener as they develop, on a path to net zero carbon emissions.   \nIf it is people causing climate change, what is being done to stop over-population ? Gaye Schmidt, Perth, Australia\nOverpopulation isn't the root cause of climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. And the richest one per cent of the world's population is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest fifty per cent. \nIt is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nIs the global capitalist model not at odds with climate change and the need for a greener way of life? Andrew, Exeter\nMatt McGrath writes:\nAccording to some experts, such as the economist Lord Stern, climate change can be seen as the great failure of the market. \nThis is because businesses have not generally had to pay for the damage they have caused to the environment.\nGlobal efforts to tackle climate change over the past two decades have focused more on harnessing capitalism to limit warming - for instance, putting a price on carbon and making the polluter pay, to ensure that emissions are ultimately restricted.\nMeanwhile, it's also the case that if there's consumer demand for greener products and services, capitalism will try to meet that demand.\nBut there's evidently still a lot of work to be done to make these approaches work.\nDoes COP26 really need 25,000 people there? They will generate a lot of CO2, so why can't many elements be online? David, Birmingham\nMatt McGrath writes:\nThe pandemic might be seen as the perfect moment for the UN to use technology for negotiations, and it was attempted during a preparatory meeting for COP in June, which ran for three weeks.\nUnfortunately, it didn't go well - time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources, progress was limited and decisions were put off.\nAs a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far easier for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection.\nThey also bring a lived experience of climate change that it is critical for rich countries to hear first-hand.\nThere's some evidence that this works. In 2015, the presence of island states and vulnerable nations was key to securing the commitment to limit temperature changes to 1.5C in the Paris Agreement.\nWhat questions do you have about changes in our climate? \nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "A bid to protect millions of pupils in England from \"the disaster\" of future school and college shutdowns has been given an unopposed first reading in the Commons.\nRobert Halfon, chairman of the Commons Education Committee, argued closing schools had caused too much harm,.\nMr Halfon wants ministers to consult the Children's Commissioner, and allow MPs a vote on any future closure plans.\nEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said keeping schools open was his priority.\nHe told the education committee earlier on Wednesday he would look at Mr Halfon's Bill, but stopped short of backing it.\nHe added: \"Protecting face-to-face learning is my absolute priority. I have no plans whatsoever to close schools again.\"\nHe said pupil vaccination and the testing regime was the way he intended to stop schools from needing to close.\nSchool closures since the start of the coronavirus pandemic have resulted in children losing around 58% of all classroom time.\nThere was one period of lockdown in England from March to July 2020, and a further period at the beginning of 2021 in which schools were closed. \nThis has led to children missing huge chunks of their education, and has had an impact on mental health and wellbeing.\nMr Halfon says such a huge decision should not be taken by ministers alone.\nThe Schools and Education Settings (Essential Infrastructure and Opening During Emergencies) Bill seeks to ensure educational settings - including early years, schools, colleges and universities - are classified as \"essential infrastructure\".\nThis means they would remain open to all students during any public health or other national emergency.\nMr Halfon wants ministers to consult England's Children's Commissioner, who represents children's interests, on whether any regional or national school and education lockdown is appropriate.\nIf approved, MPs would then be asked to debate and vote on the issue.\nIf that is approved, the matter would have to return to Parliament every three weeks, in case of a further extension.\nThis is being described as a \"triple lock\".\n\"Whilst national lockdowns were important to protect the health of the public, school closures have been nothing short of a disaster for our children,\" said Mr Halfon.\n\"By ensuring that any decision taken to close schools is done so following the recommendation of the Children's Commissioner, is agreed and voted on by a majority of Parliament, and is strictly time-limited, we can make sure the best interests of the child are considered at every stage to keep children in school.\n\"We owe it to our children to safeguard their educational futures, which Covid-19 put on hold.\"\nDame Rachel De Souza, Children's Commissioner for England said: \"There is no doubt that children paid a high price for their time away from school, and now is the moment to put children at the heart of the recovery from the pandemic. \n\"That is why it is absolutely right for us to do all we can to keep schools open for children. \n\"A 'triple lock' would mean children's needs were considered at every stage to keep children in school.\"\nThe Bill is also backed by the former Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, who said: \"Never again must schools have to compete with pubs, theme parks and Primark to open.\"\nAssociation of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton supported the move, adding; \"Schools and colleges have been thrown under the bus during the coronavirus pandemic. \n\"They have been asked to carry out a range of public health tasks with minimal support from the government, as well as cope with constantly changing guidance and chaotic policy-making.\"\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"We acted swiftly during the pandemic to minimise the impact on children's education and wellbeing, and help keep pupils in face-to-face education as much as possible.\"\nBut Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said no one wants to see any further school closures. \n\"But this Bill misses the point. Rather than thinking about political mechanisms to prevent school closures, we need the government to do far more to help keep classes open.\"\nThe Bill will be presented for a second reading in February next year."

      "tags": "French Guiana,Astronomy,Nasa,European Space Agency,James Webb Space Telescope,Hubble Telescope,Space exploration,United States",
      "text": "Engineers like to describe the process of landing a rover on Mars as the \"seven minutes of terror\". \nThat's how long it takes for a robot to come to a standing-stop at the surface of the Red Planet after entering the atmosphere faster than a rifle bullet; and so much has to go right in-between to avoid smashing into the ground.\nBut when it comes to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it's more like \"two weeks of terror\".\nThe successor observatory to the mighty Hubble telescope has been built to see the very first stars to shine in the Universe. \nThese very faint, very distant targets require a huge telescope design, one that is so big it has to be folded to fit inside its launch rocket, and then, once in orbit, unfolded again to begin taking pictures of the cosmos.\nThis unfurling has been called an origami exercise in reverse, where the delicate figure is the size of a tennis court.\nIt all takes place over a period of about 14 days, immediately after the launch in mid-December. \nIt will involve an astonishing symphony of hinges, motors, gears, springs, pulleys and cables - all of which must work on command and to perfection.\nThere are no fewer than 344 \"single point failures\" - critical moments in the timeline where, if the action doesn't occur on cue, the six-tonne telescope cannot achieve the desired configuration, fatally undermining its $10bn mission.\nThe expansion of the five super-thin membranes that will shield Webb's vision from interfering sunlight look particularly tricky. Heart-stopping, to be honest. But there is a quiet confidence in the engineering teams, led by the US space agency (Nasa) and aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman (NG). And that's because they've tested and rehearsed everything, over and over and over again.\n\"The sunshield is like a skydiver's parachute; it needs to be folded perfectly so that it unfolds and deploys perfectly without snags, without any tangles,\" said Northrop Grumman systems engineer Krystal Puga.\n\"To perfect the sequence, we performed multiple deployment testing over several years on both small and full-size models. We practised not only the deployment but also the stowing process. This gives us the confidence that Webb is going to deploy successfully.\"\nWebb's drama begins almost as soon as the telescope comes off the top of its European Ariane rocket.\nFirst, the solar array must come out. No power, no mission. Then, the high-gain antenna makes its move, enabling two-way communications with the ground. No comms, no commands.\nBut all that's kind of easy compared with what comes next.\n\"When I started in this business about 40 years ago, I remember one of the first lessons I got taught was to avoid deployments on orbit,\" said Mike Menzel, Nasa's lead mission systems engineer on the project.\n\"James Webb cannot avoid the deployments. In fact, James Webb has to perform some of the most complex deployment sequences ever attempted, and these come with many challenges.\"\nWhat if something goes awry? \nThere are no cameras to show what's occurring when the mechanisms are doing their thing. Part of the reasoning for omitting them is that they wouldn't be much use anyway in the dark shadow that's supposed to be cast by the sunshield.\nSo the teams will be relying on sensor feedback, and if a problem arises, they'll work through their \"fault trees\" until a solution is found.\nIn extremis, it's possible even to give the telescope a bit of a shake to free a mechanism that might have become stuck.\n\"When I say, for instance, shimmy, you're rocking the observatory back and forth,\" explained Alphonso Stewart, Nasa's Webb deployment systems lead.\n\"In terms of a twirl, we basically can spin the observatory about any given axis. And for fire and ice, we can orient the observatory in such a way to put the sun on certain areas to heat them up, if we deem that that's necessary for the deployment,\" he told BBC News.\nWebb is due to enter service about 180 days after launch, a time period that includes tuning the performance of the telescope's mirrors and instruments. But the engineers will not rush their tasks, especially if they come up against a snag.\n\"I've been the Webb project manager for almost 11 years, and this team does not give up,\" said Bill Ochs.\n\"So, we don't talk about what do we do if we fail? We talk about how we correct problems that we see on orbit, and how we move forward from there.\""

      "text": "Ex-minister Owen Paterson could be suspended from the Commons for 30 days after an MPs' watchdog found he had \"repeatedly\" used his position as an MP to benefit two companies who paid him as a consultant.\nThe watchdog described his actions as \"an egregious case of paid advocacy\".\nIn reply, the Conservative MP said: \"The process I have been subjected to does not comply with natural justice.\"\n\"I am not guilty and a fair process would exonerate me,\" he added.\nMr Paterson said the process was \"a major contributory factor\" in the death of his wife, Rose, who took her own life last year.\nThe committee said the allegations related to events which took place before Mrs Paterson's death.\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone opened an investigation into the North Shropshire MP following accusations he had lobbied on behalf of two companies who employed him.\nHer report said he was a paid consultant to Randox and Lynn's Country Foods and had made approaches to the Food Standards Agency and Department for International Development ministers about the companies. \nThe commissioner also found Mr Paterson had breached the MPs' code of conduct by using his parliamentary office on 16 occasions for meetings relating to his outside business interests between October 2016 and February 2020 - and in sending two letters relating to business interests on House of Commons headed notepaper.\nThe report noted that there was no immediate financial benefit secured by the two companies, but that Mr Paterson's approaches could \"clearly have conferred significant benefits on Randox and Lynn's in the long term and even in the short term secured meetings that would not have been available without Mr Paterson's involvement\".\nThe Standards Committee recommended that Mr Paterson, who is a former Northern Ireland Secretary, be suspended from Parliament for 30 sitting days, which will now be debated. \nIf an MP is suspended for more than 10 sitting days by a parliamentary committee, this can automatically trigger a recall petition - something which could lead to a by-election in their seat. \nMr Paterson has strongly denied any wrongdoing. \nSpeaking to the BBC, the former environment secretary said he was \"absolutely stunned\" by the report's recommendations. \nHe said he had wanted to alert the environment department about carcinogenic products in milk and ham, defending his actions as \"absolutely right\" and arguing that it had \"saved lives\". \n\"If it happened again this morning, I would do it again,\" he added.\nThe MP accused the commissioner and the committee of not talking to him until months into the investigation and failing to hear from his 17 witnesses.\nHe claims he was pronounced guilty by the commissioner \"without being spoken to\" and that \"no proper investigation was undertaken\".\nThe BBC has been told the committee interviewed Mr Paterson and reviewed all the witness statements he provided, while the commissioner offered Mr Paterson an interview but he didn't proceed with it.  \nA spokesperson for Randox said it was aware of the report, adding: \"Randox does not wish, or need, to comment on this investigation.  This is a matter for Mr Paterson and the relevant parliamentary authorities.\"\nA spokesperson for Lynn's Country Foods said the company would not be making a statement.\nIn Mr Paterson's response to the committee report he said: \"I lost my beloved wife of 40 years and this process was a major contributory factor.\" \nHe said the way the investigation was conducted \"undoubtedly played a major role\", saying: \"Rose would ask me despairingly every weekend about the progress of the inquiry, convinced that the investigation would go to any lengths to somehow find me in the wrong.\"\nMr Paterson told the BBC the investigation had \"destroyed the last quarter of my life\" and that his wife had been \"very rattled\" by the inquiry.\nIn the report, the committee said it was \"painfully conscious that Mr Paterson lost his wife in tragic circumstances in June 2020\".\n\"We wish to express our deepest sympathy to him for his loss - this last year must have been very distressing for him and we have taken these circumstances fully into account in considering Mr Paterson's conduct during the period of the investigation.\"\nHowever, the committee said the allegations related to conduct prior to Mrs Paterson's death and that \"it is these allegations on which we are required to adjudicate, impartially, without fear or favour, and with a sole eye to the rules of the House and the requirements of natural justice\".\nIt added that it was \"very possible that grief and distress caused by this event has affected the way in which Mr Paterson approached the Commissioner's investigation thereafter\".\nThe committee also noted other mitigating factors including Mr Paterson's ill health.\nThe committee said Mr Paterson's \"evident passion for and expertise\" in food and farming was \"admirable\" but warned it should be \"channelled within the rules of the House\".\nListing \"aggravating factors\" that influenced the recommended punishment for Mr Paterson, it said: \"No previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of behaviour in failing to separate private and public interests.\"\nIt added that \"Mr Paterson's financial remuneration from Randox and Lynn's amounted to nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary\" and that during the investigation Mr Paterson had \"made serious, personal, and unsubstantiated allegations against the integrity of the commissioner and her team\"."

      "text": "A four-year-old girl missing for 18 days in a remote part of Western Australia has been found alive and well in a locked house, police have said.\nCleo Smith disappeared from her family's tent at a campsite near the town of Carnarvon on 16 October, triggering a massive search.\nA 36-year-old man is in custody and being questioned by detectives.\nPolice smashed their way into a home in Carnarvon in the early hours of Wednesday, following forensic clues.\n\"They found little Cleo in one of the rooms,\" Deputy Commissioner Col Blanch from WA Police said in a statement.\n\"One of the officers picked her up into his arms and asked her, 'What's your name?' She said 'My name is Cleo'.\"\nThe girl has been reunited with her parents, who had made desperate pleas for Cleo's return.\n\"Our family is whole again,\" her mother, Ellie Smith, wrote on Instagram.\nPolice footage of Cleo's rescue showed her \"smiling\" and \"as well as we could expect in the circumstances\", said Commissioner Chris Dawson, who added she was receiving medical care.\nAuthorities say the man in custody has no connection to the Smith family. No charges have been laid.\nThe house where Cleo was found is about six minutes' drive from her family home in Carnarvon, which has about 5,000 residents.\nAustralian PM Scott Morrison tweeted it was \"wonderful, relieving news\". Commissioner Dawson said: \"I think Australia is rejoicing.\"\n\"To find a little girl - a vulnerable little girl - after 18 days. You know, obviously people think the worst, but importantly hope was never lost,\" the commissioner added.\nCleo's family were on the first night of their holiday at the Quobba Blowholes camping ground when she went missing between 01:30 and 06:00 on 16 October.\nThe remote site in Macleod is about 900km (560 miles) north of Perth, and is a local attraction on the state's Coral Coast - known for its windswept ocean scenery, sea caves and lagoons.\nCleo had been sleeping on an air mattress next to her younger sister's cot. When her mother, who had been sleeping in the second room of the tent, got up in the morning, Cleo was gone and the tent door was open.\nPolice said this raised fears of an abduction. Ms Smith was adamant Cleo could not have left the tent on her own.\nA taskforce of 100 officers were sent in from the state capital, Perth, to join a massive air, land and sea search. Reconnaissance planes were used to comb sparsely populated areas.\nAuthorities offered a A$1m ($750,000; \u00a3540,000) reward for information on Cleo's whereabouts.\nThe case drew international attention, and there were reports that bounty hunters had travelled to the region once the cash reward had been offered.\nDeputy Commissioner Blanch said they scoured thousands of pieces of information looking for a \"needle in a haystack\".\n\"Late last night they found that needle that led them to that address and rescued Cleo,\" he told Network Seven.\nPolice said it involved information about a car, but would not elaborate.\nABC News reported a man who lived at the house had been recently spotted by a neighbour buying nappies.\n\"We didn't click who\u2026 he was buying them for,\" the neighbour was quoted as saying.\nNews that Cleo has been found sparked a sense of huge relief in the local community.\n\"For 18 days we've been filled with anxiety and concern,\" Carnarvon Shire president Eddie Smith told Australia's 2GB radio.\nDeputy Commissioner Blanch told 6PR radio that it had been \"incredible to see seasoned detectives openly crying with relief\".\nPolice said they did not expect the reward to be claimed."

      "tags": "China,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "China's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries. \nExperts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change.\nIn 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. \nHis statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow.\nBut China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved.  \nWhile all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge. \nPer person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. \nChina became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions. \nIt is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these. \nAlong with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and \"well below\" 2C.\nChina strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are \"highly insufficient\".  \nGetting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift.\nCoal has been the country's main source of energy for decades.\nPresident Xi says China will \"phase down\" coal use from 2026 - and will not build new coal-fired projects abroad - but some governments and campaigners say the plans are not going far enough. \nResearchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing say China will need to stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production. \nAnd far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant.\nNew stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris.   \nIt may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use. \nChina argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty.\nIn the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines to increase production to avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages in several regions of the country in recent weeks.\nTsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050.\nIn moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help. \nChina first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities. \nBut the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas.\n\"China is already leading the global energy transition,\" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. \"One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China.\" \nChina generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading.\nChina's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020.\nChina says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early. \nChina ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin. \nCurrently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered.\nBy 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid.\nWorking out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources. \nBut studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents. \nThis matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, with road vehicles being the largest emitters. \nChina will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined.\nObservers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale.\nGetting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions.\nIt means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches.\nIncreasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide.\nHere again, there is encouraging news. China is getting greener at a faster rate than any other country, largely as a result of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and pollution.\nIt is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer. \nThe world needs China to succeed. \n\"Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change,\" says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre.\nChina has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments.  \nThe Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task. What happens next could hardly be more important."

      "text": "The Taliban has banned the use of foreign currencies in Afghanistan, a move that could further disrupt an economy on the brink of collapse.\n\"The economic situation and national interests in the country require that all Afghans use Afghani currency in their every trade,\" the Taliban said.\nThe economy is struggling due to the withdrawal of international financial support after the Taliban took control.\nThe US dollar has been used widely in Afghanistan's markets.\nDollars are also often used for trade in areas bordering Afghanistan's neighbours such as Pakistan.\n\"The Islamic Emirate instructs all citizens, shopkeepers, traders, businessmen and the general public to henceforth conduct all transactions in Afghanis and strictly refrain from using foreign currency,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement posted online.\n\"Anyone violating this order will face legal action,\" the statement said.\nAfter the Taliban seized control of the country in August, billions of dollars of Afghanistan's overseas assets were frozen by the US Federal Reserve and central banks in Europe.\n\"We believe that it's essential that we maintain our sanctions against the Taliban but at the same time find ways for legitimate humanitarian assistance to get to the Afghan people. That's exactly what we're doing,\" Deputy United States Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told the US Senate Banking Committee last month.\nThe Taliban has called for the release of Afghanistan's assets that are being held overseas as the nation faces a severe cash crunch.\nAfghanistan has also been hit by the exodus of foreign aid. Grants from overseas previously financed three quarters of its public spending. \nEarlier this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Afghanistan will no longer be able to access its resources, while the World Bank also halted funding for projects in the country.\nLast month, the IMF warned that the country's economy could shrink by 30% this year, pushing millions into poverty and causing a humanitarian crisis.\nThe fund also said that Afghanistan's economic woes could fuel a refugee crisis impacting neighbouring countries, Turkey and Europe.\nThe country is also suffering from a severe drought, which has ruined much of its wheat crop and sent prices soaring. \nThe United Nations World Food Programme has warned that millions of Afghans could face starvation due to a combination of the drought, conflict and Covid-19.\nHowever, although Western powers have said that they want to avoid a humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan, they have refused to officially recognise the Taliban government."

      "tags": "Carbon capture and storage,Greenhouse gas emissions,COP26,Climate change,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Countries have set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.\nThey hope to achieve the target of \"net zero\" by 2050, to help slow global warming.\nNet zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nAchieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.\nGreenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.\nMeanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.\nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises \"well below\" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. \nExperts say that to achieve this, net zero must be reached by 2050. \nNot all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain have to be compensated for, or offset - for example, by planting more trees.\nAlmost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of reducing carbon, although there may not be enough space for the number required.\nCarbon capture and storage has also been suggested as another solution. \nThis involves using machinery to remove carbon from the air, then solidifying it and burying it underground.\nHowever, the technology is still emerging, very expensive and as yet unproven.\nIt won't be easy. \nReaching net zero will involve moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our power, and abandoning vehicles run on petrol and diesel, in favour of those powered by electricity and hydrogen.\nGas central heating will need to be replaced by alternative sources, such as heat pumps. \nReaching net zero could also mean flying far less in future, and eating less red meat.\nPresenting the government's net zero strategy to the House of Commons in the run up to COP26, the government pledged:\nThe government had already announced a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, and that all the UK's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035.\nAt the time, Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband called the latest announcements \"a massive let-down\".\nMore than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050.\nHowever, China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 in the world - says it's aiming for \"carbon neutrality\" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. \nRussia - the third-largest producer of oil worldwide - has also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. \nUntil recently President Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures.\nUS President Joe Biden criticised the Russian and Chinese leaders for not attending the COP26 summit. \nIndia - the world's fourth biggest emitter of CO2 after China, the US and the EU - has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070. \nSome of the world's most heavily populated countries - including Indonesia - haven't made any net zero commitment.\nBut many of the announcements which have already come out of the COP26 summit on deforestation, cutting methane and reducing coal are directly linked to helping countries hit their net zero goal.\nThere's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.\nFor instance, Country A might record lower emissions if it shuts down energy-intensive industries such as steel production. \nBut if Country A then imports steel from Country B, it's effectively handed on its carbon emissions to Country B instead of reducing the sum total of greenhouse gases.\nThere are schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. \nHowever, some climate scientists worry such arrangements could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their own fossil fuel usage. \nAnd it's hard to say that initiatives funded to offset emissions elsewhere would not have happened anyway.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

It caught my attention,\" he told the inquest, adding the crash happened about 12 to 15 seconds later. \nHe said he saw the canopy of the jet shatter and the pilot ejecting just a fraction of a second before seeing the aircraft explode in a ball of flames.\nSqn Ldr Morris told the hearing the best engineers were chosen to accompany pilots on certain sorties. \nHe added pilots had to regularly perform certain manoeuvres, such as a practised engine failure on take-off, and such manoeuvres had to be cleared before flights.\nHe also said the sortie in which Cpl Bayliss died would not happen any more.\nThe coroner asked Sqn Ldr Morris what training Cpl Bayliss and other non-pilots would have received in how to operate the ejector seat in the jet.\nHe said he could not talk about what the practice was in 2018 but now anyone flying in a jet would be taken to a hangar, put in practice seat, shown how to strap themselves in \"and then you show them how to pull the handle\". \nHe said once in the air, the pilot could not operate the ejector seat for the other person.\nCharlotte Law, representing Fl Lieut Stark, asked whether the volume and tempo of work for new members of the Red Arrows was intense, to which Sqn Ldr Morris replied: \"The pressure you put yourself under can be intense.\"\n\"Particularly during the spring months when you start to develop the formations... There will probably be moments when you question your own ability to do the job. \n\"It's a job you go into whole-heartedly and with 100% commitment,\" he added.\nHe also said that members of the Red Arrows have a range of other duties, including dealing with the press and members of the public.\n\"It's all part of being part of the Red Arrows,\" he said.\nSqn Ldr Morris confirmed he had instructed Flt Lt Stark before he joined the Red Arrows in 2017 and, when asked if he had any concerns about his abilities as a pilot, said: \"Not any at all.\"\nHe said there was no way for the pilot, in the front seat of the plane, to eject the rear seat passenger.\nThe hearing, which is expected to last up to four days, is continuing.

The principal added that they would be released the next day when the results were out, the report added.\nIt is not clear how many students were affected by this but a news report by the Falun-gong linked New Tang Dynasty Television outlet reported that 35 students were eventually taken away into quarantine. \nAll teachers, students and staff members at the school were tested for the virus. \nThe school has been temporarily shut. \nChina has maintained a strict zero-Covid policy since the outbreak began, almost two years ago - and it shows no signs of changing tack to living with the virus. \nIts strategy, which includes strict lockdowns and border closures, comes in stark contrast to many western countries - and even countries in Asia that are slowly beginning to open up.\nMany other countries like Australia, South Korea and Singapore initially aimed to eliminate infections entirely, but have since switched to a policy that accepts the virus as endemic.\nHealth experts have questioned how long China can pursue its elimination strategy. \nChina has previously admitted the virus remains the \"biggest challenge\" to the Winter Olympics, which is due to be held in February next year.
