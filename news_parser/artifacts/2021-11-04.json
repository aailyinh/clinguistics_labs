      "text": "High levels of shame and ignorance are associated with HPV, the sexually-transmitted virus which affects 80% of people, a survey has discovered. \nThe government is rolling out HPV testing as part of routine screenings for cervical cancer. \nNearly half of the women surveyed believed their partner must have cheated if they had HPV, but the virus can remain dormant for years. \nCampaigners fear women may not attend screenings because of the stigma. \nThe survey of 2,000 women was done by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust last month. \nIt found that half of the women were embarrassed and \"put off sex\" as a result of contracting the virus. \nAround 35% of the women had no idea what HPV is, and nearly 60% said they thought it meant they had cancer. \nLaura Flaherty, 31, who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016, is typical of the respondents. \n\"When I first saw on my letter that I had been diagnosed as being HPV positive, I didn't know what it was. When I Googled it I discovered it was a sexually transmitted infection, so I automatically thought my partner had been cheating. \n\"I knew nothing about it, and it felt dirty. I didn't realise it could lay dormant for so long and when I realised how common HPV is I was shocked. No-one I spoke to had heard of it, yet most of us are going to contract it.\" \nMyth: You can only get the virus through sexual intercourse \nFact: HPV is usually sexually transmitted, but it can also be transmitted by any skin-to-skin contact in the genital and oral areas \nMyth: HPV is a sign of being promiscuous \nFact: 80% of us will contract HPV virus at some point in our lives, it's easy to get and pass on and you can get it the first time you have any sexual contact.\nMyth: HPV means I've got cancer \nFact: There are about 200 types of HPV. About 40 types affect the genital area, simply meaning they will live there, a few can cause unpleasant but harmless conditions like genital warts. Around 13 high-risk types can cause cervical cancer and other cancers of the genitals as well as mouth and throat cancer, but this is rare. \nMyth: You'll know if you have HPV\nFact: HPV is symptomless and in most cases the immune system will clear the infection. Cervical screening picks up any abnormal cells \nSource: Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust\nThe survey comes as a government initiative to test for HPV first in cervical screening, before other conditions, starts in Wales next week. It will roll out to England by 2019 and be implemented in Scotland in 2020, but there is no date for its introduction in Northern Ireland.\nThe change means that more women will be told that they have HPV.  \nRobert Music, Chief Executive, Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said: \"Testing for HPV first is a far more effective way of identifying those most at risk of cervical cancer. This change to the programme does mean more women will be told they have HPV. \n\"HPV can be confusing however, so we must normalise it to ensure people don't feel ashamed or scared about being told they have the virus.\"\nHPV infection is rapidly declining in girls aged between 12 and 18 as a result of the HPV vaccine introduced in 2008. \nLast year, the vaccine was extended to gay men aged 16 to 45, and in July the government announced that it will also be extended to boys, although no start date has yet been given. \nThere are no plans to extend the HPV vaccine to other adults over the age of 18, as the likelihood of already having the infection are high, and therefore the vaccine would be ineffective.\nDr Philippa Kaye, GP and author said: \"GPs and health professionals will be having more conversations with patients about HPV as they come in to discuss their results. Understanding how it is transmitted and the relative risks will help reduce the stigma surrounding it.\""

      "text": "Talks to resolve the fishing row between the UK and France were \"useful and positive\", the French Europe minister has said.\nBut there was no breakthrough and there will be more talks next week.\nTensions flared last month after the UK and Jersey denied fishing permits to several French boats. \nFrance has threatened to stop British trawlers from landing their catches at French ports unless more permits are granted in return covering UK waters.\nFrance's Clement Beaune said his meeting in Paris with Brexit minister Lord Frost had been useful and positive, but significant differences remained.\n\"All options are still on the table,\" Mr Beaune said, adding that \"as long as dialogue seems possible... we are giving it a chance\".\n\"There is still a lot of work to do,\" he said, claiming that France should be entitled to about 200 more fishing licences.\nThe UK government has insisted the overwhelming majority of applications for licences have been granted.\nBoris Johnson's official spokesman said the French government had given assurances that while the talks continued it would not immediately restore their threats.\n\"They've made it clear to us they're not planning to introduce them in the short-term. Both sides are keen to have further discussions,\" he said.\nLord Frost will meet European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in Brussels on Friday.\nOn Wednesday, a British trawler, detained last week after French authorities said it did not have a licence, was released. \nThe Scottish-registered scallop dredger Cornelis Gert Jan arrived back in the UK in the early hours of Thursday morning, after leaving Le Havre the previous evening.\nIn short, it's about how many French fishing boats can catch fish in UK waters.\nUnder the Brexit trade deal, the EU and UK agreed they would give licences to boats if they can show they have fished in each other's waters for years.\nBut there have been disagreements about how much evidence is needed.\nBig trawlers will routinely collect this information automatically.\nBut smaller vessels that come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, can find it harder to provide the proof needed."

      "text": "The Welsh government has called for the mining licence for Aberpergwm colliery, near Glynneath, to be cancelled.\nDeputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters said he had urged the UK government to stop \"40 million tonnes of coal\" being extracted \"from Welsh soil\" over the next 18 years.\nWelsh ministers have a \"clear policy of stopping using fossil fuels\", he said.\nBut the mine operator says it supplies niche industries like water filtration and steel production.\nIt says it provides 160 well-paid jobs in the Vale of Neath area, plus 16 apprenticeships. \nThe UK government says final responsibility for licensing coal mines lies with the Welsh government. \nAberpergwm mine is the only producer of high-grade anthracite in Western Europe and it supplies the nearby Tata steel plant in Port Talbot.\nSpeaking in the Senedd, Mr Waters said: \"Unless the UK government agree to our request to cancel a licence granted in 1996 at Aberpergwm, some 40 million tonnes of coal will be extracted from this mine by 2039 - a hundred million tonnes of carbon dioxide. \nBut Energybuild Ltd, which runs the mine, says Mr Waters' figures are wrong. \nManaging director Rhidian Davies said: \"Anthracite is a highly desirable mineral used predominately for its manufacturing characteristics as opposed to its thermal properties.\"\nHe added that Energybuild \"brought more than \u00a3100m of investment into the locality\".\nAnd he said carbon products \"will play a significant role in developing sustainable technology of the future, ideally in a circular economy [without waste and pollution]\".\n\"Our products are in significant demand to support the transition to a sustainable green economy.\"\nThe Welsh government says it is up to the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Kwasi Kwarteng, to act to intervene to prevent \"the coal being extracted from Welsh soil\" and they have written to request his intervention.\n\"We don't want it to happen and the only reason it might happen is because of their [UK government] inaction and their policies,\" Mr Waters said.\nBut a UK government spokesperson said it was a matter for the Welsh government.\n\"The Coal Authority is responsible for licensing coal mines, including for Aberpergwm,\" they said\n\"The BEIS Secretary of State is not involved in this process, as Welsh ministers have the power under the Coal Industry Act to make the final decision on whether coal mining operations in Wales can be progressed.\"\nBut the Welsh government insists they don't have the power to cancel licences that were granted before they were given control over mining regulation. \nAberpergwm was originally granted a licence to mine coal before licencing powers were handed over to the Welsh government.\nThe mine operators have recently applied to the Coal Authority for formal recognition that the conditions attached to their original licence have been fulfilled.\nCouncillor for Glynneath, Del Morgan, said he was worried \"about the prospect of losing good job opportunities from this area, an area that badly needs employment in order to retain our young people in the community\".\nMr Morgan chairs the mine's community liaison committee, where local councillors and members of the community meet the mine operator. \n\"I have been privy to some of the plans laid out for the colliery,\" he said. \"These include the developing market for water filtration, where good quality coal is used to remove toxins from the water without stripping the water of salts and important minerals. \n\"I also think that over time we will see much greener extraction and production systems develop, which will assist this mining operation to become less intrusive in terms of the world energy debate.\"\nThe debate over the future of Aberpergwm is taking place against the backdrop of the COP26 climate change summit where 40 countries have pledged to move away from coal.\nIn the run up to the summit Boris Johnson said \"consigning coal to history\" would be key in reducing carbon emissions.\nThe UK government says it will phase out the use of coal for electricity production by October 2024."

Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by rebels in 2011 and the country has been beset by unrest since then.\nElections in 2014 left the country split, with rival centres of power in Benghazi in the east and Tripoli in the west.\nThe current Libyan government in Tripoli wants good relations with the US, and the US wants Mr Masud to be extradited. The BBC's Orla Guerin in Tripoli says the signs are that ultimately the new suspect will be handed over.\nUS officials also say Mr Masud conspired with another Libyan intelligence official, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. \nAl-Megrahi maintained his innocence until his death in 2012 and his son has vowed to clear his name in the UK courts. \nIn the US, Kara Weipz, whose brother was killed in the bombing, said putting Mr Masud on trial in the US would bring peace to the families of victims.   \n\"I think we all need that peace,\" she told the BBC.\nBut among bereaved relatives in the UK there are questions and doubts. Some believe Iran was to blame for downing the plane not Libya, and the new charges are a smokescreen.\nDr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the bombing, said he did not believe the new extradition request had any purpose \"other than maintaining the fiction that there is a meaningful ongoing criminal investigation still extant\"."

      "text": "Veteran entertainer, TV presenter and dancer Lionel Blair has died aged 92, his agent has said.\nBlair, whose stage and screen career spanned eight decades, died early on Thursday morning.\nBest known as a team captain on game show Give Us A Clue, in recent years he acted in Ricky Gervais's Extras and also appeared on Celebrity Big Brother.\nBorn in Canada in 1928, he moved to the UK as a young boy and began performing in air raid shelters in World War Two.\nHenry Lionel Ogus, as he was known before his showbusiness career, grew up in Stamford Hill, north London and was evacuated to Oxford when the war broke out. \nHis father died when he was 13 and the following year Blair began working as an actor, appearing in musical productions with his elder sister Joyce.\nBut it was his self-taught dancing skills - inspired by watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers at the cinema and then copying their routines at home with Joyce - that Blair became best-known for through his long career.\nHe took part in a comedic dance-off against Sammy Davis Jr at the Royal Variety Performance in 1961 - which he later called the highlight of his entire career - and ensured his presence as a regular on the bill at future royal shows.\nHe played the role of a choreographer in the Beatles film A Hard Day's Night and life imitated art as he became a sought-after choreographer for films such the 1969 comedy The Magic Christian.\nOn television, he was choreographer for and appeared on programmes such as the Tommy Cooper Hour and the Jimmy Tarbuck Show, before becoming a judge on talent show New Faces in the late 1970s.\nBlair became a household name as team captain opposite Una Stubbs - who also died earlier this year - on ITV's long-running Give Us A Clue.\nHis friend, the actor and presenter Christopher Biggins, called him \"the most wonderful [man], kind, funny, a real giver of life. His energy was extraordinary.\"\nBiggins said Blair was \"very competitive\" and \"loved to win\" on the game show. \"He's up there now entertaining with Una, I'm sure,\" he said.\nBlair was one of the stars who appeared on a Christmas special of the Ricky Gervais comedy Extras in 2007, as one of the housemates in a fictional version of Celebrity Big Brother.\nIt was a role he would take on for real in 2014, when he spent 15 days in the house, leaving after boxer Evander Holyfield and model Jasmine Waltz.\nIn 2017 he joined another reality TV show, The Real Marigold Hotel, and travelled around India with other older celebrities.\nBroadcaster Danny Baker called him a \"a true chum, an entertainer beyond compare, an archive of a golden era, an immeasurable talent\", adding that it was \"impossible to think he won't be in some green room somewhere, dropping names and living out fantastic tales\".\nWriter and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Blair \"was the personification of va va voom, he had so much charm and dazzle... he loved life and he loved showbusiness\".\nThe broadcaster also recalled: \"[Blair] actually entered the language, because by the time he became a household name in the 1960s and 70s, in cockney slang if you were wearing flares, they were known as your Lionel Blairs.\"\nActor Sanjeev Bhaskar said he met Blair at \"numerous evenings over the years and he was always a gent, warm and fun\". \n\"I loved the fact that he'd always pepper every conversation with a bit of a tap dance. Every single time. And it was glorious,\" the Goodness Gracious Me star added.\nComedian Julian Clary described Blair as a \"showbiz trooper if ever there was\", while broadcaster Piers Morgan said: \"RIP Lionel Blair, 92. A wonderful all-round entertainer & lovely man. Sad news.\"\nSinger and presenter Michael Ball remembered Blair as a \"funny, kind, generous, compassionate and gifted man\". Entertainer Bonnie Langford added: \"Dear Lionel. Privileged to have been your dance partner.\" \nSinger Paul Young tweeted: \"I'm really sad to hear about the passing of Lionel Blair; it's wonderful to meet someone that was a TV star when you were small and to find them so impeccably gracious and charming in person. I learnt a lot from him! My condolences to his family.\" \nBlair married Susan Blair in 1967 and the couple had three children. "

      "tags": "Companies,Ecology,Royal Dutch Shell,COP26,Green economy,Oil,Environment,Oil & Gas industry,Natural gas",
      "text": "The boss of oil giant Shell has insisted it can transition to net zero by 2050, but it will need the cash from its oil and gas business to pay for it. \nBen van Beurden dismissed splitting its legacy oil and gas business from its renewables investment, a move urged by activist shareholder Third Point.\nTalking exclusively to the BBC, he said the company's plans for greener energy could only be funded by oil and gas.\n\"At this point in time [the cash] comes from our legacy business,\" he said.\nMr van Beurden was speaking at Europe's biggest oil refinery at Pernis near Rotterdam, a facility he plans to transform from refining petrol and diesel, to making biofuels and hydrogen over the next decade.  \n\"These things can only be done if you have a facility (like Pernis) to work with and if you have the cash. \n\"If we have to build a hydrogen plant from a wind farm that we build in the North Sea for a billion dollars that is not going to be funded by a hydrogen business - it will be funded by the oil and gas business,\" he said.\nBut oil and gas is not just a legacy business. Shell wants to develop new oilfields including  Cambo in the North Sea which it hopes will produce 170 million barrels of oil.  \nHow does he justify that? \nMr van Beurden says the decision on the Cambo oilfield is ultimately one for government but says it makes no sense to substitute UK resources for foreign imports to satisfy domestic demand.  \nHe said: \"Why would you say: Let's not get our oil and gas demands from our own resources but let's import from somewhere else, probably with a larger carbon footprint. \n\"I don't think that it is going to contribute to the balance of payment for the UK and also will not help the carbon footprint of the world.\"\nShell currently has a global carbon footprint the size of Russia's if you include the emissions from customers using Shell products. \nIt plans to spend four times as much on oil and gas development as on renewables next year. This is why some doubt that Shell can hit either its own targets and those imposed by a Dutch court which require it to halve its own net emissions by 2030 and eliminate them entirely by 2050. Shell is planning to appeal part of the ruling. \nShell is also expected to make its best efforts to reduce the emissions of its customers - which make up 90% of Shell's overall carbon footprint. Shell intends to appeal that court judgement.  \nShu Ling Liauw from research firm Global Climate Insights  has analysed the oil firm's spending plans and estimates that Shell will be producing more emissions by 2030 than it is now as it intends to grow its gas business.   \n\"Even if you're very generous, and assume they get all the amounts of carbon capture and storage and offsets that they need, they might just miss their 2030 targets, and they will not be able to deliver on 2050.\n\"In fact, they will be increasing emissions until 2030, and still be producing significant amounts of emissions in 2050,\" she says.\nMr van Beurden says these estimates are speculative and insists Shell is on track, having cut the carbon intensity of its own operations by 17% since 2016. \nShell is a major component of the UK's leading share index. If you have a pension you are almost certainly a part owner of Shell, BP and other oil and gas companies.  \nThere is growing clamour on the part of many pension fund trustees and their scheme members to dump or divest shares in fossil fuel businesses to starve them of capital. That would be a mistake, according the world's largest asset manager Blackrock which looks after 13 trillion dollars in pensions and savings. \n\"You can't divest from the world. It's much better to engage with companies and use your influence as a shareholder. If you divest, you lose that influence,\" said Sandy Boss, head of investment stewardship.\nOthers point out that if Shell itself were to sell its oil and gas business, those assets would be hoovered up by companies that might be less transparent and less inclined to make the effort to decarbonise.  \nAs the recent energy crisis brutally exposed, the UK along with the rest of the world is still hugely reliant on fossil fuel. That reliance needs to be managed down over time according to Mr van Beurden otherwise we will see price shocks in the future that will be counterproductive.\n\"I think this energy transition can be done but it will require a lot of orchestration and a lot of faith of society that it can be done. `\n\"If you want to destroy the faith by driving up energy prices, by creating shortages or market failures, I think politicians are going to lose societal acceptance that this is actually doable.\"\nAs powerful as Shell is, its customers may be more powerful. \nAs long as there is demand for fossil fuels. Shell or someone else will supply it. That demand can be influenced by government carrot or stick, companies can be squeezed by financiers but consumer behaviour will ultimately determine whether the world can hit net zero by 2050.  "

      "tags": "Literature,Apartheid,Booker Prize,South Africa,Books",
      "text": "South African author Damon Galgut has won the prestigious Booker Prize for fiction at the third attempt for his novel The Promise.\nGalgut, who was previously nominated in 2003 and 2010, picked up the \u00a350,000 prize at a ceremony on Wednesday.\nThe Promise is his ninth book and follows the decline of one South African family over four decades from the apartheid era to the present day.\nThe chair of the judges, Maya Jasanoff, described it as \"a tour de force\".\n\"It combines an extraordinary story, rich themes and the history of the last 40 years of South Africa in an incredibly well-wrought package,\" she said.\n\"It manages to pull together the qualities of great storytelling, it has great ideas, it's a book that has a lot to chew on, with remarkable attention to structure and literary style.\"\nThe author said he was \"really profoundly, humbly grateful\" for the award.\n\"I'm not used to winning things,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday. \"And I just assumed that would be the case last night.\n\"Perhaps nobody was more amazed than me when things went my way.\"\nAnalysis by Rebecca Jones, BBC arts correspondent\nThe Promise by Damon Galgut is an excellent winner. In my view it is an outstanding book and it is hard to disagree with the critic who said: \"This is so obviously one of the best novels of the year.\"\nWhy? On the one hand it is a gripping saga, following the decline and fall of a white South African family over four decades. It is packed with incident - sex, drugs, shootings - and there is drama, discord and death. But there is also plenty of unexpected comedy to lighten the mood. It made me laugh.\nOn the other hand, through the lens of this one family, The Promise also deftly tells the story of South Africa and its troubled transition from apartheid state to multi-racial democracy. So it is rich with layers and yet it is compact, with fewer than 300 pages.\nIt is also technically superb. There is an invisible narrator, who acts like a film camera. So you move fluidly from one location to another, from one character's point of view to another, sometimes within the same paragraph or page. At one point we fly into someone's dreams. At another we dive into the feelings of a pack of hyenas and even a family dog. \nDamon Galgut nearly died from cancer as a young child. In 2010 he told me it was the central, cataclysmic event of his life. Books provided comfort during his illness. When he finally recovered he was left with the overwhelming need to write. Now he has won one of the biggest prizes in publishing.\nThe Promise begins in 1986 and revisits the family over the course of four funerals, each in a different decade and at a different point in the nation's journey.\nThe title refers to a pledge that the white family's black maid would be given the house she inhabits and the land it stands on.\nGalgut, 57, grew up in Pretoria and told the Today programme that it also refers to the unfulfilled promise in South Africa after apartheid, the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government.\n\"I'm far from alone in saying that I think, in 1994, in our first free elections, there was a sense of great promise in the air that South Africa could at last change its course and become a different sort of country, and I certainly don't think that promise has been fulfilled,\" he said.\nThe \"portrait\" his book paints of modern South Africa \"is not a happy one\", he told reporters after the ceremony.\n\"I had no agenda in describing it that way, but things are not great with us right now, so you could read that as a warning or a portrait, I don't know, but South Africa has seen better days.\"\nBut he said his win was a sign that more attention was being paid to African literature.\n\"The fact that the Nobel Prize winner this year came from Africa, the fact that the Booker has gone to an African, would suggest that the volume is going up on Africa,\" he said.\n\"I hope that's a process that will continue and that people will take African writing a little more seriously, because there's a lot of great writing coming from us.\"\nThe Promise was widely praised when it was published in the UK in June, with The Guardian calling it \"stunning\", The Sunday Times describing it as \"bleak but superbly narrated\" and The Financial Times declaring it \"a complex, ambitious, brilliant work\".\nThe other nominated books were:\nLast year's Booker Prize was won by Douglas Stuart for Shuggie Bain. The Scottish author said the victory \"changed everything for me\", with the novel shooting up best-seller lists as a result and now being adapted into a TV series."

      "text": "The human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccine is cutting cases of cervical cancer by nearly 90%, the first real-world data shows. \nCancer Research UK described the findings as \"historic\", and said it showed the vaccine was saving lives. \nNearly all cervical cancers are caused by viruses, and the hope is vaccination could almost eliminate the disease. \nThe researchers said the success meant those who were vaccinated may need far fewer cervical smear tests too. \nCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women around the world, killing more than 300,000 each year.\nAlmost nine-in-10 deaths are in low and middle income countries where there is little access to cervical cancer screening. The hope is vaccination will have an even bigger impact in those countries than wealthier nations such as the UK.\nMore than 100 countries have starting using the vaccine as part of World Health Organization plans to get close to eliminating cervical cancer..\nIn the UK, girls are offered the vaccine between the ages of 11 and 13, depending on where they live. The vaccine has also been offered to boys since 2019.\nThe HPV vaccine can only prevent an infection, it cannot rid the body of the virus once it has been caught. The viruses are so widespread that immunisation has to be aimed at children before they become sexually active.\nThe study, published in the Lancet, looked at what happened after the vaccine was introduced for girls in England in 2008.\nThose pupils are now adults in their 20s. The study showed a reduction in both pre-cancerous growths and an 87% reduction in cervical cancer. \n\"The impact has been huge,\" said Prof Peter Sasieni, one of the researchers at King's College London.\nThe reductions were less dramatic when older teenagers were immunised as part of a catch-up campaign. This is because fewer older teenagers decided to have the jab and they may already have been sexually active. \nOverall, the study estimated the HPV programme has prevented about 450 cancers and 17,200 pre-cancers.\nProf Sasieni said that was \"just the tip of the iceberg\" because those vaccinated were still young to be getting cancer, so the numbers would only grow with time. \nLaura Flaherty was diagnosed with cervical cancer this year at the age of 29 after putting off a routine smear test.\n\"The HPV vaccine hadn't been rolled out when I was at school,\" she says.\n\"I was diagnosed after a routine smear test. I'd put it off for four months - and while it wouldn't have made a difference to my diagnosis - it just shows how important it is to keep up to date with your smears.\n\"I was told I had abnormal cells and tested positive for HPV and further investigation revealed I had stage one cervical cancer, which resulted in a hysterectomy. \n\"I was sat in a room and told: 'I'm really sorry, it's cancer'. I had two small children and I said 'I need you to save me, they need looking after'.\n\"I went for my smear test in February this year and was given the all clear in August. I just always feel so lucky to be here.\"\nAt the moment, women are invited for a smear test every three to five years to screen for cervical cancer. \nBut Prof Sasieni said there \"definitely\" needed to be a rethink after these results. \nHe told me: \"It should be a wake-up call to policy-makers, women will read this and think 'why should I go for screening?'\n\"I would hope we'd come back with a new screening programme, two to three times a lifetime and continue screening women who have not been vaccinated.\"\nThis is not the final say on the HPV vaccination. There are still questions about how long protection lasts and whether there needs to be a mid-life booster. \nThere are also more than 100 types of human papillomavirus.\nThe UK started using a vaccine that protected against two of them and is about to introduce one that protects against nine viruses, including the main causes of genital warts. \nThe cancer-causing versions lead to dangerous changes to the DNA of infected cells that transform them into cancer. \nThis can happen in any infected tissue. The viruses can be spread through vaginal, oral and anal sex, so are also linked to anus, penis and some head and neck cancers.\nHowever, 99% of cervical cancers are caused by human papillomaviruses. \nDr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist for the UK Health Security Agency, said the findings were \"remarkable\" and showed the vaccine \"saves lives by dramatically reducing cervical cancer rates among women\".\nMichelle Mitchell, the chief executive at Cancer Research UK, said: \"It's a historic moment to see the first study showing that the HPV vaccine has and will continue to protect thousands of women from developing cervical cancer.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "The Department of Education (DE) will need an extra \u00a3350m in funding in 2022-23 to meet \"inescapable pressures\".\nGary Fair, DE's director of finance, told a Stormont committee there had been \"progressive underfunding\" of education.\nA recent Institute for Fiscal Studies report found Northern Ireland spent less on each school pupil's education than any other part of the UK.\nThe education budget is one of Stormont's biggest.\nIt covers schools, youth services and early years and comes in at about \u00a32.2bn a year.\nMr Fair, who was addressing the Education Committee, told SDLP assembly member (MLA) Daniel McCrossan that a \"very poor budget settlement\" for the next three years would lead to more of a crisis.\nIn response to a subsequent question from DUP MLA Diane Dodds, Mr Fair said the department would need an extra \u00a3350m in its budget next year.\n\"We have estimated certainly for next year that we'll be requiring probably an extra \u00a3350m,\" he said.\nMrs Dodds asked if measures like the Fair Start recommendations to tackle educational underachievement were dependent on additional money.\n\"Those are inescapable pressures really - \u00a3350m,\" replied Mr Fair.\n\"Our baseline every year doesn't reflect what we actually should have or need in our baseline so it is a problem.\n\"There's a risk in assuming that certain things will be taken forward without additional money.\"\nThe committee's chairman, Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle, asked Mr Fair about the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) report's conclusions that pupils in Northern Ireland had less spent per head on their education than elsewhere in the UK.\n\"Do pupils in Northern Ireland get less spent on them in education than the rest of these islands?\" Mr Lyttle asked.\n\"The figures would seem to indicate that, yes,\" replied Mr Fair.\n\"It has to be linked to progressive underfunding over the last number of years and the lack of certainty around budgets moving forward, and the lack of baseline just to cover even what's required every year.\"\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy has previously warned some departments may face \"more pain\" as he prepares a budget which could increase spending on health.\nMr Murphy has also disputed a claim by Chancellor Rishi Sunak that Northern Ireland will receive substantial extra funding for public services.\nThe department had bid for an additional \u00a384m in day-to-day spending and \u00a311.5m in capital funding in the October monitoring round.\nA monitoring round is a budget exercise in which money is reallocated to departments.\nHealth received about \u00a3200m of extra money in the October monitoring round with education receiving \u00a39.2m in day-to-day resource funding - mainly for special educational needs (SEN) pressures - and \u00a311.5m in capital funding.\nThe capital funding included \u00a38m for \"minor works\" to schools - which is often used to pay for essential repairs for school buildings.\nBut a DE official, Seamus Gallagher, told MLAs that much more money was needed.\n\"In terms of the state of the schools estate, we could probably spend \u00a3500m on the school estate every year and still spend 10 years bringing it up to where we would like it to be,\" he said.\n\"But we're constrained by budget and then have to allocate money in priority order where it's most required.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Thursday.\nCountries such as Poland, Vietnam and Chile, which rely heavily on coal - the single biggest contributor to global warming - are committing to move away from it. More than 40 countries have signed up to a statement to quit the use of the fossil fuel, and the UK government says 190 nations and organisations have pledged to stop using it. \"The end of coal is in sight,\" says Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. But some of the world's biggest coal-dependent countries, including Australia, India, China and the US, didn't sign up, which makes for \"glaring gaps\", according to shadow business secretary Ed Miliband. There is also nothing about moving away from oil and gas, he adds. Follow our updates as the COP26 summit focuses on energy.\nGlobal carbon dioxide, or CO2, emissions are set to rebound to near pre-Covid levels. Gas emissions fell by 5.4% during lockdowns in 2020 but the scientific Global Carbon Project report predicts they will rise by 4.9% this year. Scientists, surprised by the findings, say this increase underlines the urgency of action at summits such as COP26 in Glasgow.\nWhen Israeli minister Karine Elharrar couldn't attend COP26 because it wasn't wheelchair-accessible, it was a reflection of how many disabled people often feel - ignored and left out of climate change conversations. This is despite the United Nations Human Rights Council saying those with disabilities are among the people most \"adversely affected in an emergency\". So why are they so affected by climate change and what can we do about it? We've taken a look.\nSgt Lynsey Buchanan-Barlas and her police dog Nico have been searching Glasgow's streets for explosives weeks before and during COP26. Although there are different things going on with lots of important people at the summit, it's all about keeping everyone safe. \"The dogs are the brains of the operation, I just hold the lead,\" she says. Read more about their team work.\nIts chemical symbol is H and it's once again been hitting the headlines. Hydrogen is being mooted as a clean fuel source that could help curb greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. So what exactly is hydrogen energy and how could it be used as an alternative to fossil fuels? Find out here.\nCOP26 PUSH NOTIFICATIONS: If you want to keep up with the latest around the climate summit, tap here to receive alerts on your phone.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nNet zero is a phrase that keeps popping up but do you know what it means? The simplest way of explaining it is that it means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Those gases, such as CO2, are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. So reducing those emissions and balancing out any remaining ones, by planting trees that absorb carbon for example, achieves net zero.\nRead more about it here and you can also find out how the UK and other countries are doing.\nYou can find further information on our climate page.\nWhat questions do you have about changes in our climate? \nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Universities,University of Sussex,LGBT",
      "text": "A university professor accused of transphobia for her views on gender identity has said protests against her were like a \"terrible anxiety dream\".\nIn a BBC interview, Kathleen Stock, who rejects the claim, said she quit her University of Sussex post following \"reputation trashing from colleagues\".\nShe said it had been surreal to see her name \"plastered over every wall\" on student protest posters.\nThe university said it unequivocally defended her right to free speech.\nVice-chancellor Professor Adam Tickell told staff in an email he had hoped Prof Stock would have felt able to return to work, and she would have been supported.\nBut the philosophy professor told BBC's Woman's Hour the campaign against her was the \"end point\" of years of negative treatment by colleagues that had become \"exhausting\".\nProf Stock, who recently published a book questioning the idea that gender identity is more \"socially significant\" than biological sex,  said her views had been \"radically misrepresented\" to suggest she was bigoted or transphobic, something she categorically denies.  \nBut an online statement accompanying the campaign against her suggested Prof Stock \"has spent years campaigning for the exclusion of trans people from 'women's only spaces' and against trans and non-binary people's right to self-identify as any gender\".  \nIt also criticised her trusteeship of the LGB Alliance, which describes itself on Twitter as promoting \"the rights of lesbians, bisexuals & gay men, as recognised by biological sex\". The group is described by trans activists as transphobic, which it denies.\nIn the interview aired on Wednesday, Prof Stock said: \"In almost every university... there are a small group of people who are absolutely opposed to the sorts of things I say and instead of getting involved in arguing with me using reason, evidence - the traditional university methods - they tell their students in lectures that I pose a harm to trans students. \n\"They go on Twitter to say that I'm a bigot so thus creating an atmosphere in which students become much more extreme and much more empowered to do what they did, I guess.\"\nIn October, posters were put up near the university campus and an accompanying social media campaign claimed Prof Stock \"makes trans students unsafe\". Photos also showed a masked protester standing on the university's sign with a banner reading \"Stock out\".\nProf Stock told Woman's Hour presenter Emma Barnett the effect of the protests was \"head spinning\" and \"like some sort of surreal terrible anxiety dream to see your name plastered over every wall\".\nShe described a protest at an open day when about 100 students were holding placards saying \"Stock out\", ''Fire her\", with flares being set off.\n\"I don't know if I can explain it but you have to imagine yourself at your workplace\u2026 all eyes are on you, all fingers seem to be pointing at you, it's like a medieval experience,\" she said.\n\"At that point I wasn't scared so much as incredibly distressed.\"\nThe professor said she had received hundreds of letters of support and accused her critics of being \"out of step\" with the public.\nThe \"tipping point\" that led to her resignation, she said, was when the Sussex branch of the University and College Union (UCU) released a statement which \"basically backed the protesters and implicitly made it obvious that they thought I was transphobic and accused Sussex University of institutional transphobia\".\nShe had previously tweeted a screenshot of a message purportedly sent to all Sussex UCU members which didn't name her personally but urged university management to \"take a clear and strong stance against transphobia at Sussex\", including an \"urgent investigation\".\nThe national branch of the UCU released a follow-up statement saying it was a \"proud and unequivocal supporter of trans rights\", opposed harassment and bullying and was \"not calling for any staff to be dismissed from their post\".\nThe University of Sussex said it had publicly and internally fully supported Prof Stock's freedom of speech and would not tolerate the bullying and harassment of anyone in its community.\nEqualities minister Liz Truss and chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) Baroness Kishwer Falkner both criticised the attacks on Prof Stock.\nHigher and further education minister Michelle Donelan said the campaign of harassment against her was \"deplorable\" and the situation should never have got that far."

      "text": "Movie stars, including Jamie Dornan, Caitr\u00edona Balfe and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, have joined Sir Kenneth Branagh on the red carpet to open this year's Belfast Film Festival at the Waterfront Hall.\nBranagh returned to his hometown to showcase his latest film Belfast.\nIt follows the life of a Belfast family in the late 1960s as the Troubles broke out and will be released in UK cinemas on 21 January.\nAlso at the premiere was break-out star of the movie 10-year-old Jude Hill.\nThe film explores his character's childhood, amid the social and political tumult of the time.\nWritten and directed by Branagh, the film also stars Dame Judi Dench.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI at the premiere in Belfast, Branagh said it was a story he had wanted to write for a long time.\n\"At one stage I thought there was maybe a story about my grandparents when they were young,\" he said.\n\"But in the end it became clear that it [the story] was about this turning point, this moment of change here. \n\"There were a lot of big questions for anyone living in Belfast and we had our own little version of it in our family.\"\nFans have arrived all the way from Germany to try to catch a glimpse of the stars and there was an array of cameras and reporters.\nI was lucky enough to see the film last night. I have to admit, I sometimes struggle with films about Northern Ireland but I thought Belfast was really wonderful.\nSet in August 1969, the Troubles are there but in the main it's an affectionate portrait of a childhood where, actually, the city is a wonderful place to young Buddy, at the centre of the film.\nYet there is gathering darkness as the Troubles start to impact.\nObviously it's semi-autobiographical - the family live at 96 Mountcollyer Street in Tigers Bay - so there are a lot of local references.\nThe big question is does the family stay or do they go?\nBranagh's parents left Belfast and moved to England when the Troubles started and he said the film was about trying to understand why they made that decision.\n\"What I felt very strongly about that time was I felt very secure - I really knew who I was and I felt in this city that you couldn't get lost,\" he said.\n\"We were related to one half of Belfast and we went to school with the other half.\n\"That that was instantly lost in a moment of traumatic change which happened to everyone, was something I really wanted to understand my parents' process with.\"\nNorthern Ireland actor Jamie Dornan said the fact the film showed the beginning of the Troubles from a different viewpoint is important for audiences outside of Northern Ireland.\n\"I hope they have a better understanding that a lot of regular people were caught up in this and they didn't want it,\" he said.\n\"I've spent my adult life travelling the world telling people with great pride that I'm from Belfast.\n\"I've always been met with this sort of gasp - people can't believe you are from that place and you got out of there alive.\n\"No matter what we say about it, no matter how we package it, that is the world view of this place.\n\"If we can show a different side of it, then I think that's really important.\"\nBelfast has received plaudits from the global film industry and was awarded Toronto International Film Festival's People Choice Award following its screening in September.\nDirector of Belfast Film Festival, Michele Devlin said she \"could not be prouder\" to have welcomed Branagh to open the 21st Belfast Film Festival. \n\"His lovingly-crafted homage to his hometown and its citizens perfectly encapsulates the theme of this year's festival 'bringing it all back home',\" she added. \nBelfast Film Festival returns to celebrate its 21st year with a programme full of local films and stars, running from 4 to 13 November. \nAlso being shown at the festival will be Alison Millar's newest documentary on the life and death of journalist Lyra McKee which was made in partnership with Lyra's family, friends and partner.

      "tags": "Greenhouse gas emissions,Carbon dioxide,Greenhouse gas monitoring,Climate change",
      "text": "Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rebound to near the levels they were at before Covid, in a finding that has surprised scientists.\nThe amount of planet-heating gas released in 2020 fell by 5.4% as the pandemic forced countries to lock down.\nBut a scientific report by the Global Carbon Project predicts CO2 emissions will rise by 4.9% this year.\nIt shows the window is closing on our ability to limit temperature rise to the critical threshold of 1.5C.\nThis rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere underlines the urgency of action at summits like COP26 in Glasgow, scientists say.\nImportant deals have been struck at the meeting this week, on limiting emissions of methane and on curbing deforestation. \nYet emissions from coal and gas are predicted to grow more in 2021 than they fell the previous year - though carbon released from oil use is expected to remain below 2019 levels.\nDr Glen Peters, from the Center for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Oslo, Norway, said: \"What many of us were thinking in 2020 - including me - was more of a recovery spread out over a few years, as opposed to a big hitch in 2021.\n\"That's where the surprise comes for me - that it happened so quick, and also there's a concern that there's still some recovery to come.\"\nThis rapid rebound in emissions is at odds with the ambitious CO2 cuts required in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. This is the increase viewed by scientists as the gateway to dangerous levels of global warming.\nThe 16th annual Global Carbon Budget report was compiled by more than 94 authors who analysed economic data and information on emissions from land activities, such as forestry. \nIt shows that, if we continue along as we are and don't cut emissions, there's a 50% likelihood of reaching the 1.5C of warming in about 11 years. This concurs with the findings in a recent UN report that suggested we would get there by the early 2030s.\nProf Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, said: \"To limit climate change to 1.5C, emissions of CO2 need to reach net zero by 2050. Doing this in a straight line would mean cutting global emissions down by 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.\"\nThe fall in 2020 was 1.9 billion tonnes, but that was in the lockdown.\nSo reducing emissions by an amount roughly equivalent to that in the post-lockdown period presents a daunting challenge. But the scientists stress that it remains achievable.\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\n\"Personally, I think [the 1.5C goal] is still alive, but the longer we wait, the harder it will get... we need immediate action and reductions,\" said co-author Pierre Friedlingstein, from the University of Exeter.\nProf Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 concurred: \"This decrease of 1.4 billion tonnes each year is a decrease that is very large indeed, but is feasible with concerted action. We need to limit climate change as low as possible and 1.5C is a good target to maintain.\"\nEmissions in China are expected to be 5.5% higher in 2021 than in 2019 and are also projected to rise in India, with a 4.4% increase in 2021 relative to the pre-pandemic level.\nDr Peters said commentators should remember that, while China is responsible for nearly 30% of global carbon emissions, that left another 70% for the rest of the world to tackle.\nThe superpower has also demonstrated weaker economic growth in the past decade and has been switching to low-carbon energy sources at a faster rate than many other countries.\nIts emissions growth this year is related to stimulus packages - focused on heavy industry - which are in turn a response to the Covid-related slowdown. \n\"China is doing very well on many dimensions: it's deploying solar, it's deploying wind, electric buses, electric vehicles, and so there's lots of positive things going on in China,\" Dr Peters explained. \"But unfortunately, the stimulus packages often tend to focus on industrial sectors - construction, steel, cement. This requires coal. \n\"If China can turn that around, it has plenty of potential to reduce emissions because it has so much potential for large-scale deployment of solar and wind [power] that other countries don't have.\"\nAt COP26 this week, India pledged to reach net zero - where its emissions are reduced and any remaining ones balanced out by projects such as tree planting - by 2070. Like China, it has installed lots of wind and solar capacity, but fossil fuel sources have also been growing.\nProjected 2021 emissions in the US, European Union and the rest of the world remain, respectively, 3.7%, 4.2%, and 4.2% below their 2019 levels - in large part due to policies designed to reduce emissions from fossil fuels.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

Later, he said he could not recollect these incidents.\nHis aggressive behaviour led to him being detained under the Mental Health Act in September 2020, and he was a patient at the Ladywell mental health unit which is at Lewisham hospital, but run by the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust. \nRawson claimed to a doctor that he had been attacked by people from outer space, and he would get a machine gun and kill them. \nDuring an earlier stay at King's College hospital in south London, he was said to have assaulted a doctor.\nProsecutor Julian Evans told the Old Bailey that in late November 2020: \"Mr Rawson was diagnosed with Covid-19, delaying efforts to get him re-housed in a care home.\" \nThe BBC has been told that a team of professionals had a meeting to decide where he should be placed. \nAt that meeting, run by the South London and Maudsley trust, were Rawson's social worker, a psychiatrist and a member of staff from Fieldside care home. \nA risk assessment was said to have been done and it was decided to place him in Fieldside. \nOn 22 December he was moved into a second-floor room next door to Eileen Dean.\nFrom the start of his time there he was distressed and cried a lot, and was believed to be suffering from depression and early-onset dementia. \nWithin a few days he frightened a female staff member by swearing and waving his walking stick at her. \nHe sent messages, many to his ex-partner, describing himself as scared and confused. \nBy the start of the new year he said he feared he was going to be killed in his sleep in \"this OAP home\".\nHe was still sending messages a few hours before he attacked Mrs Dean.\nOn the first Sunday of the new year, Rawson was caught on the home's CCTV at around half-past midnight carrying his walking stick. \nFive minutes later he was seen without the stick in a distressed state. \nHe used his phone to call 999 and told the police operator: \"I think somebody has been killed and I don't know what's happening... \n\"There's loads of people dead here and I don't know how it happened and I'm scared as hell because someone's killed them all... There's one person still alive.\" \nA member of Fieldside's staff, Angela Pawelczyk, saw Rawson on the CCTV in the second-floor hallway, and went to investigate. \nRawson pointed at Mrs Dean's room and said: \"She is dead.\" \nBut in spite of her appalling injuries, at that point, the 93-year-old was still alive and appeared to mouth the word \"help\".\nRawson's walking stick was on the bed, the handle was close to the back of Mrs Dean's head.\nHe told police: \"I was on a mission or the world would die. I did what I had to do.\"\nDet Ch Insp Chris Wood, who led the investigation, said Mrs Dean was known as a \"calm, quiet and lovely woman\", whose husband died almost 30 years ago.\n\"Eileen was a completely defenceless woman, whose life was suddenly taken away in a horrific manner,\" he said.\nIn the weeks after Mrs Dean's killing, the Care Quality Commission, which oversees care homes, carried out a new inspection of Fieldside. \nIt found its safety and leadership, both previously rated good, needed improvement. \nMichael Holland, medical director at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said the trust offered its \"sincere and heartfelt condolences\" to Mrs Dean's family and friends.\nHe said the trust was conducting an investigation to identify areas where it can improve, in line with NHS policy.\nThe BBC has also asked Fieldside care home for a response.

      "tags": "Universities,Strike action",
      "text": "Academics at 37 universities have voted in favour of more strike action in a long-running row over pensions.\nMembers of the University and College Union (UCU) who took part voted 76% in favour of strike action - with 88% in favour of action short of a strike.\nThe vote does not mean that industrial action is inevitable.\nUniversities UK said the result was \"disappointing\" but said the union had failed to secure a mandate at almost half the institutions that had ballots.\nThe UCU said universities needed \"to urgently revoke the pension cuts and return to the negotiating table to avoid strike action\".\nThe ballot covered 68 universities - of those, 35 met the 50% turnout threshold that is legally required for a strike.\nThe threshold does not apply to two universities in Northern Ireland - Ulster and Queen's University Belfast.\nThe dispute over pensions has been rumbling on for nearly a decade, and was reignited because of what the UCU described as a \"flawed valuation\" of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) pension fund. \nThe UCU said it was \"carried out at the start of the pandemic when global markets were crashing\" and would lower members' guaranteed retirement income by 35%.\nThe union is expecting the results of another ballot on pay and conditions on Friday.\nFollowing that, the union's higher education committee will meet to decide the next steps, after consulting branches.\nUCU general secretary Jo Grady said: \"These results are a clear mandate for strike action over pension cuts and should be heard loud and clear by university employers.\n\"Staff in universities have given their all to support students during the pandemic, but management have responded by trying to slash their guaranteed pension by 35%.\"\nMs Grady said avoiding strike action was \"the outcome staff want\", and called on universities to \"withdraw the needless cuts\".\nFor some students a winter of disruption lies ahead. \nAs well as this vote on pensions, the results of ballots at many more universities across the UK on pay and conditions are expected. \nBut so far the results suggest lecturers and other staff, such as librarians, have mixed feelings about causing students to miss out any further.  \nWhen this dispute began students joined picket lines in 2020 in support of their lecturers.  \nBut that was before the pandemic left many studying for their degrees online, from their bedrooms.\nThe transformative shift to online learning during lockdowns may also provide universities with a way to minimise the impact. \nThe National Union of Students (NUS) said it stood \"in solidarity\" with staff who voted for industrial action because they were doing \"more work for less reward\".\nHillary Gyebi-Ababio, its vice-president for higher education, said: \"Staff working conditions are our learning conditions, and we must stand together if we are to realise a system that is truly student-centered and democratised.\"\nUniversities UK said: \"While it is disappointing to see some UCU members think industrial action over pensions is justified, the union has failed to secure a mandate for industrial action in 31 of the 68 institutions, meaning fewer branches have reached the threshold than in previous ballots. \n\"Union members voting 'yes' to strike action at eligible branches account for less than 7% of the scheme's total active membership...\n\"The employers' proposals for reform are the only viable plans under current regulations that will keep the scheme affordable for members and universities and keep the defined benefit section of the scheme open.\"\nThe universities also say a range of measures could mitigate the impact of the pension changes on employees.\nLast year, staff at 74 universities held a 14-day strike over pensions, pay, and conditions, and there was also action in 2019 and 2018.\nThe 37 institutions where staff are able to take strike action over pensions are: Institute of Development Studies; Aston University; Birkbeck, UoL; Durham University; Goldsmiths, UoL; Heriot-Watt University; Imperial College London; Keele University; King's College London; London School of Economics; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Loughborough University; Open University; Royal Holloway, UoL; SOAS, UoL; The University of Birmingham; The University of Dundee; The University of Kent; The University of Leeds; The University of Nottingham; The University of Sheffield; The University of Stirling; University of Bath; University of Belfast; University of Bradford; University of Bristol; University of Cambridge; University of Edinburgh; University of Essex; University of Glasgow; University of Lancaster; University of Liverpool; University of Reading; University of St Andrews; University of Sussex; University of Ulster; University of York"

      "text": "Boris Johnson has confirmed he stayed for free at a holiday home owned by the family of Lord Zac Goldsmith - who received a peerage from the PM in 2019.\nThe list of ministers' interests says the PM has \"a longstanding personal friendship\" with the family and \"in that capacity\" stayed at their place in southern Spain last month.\nDowning Street had previously refused to confirm if the trip had happened.\nLabour said it was \"more evidence of the sleaze engulfing this government\". \n\"It's obvious to everyone that the prime minister is dishing out cushy jobs to his mate who pays for his luxury holidays,\" said the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner.\n\"Yet again Boris Johnson behaves like it's one rule for him and another for everyone else.\"\nThe party is also calling for an inquiry into why the holiday has not been declared on the Register of Members' Interests - a separate declaration made by all MPs, not just ministers. \nLord Goldsmith is close friend of the prime minister's wife and gave her her first job in politics. \nHe lost his seat as an MP for Richmond Park in 2019, but retained his job as an environment minister after Mr Johnson appointed him to the House of Lords.\nAt the time, Labour condemned the appointment as \"jobs for mates\". \nMr Johnson has previously been criticised over being slow to explain how his holiday to the Caribbean island of Mustique was funded. \nAn investigation by the Committee on Standards found he had not broken the rules but criticised the arrangements as \"ad hoc and informal\". \nThe government is supposed to publish a list of any financial benefits received by ministers twice a year.\nThe most recent list includes the declaration that: \"The prime minister has a longstanding personal friendship with the Goldsmith family and, in that capacity, in October 2021, stayed in a holiday home in southern Spain which was provided free of charge by the Goldsmiths. \n\"Given Lord Goldsmith is a minister of the crown, the arrangement has accordingly been declared.\"\nMr Johnson may also declare the holiday gift in the register of MPs' interests, which is likely to include details about the cost of the donation.

      "tags": "Virginia,US politics,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Joe Biden has rejected suggestions that his Democratic party's shock loss in the Virginia governor's race was a verdict on his presidency.\nMr Biden argued that the miring of his legislative agenda in a Capitol Hill logjam did not sway the outcome.\nHe cited \"Trump voters\", schools, jobs and petrol prices as other reasons for the surprise defeat of Terry McAuliffe.\nRepublican Glenn Youngkin, a political newcomer, came from behind to win the Virginia governor's race on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, the New Jersey governor's race went down to a nail-biting dead heat between the Democratic incumbent, Phil Murphy, and a little-known Republican challenger, Jack Ciattarelli.\nUS media have projected Mr Murphy will win that race, though his opponent has not yet conceded.\nAt the White House on Wednesday, Mr Biden was asked whether he accepted any blame for Tuesday's political earthquake in Virginia.\nHe said voters are \"upset and uncertain about a lot of things\", including the pandemic, education, the economy and the price of petrol.\nMr Biden conceded Democrats should have passed his signature $1.75tn (\u00a31.3tn) package of social and climate programmes and a $1tn infrastructure bill before Tuesday's vote.\nHe added: \"But I'm not sure I would be able to have changed the number of very conservative folks who turned out in the red districts who were Trump voters.\"\nMr Biden took several questions from reporters after making comments to promote coronavirus vaccines as American children aged 5 to 11 became eligible for the shots.\nThe president encouraged parents to get their young jabbed to \"help us keep our schools open\".\nRising inflation, a slow economic recovery, a historic immigration crisis at the southern US border, and a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan have also hit Mr Biden's approval rating.\nHe is one of the most unpopular presidents ever at this point during a first term, according to opinion polls.\nMr Biden returned from a climate conference in Scotland early on Wednesday to news of the loss in a key Democratic stronghold that the president won by 10 points just a year ago.\nMr Youngkin, a former executive with the private equity firm Carlyle Group, is the first member of his party elected to statewide office in Virginia since 2009.\nThe mild-mannered political novice narrowly defeated former Virginia Governor McAuliffe with a delicate balancing act of pulling in Trump supporters, while avoiding being tied too closely to the former president, who remains unpopular in swathes of the state.\nMr Youngkin's strategy is already being hailed as a template for Republicans as they vie to wrest wafer-thin congressional majorities from Democrats in next year's mid-term elections.\nTwo other Republicans won the other top offices in Virginia.\nFormer US Marine Winsome Sears will be the first black female lieutenant governor of the state, which was the former seat of the pro-slavery Confederacy during the American Civil War.\nCuban-American Jason Miyares becomes the first Latino attorney general of Virginia.\nVirginia exit polls showed many voters were preoccupied with education, including how schools handle gender, race and mask mandates - key campaign issues for Mr Youngkin.\nNew Jersey's governor had been expected to cruise to re-election in a state where registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by more than a million.\nBut Mr Murphy, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive, just squeaked to victory by a fraction of a percentage point against a Republican underdog with low name recognition.\nA Biden ally, Mr Murphy has presided over a leftward shift in the state, including higher taxes on millionaires, gun control and a higher minimum wage.\nThe political headwinds for Democrats in New Jersey were also underscored as a Republican truck driver, Edward Durr, who told Fox News he spent just $5,000 on his campaign, ousted the powerful president of the state senate."

      "text": "The British trawler that was detained by France during the post-Brexit fishing row has been released by the French authorities.\nThe Scottish-registered scallop dredger Cornelis Gert Jan left the northern French port of Le Havre on Wednesday evening.\nThe trawler's owner, Macduff Shellfish, said it was \"delighted\" that the crew and vessel could return home.\nFrench authorities held the boat last week, saying it did not have a licence.\nMenna Rawlings, the UK's ambassador to France, welcomed the news, tweeting: \"Glad to hear the Cornelis is free to leave Le Havre and that the Brits on board are on their way home tonight.\"\nThe dispute over post-Brexit fishing licences flared up last month, after the UK and Jersey denied fishing permits to several French boats.\nFrance then threatened a series of measures against the UK unless more licences were granted by 2 November.\nBut French President Emmanuel Macron suspended the threats at the 11th hour ahead of more talks between UK and French ministers on Thursday.\nEarlier, the trawler's skipper Jondy Ward told the BBC they had been \"caught in the middle\" of the political row.\nMr Ward still faces trial in France next August regardless of Wednesday's court ruling that the boat can be released. \nHe has been charged with illegal fishing without a licence in French waters - but the case could be dropped before it reaches trial.\nAndrew Brown, the public affairs director of Macduff Shellfish, said the crew were in good spirits, looking forward to returning to their loved ones and grateful for all the messages of support.\nNo bail bond was needed to release the trawler, he said.\nIt comes after Mr Ward's lawyer said the French authorities had demanded a bond of 150,000 euros (\u00a3127,000), which he argued was excessive given the total value of the produce on board was around 5,000 euros (\u00a34,200).\nIn short, it's about how many French fishing boats can catch fish in UK waters.\nUnder the Brexit trade deal, the EU and UK agreed they would give licences to boats if they can show they have fished in each other's waters for years.\nBut there have been disagreements about how much evidence is needed.\nBig trawlers will routinely collect this information automatically.\nBut smaller vessels that come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, can find it harder to provide the proof needed.\nDowning Street acknowledged that France could reimpose its threats as Brexit minister Lord Frost prepared to hold talks with France's Europe minister Clement Beaune on Thursday.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"It's entirely up to the French government if they want to reimpose the threats that we saw they both announced and stood back from in recent days.\""

The team is working to date the finds.\nSmall fragments of clay tobacco pipes, including part of a bowl with a stamp that shows it was made in London, were also found along with a single flake of flint from the late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age.\nAbout 30 people took part in the dig - half were archaeology volunteers with the National Trust for Scotland and the other half were staff and volunteers from Culloden.\nCulloden saw the deaths of about 1,600 men - 1,500 of them Jacobites.\nThe battle ended Prince Charles Edward Stuart's campaign to regain the Great British throne for his father.\nThe prince escaped from the battlefield, which is near Inverness, and died in Rome in 1788.\nArchaeologists have examined the moorland battle site on the outskirts of Inverness before.\nIn recent years detailed investigations with metal detecting and geophysical survey work have taken place in an area known as the Field of the English, with trial trenching around Old Leanach Cottage, both close to the position of the government first line."

      "text": "A woman who had no cancer symptoms has told how a routine smear test saved her life.\nLaura McAdam was just 31 when a biopsy, taken during a colposcopy, confirmed she had cervical cancer.\nThe diagnosis came two years after her regular test came back showing cell changes. \nMs McAdam, 36, shared her story as part of a new Scottish government campaign which urges women not to ignore their smear test invitation. \nUptake of cervical screening in Scotland has declined in recent years and in 2020/21 only 69.3% of those eligible attended appointments.\nThis compares to 71.2% the previous year and 73.1% in 2018/19.\nEarlier this year the Scottish government confirmed that three women had died after being wrongly excluded from Scotland's cervical cancer screening programme. \nMs McAdam, from Ayrshire, said: \"I was diagnosed early thanks to attending a regular smear test and I'm so grateful that my cell changes were picked up early enough - it saved my life. \n\"I had no symptoms whatsoever before that, so I know first-hand how important it is to attend screenings, even if nothing seems wrong.\"\nCervical cancer kills two women every day in the UK but it is largely preventable and screening, which is offered to women aged 25 to 64, is the best way to protect against the disease.\nDespite this almost one in three women in Scotland still don't go for the five-minute smear test.\nAfter her smear test showed cell changes, Ms McAdam attended check-up appointments every six months. \nWhen the results kept showing cell changes, she underwent a colposcopy - a procedure used to look at the cervix - in November 2016. \nA week later she received her cervical cancer diagnosis and in January 2017, Ms McAdam had a hysterectomy. \nShe was scheduled in for a five-week course of precautionary chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment.\nBut a tear in Ms McAdam's bladder was detected shortly before the course was meant to start and her doctors decided to cancel the treatment. \nFollowing a bladder operation she now attends scans every six months to closely monitor her recovery.\nMs McAdam, who volunteers with Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust which campaigns on the importance of cervical screening, said: \"I had a few niggly back pains as a result of the bladder operation, but other than that I feel absolutely fine now.\n\"All the hospital staff have been fantastic throughout all this and I can't thank them enough for their care.\"\nThe new campaign also provides tips and reassurance around the appointment to help women overcome barriers to attending, such as embarrassment or worry.\nPublic Health Minister Maree Todd said: \"A five-minute smear test could save your life. Even if you expect everything is fine, it's important not to ignore your invite, as the test can help stop cervical cancer before it starts.\"\nThe test screens for human papillomavirus (HPV), the main cause of cervical cancer, and helps ensure cell changes are identified and treated earlier.   \nShe added that while some may feel anxious about the test information and advice is available to make the experience easier.\nEarlier this year Ms Todd told the Scottish Parliament that about 600 women had been wrongly excluded from the cervical cancer screening programme following a partial hysterectomy. \nThree of those women have since died and the government strongly suspects that one developed cancer as a result of her exclusion. \nIn June Ms Todd issued \"heartfelt apologies\" to the women who were excluded from the programme and went on to develop cervical cancer.

It's hard to understand sometimes why the investigation process take so long. \nWhen you look at its judgements over the years on different MPs, sometimes critics have wondered if its decisions compare coherently. \nBut given that Boris Johnson has become fond of football metaphors lately: one of their team was given a serious red card, but rather than follow the decision, they've decided to sack the referee and the player can finish the match. \nIt's true that most of the public don't pay much attention to political and parliamentary process - although If you're reading this blog, you may be one of those that does. \nBut with around 100 Tory MPs staying away from the vote, defying the orders of party bosses, it's obvious there are plenty of Conservatives who are well aware that these kinds of shenanigans have political risk. \n\"One rule for them, and one rule for the rest\", is Labour's charge. \nRemember just how much damage the expenses scandal did to the reputations of all MPs, even though the number caught up in truly awful behaviour was small. \nThat's not to suggest that events today are anything like the scale of that intense political crisis.  \nBut every MP who backed today's move can expect to have it used against them on political leaflets or Facebook campaigns. \nThere could be serious consequences in Parliament if the opposition parties decide to use this moment to withdraw cooperation on other committees or ways of working. \nSome ministers already fear this is an episode that Downing Street may come to regret. \nOwen Paterson is adamant that he did nothing wrong, and has been denied natural justice. \nBut with this Tory response, voters may well come to wonder, what's fair about this?"

      "text": "An Australian man has been charged with the abduction of four-year-old Cleo Smith, who was rescued on Wednesday after being missing for 18 days.\nTerence Darrell Kelly, 36, appeared in court in the town of Carnarvon charged with forcibly or fraudulently taking or enticing a child under 16.\nCleo disappeared from her family's tent at a campsite on 16 October, triggering a massive search.\nPolice found her in a locked home in Carnarvon.\nCleo has since been reunited with her parents, who made desperate pleas for her return. \"Our family is whole again,\" her mother, Ellie Smith, wrote on Instagram.\nAuthorities said Mr Kelly had no connection to the Smith family. \nMr Kelly, who police say was taken to hospital with self-inflicted injuries before being charged, did not apply for bail and was not required to enter a plea at the Carnarvon Magistrate's Court on Thursday.\nHe has been remanded in custody until 6 December, according to local media reports. \nPolice allege he acted alone. They have previously said the kidnapping was unplanned and \"opportunistic\".\nMr Kelly's neighbours expressed shock that he might have been involved, telling the West Australian newspaper he was a \"very quiet\" man who \"kept to himself\" but was known to everyone on the street. \nABC News reported that the man had been recently spotted by a neighbour buying nappies.\nThe search for Cleo at one stage had been likened to finding \"a needle in a haystack\", covering vast distances.\nIn the end, the house where she was discovered was 100km (62 miles) south of the remote campsite where she had last been seen, but just a few kilometres from her own family home, according to local media reports.\nThe relief felt by the officers who finally found her playing with toys in the locked house can be heard on audio released by police on Thursday.\nIn the recording, an officer can be heard saying \"we've got her, we've got her\", and asking the child her name. \n\"My name is Cleo,\" she responds, to the delight of the officers, who say: \"Hello Cleo!\"\nThe joy was felt across the police force, with deputy commissioner Col Blanch telling local radio of \"seasoned detectives openly crying with relief\" on hearing the news the little girl was safe.\nDetective Sergeant Cameron Blaine said she was alert and aware when he and his colleagues found her.\nDet Blaine, who visited the family after Cleo was released from a hospital check-up, added he was \"amazed she seems to be so well-adjusted and happy\" after her ordeal.\n\"It was really heart-warming to see her interact and playing in the backyard and just being herself and around her parents,\" he said.\nAccording to Reuters news agency, specialists will now be brought in to interview Cleo, while her parents have been given help in how to preserve her memories of the incident."

      "text": "Brexit Minister Lord Frost has met France's Europe minister in Paris in an attempt to resolve a dispute over post-Brexit fishing rights. \nTensions flared up last month after the UK and Jersey denied fishing permits to several French boats. \nFrance then threatened a series of measures against the UK unless more licences were granted by 2 November.\nBut President Emmanuel Macron suspended the threats at the 11th hour ahead of more talks between the two sides.\nThe French government has insisted that punitive measures - which could include a ban on British trawlers landing their catches in French ports and tighter customs checks on cross-Channel trade - remain \"on the table\" if a deal cannot be reached. \nFollowing the meeting, a UK government statement said the pair had \"discussed the range of difficulties arising from the application of the agreements between the UK and the EU\".\nIt added that Lord Frost and Mr Beaune were expected to speak again early next week.\nFrance's Europe Minister Clement Beaune tweeted he was \"happy to receive\" Lord Frost in Paris to \"restart a necessary dialogue\". \nLord Frost is now heading to Brussels on Friday to meet European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic to discuss problems of trading goods between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland following Brexit.\nThis may be a negotiation over post-Brexit fishing rights, but it's a test of post-Brexit relations.\nDisputes over technical issues - such as how French boats must prove their right to fish in British waters - are framed by wider personal and political mistrust.\nBoth sides are playing down expectations for the meeting today between David Frost and Clement Beaune.\nParis says the UK is deliberately blocking applications and not respecting the deal it signed.\nLondon - for once round the table with a major EU member state - is said to want to broaden the agenda to include other issues, like the Northern Ireland protocol.\nTriggered by the fate of a few dozen fishermen, this is just as much about the future relationship between France and post-Brexit Britain.\nIt comes after a British trawler, which was detained last week after French authorities said it did not have a license, was released. \nThe Scottish-registered scallop dredger Cornelis Gert Jan arrived back in the UK in the early hours of Thursday morning, after leaving Le Havre the previous evening. \nThe trawler's skipper Jondy Ward still faces trial in France next August regardless of Wednesday's court ruling that the boat can be released.\nHe has been charged with illegal fishing without a licence in French waters - but the case could be dropped before it reaches trial.\nMr Ward said they had been \"caught in the middle\" of the political row.\nIn short, it's about how many French fishing boats can catch fish in UK waters.\nUnder the Brexit trade deal, the EU and UK agreed they would give licences to boats if they can show they have fished in each other's waters for years.\nBut there have been disagreements about how much evidence is needed.\nBig trawlers will routinely collect this information automatically.\nBut smaller vessels that come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, can find it harder to provide the proof needed."

      "text": "A European manhunt is under way for a man accused of one of the biggest burglaries in English legal history, a BBC investigation has found. \nAlfredo Lindley is said to have led a series of burglaries on the luxury homes of three celebrities in December 2019 - including a \u00a325m raid on the home of F1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone.\nItalian authorities also accuse Lindley of raiding the home of Patrick Vieira, now Crystal Palace manager, in 2009.\nLindley is believed to be in Belgrade.\nThe 40-year-old Peruvian national has a criminal record in Italy for scams and burglaries under multiple identities dating back to 1995, according to court documents obtained by the BBC.\nInformation shows in the past decade Lindley has used at least 19 aliases - including Daniel Vukovic, Ljubomir Romanov and Ljubomir Radosavlejic.\nDocuments reveal these identities have links to various European cities including Belgrade, Sarajevo, Milan and Zagreb.\nUnder the name Ljubomir Romanov, Lindley appeared before a court in Belgrade on 27 August faced with extradition to the UK.\nThe case was brought by the Republic of Serbia's specialised department for organised crime. However, the extradition was refused by the Serbian authorities and Lindley is still believed to be in Belgrade.\nHe is listed as the co-owner of a construction business in the centre of the city. According to his Serbian Government-issued ID, his home address is in the town of Obrenovac, a municipality of Belgrade.\nMet Police detectives say Lindley is \"wanted for questioning in respect of a series of high-value burglaries committed in December 2019 in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea\".\nDuring the first 13 days of December 2019, an estimated \u00a326m worth of items were taken from the west London homes of Ms Ecclestone, Frank Lampard and the deceased former owner of Leicester City Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha\nThe raid on Ms Ecclestone's mansion alone - on one of the most expensive streets in the world - is believed to be the biggest domestic burglary in English legal history.\nMost of the stolen jewellery and watches have never been recovered.\nEarlier this year, four Romanian nationals were cleared of conspiracy to commit burglary following a two-month trial.\nItalian nationals Jugoslav Jovanovic, 24, Alessandro Donati, 44, and Alessandro Maltese, 45, were each extradited from Italy to the UK and have admitted their part in the raids.\nThey will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on 15 November.\nOn 30 November 2019, under the name Daniel Vukovic, Lindley, along with Jovanovic, flew in to London Stansted from Stockholm, according to details read out in a related court case.\nThe pair set up a base at a hotel in Orpington, south-east London.\nThe next day Jovanovic burgled the west London home of ex-Chelsea and England footballer Lampard and his wife Christine while the couple were out.\nMore than \u00a350,000 worth of items were stolen, including white-gold Patek Philippe cufflinks, a Cartier pocket watch, two rose-gold ladies' watches and a Mia Lia gold necklace.\nLindley is accused by police of being involved in the burglary.\nThen on 10 December, a Knightsbridge property belonging to the family of billionaire Leicester City owner Mr Srivaddhanaprabha was burgled.\nMr Srivaddhanaprabha died in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium in October 2018 and his family said the home had been left untouched since his death.\nLindley is accused of ransacking the house along with Jovanovic, Maltese and Donati.\nJurors were told last November that among the items taken were seven Patek Philippe watches, a Tag Heuer smart watch and about \u20ac400,000 in cash.\nThe next day the group dined at a sushi restaurant near Harrods where they had a \u00a3760 champagne and sashimi lunch.\nFinally, on 13 December, Lindley is said to have carried out the Ecclestone raid, along with Maltese and Donati, while Jovanovic kept watch.\nIsleworth Crown Court heard that the men, equipped with screwdrivers, targeted the palatial home opposite Kensington Palace F1 heiress Ms Ecclestone shares with her husband Jay Rutland. The couple had left for a Christmas holiday in Lapland only hours earlier.\nKensington Palace Gardens is the most expensive street in the world, has an armed-guard presence and is home to the Russian, French and Israeli embassies as well as Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovic and the Sultan of Brunei.\nMany of the rooms inside Ms Ecclestone's mansion were cleared of valuables. In just over an hour, the burglars made off with 400 items of jewellery and large sums of cash.\nAfter a brief stay at an AirBnB in Chelsea, Lindley left the country on 18 December on an AirSerbia flight from Heathrow to Belgrade.\nDetectives do not believe Lindley has been back to the UK since.\nAuthorities in Italy allege Lindley is linked to more high-end burglaries.\nThey say that in September 2009 he and some accomplices raided the homes of international footballers Patrick Vieira and Sulley Muntari.\nThe two midfielders had been playing in a Milan derby for Internazionale when their homes were burgled.\nItalian court documents allege the gang took possession of a safe containing about \u20ac15,000 in cash, jewellery and 28 \"fine watches\" worth about \u20ac200,000.\nThe estimated value of the haul from both burglaries was over \u20ac1m.\nAccording to the documents, proceedings against him are yet to take place although they were due to commence in June 2017.\nThe papers also state that on New Year's Eve 2010, Lindley was caught on camera entering the Milan apartment of Maria Luisa Gavazzeni, the widow of the designer Nicola Trussardi.\nAfter forcing open a window, Lindley and his accomplices removed a safe that contained \u20ac2m worth of jewels.\nHe was jailed for two years and four months for his part in the burglary.\nLindley and his legal representatives did not respond when approached by the BBC."

      "text": "Owen Paterson has resigned as an MP after a row over his conduct led to a government U-turn.\nThe Conservative was found to have broken lobbying rules and was facing suspension - until Tory MPs blocked it by calling for an overhaul of the MPs' standards watchdog instead. \nThey initially had the backing of No 10, but Downing Street reversed its decision after a furious backlash. \nMr Paterson said he now wanted a life \"outside the cruel world of politics\". \nIn a statement, the 65-year-old, who has represented North Shropshire since 1997, said the past two years had been \"an indescribable nightmare for my family and me\".\nHe said his integrity had been \"repeatedly and publicly questioned\", and claimed he was \"totally innocent\" of breaking lobbying rules. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to his \"friend and colleague\", saying he had had a \"distinguished career\" and was a \"voice for freedom\".  \nBut other MPs said he needed to be held to account for his actions, with one, Labour's Sam Tarry, tweeting: \"Good riddance.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the prime minister to apologise to the whole country for the \"chaotic\" past 24 hours, and for his \"grubby attempt to cover up for the misdemeanour of his friend\".\nBy Damian Grammaticas, political correspondent\nThe past 24 hours have clearly been damaging to Boris Johnson and the government.\nThere's been a hit to both on the issue of integrity - a perception this was sleazy, undermining of standards.\nThere's also been a hit to the prime minister within the Conservative Party. Dozens of his MPs disobeyed when told to vote to block Owen Paterson's immediate suspension.\nEvery rebellion chips away at a prime minister's authority. The government's swift U-turn, making Wednesday's vote meaningless, only dismayed more MPs and left questions about poor decision-making at the top.\nThe government says its aim is to improve the standards system. But if so that task will be harder now, as there's suspicion about its motives - and the opposition will have to be satisfied with whatever it proposes.\nAnd there's to be a by-election, which will play out under intense scrutiny, with the opposition undoubtedly hammering away that issue of sleaze.\nThe Commons Standards Committee concluded last week that Mr Paterson had misused his position as an MP to benefit two firms he worked for, after a damning report on his behaviour by standards commissioner Kathryn Stone.\nIt recommended he be suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days - a sanction that could also lead to a recall petition in his constituency, and the possibility of him facing a by-election. \nSuch recommendations - which have to be signed off by MPs - are usually accepted without much discussion.\nBut on Wednesday, the government ordered its MPs to vote for an amendment to halt Mr Paterson's case and to rejig the standards system. \nBorn in Whitchurch, Shropshire, in 1956, he studied history at Cambridge University, before joining his family leather business, of which he later became managing director.\nHe was first elected MP for North Shropshire in 1997 and had a majority of almost 23,000 at the last general election. \nPaterson was made Northern Ireland secretary in 2010, moving to become environment secretary in 2012.\nAfter leaving the government in 2014 he was a strong supporter of Brexit.\nHis wife Rose, chair of Aintree racecourse, took her own life in 2020. The couple had three children.\nOpposition parties accused the Conservatives of corruption and sleaze, saying they were just looking out for their own MP, and Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats refused to take part in any new process. \nOn Thursday morning, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg announced a U-turn, saying no new process would go ahead without cross-party support and any changes would not be made retrospectively in Mr Paterson's case. \nMr Paterson did not know the government was going to ditch the proposals ahead of Mr Rees-Mogg's announcement and was in a supermarket when told the news by a BBC journalist. \nThe prime minister's spokesman said he had \"recognised the strength of feeling on all sides of the House around the issue and changed his mind when it became clear that a cross-party consensus on the changes was not possible\".  \nBut Labour's Sir Keir said Mr Johnson \"must explain how he intends to fix the immense harm he has done to confidence in the probity of him and his MPs\".\nAnd despite Mr Paterson's resignation, the SNP's Pete Wishart said it was \"not the end of this sorry saga\".\nHe tweeted: \"Something rotten has happened in the last couple of days and the extraordinary behaviour of this government must be examined.\"\nMr Paterson said it was a \"painful decision\" to resign but \"the right one\".\nHe said the past few days had been \"intolerable\", claiming he had seen people - including MPs - \"publicly mock and deride\" the death of his wife Rose, who took her own life last year. \nIn an earlier statement, the former Northern Ireland secretary said the investigation into his conduct had been \"a major contributory factor\" in her death. \nOn Thursday, Mr Paterson added: \"My children have therefore asked me to leave politics altogether, for my sake as well as theirs.\n\"I agree with them. I do not want my wife's memory and reputation to become a political football. Above all, I always put my family first.\"\nThere was no mention of the standards row in Mr Johnson's tribute to the Tory MP, instead saying: \"I am very sad that Parliament will lose the services of Owen Paterson who has been a friend and colleague of mine for decades. \n\"He has had a distinguished career, serving in two cabinet positions, and above all he has been a voice for freedom - for free markets and free trade and free societies - and he was an early and powerful champion of Brexit. \n\"I know that this must have been a very difficult decision but I can understand why - after the tragic circumstances in which he lost his beloved wife Rose - he has decided to put his family first.\"\nMr Paterson's resignation means there will shortly be a by-election for his safe Conservative seat. \nMr Paterson has been a paid consultant for clinical diagnostics company Randox since 2015 and to meat distributor Lynn's Country Foods since 2016, earning a total of \u00a3100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary.\nMPs are allowed to have these jobs, but are not allowed to be paid advocates - using their influence in Whitehall for the company's gain.\nThe committee concluded that Mr Paterson had breached this rule on paid advocacy by:\nMr Paterson was also found to have broken conduct rules by:"

      "text": "Labour has ruled out standing aside in favour of a cross-party \"anti-sleaze\" candidate in the by-election to replace Tory MP Owen Paterson.\nMr Paterson announced his resignation after the government changed its mind over blocking his suspension from Parliament for breaking lobbying rules.\nLabour held talks with the Lib Dems and Greens about whether to get behind an independent candidate in the by-election to replace him.\nBut the party says it will stand.\nLiberal Democrat leader Ed Davey also confirmed his party would put forward a candidate after being a \"clear second\" in last year's local elections.\nHe told the BBC News channel: \"We see ourselves as the challengers and we can be the ones who take this message on behalf of people.. to really put pressure on the Conservatives.\"\nNo date has been set for the by-election in North Shropshire, an ultra-safe Conservative seat Mr Paterson held with 62.7% of the vote at the 2019 election.\nIn the end, the discussions didn't last long.  \nSeveral opposition party figures said on Thursday that the idea of a non-affiliated anti-sleaze candidate was being actively considered. \nBecause North Shropshire has been a very safe Conservative seat, the rationale was that such a candidate would keep the issue of \"sleaze\" in the headlines. \nSome speculated that, just maybe, a good independent candidate would stand a chance. \nBut as we reported on Thursday night, no candidate was agreed upon. \nThe fact that Owen Paterson is not standing put some off the idea. There were practical difficulties too.  \nAnd on Friday morning, the Labour leadership made it clear their party won't take part.  \nNot for the first time, parties who have floated the idea of working together have found it very hard to get off the ground.  \nBack in 1997 former BBC journalist Martin Bell took on - and defeated - Conservative incumbent Neil Hamilton in Tatton, Cheshire, after opposition parties stepped aside.\nWearing a white suit, he campaigned as an independent on an \"anti-sleaze\" ticket, with the other major parties not putting up a candidate. \nA Labour source had said a similar approach might be a \"sensible idea\", but the party has now indicated it will stand a candidate.\nThe Lib Dems are also standing, hoping to replicate their by-election win earlier this year in the previously Conservative-held seat the Chesham of Amersham.\nMr Paterson has held North Shropshire since 1997. Labour was a distant second at the last election in 2019, with the Liberal Democrats third. \nThe Commons Standards Committee concluded last week that the former cabinet minister had misused his position as an MP to benefit two firms he worked for, after a damning report on his behaviour by standards commissioner Kathryn Stone.\nIt recommended that he be suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days, which could have prompted a by-election.\nBut on Wednesday, the government ordered its MPs to vote for an amendment to halt Mr Paterson's case and to rejig the standards system.\nAmid an outcry from opposition parties. it changed its mind on Thursday and Mr Paterson, a former cabinet minister, announced he was quitting Parliament.\nHe said the past few days had been \"intolerable\", but called his decision \"the right one\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to Mr Paterson's \"distinguished career\", describing him as a friend.\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson \"must explain how he intends to fix the immense harm he has done to confidence in the probity of him and his MPs\".\nLabour and the SNP have also insisted the Commissioner for Standards must be allowed to continue her work scrutinising other MPs.\nEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister had always been clear that paid lobbying was wrong and it had been a \"mistake\" to conflate creating a \"fairer\" system with a right of appeal in an individual case.\nIn response to reports Mr Johnson had wanted the system changed to pre-empt an investigation into the redecoration of his Downing Street flat, Mr Zahawi said this was \"absolutely not true\".

      "tags": "Romney Marsh,New Romney,Royal Tunbridge Wells,Heathfield",
      "text": "A hospital worker has admitted murdering two women in 1987, and sexually abusing at least 100 female corpses, including children.\nDavid Fuller, 67, of Heathfield, East Sussex, attacked Wendy Knell and Caroline Pierce in Tunbridge Wells.\nOn the fourth day of his murder trial at Maidstone Crown Court, Fuller changed his plea to guilty.\nHe previously admitted sexually abusing bodies in two Kent hospital morgues over 12 years.\nFuller had earlier admitted to killing the women subject to \"diminished responsibility\", but denied murder.\nMrs Justice Cheema-Grubb directed the jury to find him guilty on both counts of murder, after he was rearraigned.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said: \"This is a shocking case. The sickening nature of the crimes committed will understandably cause public revulsion and concern.\n\"I would also like... to remember Wendy Knell and Caroline Pierce, two young women who had their lives brutally taken away from them over 30 years ago. I hope their families can find some solace in seeing justice finally done.\"\nWarning: this article contains information some people may find distressing.\nFuller previously admitted sexually abusing bodies in two Kent hospital morgues over 12 years.\nAhead of the trial he had pleaded guilty to 51 offences, including 44 charges relating to 78 identified victims in the two mortuaries where he worked as an electrician.\nMs Knell's family said in a statement that \"it's good knowing he will not be in a position to hurt or cause any more pain\".\nA date for sentencing has yet to be set. \nInvestigators said the case came together following recent advances in DNA testing - and a huge police operation costing \u00a32.5m - which linked Fuller to the double killings, dubbed \"the Bedsit Murders\".\nHis saliva and other DNA was found on Ms Knell's bedding, towel and intimate samples.\nHis semen was also found on Ms Pierce's tights, the only item of clothing she was wearing when her body was found in a water-filled dyke three weeks after her abduction.\nFollowing his arrest for the murders, a search of Fuller's home revealed he had hoarded millions of indecent images and videos of children and extreme pornography on hard drives, floppy discs, DVDs and memory cards in his loft and spare room.\nTwo of the drives were hidden in a box, which was screwed to the back of a chest of drawers and placed inside a wardrobe. On these drives officers found footage Fuller had recorded of himself abusing corpses in the morgues.\nFolders, some labelled with the names of the victims, contained images and videos of him molesting female bodies, including three children, between 2008 and November 2020.\nPolice have been unable to identify 20 of the victims.\nDet Ch Supt Paul Fotheringham: \"Sadly, it is likely to be the case that some of the victims will never be identified. \n\"In these cases there is such limited information available to help us with establishing their identities, and there are no lines of enquiry outside of the investigation that can assist us.\"\nFuller worked in electrical maintenance at hospitals since 1989 and was at the Kent and Sussex Hospital, until it closed in September 2011. \nHe was transferred to the Tunbridge Wells Hospital at Pembury, where the offences continued until his arrest.\nInvestigators said Fuller would work late shifts and go into the morgue when other staff had left, often \"visiting the same bodies repeatedly\".\nFuller's offending in the mortuaries is not something Kent Police, or any other force in the country, has ever had to deal with before.\nOver the past nine months a bespoke package of care has been created with Victim Support, specially designed for this case.\nIt has cost \u00a31.5m and involved drafting in 150 police family liaison officers, who were put through specialist training.\nThe families of the identified victims were visited for the force to break the news, and their assigned liaison officers will continue to support them going forward.\nThere is evidence Ms Knell was raped during or after her death, the court heard.\nMs Knell was killed in her home in Guildford Road on 23 June 1987. She was found in her bed by her boyfriend the following day, after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up to work.\nIn a written statement released after Fuller changed his plea, Ms Knell's family said for 34 years they had wanted to know who killed her, and \"how she spent her last moments alive\".\n\"We now know, and sadly it's much worse than we could ever have imagined.\n\"Hopefully, we can now start to grieve and move past the pain and start to remember her as the beautiful, kind, generous, caring, funny girl she was. \n\"Although the guilty plea won't change anything deep down, as the pain and loss will always be there, it's good knowing he will not be in a position to hurt or cause any more pain.\"\nWhat happened to Ms Pierce after she was abducted from outside her home in Grosvenor Park on 24 November is less clear.\nNeighbours reported hearing screaming, but it took three weeks for her body to be spotted by a farm worker, more than 40 miles away in Romney Marsh.\nPolice said it was very likely Fuller met both women before he killed them.\nFuller was a customer of SupaSnaps, the photo development chain on Camden Road where Ms Knell worked.\nPhotos and diary entries found in Fuller's home also show he went to Buster Brown's restaurant, on the same road, where Ms Pierce was a manager.\nFuller kept a record of having carried out at least 30 burglaries, dubbed by police as \"creeper-style\", during the 70s.\nBut he never served time in prison, and the offending preceded the police DNA database.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the NHS had written to all trusts asking for mortuary access and post-mortem activities to be reviewed in the wake of the case.  \nMiles Scott, chief executive of the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, said: \"I want to say on behalf of the Trust, how shocked and appalled I am by the criminal activity by David Fuller in our hospital mortuary that has been revealed in court.\n\"And most importantly, I want to apologise to the families of those who've been the victims of these terrible crimes.\"\nHe said: \"I am confident that our mortuary today is safe and secure. But I am determined to see if there are any lessons to be learned or systems to be improved.\"\nThe trust has commissioned an independent investigation into the case to identify anything that could have been done differently. \nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "A woman travelled to Lithuania for a hip replacement because the NHS in Wales faces such huge waiting lists. \nJill Davies, from Birchgrove, Swansea, waited four years to see a consultant and was told there was a further three-year wait for an operation. \nIt comes as a surgeon warned patients on waiting lists had been questioning whether their lives were worth living.\nThe Welsh government said it wanted to \"radically transform\" how healthcare was delivered.\nMs Davies, 66, a retired head teacher, was told in 2016 she had arthritis in both hips and that it was more severe in her right, but only in December 2020 was she referred to a hip consultant. \n\"By that time I could not really walk,\" she said. \n\"I was down to walking like 25 metres, using a stick all the time. If I went shopping I used to hire one of the scooters because I was lacking in mobility at that time.\"\nWhen she finally saw the consultant this year he told her he would put her on the waiting list for an operation, but that it would take three years. \n\"At that point I burst into tears,\" Ms Davies said. \nShe was \"absolutely flattened\" so decided to go to Lithuania for treatment.\nShe contacted a clinic on 1 July, flew out on the 22nd and had her operation on 24 July, followed by a 10-day intensive rehabilitation programme.\n\"I'm in no pain,\" she said. \n\"I can walk, I'm swimming, I can drive and do what I want to do. I've got my life back.\"  \nPaul Williams, an orthopaedic surgeon at Neath Port Talbot Hospital, said the effect of long delays on mental and physical health was \"horrific\".\nHe said: \"To be living with pain from an arthritic joint is terrible.\n\"We sent out a questionnaire recently and many of the patients have actually replied that they're questioning if their life is worth living because of the pain they're in.\" \nThe latest figures for the Welsh NHS showed another record high for those waiting for hospital treatment. \nThe number of patients waiting more than 36 weeks has grown from 25,634 in February 2020 to 243,674 by August 2021.\nThe longest waits included 56,279 people who needed orthopaedic or trauma treatment.\nThe overall waiting list for treatment is a record 657,539 -  just over a fifth of the Welsh population.\nIn the Swansea Bay health board, which covers Swansea county and Neath Port Talbot, problems were exacerbated when elective surgery at Morriston Hospital was postponed for seven months in 2019, before the Covid pandemic hit. \nThe health board said it planned to transform services with its three hospitals focusing on different things to protect surgery from emergency needs or winter pressures.\nNeath Port Talbot Hospital will become an orthopaedic centre of excellence, with investment approved by the Welsh government for four new theatres. \nOrthopaedic surgeon and Singleton and Neath Port Talbot hospitals' medical director, Dougie Russell, said: \"Now the pandemic's happened it's given us an opportunity to reset the whole system. \n\"This is our opportunity to get ourselves on a level footing.\" \nThe Royal College of Surgeons said regional hubs concentrating on routine surgery should be introduced across Wales to cope with the backlog. \nMr Williams said: \"Orthopaedics has always been seen as an area where patients can wait a bit longer and a bit longer, and perhaps a bit longer still, but you can't put a price on that.\" \nPlans for the three hospitals come as a Welsh government conference meets on Thursday to discuss tackling waiting times.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said she would invest another \u00a3170m a year to \"transform\" planned care. \nShe will tell the meeting she hopes extra cash will \"build a planned care system that is bigger, better and more effective than we have seen before\".\nDirector of the Bevan Commission think tank, Helen Howson, said fixing record waiting times would be the biggest challenge facing the NHS since its creation. \nShe said the disruption Covid caused should force it to address problems that existed before the pandemic. \nThe Welsh government said it wanted health boards to \"radically transform\" the way planned healthcare was delivered. \nAs well as the \u00a3170m, Ms Morgan will outline \u00a31m for a fund to help health boards to innovate.\nShe said: \"The impact of the pandemic on planned care has been significant, resulting in a massive backlog of patients waiting for planned treatments.\n\"We need a whole system approach to how care is delivered and by investing \u00a3248m in Covid recovery, \u00a3170m in planned care and \u00a342m in social care, we hope to put NHS Wales in a stronger position for future generations.\"\nNHS Wales chief executive, Judith Padgett, said: \"We need to transform the way we deliver services. Many advancements and new ways of working have come online during the pandemic, but it is important to build on these and use the opportunity to create modern health and social services for the future.\""

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Jacob Rees-Mogg,Owen Paterson,Parliamentary Standards Commissioner ",
      "text": "The government has U-turned on its plans to overhaul the policing of MPs' conduct after a furious backlash.\nOn Wednesday, No 10 backed a shake-up of the standards watchdog and blocked the suspension of one of its own former ministers, Owen Paterson.\nThis sparked an angry reaction from Labour and some Tory MPs, who feared it would look like corruption to voters.\nMPs will now vote again on Mr Paterson's recommended 30-day suspension for misusing his position. \nDowning Street would not confirm the date of the vote, but said it would happen \"as soon as possible\". \nMr Paterson was found to have broken Parliament's rules by using his position as an MP to benefit two companies he was working for as an adviser, for which he was paid \u00a3100,000 a year on top of his Commons salary.\nHe insists he did nothing wrong, and on Wednesday the government backed moves by his Conservative colleagues to change the rules.\nBut opposition parties refused to cooperate, prompting a hasty rethink from Downing Street.\nAfter the government's U-turn on Thursday, Boris Johnson's spokesman said the prime minister had \"recognised the strength of feeling on all sides of the House\" and \"changed his mind when it became clear that a cross-party consensus on the changes was not possible\".\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson \"leading his troops through the sewer\", claiming what had happened in the past 24 hours had been \"corrupt\".\nWhat looks like a shambles has caused problems in several different directions. \nThere is particular concern among Tory MPs elected for the first time in 2019 - a new generation questioning the attitudes and, some believe, entitlement of their political seniors. \nIn the words of one MP it has \"destroyed a lot of goodwill\" and, without doubt, will make them less willing to defend the government the next time something goes wrong. \nOwen Paterson and his supporters, who genuinely believe he has been wronged, are now left dangling, and, arguably, there will now be even more attention and more anguish around his case.  \nBoris Johnson has left himself vulnerable to suspicions about his own personal interest in the system, which just happens to have found that he has made mistakes over the years. \nRead Laura's full blog\nAnnouncing the U-turn in Parliament, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the overhaul would not now go ahead without cross-party support. \nHe told MPs there was a \"strong feeling\" that any change to the standards process should not just be based on Mr Paterson's case, and Wednesday's Commons vote had \"conflated\" the two issues.\n\"This link needs to be broken,\" he added, saying the government would come back to MPs with more detailed proposals after discussions with the other parties. \nAnother vote will also take place on whether Mr Paterson should be suspended.\nReacting to the U-turn, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"What has happened in that last 24 hours is corrupt. There is no other word for it.\"\nHe added: \"To rip the whole system up to protect [Mr Paterson] is corrupt. There is no point shilly-shallying around and pretending it is something else. This goes to the very very top.\"\nAn emergency Commons debate on the issue will take place on Monday, after the Liberal Democrats requested it.\nThe Commons Standards Committee concluded last week that Tory MP Mr Paterson misused his position as an MP to benefit two firms he worked for, after a damning report on his behaviour by standards commissioner Kathryn Stone.\nThey recommended he be suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days - a sanction that could also lead to a recall petition in his constituency, and the possibility of him facing a by-election. \nSuch recommendations - which have to be signed off by MPs - are usually accepted without much discussion.\nBut on Wednesday, the government ordered its members to vote for an amendment to halt Mr Paterson's case and to rejig the standards system. \nLabour, the SNP and Lib Dems voted against the plans, along with 13 Conservative MPs, while dozens of Tories abstained. But it was carried by 18 votes to cries of \"shame\" from the opposition benches. \nMr Paterson has been a paid consultant for clinical diagnostics company Randox since 2015 and to meat distributer Lynn's Country Foods since 2016.\nMPs are allowed to have these jobs, but are not allowed to be paid advocates - using their influence in Whitehall for the company's gain.\nThe committee concluded that Mr Paterson had breached this rule on paid advocacy by:\nMr Paterson was also found to have broken conduct rules by:\nThe SNP's Pete Wishart also said the incident had left MPs with \"absolutely no trust from any of the members of the public at all\".\nAnd Tory MP Mark Harper - who voted against the government - called it \"one of the most unedifying episodes I have seen in my 16 years as a Member of Parliament\", adding: \"My colleagues should not have been instructed, from the very top, to vote for this. This must not happen again.\"\nMeanwhile, a junior minister who lost her job after breaking with the government ranks to abstain on the vote, Angela Richardson, was reappointed to her post in the Department for Levelling Up.

      "title": "Molnupiravir: First pill to treat Covid gets approval in UK",
      "text": "The first pill designed to treat symptomatic Covid has been approved by the UK medicines regulator. \nThe tablet - molnupiravir - will be given twice a day to vulnerable patients recently diagnosed with the disease. \nIn clinical trials the pill, originally developed to treat flu, cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the treatment was a \"gamechanger\" for the most frail and immunosuppressed.\nIn a statement he said: \"Today is a historic day for our country, as the UK is now the first country in the world to approve an antiviral that can be taken at home for Covid.\"\nMolnupiravir, developed by the US drug companies Merck, Sharp and Dohme (MSD) and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is the first antiviral medication for Covid which can be taken as a pill rather than injected or given intravenously.\nThe UK has agreed to purchase 480,000 courses with the first deliveries expected in November.\nInitially it will be given to both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients through a national study, with extra data on its effectiveness collected before any decision to order more.\nThe drug needs to be given within five days of symptoms developing to be most effective. \nIt's not immediately clear how it will be distributed so quickly by the NHS. It's thought some care homes may be offered supplies while other elderly or vulnerable patients may be prescribed it by their GP after testing positive for Covid.\nThe new treatment targets an enzyme that the virus uses to make copies of itself, introducing errors into its genetic code. That should prevent it from multiplying, so keeping virus levels low in the body and reducing the severity of the disease.\nMerck said that approach should make the treatment equally effective against new variants of the virus as it evolves in the future. \nThe UK regulator, the MHRA, said the tablet had been authorised for use in people who have mild to moderate Covid and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness such as obesity, old age, diabetes or heart disease.\nThe organisation's chief executive, June Raine, described it as \"another therapeutic to add to our armoury against Covid-19\". \n\"It is the world's first approved antiviral for this disease that can be taken by mouth rather than administered intravenously,\" she said.\n\"This is important, because it means it can be administered outside of a hospital setting, before Covid-19 has progressed to a severe stage.\"\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, warned on Wednesday of some \"hard months to come\" in the pandemic. \nHe said that while Covid cases appeared to have stabilised, deaths were rising and there were signs infections were starting to \"penetrate\" older age groups.\nThe UK recorded 41,242 Covid cases on Thursday and 214 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nEarlier clinical trials of molnupiravir on 775 patients who had recently caught Covid found:\nThe results were published in a press release and have not yet been peer-reviewed. \nBut data suggest molnupiravir needs to be taken soon after symptoms develop to have an effect. An earlier study in patients who had already been hospitalised with severe Covid was halted after disappointing results.\nIn its approval document, the MHRA recommends the drug is used \"as soon as possible\" following a positive Covid test and within five days of symptoms onset. \nProf Penny Ward, from King's College London, who was not involved in the study, said: \"If these outcomes are replicated in the UK population, then the number of cases requiring hospital admission could be halved and the number of deaths greatly reduced.\n\"It seems likely that it will be restricted for use by those at highest risk of disease complications - for example older adults with heart, lung or kidney disease, diabetes or cancer.\"\nThe UK government has not disclosed how much its initial contract for 480,000 courses of molnupiravir is worth. But US authorities recently made an advance purchase of 1.7 million courses at a cost of roughly $1.2 billion, or $700 (\u00a3513) for each patient. \nOther countries including Australia, Singapore and South Korea have also made purchase agreements.\nMerck is the first company to report trial results of a pill to treat Covid, but other companies are working on similar treatments. \nIts US rival Pfizer has started trials of two different antiviral tablets, while Swiss company Roche is working on a similar medication."

      "text": "An MP who made threatening phone calls to a woman because she was jealous of her relationship with her partner has been given a suspended sentence.\nClaudia Webbe, a former Labour MP for Leicester East who is now independent, was convicted of one charge of harassment last month.\nWestminster Magistrates' Court heard she made several calls over two years and threatened the woman with acid.\nWebbe was handed a 10-week sentence, suspended for two years, on Thursday.\nThe 56-year-old made 16 calls to Michelle Merritt, a long-term friend of Webbe's partner Lester Thomas, between September 2018 and April last year in a campaign of harassment borne out of jealousy, the court heard.\nThe court was told on one occasion she made an \"angry\" call, used a derogatory term and added: \"You should be acid.\"\nIt also heard how Webbe threatened to send naked images of Ms Merritt to her family and a recording of a call in which she was heard shouting \"get out of my relationship\".\nAddressing the court, Ms Merritt said she had been left \"very scared\" by the harassment, struggling to work and socialise.\n\"I've almost become a hermit,\" the 59-year-old - who the court heard had never met Webbe - added.\n\"No woman should be threatened and harassed as Ms Webbe has done to me over the years, let alone by a politician.\"\nLabour's national campaign co-ordinator Shabana Mahmood confirmed Webbe had been expelled from the party and called for her to resign as an MP.\nShe said Labour would push for a recall petition to force a by-election if Webbe did not quit the Commons.\n\"She should do the right thing by the people of Leicester East,\" she added.\nChief magistrate Paul Goldspring, sentencing, said: \"I have no doubt that, when not overtaken by jealousy and rage, you are a hard-working, upstanding Member of Parliament and of society.\n\"[But] the level of harassment and the threats you made cannot be excused.\"\nHe added he found it \"odd and concerning\" that the probation service report said Webbe felt like a victim herself. \nThe district judge said he counted four occasions when Webbe referred to herself as \"the victim\" during her testimony from the witness box.\nMr Goldspring told the court Webbe \"showed little remorse or contrition\" and would have been jailed immediately were it not for her previous good character.\nThe sentence means Webbe will face a recall petition, which could trigger a by-election if at least 10% of her constituents support it. \nBy Tim Parker, BBC Radio Leicester political reporter \nMr Goldspring knows only too well what his decision today means for the Leicester East constituency.\nIt sets in train the possibility of a by-election, but it's a slow train with an uncertain timetable that might never reach the destination some are hoping for.\nIf Claudia Webbe fails to overturn her sentence, she faces a recall petition - where her constituents will be asked if they want to replace her.\nBut with the backlog of cases in courts at the moment, that appeal is likely to take several weeks.\nIf a recall petition is triggered, that must last six weeks. Factor in the time taken to organise that too - and the potential impact of the holiday period - and it makes a by-election date even more difficult to predict.\nThere were 78,433 people able to vote in Leicester East in 2019 - 10% of them need to feel strongly enough to sign a recall petition, for a by-election to be triggered.\nHowever, the process is pending any appeal by Webbe against her conviction, an avenue she said she would pursue. \nIn a statement, Webbe said: \"I am very disappointed by the decision of the magistrate and want to strongly reiterate that I am innocent.\n\"I am lodging an appeal and despite today's sentence, I fully expect the appeal to be granted and that, ultimately, it will be successful.\" \nHer defence lawyer, Paul Hynes QC, said Webbe had also received threats of violence on social media, as well as racist comments.\nHe said after her conviction, police had received a called from a man threatening a female MP they believed was Claudia Webbe.\n\"[She has been] subjected to extraordinary vilification,\" he added.\nMr Hynes previously read out character references from former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, ex-shadow chancellor John McDonnell and former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott supporting their former colleague.\nWebbe was elected as Leicester East MP in 2019, replacing Keith Vaz who was suspended from the Commons. \nShe also worked as a councillor in Islington between 2010 and 2021.\nWebbe, of Islington, north London, was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and told to pay \u00a33,128 in costs and surcharges. \nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

This was down from 60.6% in the previous month.\nBut more people started treatment for cancer in the latest month than in the previous month. \nThe total number of patients starting their first cancer treatment and the number of patients starting their treatment within the target time were the second highest since the current records began.\nThe Conservatives called the figures \"catastrophic\", saying Wales should be seeing improvements after it moved from the peak of the pandemic.\nHealth spokesman Russell George said: \"To record the worst ever A&E waiting times and the longest NHS treatment waiting list in the same month shows a complete lack of leadership.\"\nPlaid Cymru said the figures painted a bleak picture and called for a long-term plan.\n\"We cannot be trapped in an endless cycle where waiting times are getting increasingly worse and the only solution the government can come up with is to provide short-term fixes which change very little in the long run,\" said health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth."

      "text": "A farmer said he was given a \u00a315,000 fine after some of the trees he planted in a Welsh government scheme were in the wrong place - some by a few inches. \nDavid Mills, from Lower Chapel, Powys, decided to plant 13,000 trees on 20 acres of his land as part of the Glastir Woodland Creation scheme. \nEarlier this year, Mr Mills was told he had contravened the original plans. \nThe Welsh government said it could not comment on a case which was subject to an appeal. \nIt added it had a \"statutory obligation\" to enforce the rules, but it was reviewing the current rules of the scheme. \nMr Mills said he felt like he had \"done his bit\" to encourage biodiversity on his farm and tackle climate change when he planted the trees. \nBut he received a letter from Rural Payments Wales telling him he had contravened original plans - using satellite images as evidence - and that he faced a \u00a315,000 fine. \nHe said: \"We'd planted the right number of trees, I'd got someone from Welsh government to plan and draw up all the diagrams.

It's a ridiculous situation.\" \nHe said he had to borrow money from his son to pay the fine straight away, as it was accruing heavy interest, and that he had been unsuccessful in an appeal. \nHe said Rural Payments Wales told him the tree planting differed from the original plan, in some cases by as little as 10cm (4in). \n\"It's been horrific,\" Mr Mills added. \n\"I feel like I've been tricked and cheated, and the hypocrisy when you see someone [from Welsh government] saying 'we want to plant more trees' and this is the way I'm treated for doing what I thought was environmentally friendly. \n\"I want to increase biodiversity - I'm not doing it for any other reason other than I care.\" \nMr Mills said farmers should be supported, rather than penalised, for planting trees and maintaining them. \nHe said: \"I would have expected a pat on the back, but instead of that I get a \u00a315,000 fine.\" \nHis appeal has been supported by National Farmers' Union (NFU) Cymru, which said it is representing two other farms in similar situations but facing even higher fines. \nStella Owen, a county adviser, said she was concerned about the reputational damage to the tree planting scheme. \nShe said it was not just about the financial penalty as farmers found it \"scarring\" to have committed to the scheme and then feel like they have failed.\n\"That's no help to anybody, that doesn't deliver the aspirations of what Welsh government want,\" she added.\n\"That doesn't do anything for the mental health of the farmer and to all intents and purposes, it will just put people off.\n\"If they want that uptake, then there has to be more leniency in terms of a simple, robust scheme which can allow changes.\n\"There is absolutely no need for this level of financial penalty to be imposed five years down the line.\" \nThe scheme was launched in 2015 with the aim of combating climate change, increasing biodiversity and establishing habitats for wildlife.\nFarmers were offered grants to plant trees and payments to maintain them over 12 years, which feed into plans for a National Forest for Wales. \nThe Welsh government said: \"Contracts can be verified by on-farm visits or the use of latest available aerial imagery. \n\"When the scheme verification shows the conditions of the contract have not been met, the Welsh government has a statutory obligation to apply European Commission rules concerning the recovery of payments and application of over-declaration penalties.\n\"We are committed to supporting farmers to create more woodland in order to tackle climate change.\""

      "tags": "Vaccination,HPV,Cervical cancer,Cancer",
      "text": "New research has found the HPV vaccine can reduce cases of cervical cancer by nearly 90%. \nCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women around the world, killing more than 300,000 each year.\nThe HPV vaccine protects against several types of HPV.\nThey include those causing nearly all cases of cervical cancer, most anal cancers, and some genital and head and neck cancers.\nStudies have shown that the vaccine protects against HPV infection for at least 10 years, although experts expect protection to last much longer.\nThe first major study suggests it is very effective, cutting cases of cervical cancer by nearly 90%. \nPublished in the Lancet, it looked at what happened after the vaccine was introduced for girls in England in 2008.\nThe HPV vaccine works best if girls and boys get it before they come into contact with HPV.\nThat's because the vaccine can only prevent an infection, it cannot rid the body of the virus once it has been caught. \nThe viruses are so widespread that immunisation has to be aimed at children before they become sexually active.\nHPV (short for human papillomavirus) is the name for a very common group of viruses. \nThere are more than 100 different types of HPV and infections do not usually cause any symptoms - although some types can cause warts. These may appear on your hand, foot, genitals or inside your mouth.\nMost people, however, will not know they're infected and their bodies will get rid of the virus without treatment. \nHigh-risk types of HPV, on the other hand, can cause abnormal tissue growth which can lead to cancers. \nIt is very easy to pick up, being very contagious, and is spread by close skin-to-skin contact.\nUp to 80% of people are exposed to HPV by the age of 25.\nIn most cases people are infected for 18 months to two years.\nIt is not technically a sexually transmitted disease, as it is not spread by sexual fluids, in the same way as diseases such as gonorrhoea.\nHowever it is often transmitted during sexual contact, including touching.\nAlmost 90% of cervical cancer deaths are in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  \nIn these countries, cervical cancer is often not identified until it has further advanced and symptoms develop. \nLast year, the WHO announced plans to eliminate the disease \"within the next century\" by achieving 90% coverage for HPV vaccination by 2030. \nOver a hundred countries have now introduced HPV vaccination.  \nHowever, as of 2020, less than 25% of low-income and under 30% of lower middle-income countries had introduced the vaccine, compared with 85% of high-income countries.\nCervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in Africa, but it is the deadliest, the WHO says.\nInadequate screening programmes, limited access to treatment services and vaccine hesitancy all contribute to this.\nRwanda was one of the first countries in Africa to introduce a vaccination campaign. It launched a plan in 2011 to get girls vaccinated early and to introduce cervical screening for women.  \nIn the first year it reached nine out 10 girls eligible for the vaccine, a result that experts cite as a model for other countries.\nHowever, HPV vaccine rates remain low even in some developed countries, partly due to misinformation that it could cause infertility. Currently, less than 0.1% of eligible Japanese women get vaccinated.\nTwo injections are given into the upper arm spaced at least six months apart.\nAccording to the NHS, children who miss the HGV vaccine in Year 8 will be offered it in the next academic year. \nTeenagers who were eligible for the jab but did not take it up aged 12 or 13 - boys in year 8 from September 2019 and girls from September 2008 - can also access the jab for free up to the age of 25.\nYes. \nAlthough the vaccine appears to dramatically reduce the chances of developing cervical cancer, it does not protect against all types of HPV. \nSo it is important that women also have regular cervical smears once they reach the age of 25."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Coal mining",
      "text": "More than 40 countries have committed to shift away from coal, in pledges made at the COP26 climate summit. \nMajor coal-using countries including Poland, Vietnam and Chile are among those to make the commitment. \nBut some of the world's biggest coal-dependent countries, including China and the US, did not sign up.\nIn a separate commitment, 20 countries, including the US, pledged to end public financing for \"unabated\" fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022.\nSuch projects burn fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas, without using technology to capture the CO2 emissions. \nCoal is the single biggest contributor to climate change.\nSignatories to the agreement have committed to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally. \nThey have also agreed to phase out coal power in the 2030s for major economies, and the 2040s for poorer nations, the UK said.\nDozens of organisations also signed up to the pledge, with several major banks agreeing to stop financing the coal industry. \n\"The end of coal is in sight,\" UK business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. \n\"The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal's fate and embrace the environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy.\"\nBut UK shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said there were \"glaring gaps\" from China and other large emitters, who have not committed to stop increasing coal use domestically. He also noted that there was nothing on the phasing out of oil and gas.\nMr Miliband said the UK government \"has let others off the hook\".\nAlthough progress has been made in reducing coal use globally, it still produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019. \nCountries like South Africa, Poland and India will need major investments to make their energy sectors cleaner. \nJuan Pablo Osornio, head of Greenpeace's delegation at COP26, said: \"Overall this statement still falls well short of the ambition needed on fossil fuels in this critical decade.\"\n\"The small print seemingly gives countries enormous leeway to pick their own phase-out date, despite the shiny headline,\" he added. \nThere's been such a flurry of announcements on the world's most polluting fossil fuel, that it's hard to see the light for all the (coal) dust.\nThere are many questions outstanding.\nOne of the biggest is the list of countries missing from this bonfire of coal commitments - including the US, China and India.\nThe time scales for phase-out are also a bit woolly - with richer countries promising to end coal by the 2030s, with developing nations in the 2040s.\nNone of these commitments are binding - again there is no big stick to force countries to do this.\nAnd how many of the plans to stop using coal in developing countries will need financial support from the developed world?\nWe've already seen the UK, Germany and the US step up to pay South Africa's $8.5bn (\u00a36.2bn) to move away from coal. Other countries are said to be interested in following in South Africa's footsteps.\nSo is there also a question of the rich countries paying others to do what they struggle to do at home?\nWhile the US was notably absent from the coal commitments, it joined 19 other countries - including the UK, Canada and New Zealand - in pledging to stop financing unabated overseas fossil fuel projects.\n\"Investing in unabated fossil-related energy projects increasingly entails both social and economic risks\u2026 and has ensuing negative impacts on government revenue, local employment, taxpayers, utility ratepayers and public health,\" the signatories of the UK-led initiative said in a joint statement.\nThe deal saw countries and financial institutions vow to steer their spending into clean energy instead. \nIt allowed for exemptions in unspecified \"limited\" circumstances, but said these must be consistent with efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.\n\"Ending international finance for all unabated fossil fuels is the next critical frontier we must deliver on,\" UK energy minister Greg Hands said. \"We must put public finance on the right side of history.\"\nHowever, major financers of such projects, such as China, Japan and South Korea, did not sign up.\nThe countries did join G20 nations last month in agreeing to end financial support for new unabated coal plants overseas.

We'll have another update for you on Thursday.\nThe UK has \"hard months to come\" due to its current \"very high\" rate of coronavirus cases, England's deputy chief medical officer has warned. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC too many people believed the pandemic was now over. The UK recorded 41,299 Covid cases on Wednesday and 217 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nA member of the group of scientists advising the government on coronavirus has stepped down from the role. Sir Jeremy Farrar said he left the independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) so he could focus on his work as director of medical charity the Wellcome Trust. But in a statement, he warned the crisis was \"a long way from over\".\nBooster vaccines are seen as the single most important way to control Covid as we head into the winter months. From this week anyone eligible - six months after their second dose - can turn up at a walk-in centre to get their booster in England. But doctors have told the BBC that complacency, and changes to the way jabs are offered, could leave millions at greater risk of serious illness this Christmas.\nIkea will raise its prices as the disruption to global supply chains caused by coronavirus is expected to last into next year. The Swedish furniture giant saw record demand during the pandemic as people spent more time at home. But it said the biggest hit to its income came from \"the steep increase in transport and raw material prices in the second half of the financial year\". Profit was down 4% compared with 2019, before the pandemic, it said.\nRemember the local council that went viral after a fractious Zoom meeting was shared on social media during the pandemic? Well it's changed its name. Handforth Parish Council's online row made a star of stand-in clerk Jackie Weaver as the chairman Brian Tolver told her she had \"no authority here\".

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday.\nThe first pill designed to treat people who are ill with Covid has been approved by the UK medicines regulator. The tablet - molnupiravir - will be given twice a day to vulnerable patients recently diagnosed with the disease. In clinical trials the pill, originally developed to treat flu,  nearly halved the risk of hospitalisation. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the treatment was a \"gamechanger\". \nThe Bank of England has signalled it will raise interest rates in the \"coming months\" in response to high inflation, but held off on an immediate increase. Rates were cut to their current record low rate of 0.1% in March last year in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. But the reopening of the economy has fuelled price rises, prompting expectations that the Bank would increase borrowing costs. Financial markets expect the interest rate to hit 1% by the end of next year.\nSainsbury's says it is in a \"good position\" ahead of Christmas amid worker and supply chain challenges. The supermarket's chief executive, Simon Roberts, said many customers were returning to pre-pandemic shopping habits. But he admitted the supermarket industry still faced \"labour and supply chain challenges\". Sainsbury's and Argos stores will be closed on Boxing Day in recognition of staff's \"extraordinary efforts\" through the pandemic.\nGlobal carbon dioxide emissions are set to rebound to near the levels they were at before Covid, scientists have found. The amount of planet-heating gas released in 2020 fell by 5.4% as the pandemic forced countries to lock down. But a scientific report by the Global Carbon Project predicts CO2 emissions will rise by 4.9% this year. This rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere underlines the urgency of action at summits like COP26 in Glasgow, scientists say.\nThe pandemic has seen more of us leaving screens behind to work outdoors. In the UK, three in five UK workers intend to switch to a different job as a result of Covid, according to a report earlier this year by insurance group Aviva. Among them is the aptly named Sharnee Gardner who swapped life as a model to become, you've guessed it - a gardener. She said: \"I flew [around] the world - but I was so absorbed in my work that I hardly spent time in nature anymore\". Covid travel bans changed that. Now the 23-year-old is studying with the Royal Horticultural Society where she spends her time cutting lawns, pruning trees and planting beds.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe morning coronavirus briefing is being paused for two weeks to tell you five things you need to know about the COP26 climate summit.\nMillions have had their Covid booster jab - but could they have been rolled out more quickly? \nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

In return, it got a lifting of sanctions.\nBut Mr Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 and reintroduced the sanctions after failing to get Iran to agree to provisions to curb its ballistic missile programme and end its involvement in regional conflicts.\nSince the re-introduction of sanctions, Iran has been unable to access billions of dollars of its assets held in foreign banks. \nWorld powers don't trust Iran: Some countries believe Iran wants nuclear power because it wants to build a nuclear bomb - it denies this.\nSo a deal was struck: In 2015, Iran and six other countries reached a major agreement. Iran would stop some nuclear work in return for an end to harsh penalties, or sanctions, hurting its economy.\nWhat is the problem now? Iran re-started banned nuclear work after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. Even though new leader Joe Biden wants to rejoin, both sides say the other must make the first move."

      "text": "Three men have been arrested after the rescue of a woman who claimed that she was forced to live in a cupboard by her alleged exploiters.\nThe men were arrested on suspicion of forced labour and human trafficking offences on 3 November.\nA 36-year-old Bangladeshi national was arrested at an address in Llandudno, in Conwy.\nTwo British men, aged 46 and 21, were arrested at addresses in Newcastle-under-Lyme and Stoke-on-Trent.\nThe Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) officers, who carried out the investigation, said the 21-year-old had been arrested at a lettings agency in the Hanley area of Stoke-on-Trent.\nThe three suspects have been interviewed by GLAA officers and released under investigation pending further enquiries.\nGLAA officers said they had received reports from the modern slavery helpline that hotel staff in Llandudno were not being paid the national minimum wage.\nThe reports also claimed the staff were expected to work long hours and were not given access to the contracts they were rushed into signing.\nTwo British women who worked at the hotel, aged in their 30s, said that they were paid as little as \u00a3250 per month for up to 60 hours of work per week, when they were interviewed by GLAA officers, North Wales Police and HM Revenue and Customs.\nOne added that she was forced to live in a cupboard with no washing facilities.\nThe women claimed they were told to lie about their working hours if asked, and that two of their recruiters would visit the hotel frequently to check up on their work.\nBoth have been accepted into the government's National Referral Mechanism (NRM) to receive specialist support.\nMartin Plimmer, a GLAA senior investigating officer, said said it was an \"unfortunate reality\" that modern slavery and labour exploitation crimes are \"often hidden from view\".\n\"Our investigations are ongoing and searches of the addresses have unearthed other valuable lines of enquiry including substantial amounts of money which we are in the process of investigating further,\" he said.\nHe also said that the two women would have \"brighter futures\" as a result of the investigation and have been \"removed from any possible danger and are beginning the long road to recovery\".\nDet Insp Lindon Evans, of Staffordshire Police, urged people to be aware to spot the signs and to report any suspicions about modern slavery.\n\"Signs include long labour hours, chaperoning, lack of personal possessions, malnutrition, and abuse,\" he said.\n\"This operation was a good example of partnership working and modern slavery has quite rightly been made a priority across law enforcement.\""

      "text": "Michael Ransley and his partner Dr Phoebe Beedell set off from Cornwall for COP26 in the spring of 2019 in a horse and cart. \nAlong the way to the UN climate conference they travelled on country roads to avoid disrupting traffic. \nBy the time their horse Tarateeno the Marvellous reached his final destination on Saturday he had averaged 1,500 miles a year.\nThe 15-year-old cob celebrated by grazing on Glasgow Green. \nOver the next fortnight the activists aim to raise awareness of the climate crisis throughout the host city.\nWe met on Victoria Road, on the south side, just over two miles from the Scottish Event Campus.\nMr Ransley, 59, told BBC Scotland he bought Tarateeno when he was a three-year-old.\nSince then they have meandered all over the UK and even crossed the Channel to France.\nThey originally set off for Glasgow more than two years ago but delayed their arrival until the summit was rescheduled due to the Covid pandemic.\nAsked why he had made the journey, Mr Ransley told BBC Scotland: \"We feel the politicians are behind the times and are impotent. \n\"We need to wake them up.\"\nAs Tarateeno enjoyed a rest next to a set of traffic lights on one of Glasgow's busiest roads, his owner told me he wants to see a complete end to the extraction of fossil fuels. \nMr Ransley added: \"We are standing in a street that is very noisy and polluting. \n\"I want my grandchildren to grow up in a clean planet where cities are vibrant.\n\"Look at how much space these cars take up.\" \nMr Ransley said the couple have wandered round the country, from Shropshire to Stranraer, talking to people about global warming.\nThey even branded their cart a \"climate crisis emergency response vehicle\", although he joked: \"We don't have to worry about parking.\"\nThey have enjoyed spectacular views on their travels and savoured simple pleasures, such as smelling honeysuckles.\nMr Ransley added: \"I don't earn a lot of money but I still feel like I am the richest man in the country.\"\nThis is the first time they have targeted a COP summit but the couple will be avoiding mass events as they said Tarateeno's welfare is paramount.\nThe horse attracts admirers everywhere he goes and as we spoke locals asked if they could pet him while others requested a picture with the four-legged activist.\nOne woman even crossed the road to feed Tarateeno an apple.\nDr Beedell, 60, said the significance of the UN summit is unprecedented. \nShe said: \"This is probably the most important meeting in the world ever.\" \nThe academic researcher has been involved in environmental protests for more than 30 years and believes a wartime mentality is need to combat the greatest threat of our times. \nShe added: \"I am doing this for my children and grandchildren. \n\"Action on climate change is a really unifying and liberating process which is what we really need in these divisive times. \n\"It is something that can bring us all together.\"\nDr Beedell said the couple have talked to people from all walks of life since they set off for Glasgow.\nShe added: \"We really hope to inspire people and to reach out to people who might not really have climate conversations.\n\"We capture people's imaginations.\"  \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "As fossil fuels are phased out across the world, the question on many people's minds is what should replace them.\nOne former coal mining community has been busy looking for solutions.\nRenewable energy projects are now taking the place of carbon in parts of Carmarthenshire's Amman Valley.\nAnd there are calls to ensure these schemes remain community-owned, so profits stay in Wales.\nFor decades Welsh communities like this one exported millions of tonnes of coal across the world, but things have moved on.\nDan McCallum runs community energy charity Awel Aman Tawe, set up in 1998.\n\"It is not about feeling guilty about the past. Yes this area has produced a lot of coal which has caused pollution, but we have to look to the future,\" he said.\n\"We have always produced energy here in this area. It used to be coal and now it's renewable energy, whether from wind energy or solar panels.\n\"So now we have solar panels on local buildings like Cwmgors rugby club. People see that transition naturally.\"\nThe charity works with schools and community groups to raise awareness and help people reduce their carbon footprint. \n\"I would like to see as much of our energy as possible in the future being community-owned so the income from that energy stays in Wales,\" said Mr McCallum. \n\"We have great examples of this already. Look at Ynni Ogwen, in north Wales and their work with community-owned hydro (power).\"\nBy keeping assets and resources in Wales, jobs could be created that could help young people in the area, Mr McCallum said.\nDespite these developments, local historian and former miner, Dr John Dorian Evans, believes the role coal played in many Welsh communities should not be forgotten.\n\"It's important to remember the effort people went through to produce the coal, men and women, and our culture was based on the coal industry,\" he said.\n\"It was a way of life. Nearly every house in the street I lived on had a miner in it. The conversations were about coal and the production of coal or wages paid by the National Coal Board.\n\"In Ammanford we have a miners hall. Miners donated from their wages each week to create these buildings and they were centres for their communities.\nDr Evans believes the rising cost of gas proves the need for a mix of energy sources to meet the UK's energy requirements, including investment in carbon capture and storage as well as biomass fuels. \nFormer miner Terry Pugh is passionate about the need for change and feels more help needs to be given to support \"green ventures\".\n\"We need to turn this industrial area into a green valley. It is a giant step but a necessary step,\" he said.\n\"We need to change the way we behave as a society to make the world a cleaner and better place.\n\"We would be further ahead if there was more grants and more laws to move on. There are so many things we could be doing in this country that aren't being done and need to be done desperately before it is too late.\""

      "text": "The Welsh ambulance service faces pressure like it has never seen before, the country's health minister has said.\nEluned Morgan said she was not \"ducking\" from responsibility for what her opponents say is a crisis.\nIt comes as the service asked for help from the military to drive its vehicles.\nOne frontline worker told BBC Wales crews are spending whole shifts waiting to off-load patients.\nMs Morgan told a Senedd debate calls have increased 20-30% compared to this time last year, that staff were reaching \"burnout\" and that there was a \"blockage\" in getting people out of hospitals.\nThe Conservatives, who forced the debate on Wednesday, said ministers should declare an emergency and called for action.\nFigures from July showed only 57.8% of the most serious calls, classed as red, were responded to within eight minutes, below the target of 65%.\nThe service received more calls in July than in any month since the pandemic began.\nWelsh Ambulance Services Trust said it has been under \"significant and sustained pressure\" in recent months, and it wants assistance to help cope with the winter.\nIt is the third time it has requested assistance since the Covid pandemic began - the Ministry of Defence is now considering the request.\nTrust Chief Executive Jason Killens apologised to \"all of those patients that have waited much longer for their emergency ambulance to arrive than we would like in recent weeks and months\".\nHe said the military drivers would \"help us put more ambulances on the streets, and get to see more patients more quickly\".\nBut he said that was \"not the solution\", saying the pressure on his service was a symptom \"of a broader problem across urgent and emergency care here in Wales and across the UK\".\nStewart Manning, 59, from Marshfield in Newport, has diabetic gastroparesis, a digestive condition which leads him to become very dehydrated.\nHe said he had experienced a few instances in the past four years where he waited more than three hours for an ambulance.\nIn June he was told an ambulance would not arrive for eight hours, and his wife Corrine drove him to hospital.\n\"That was horrific. Eight hours - that can't be,\" he said.\n\"It's not the fault of the ambulance crews, it's not the fault of the front line, the coal face, the nurses or anyone else like that.\n\"But there's got to be someone responsible for the way it is structured. The management, the funding even. There are so many different issues relating to this.\n\"There are people out there who are not going to be seen to for a long time\u2026 they're going to die.\"\nIn the Senedd debate on Wednesday Ms Morgan said the service was under \"unprecedented pressure\".\n\"I'm not hiding, I'm not ducking, I am absolutely taking responsibility,\" she said.\n\"Covid was bad, everybody understood Covid, but everybody in the service at the moment is telling me that this pressure at the moment is worse than anything we've seen.\"\nShe said 18% of calls are Covid-related, but handover delays to hospital have a \"significant impact\" .\nThe service has been hit by staff absence, caused by sickness which rose by 10% in June, self-isolation, shielding and delayed annual leave.\n\"We've got to accept the fact that a lot of these people are reaching burnout and they need a break,\" the minister said.\nMs Morgan added that staff were not taking up overtime as much as in the past, and there were difficulties in \"timely discharge in patients from hospital\", reducing available hospital beds.\nShe rejected the call to declare an emergency, but accepted \"there is a problem here that needs to be resolved\".\nSenedd members gave examples of problems faced by constituents with the ambulance service.\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the service is in \"crisis\" and has been \"for some months\".\nHe said a constituent of his was asked by the service to take a family member with a suspected heart attack to hospital themselves.\nMeanwhile Mabon ap Gwynfor, Plaid Cymru MS for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said he knew of a case where a patient had to wait for 15 hours for an ambulance.\nHe said it was a \"symptom of a deep seated problem\", and feared more ambulances on the frontline would \"add to the queues of ambulances outside A&E departments\".\nLabour Swansea East MS Mike Hedges said the Welsh Ambulance Services Trust was \"not working effectively\" and should be \"split up\" and run by the individual health boards, \"so it's their fault, not somebody else's\".\nThe Trust covers the whole of Wales, while health boards are regional.\nHe said some were going to hospitals because they could not see a GP. \nMr Hedges appeared to criticise previous health ministers from his own party: \"Fortunately for the first time since I was elected, we have a health minister who I am confident will address the problems.\"\nPaul Amphlett retired as a paramedic six years ago and now works part-time as an emergency medical technician in Brecon, Powys.\n\"I have never known it as bad as it is at the moment, in the sense that morale is at rock bottom,\" he told BBC Wales.\n\"I didn't join the ambulance services to babysit patients outside hospitals for eight, 12 hours.\"\nMr Amphlett, 59, said crews from his patch in Powys were being sent across south Wales because the service is so stretched.\n\"There's no let-up. It's constant.\n\"They [patients] can't get hold of GPs. They are ringing 111 and are speaking to people telling them to ring for an ambulance because they can't get a doctor.\"\nWelsh Ambulance Services Trust declined to respond to Mr Amphlett's comments.\nThe military has assisted the NHS throughout the Covid pandemic. Soldiers helped drive ambulances in Wales on Christmas Eve, at the height of the pandemic's second wave.\nThe Welsh government said the new request, which it has processed on behalf of the trust, asks for \"drivers with a C1 driving licence to deal with increased pressures facing the service over the winter\".\nMilitary help for the service was proposed by Welsh Secretary Simon Hart in a letter to the Welsh government sent earlier in September.\nThe armed forces have assisted other ambulances services in the UK over recent months.\nSoldiers will begin driving Scottish ambulances this weekend, while the military was called in to help four trusts in England last month.\nA Ministry of Defence spokesman said it has \"received a request from Welsh government to support the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust under the military aid to civil authorities process. The request is currently under consideration.\n\"We are working hard to identify where we can most effectively provide assistance across the whole of the United Kingdom as we continue to tackle the pandemic.\"\nAre you affected by the issues in this story?

He was caught on CCTV armed with a large knife as Keon was attacked.\nTahjgeem Breakenridge, 18, from Oldfield Road, Balsall Heath, Birmingham, and Michael Ugochukwu, 18, of Twyning Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, were also found guilty of murder after nearly 16 hours of jury deliberations.\nThe 14-year-old was additionally convicted of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life while the 16-year-old, Breakenridge and Ugochukwu were all convicted of having an offensive weapon.\nThe trial heard Keon was murdered outside his home in a \"short and brutal\" attack.\nHe was repeatedly stabbed by a group who got out of a stolen car and chased him before shooting him in the stomach as he lay on the ground, the court was told.\nThe five-week trial heard Keon suffered eight sharp-force injuries and a fatal injury to his abdomen from one of two gunshots fired in what was described as a 30-second gang attack.\nHe was pronounced dead two hours later at Birmingham Children's Hospital.\nAt the start of the proceedings, prosecutor Michael Burrows QC said a Ford S-Max, which had a false registration plate, was used by those who attacked Keon.\nIt later crashed on Wheeler Street, Birmingham, where investigators found forensic evidence including a hunting knife.\nThe four defendants convicted of murder have been remanded into custody by judge Lord Justice William Davis for a sentencing hearing on 29 November.\nOn Friday, jurors are set to resume their deliberations on Kieron Donaldson, 18, of Aston Lane, Perry Barr, Birmingham, who denies murder.\nThe 18-year-old is alleged to have \"helped and supplied weapons\" for what was said to be a planned attack.\nFollowing Keon's death, his mother, Sharmaine Lincoln, remembered her son as a joker and a \"loving child with a jolly spirit\" whose \"unbelievable laugh\" would echo daily around her home.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "David Cameron,Greensill Capital,UK Parliament",
      "text": "Westminster has been bursting with rebellions, U-turns and resignations this week after the Tory MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken parliamentary rules on lobbying. But what does the term mean? \nLobbying is when individuals, businesses, trade unions, groups or charities try to get a government to change its policies. \"Political persuasion\" might be a better term.\nLobbyists make their case to ministers, MPs or officials. They can write, email, text, phone, video call or turn up in person in Parliament to do it, although the latter hasn't happened much over the past two years due to Covid-19 restrictions.\nNot always. Changing politicians' minds can take a long time. That's why organisations and firms often hire professional lobbyists to make arguments on their behalf. Some of these are former politicians themselves and \"know the game\" - that is, who's who and where to find them.\nBut it's important to re-emphasise that individual citizens - unpaid - can also lobby politicians about issues that are important to them. Anyone can be a lobbyist, in other words.\nSupporters say professional lobbying is a vital and valid part of democracy - that it stimulates debate and keeps politicians in touch with the latest developments in areas like science and business.\nBut critics argue that the current system is open to corruption and that wealthy interests - the ones who can afford professionals to make their case - have an unfair advantage.\nMinisters and top civil servants are effectively banned from lobbying their former colleagues for two years after leaving government. Lobbyists also have to join a register, which was set up by David Cameron as prime minister.\nBut Mr Cameron, who left Downing Street in 2016, became the centre of a row about lobbying earlier in 2021 over his work for Greensill Captial. \nIn Mr Paterson's case, he was found to have broken the rules by approaching and meeting officials at the Food Standards Agency and ministers at the Department for International Development a number of times over issues involving two firms he was a consultant for. \nThe Commons Standards Committee also said he used his parliamentary office and stationery for his consultancy work and failed to declare his interests in some meetings.\nThe commissioner decided that the contact with officials and ministers were \"serious breaches\" of the rules.\nFollowing the disclosures about Mr Cameron's work, the government set up a review of lobbying, led by lawyer Chris Boardman. \nHe said some of the accusations that the government's processes for managing lobbying were \"insufficiently transparent\", had \"loopholes\" and allowed \"a privileged to few have a disproportionate level of access to decision makers in government\" were \"justified\". \nBut he said Mr Cameron did not break any of the rules. \nAfter the incident involving Mr Paterson, the focus from the government was not on his lobbying but in the need for an overhaul of the system policing MPs' conduct instead - giving members more chances to appeal findings against them.\nInitially, Downing Street backed an amendment to shake-up the watchdog and blocked Mr Paterson's suspension too. \nBut within 24 hours, and after a furious backlash from opposition MPs, No 10 U-turned, and now government is appealing to other parties to hold cross-party talks about any chances.\nThese would not be retrospectively applied to Mr Paterson's case though, and soon after the announcement, the MP resigned his seat. \nIt started long ago when members of the public turned up in Parliament's lobby areas to let MPs know what needed to change.\nIt's harder to get into that part of the building than it used to be because of tougher security, so meetings are just as likely to take place elsewhere, such as over dinner, in MPs' constituencies or via the phone."

      "text": "A special Crown Office unit set up to probe Covid-linked deaths is considering 827 cases in Scotland's hospitals, latest figures show.\nThe unit was set up to consider the circumstances of Covid-linked deaths such as those in care homes.\nBut the prosecution service has also received reports of hundreds of hospital-related virus deaths.\nProsecutors will eventually decide if these deaths should be the subject of a fatal accident inquiry or prosecution.\nAs of 7 October, Crown Office figures show Scotland's biggest hospital, the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, has the highest number of reported Covid-linked deaths at 113. \nThis was followed by the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley and Glasgow Royal Infirmary which both had 71 Covid-related deaths referred to the Crown Office. \nThe figures do not include deaths at home addresses or hospices, or where a care home resident died in hospital after contracting Covid-19 in a home.  \nCare home Covid death figures are published separately by the Crown Office.\nThese show the Crown's Covid-19 Deaths Investigation Team (CDIT) had received 3,491 Covid-linked death reports for care homes as of the end of September. \nA spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said it had established the dedicated CDIT team to receive and consider reports of Covid-19 deaths.\nHe added: \"CDIT receives and deals with those reports and carries out any investigation which may be justified in the particular circumstances of any particular death or deaths.\n\"CDIT will work with the relevant agencies to ensure that all necessary and appropriate enquiries are made as quickly as possible.\"\nDoctors have a duty to report Covid-linked deaths of patients in their care to the CDIT team.\nThe CDIT team is still at the stage of gathering information on the circumstances of the Covid-19 related deaths it has been asked to consider.\nIt is not clear when the Crown Office unit will move to the next phase of its work but the timeline of a planned public inquiry will likely be a factor. \nThe Scottish government has said a public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemic in Scotland will be established by the end of the year.\nDr Scott Davidson, deputy medical director at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: \"I want to offer my most sincere condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one during the pandemic. People continue to die from this dreadful virus and every death it brings is a tragedy. We will of course continue to support investigations into these deaths.\n\"As Scotland's largest health board area, just under a third of all Covid infections have been recorded within Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and as a result, our largest hospitals have, unfortunately, also seen the highest number of people to sadly die after being infected with Covid-19.\"\nDr Davidson pointed out the health board's high proportion of deprived areas which were more likely to suffer from Covid and were at higher risk of more serious illness. He said it was also home to the largest black, Asian and minority ethnic population in Scotland, communities he said which also had increased risk of serious illness and death due to Covid.\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"We mourn every death from Covid-19 and express our sympathy for all those who have lost loved ones, and for the distress and grief experienced by individuals and their families. \n\"Saving people's lives has been and continues to be the priority of the Scottish government throughout the pandemic and it would clearly be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing Crown Office investigation.\""

      "title": "COP26: More than 40 countries pledge to quit coal",
      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Coal mining",
      "text": "More than 40 countries have committed to shift away from coal, in pledges made at the COP26 climate summit. \nMajor coal-using countries including Poland, Vietnam and Chile are among those to make the commitment. \nBut some of the world's biggest coal-dependent countries, including China and the US, did not sign up.\nIn a separate commitment, 20 countries, including the US, pledged to end public financing for \"unabated\" fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022.\nSuch projects burn fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas, without using technology to capture the CO2 emissions. \nCoal is the single biggest contributor to climate change.\nSignatories to the agreement have committed to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally. \nThey have also agreed to phase out coal power in the 2030s for major economies, and the 2040s for poorer nations, the UK said.\nDozens of organisations also signed up to the pledge, with several major banks agreeing to stop financing the coal industry. \n\"The end of coal is in sight,\" UK business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. \n\"The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal's fate and embrace the environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy.\"\nBut UK shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said there were \"glaring gaps\" from China and other large emitters, who have not committed to stop increasing coal use domestically. He also noted that there was nothing on the phasing out of oil and gas.\nMr Miliband said the UK government \"has let others off the hook\".\nAlthough progress has been made in reducing coal use globally, it still produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019. \nCountries like South Africa, Poland and India will need major investments to make their energy sectors cleaner. \nJuan Pablo Osornio, head of Greenpeace's delegation at COP26, said: \"Overall this statement still falls well short of the ambition needed on fossil fuels in this critical decade.\"\n\"The small print seemingly gives countries enormous leeway to pick their own phase-out date, despite the shiny headline,\" he added. \nThere's been such a flurry of announcements on the world's most polluting fossil fuel, that it's hard to see the light for all the (coal) dust.\nThere are many questions outstanding.\nOne of the biggest is the list of countries missing from this bonfire of coal commitments - including the US, China and India.\nThe time scales for phase-out are also a bit woolly - with richer countries promising to end coal by the 2030s, with developing nations in the 2040s.\nNone of these commitments are binding - again there is no big stick to force countries to do this.\nAnd how many of the plans to stop using coal in developing countries will need financial support from the developed world?\nWe've already seen the UK, Germany and the US step up to pay South Africa's $8.5bn (\u00a36.2bn) to move away from coal. Other countries are said to be interested in following in South Africa's footsteps.\nSo is there also a question of the rich countries paying others to do what they struggle to do at home?\nWhile the US was notably absent from the coal commitments, it joined 19 other countries - including the UK, Canada and New Zealand - in pledging to stop financing unabated overseas fossil fuel projects.\n\"Investing in unabated fossil-related energy projects increasingly entails both social and economic risks\u2026 and has ensuing negative impacts on government revenue, local employment, taxpayers, utility ratepayers and public health,\" the signatories of the UK-led initiative said in a joint statement.\nThe deal saw countries and financial institutions vow to steer their spending into clean energy instead. \nIt allowed for exemptions in unspecified \"limited\" circumstances, but said these must be consistent with efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.\n\"Ending international finance for all unabated fossil fuels is the next critical frontier we must deliver on,\" UK energy minister Greg Hands said. \"We must put public finance on the right side of history.\"\nHowever, major financers of such projects, such as China, Japan and South Korea, did not sign up.\nThe countries did join G20 nations last month in agreeing to end financial support for new unabated coal plants overseas.

      "tags": "Genetics,Coronavirus vaccines,BAME communities,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "University of Oxford scientists have uncovered a gene that doubles the risk of lung failure and death from Covid.\nThey say around 60% of people from South Asian backgrounds and 15% of people of European ancestry carry the high-risk version of the gene.\nVaccines are key and help significantly reduce these risks, researchers say.\nThe Nature Genetics study sheds light on why some communities in the UK and South Asia are at higher risk from Covid - but does not fully explain it.\nBuilding on previous genetic work, researchers used a combination of artificial intelligence and new molecular technology to pinpoint the exact gene - called LZTFL1 -  responsible for the increased risks.\nThey estimate the risky version of the gene is present in about 2% of people from African-Caribbean backgrounds and 1.8% of people of East Asian descent. \nLead researcher Prof James Davies said the discovery that the risky gene does not affect all populations equally was very important.\nBut he said a complex mix of factors - including age in particular - contributed to each person's individual risk. \nHe added \"Socio-economic factors were also likely to be important in explaining why some communities have been particularly badly affected by the pandemic.\n\"Although we cannot change our genetics, our results show that the people with the higher risk gene are likely to particularly benefit from vaccination.\"\nResearchers believe the risky version of the gene makes people's lungs more susceptible to coronavirus.\nThey hypothesise that the high-risk gene derails a key protective mechanism that cells lining the lungs normally employ to defend themselves from Covid. \nWhen cells lining the lung interact with coronavirus, one of their defence strategies is to turn into less specialised cells and become less welcoming to the virus. \nThis despecialisation process reduces the amount on the surface of cells of a key protein called ACE-2, which is key to coronavirus attaching itself to cells.\nBut for people with the risky version of the LZTFL1 gene this process does not work as well, and lung cells are left vulnerable to invasion of the virus.\nScientists say it is significant that the gene involved affects the lungs, but does not have an impact on the immune system. \nThis means people at high risk can still get immune protection from the vaccine, they say.\nAnd scientists hope the discovery helps lead to new customised drugs that focus on the lungs - current ones focus mostly on the immune system."

      "text": "A council has admitted liability after a teacher was convicted of attacks on vulnerable children with learning difficulties, BBC Scotland has learned.\nLinda McCall, who was employed by Scottish Borders Council (SBC), was found guilty in July of assaulting five pupils.\nThe youngsters are autistic, non-verbal and were aged between five and seven years old at the time.\nThe law prevents the publication of any information which may identify them.\nThe BBC has been told SBC has now admitted liability for the actions of McCall in a civil case launched by the parents of the children who suffered. \nThe legal case was raised against the local authority as the employer of the teacher.\nFive parents told BBC Scotland of the \"life-changing trauma\" inflicted on their families.\nOne mother said her son had tried to harm himself while another father said he lived with guilt which had driven him to the point of depression.\nAnother parent told how McCall pulled her son along the floor violently.\n\"My son was crying uncontrollably,\" they said. \"He was very scared to go to school and was hiding his uniform.\"\nCommenting on the confirmation that SBC admitted liability, the lawyer acting for the families said this marked the end of a \"long and tortuous road to justice\".\nMarina Urie, from Thompsons Solicitors, told the BBC: \"The families are massively relieved Scottish Borders Council has done the decent thing and finally admitted liability. \n\"It means a huge amount.\"\nShe said they felt vindicated after a long process stemming back many years.\n\"They were met with a brick wall by the council who assured them nothing had happened and this admission now five years down the line is a huge moment for them,\" she said.\nThe allegations against McCall first emerged in 2017.\nThe teacher was placed on a period of paid leave while SBC carried out an internal investigation.\nBBC Scotland obtained a document from 2018 in which one parent was given assurances by the council that the abuse accusations against McCall \"did not affect\" her son in any way.\nThe email states the local authority's \"thorough\" investigation had resulted in \"no further action\" against McCall.\nThe woman's son was later confirmed as a victim in McCall's criminal conviction.\nEach of the five parents who have spoken to the BBC claim the council failed to inform them their children were victims.\nThey describe first learning of the abuse from Police Scotland when criminal proceedings were later initiated.\nIn the wake of BBC Scotland's report, SBC set up an independent investigation earlier this year to look into how it handled complaints about the teacher. \nAndrew Webster QC is examining how an internal council inquiry initially cleared her of any wrongdoing.\nThe inquiry has yet to report its findings. \nThe mother of one child harmed by McCall told the BBC she cried when news came through the council had admitted liability in the civil case.\nShe said: \"It is like coming to the end of a very long battle. \n\"I thought we were not going to get here. I opened the email with the news and I was in tears. It is such a relief to feel finally believed. \n\"To have them admit they were wrong feels like a massive weight lifted.\"\nAnother parent said: \"I feel vindicated. Years ago I asked what was going on. They insisted nothing happened to my kid.\n\"Finally someone has taken some responsibility for the trauma we have been through.\"\nSBC said it could not comment.\nA spokesman said: \"This remains an ongoing legal matter which is being dealt with by external solicitors on behalf of SBC.\n\"We have no further comment to make at this stage.\"\nChristine Grahame, SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, spoke of her relief.\nShe said: \"I first met the parents three and a half years ago.\n\"This is about the council admitting they got it wrong. They brushed off the parents.\n\"Their campaign has been vindicated. They treated these parents and children abysmally.\""

      "title": "Molnupiravir: First pill to treat Covid gets approval in UK",
      "text": "The first pill designed to treat symptomatic Covid has been approved by the UK medicines regulator. \nThe tablet - molnupiravir - will be given twice a day to vulnerable patients recently diagnosed with the disease. \nIn clinical trials the pill, originally developed to treat flu, cut the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the treatment was a \"gamechanger\" for the most frail and immunosuppressed.\nIn a statement he said: \"Today is a historic day for our country, as the UK is now the first country in the world to approve an antiviral that can be taken at home for Covid.\"\nMolnupiravir, developed by the US drug companies Merck, Sharp and Dohme (MSD) and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is the first antiviral medication for Covid which can be taken as a pill rather than injected or given intravenously.\nThe UK has agreed to purchase 480,000 courses with the first deliveries expected in November.\nInitially it will be given to both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients through a national study, with extra data on its effectiveness collected before any decision to order more.\nThe drug needs to be given within five days of symptoms developing to be most effective. \nIt's not immediately clear how it will be distributed so quickly by the NHS. It's thought some care homes may be offered supplies while other elderly or vulnerable patients may be prescribed it by their GP after testing positive for Covid.\nThe new treatment targets an enzyme that the virus uses to make copies of itself, introducing errors into its genetic code. That should prevent it from multiplying, so keeping virus levels low in the body and reducing the severity of the disease.\nMerck said that approach should make the treatment equally effective against new variants of the virus as it evolves in the future. \nThe UK regulator, the MHRA, said the tablet had been authorised for use in people who have mild to moderate Covid and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness such as obesity, old age, diabetes or heart disease.\nThe organisation's chief executive, June Raine, described it as \"another therapeutic to add to our armoury against Covid-19\". \n\"It is the world's first approved antiviral for this disease that can be taken by mouth rather than administered intravenously,\" she said.\n\"This is important, because it means it can be administered outside of a hospital setting, before Covid-19 has progressed to a severe stage.\"\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, warned on Wednesday of some \"hard months to come\" in the pandemic. \nHe said that while Covid cases appeared to have stabilised, deaths were rising and there were signs infections were starting to \"penetrate\" older age groups.\nThe UK recorded 41,242 Covid cases on Thursday and 214 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nEarlier clinical trials of molnupiravir on 775 patients who had recently caught Covid found:\nThe results were published in a press release and have not yet been peer-reviewed. \nBut data suggest molnupiravir needs to be taken soon after symptoms develop to have an effect. An earlier study in patients who had already been hospitalised with severe Covid was halted after disappointing results.\nIn its approval document, the MHRA recommends the drug is used \"as soon as possible\" following a positive Covid test and within five days of symptoms onset. \nProf Penny Ward, from King's College London, who was not involved in the study, said: \"If these outcomes are replicated in the UK population, then the number of cases requiring hospital admission could be halved and the number of deaths greatly reduced.\n\"It seems likely that it will be restricted for use by those at highest risk of disease complications - for example older adults with heart, lung or kidney disease, diabetes or cancer.\"\nThe UK government has not disclosed how much its initial contract for 480,000 courses of molnupiravir is worth. But US authorities recently made an advance purchase of 1.7 million courses at a cost of roughly $1.2 billion, or $700 (\u00a3513) for each patient. \nOther countries including Australia, Singapore and South Korea have also made purchase agreements.\nMerck is the first company to report trial results of a pill to treat Covid, but other companies are working on similar treatments. \nIts US rival Pfizer has started trials of two different antiviral tablets, while Swiss company Roche is working on a similar medication."

The images were captured by a police helicopter in November 2020, about two weeks after the second sighting and around Halloween.\nThe jetpack sighting theory had drawn scepticism from jetpack manufacturers. \nThey said most jetpacks did not carry enough fuel to fly for more than a few minutes, meaning it was difficult for them to get very high.\nMark Weiss, a former American Airlines captain, said although it was uncommon for balloons to get in the path of aircrafts, it could still be \"a very startling experience\" for pilots.\n\"If you see it coming towards you, you might need to do an abrupt manoeuvre - and you put the passengers at risk,\" he told the BBC.\nWhile a balloon would generally be harmless to planes, he said, if it had metal parts attached \"it could potentially destroy an engine\"."

      "tags": "Monetary Policy Committee (MPC),Inflation,UK economy,Bank of England,Pound Sterling (GBP),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Bank of England has signalled it will raise interest rates in \"coming months\" in response to high inflation, but held off on an immediate increase.  \nOn Thursday, Bank policymakers voted 7-2 in favour of no change from the current record low rate of 0.1%. \nBank governor Andrew Bailey said the decision had been a \"close call\".\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said there was \"value\" in waiting to see how the jobs market coped with the end of the furlough scheme.\nHowever, it did not rule out a rate rise at its next meeting in December.\nThe MPC meets every six weeks. When pressed on when a rate rise might come, Mr Bailey said: \"From now onwards.\"\nHe said the MPC had \"spent many hours\" pondering its decision, adding: \"The calls are close, they are quite hard. It's a reflection of the position we're in.\"\nIn a BBC interview, Mr Bailey said current conditions were different because inflation was being caused by global \"supply shocks\" rather than demand pressure in the UK economy.\n\"Putting interest rates up, I'm afraid, isn't going to get us more gas,\" he added.\nBut he said that interest rates were not going to return to levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"For the foreseeable future, we're in a world of low interest rates,\" he said.\n\"That doesn't mean that they don't rise and fall within that sort of bound. But I want to be quite clear, we're not signalling that there's going to be some very sharp return to the world that we can just about remember before the financial crisis.\"\nMr Bailey said the MPC wanted to see \"more evidence\" of how the labour market was evolving before raising interest rates.\nHowever, he stressed: \"We think there will be some need to increase interest rates to bring inflation sustainably back to target. And we will be ready to do that.\"\nWhile the MPC voted to keep interest rates on hold, policymakers were split on the decision.\nTwo of the nine members, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders, voted to raise rates immediately to 0.25%.\nRates were cut to their current level in March last year in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut the reopening of the economy has fuelled price rises, prompting expectations that the Bank would increase borrowing costs.\nThe pound fell by nearly 1% against the dollar to $1.3556 following the Bank's decision, reflecting the fact that investors had bet on a rate rise.\nFinancial markets expect the interest rate to hit 1% by the end of next year.\nElectricity and gas prices have surged as the global economy reopens.\nFactories and businesses are also struggling with staff shortages and a backlog of orders, which has also pushed up prices.\nThe Bank expects inflation to peak at 5% next April, up from 3.1% in September.\nThis would be the highest rate in more than a decade and far higher than the Bank's target of 2%.\nThe Bank said households faced \"substantially\" higher energy bills next year.\nPolicymakers also said food prices were likely to rise in the run-up to Christmas.\nHowever, they added that the sharp increase in inflation was expected to be \"temporary\", with price rises expected to ease back towards 2% in the second half of next year.\nHigher inflation is expected to put pressure on household finances for the next two years.\nThe Bank's latest Monetary Policy Report expects price rises to outpace pay increases in 2022 and 2023.\nSo-called real incomes are expected to barely grow in 2024.\nHigh Street banks use the interest rate set by the Bank's MPC to set their own mortgages and savings rates.\nWhile an increase in interest rates would have been bad news for borrowers, many mortgage holders would not have faced an immediate increase in payments.\nThree quarters of mortgage holders are currently on fixed-rate deals.\nHigher prices are expected to weigh on growth in the near term.\nThe Bank now expects the economy to grow by 1.5% in the three months to September.\nThis is almost half the rate expected at its previous forecast in August.\nAs a result, the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the start of next year. It had previously expected the economy to recover by the end of 2021.\nThe Bank also cut its forecast for annual growth in 2021 and 2022 to 7% and 5% respectively, down from 7.25% and 6% previously.\nIn September, around a million workers were still on the government's furlough scheme that subsidised wages.\nThe scheme ended in October and the Bank expects most of those who were on furlough to return to work.\nWhile the peak in inflation next April is expected at a time when around 40% of workers are negotiating pay deals, the Bank does not expect higher prices to lead to big demands for pay rises.\nIt suggested that many workers were still scarred by the financial crisis, when many accepted slow pay growth or wage freezes even amid rising inflation.\nBe in no doubt, people and businesses should prepare for rates rising in the coming months, perhaps as high as 1% from their record lows of 0.1%, but not precisely this month.\nThe message from the Bank of England is that the economy has been hit by supply chain bottlenecks, both for goods and workers, pushing back the time when the economy regains all the lost pandemic growth into early next year. And while the inflation picture is now worse, with a forecast peak of 5% when the energy price cap is due to be further increased in April 2022, there is not much the Bank thinks it can do about the global drivers of this.\nWhere the Bank can act is around the persistence of this inflation into 2023 and 2024. They do now feel there is a risk that pressures from rising prices last. If interest rates were kept at these emergency lows, the Bank forecasts inflation would still be about 3% in late 2024.\nBut acting now would have required immediate evidence of a spiral in wage rises across the economy. On balance, the members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee want to see official data in a fortnight on the impact of the end of the furlough scheme on the jobs market."

      "tags": "Companies,Competition and Markets Authority,Retailing,JD Sports,Footasylum",
      "text": "JD Sports has hit out at the UK's competition watchdog after being forced to sell rival chain Footasylum.\nAfter an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ruled that the takeover could lead to a \"worse deal\" for customers.\nBut JD Sports criticised the move, calling the decision \"inexplicable\" and \"beyond logic\".\nIts chairman Peter Cowgill suggested that the CMA is in \"a minority of one in reaching this conclusion\".\nThe CMA found that JD Sports was the closest alternative for Footasylum shoppers.\nHowever, the retailer has argued that one of the key areas of competition it faces is from brands such as Nike and Adidas selling their goods direct to consumers online.\nJD Sports' chairman Peter Cowgill noted that the CMA had acknowledged that these direct sales were a threat to the retailer, which, he said, made the competition body's decision puzzling.\nThe deal to buy Footasylum was first announced in April 2019. The latest ruling by the CMA follows an in-depth investigation after the competition watchdog first blocked the \u00a390m takeover last year.\nJD Sports appealed against a ruling by the CMA in September, saying it was \"perplexed\" by its decision not to include online sales to consumers by major brands.\nIn an update on Thursday, the CMA found that the takeover of Footasylum would reduce competition even after taking into account the growth in online shopping.\nHalf of 1,300 online shoppers surveyed by the competition watchdog said that they would go to JD Sports if they were unable to purchase their usual trainers or joggers at Footasylum.\nIt suggested that customers would have fewer options and could face higher prices, fewer discounts, and less choice of products in-store as a result.\nKip Meek, chair of the CMA inquiry group, said: \"The UK boasts a thriving sports fashion market and today's decision reflects our commitment to keeping it that way.\n\"We strongly believe shoppers could suffer if Footasylum stopped having to compete with JD Sports. It is likely they would pay more for less choice, worse service and lower quality.\"\nIt added that the rivals can continue to compete for shoppers online and as they return to the High Street.\nJD Sports argued on Thursday that the CMA in fact agreed with it on several fronts. It said, for example, that the CMA had found JD Sports' biggest competition came from international brands selling to consumers from their own websites or apps.\nJD Sports also said that it would have no incentive to raise prices or reduce deals for shoppers.\nIn a statement to investors, JD Sports said that \"the decision to prohibit the acquisition defies logic\", given that Footasylum has a market share of less than 5%.\n\"The CMA rightly concludes that, following the acquisition of Footasylum, JD would have no incentive to raise prices or worsen its offer as its most important competitors are the [Direct to Consumer] DTC operations of the international brands themselves,\" said Mr Cowgill.\n\"However, the CMA has then somehow concluded that the competitive threat from DTC does not extend to Footasylum and that JD would have an incentive to worsen the offer in Footasylum to the detriment of both consumers and suppliers. We would suggest that the CMA is in a minority of one in reaching this conclusion.\n\"Overall, the CMA's decision today continues to be inexplicable to anyone who understands what difference the pandemic has made to UK retail and how competition and the supply chain in our markets actually work.\"\nMr Cowgill added that the decision comes after the UK High Street has been seriously damaged by coronavirus-related lockdowns and could see further closures. \nThe sportswear retailer has four weeks to lodge an appeal with the Competition Appeal Tribunal following the decision.\nJD said that it is studying the CMA's new report in detail and will consider its options \"carefully\".\nDespite the watchdog's decision, JD's share price rose by more than 3% on Thursday to \u00a311.17.\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that investors appeared to have \"shrugged off\" the news.\n\"The acquisition was part of the company's quest for dominance in the sportswear market,\" she said.\n\"But the decision by the CMA on the grounds that keeping Footasylum within the group would lead to a lack of choice for customers, indicates just how formidable JD Sports now is as an online powerhouse.\""

      "tags": "Policing,Independent Office for Police Conduct,Metropolitan Police Service",
      "text": "Met Police officers facing allegations of assault and harassment were allowed on patrol because of staff shortages, BBC News has been told.\nA former internal investigations officer claims he was told the force did not have enough staff and restrictions needed to be eased. \nHe also said he witnessed interference in investigations during his work in 2017.\nThe Met said changes in restrictions are \"carefully considered\".\nJaysen Veeren, who revealed the claims, worked in the Serious Misconduct Investigation Unit within the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS), which is responsible for investigating the force's own officers and recommending actions such as a suspensions or restricted duties. \nDuring his 18 months in the department, he claims: \nMr Veeren says senior officers who were brought into the DPS in 2017 wanted to change the use of restrictions on officers under investigation.\nIn September, he secretly recorded a meeting with an officer responsible for making decisions on misconduct investigations, known as the 'appropriate authority'. BBC News has listened to it. \nAt the meeting, the officer explained a change in \"ethos\" within the department. \n\"We haven't got enough people,\" he said. \"We've now moved away from sacking everybody to only sacking people that we really need to sack.\"\nHe then referenced public comments by Met Commissioner Cressida Dick about shortages of officers within the force and said the use of restrictions needed to be addressed \"as a direct result of that\". He added the DPS was \"jumping on to the restrictions far too quickly\".\nIn June 2017, the Commissioner told BBC News the force was \"stretched\" and \"need[ed] the resources to do the job\". It's estimated the force lost more than 1,700 frontline officers from 2010 to 2017. \nDecisions over what restrictions officers should face while under investigation were made by a deputy assistant commissioner within the department based on evidence provided by Mr Veeren and other officers. \nBut Mr Veeren said he felt it was \"very clear\" he was being directed to present evidence which would lead to reduced restrictions. \nOne PC, who was on bail for breaching a non-molestation order, faced an additional complaint of harassing a woman working in a shop, according to Mr Veeren.  \nHe said despite these complaints and having previously broken restrictions relating to his duty, the officer was permitted to go on patrol as long as he wore a body-worn camera at all times. \nA different officer faced a gross misconduct hearing over the alleged assault of a woman, Mr Veeren said.\nHe said following a change in his restrictions, the PC was involved in a police chase which led to a moped crashing at a time when officers had been directed not to conduct such pursuits following a rise in incidents. The officer was not wearing body worn video at the time nor trained to drive a police car in pursuit, according to Mr Veeren. \nSenior officers also criticised cases even where they were not directly aware of the evidence, Mr Veeren claims. \nHe says a detective inspector had sexual relationships with multiple victims of rape or sexual assault who he had met through his work in Sapphire Command, a team specialising in rape and sexual offences cases at the time. \nWhile gathering evidence, Mr Veeren says his case officers were told the investigation was a \"witch hunt\" by two senior officers. He says he was also asked to defend concerns by a detective chief inspector about whether the investigation was \"justified or necessary\" with the force \"haemorrhaging talent\".\nShortly before leaving his department in late 2017, Mr Veeren complained to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), and was transferred to a different department. \nIn August this year, the watchdog told him it had made learning recommendations about how the Met could improve its internal investigations and said there were \"broken systems\" and \"a culture of mistrust\" in the unit. \nBut it said there was no evidence of corruption and in a number of cases where \"it appeared senior officers were interfering in cases, they were in fact managing the quality or timeliness of the investigation\".\nBBC News has learned a second officer made allegations about the handling of cases in the DPS during an employment tribunal.  \nThese allegations \"support\" some of Mr Veeren's claims and make further allegations of \"corruption and discrimination\" within the same unit, according to an IOPC document relating to Mr Veeren's complaint. \nThe IOPC said it has concluded an investigation into the officer alleged to have had relationships with sexual assault victims and found he has a case to answer for gross misconduct.\nThe Met declined to say whether any officers allowed to go on patrol wearing body worn video while facing allegations of misconduct had been accused of sexual offences or had subsequently been the subject of any complaints while on duty.\nIn a statement, the force said the IOPC investigation found allegations that members within the DPS had abused their position to affect ongoing investigations were either \"not corroborated or disproven\".\nIt said it was not willing to discuss the cases of individual officers but said allegations of misconduct are investigated robustly. It added that when considering the use of restrictions on an officer, \"the integrity of our professional standards investigations will always take primacy over any other business need\". \n\"At the centre of any investigation is the welfare and safety of those involved, including those who make allegations and the wider public,\" it said. \nLabour's Shadow Home Secretary, Nick Thomas Symonds, said \"these are incredibly serious accusations\".\n\"We must also be clear that pressures on police forces are a direct result of 11 years of cutting frontline officer and police staff numbers by the Conservatives\", he said.\nA Home Office spokesperson said the use of restrictions is an operational matter for forces. It said it had hired over 11,000 extra officers to bring crime down."

      "text": "Five activists have been arrested as hundreds of climate change protesters marched through Glasgow.\nScuffles broke out during an Extinction Rebellion demonstration outside the SSE energy company as two activists tried to force their way into the building.\nPolice said other arrests were made following \"assaults\" on officers who had paint sprayed in their faces.\nMost of the demonstrations against corporate \"greenwashing\" were peaceful as officers accompanied marchers.\nThe biggest protests of the summit so far began with hundreds of campaigners gathering in the city centre to highlight what they see as the exaggeration of green credentials by big businesses. \nSome then headed for the offices of SSE where police and security staff prevented activists entering the building, and four arrests were made including two people who, according to the police, sprayed paint at officers. \nGary Ritchie, Assistant Chief Constable of Police Scotland, said they received first aid at the scene before opting to return to the operation, which he described as \"very effective\" and \"very well planned\".\nAnother protest took place outside the offices of JP Morgan, where a green flare was let off. \nExtinction Rebellion said about 500 demonstrators were later \"kettled\" at St Vincent Street before being allowed to move off with a heavy police escort towards the city's Broomielaw next to the River Clyde.\nAmid shouting and pushing, several protesters fell and police medics helped at least one woman who was injured.\nACC Ritchie said most protesters had been \"fairly compliant\" with police \"in negotiations\" with the group about their intentions.\n\"They have told us they would like to proceed to another part of the city and we have agreed to that,\" he said. \"But for public safety reasons we will be escorting the protesters as they make their way to that location.\"  \nACC Ritchie said police would \"protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest or counter-protest at COP26, balanced against the rights of the wider community\". \nHe added: \"We will provide a proportionate policing response to any protest and violence will not be tolerated. \n\"Assaults on officers, who put their safety at risk every day to keep the public safe and have adopted a facilitative and rights-based approach to protest, is totally unacceptable.\"\nEyewitness: Cameron Buttle, BBC Scotland reporter in Glasgow city centre\nFor around two hours hundreds of public order police were chasing a group of protesters around the centre of Glasgow. \nIt was a hugely difficult operation to police; as soon as a street was blocked the protesters disappeared down a lane or backtracked and took a different route. \nEventually a group of about 150 were held in a block just off Renfield Street. \nIt was noisy, passionate and occasionally very tense.\nI did see some scuffles breaking out in front me but it calmed down very quickly.  \nEventually the police cordon moved slowly through the city taking the group down towards the main conference venue. \nSome protesters complained about the police operation, saying it was over the top and heavy handed. \nThe police said they feared that main routes were going to be blocked and said the action was proportionate.\nCampaigners also used the demonstrations to object to the planned Cambo oil field off Shetland,  on  the anniversary of the Queen inaugurating the flow of North Sea oil in 1975.\nFriends of the Earth Scotland, along with the campaign groups Platform and Stop Cambo, took part in protest events.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said an environmental review of the new Cambo oil field should be carried out before extraction begins.\nThe UK government's Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has backed the project, saying Cambo is \"priced in\" to the UK government's plans to reduce emissions.\nRosemary Harris, of Platform, said there should be no new investment in oil and gas.\nShe said: \"Any new oil and gas production is continuing to support a declining industry. There's a lot of talk about it being important for jobs, but they should be creating pathways for workers outside oil and gas.\"\nInside the conference hall, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak promised to cut carbon emissions by rewiring the \"entire global financial system\".\nHe said the plan would help persuade firms investing in fossil fuels to instead put their money into green energy and technologies.  \nAbout 450 of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension companies, which control about \u00a3100tn, have signed up. \nMore than 100 world leaders were in Glasgow for the first two days of the COP26 summit but most have now left, leaving delegations to continue the negotiations.\nUS President Joe Biden flew out on Tuesday night after a two-day visit.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "People in parts of Wales are facing a \"crisis of access\" to GPs, according to a patients' watchdog. \nThe Community Health Council (CHC) said many were left waiting for up to an hour on the phone to speak to someone.\nWhen they finally get through, they are often told there are no available appointments, it added.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said doctors were trying to ease the problem by using modern technology such as video calling.\nBut the union admitted an ongoing problem had been made worse by the pandemic. \nOne health board estimated demand for appointments was up 20% in some places.\nGeoff Ryall-Harvey, of the North Wales CHC, said he feared people were getting \"extremely frustrated\".\nSome surgeries, he said, had banned queueing outside because of Covid. \nBut with some GPs not having an online booking system, he said this had meant long waits on the phone for some.\nMr Ryall-Harvey said: \"People are being told all the appointments are gone, even at 08:10 in the morning when the lines have just opened. \n\"It's one thing to be told that there are no appointments left, but for this to happen several days on the run means there's a very real crisis of access for people in some areas. \n\"Part of the problem goes back before the Covid pandemic. There has been a steady decline in the number of GPs working in Wales.\"\nBecca Martin, of Wrexham, tried to make a GP appointment for her 67-year-old father Steve when he developed a urine infection in June.  \nBut she said it was \"incredibly difficult\" and by the time they managed to get one, his condition had become so bad he was taken straight to hospital. \n\"My mum was on the phone for over an hour at one point,\" Ms Martin said.\n\"That's not unusual - I've heard many cases of people on the phone for upwards of an hour trying to get through.\"\nAfter being repeatedly told there were no appointments and to call back the next day, Ms Martin said her mother told the surgery she \"was fearful for his life and she thought he was going to die\". \n\"By that point it was too late and he was blue-lighted to hospital because he'd deteriorated too much,\" she explained.\nMany Welsh GP surgeries are run independently, contracting services to the local health board. \nBetsi Cadwaladr health board estimated that in practices it managed, demand for appointments had increased by up to 20%. \nDr Phil White, chairman of the Welsh GPs Committee at the BMA, which represents doctors, said problems were developing before Covid with more GPs being lost to early retirement. \nBut he said GP surgeries are often in buildings with small waiting rooms, which were not safe for large number of often vulnerable people.\n\"But video consultations, phone consultations and e-mail consultations have escalated considerably over the past 12 months,\" he added.\nThe Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents the organisations that make up NHS Wales, said the health service was facing \"unprecedented demand\".\n\"More people are needing to access primary care with services under more pressure now than they were at the height of the pandemic,\" said director Darren Hughes, adding leaders were doing \"all they can to address these issues\"."

      "tags": "Monetary Policy Committee (MPC),Inflation,UK economy,Bank of England,Pound Sterling (GBP),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Bank of England has signalled it will raise interest rates in \"coming months\" in response to high inflation, but held off on an immediate increase.  \nOn Thursday, Bank policymakers voted 7-2 in favour of no change from the current record low rate of 0.1%. \nBank governor Andrew Bailey said the decision had been a \"close call\".\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said there was \"value\" in waiting to see how the jobs market coped with the end of the furlough scheme.\nHowever, it did not rule out a rate rise at its next meeting in December.\nThe MPC meets every six weeks. When pressed on when a rate rise might come, Mr Bailey said: \"From now onwards.\"\nHe said the MPC had \"spent many hours\" pondering its decision, adding: \"The calls are close, they are quite hard. It's a reflection of the position we're in.\"\nIn a BBC interview, Mr Bailey said current conditions were different because inflation was being caused by global \"supply shocks\" rather than demand pressure in the UK economy.\n\"Putting interest rates up, I'm afraid, isn't going to get us more gas,\" he added.\nBut he said that interest rates were not going to return to levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"For the foreseeable future, we're in a world of low interest rates,\" he said.\n\"That doesn't mean that they don't rise and fall within that sort of bound. But I want to be quite clear, we're not signalling that there's going to be some very sharp return to the world that we can just about remember before the financial crisis.\"\nMr Bailey said the MPC wanted to see \"more evidence\" of how the labour market was evolving before raising interest rates.\nHowever, he stressed: \"We think there will be some need to increase interest rates to bring inflation sustainably back to target. And we will be ready to do that.\"\nWhile the MPC voted to keep interest rates on hold, policymakers were split on the decision.\nTwo of the nine members, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders, voted to raise rates immediately to 0.25%.\nRates were cut to their current level in March last year in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut the reopening of the economy has fuelled price rises, prompting expectations that the Bank would increase borrowing costs.\nThe pound fell by nearly 1% against the dollar to $1.3556 following the Bank's decision, reflecting the fact that investors had bet on a rate rise.\nFinancial markets expect the interest rate to hit 1% by the end of next year.\nElectricity and gas prices have surged as the global economy reopens.\nFactories and businesses are also struggling with staff shortages and a backlog of orders, which has also pushed up prices.\nThe Bank expects inflation to peak at 5% next April, up from 3.1% in September.\nThis would be the highest rate in more than a decade and far higher than the Bank's target of 2%.\nThe Bank said households faced \"substantially\" higher energy bills next year.\nPolicymakers also said food prices were likely to rise in the run-up to Christmas.\nHowever, they added that the sharp increase in inflation was expected to be \"temporary\", with price rises expected to ease back towards 2% in the second half of next year.\nHigher inflation is expected to put pressure on household finances for the next two years.\nThe Bank's latest Monetary Policy Report expects price rises to outpace pay increases in 2022 and 2023.\nSo-called real incomes are expected to barely grow in 2024.\nHigh Street banks use the interest rate set by the Bank's MPC to set their own mortgages and savings rates.\nWhile an increase in interest rates would have been bad news for borrowers, many mortgage holders would not have faced an immediate increase in payments.\nThree quarters of mortgage holders are currently on fixed-rate deals.\nHigher prices are expected to weigh on growth in the near term.\nThe Bank now expects the economy to grow by 1.5% in the three months to September.\nThis is almost half the rate expected at its previous forecast in August.\nAs a result, the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the start of next year. It had previously expected the economy to recover by the end of 2021.\nThe Bank also cut its forecast for annual growth in 2021 and 2022 to 7% and 5% respectively, down from 7.25% and 6% previously.\nIn September, around a million workers were still on the government's furlough scheme that subsidised wages.\nThe scheme ended in October and the Bank expects most of those who were on furlough to return to work.\nWhile the peak in inflation next April is expected at a time when around 40% of workers are negotiating pay deals, the Bank does not expect higher prices to lead to big demands for pay rises.\nIt suggested that many workers were still scarred by the financial crisis, when many accepted slow pay growth or wage freezes even amid rising inflation.\nBe in no doubt, people and businesses should prepare for rates rising in the coming months, perhaps as high as 1% from their record lows of 0.1%, but not precisely this month.\nThe message from the Bank of England is that the economy has been hit by supply chain bottlenecks, both for goods and workers, pushing back the time when the economy regains all the lost pandemic growth into early next year. And while the inflation picture is now worse, with a forecast peak of 5% when the energy price cap is due to be further increased in April 2022, there is not much the Bank thinks it can do about the global drivers of this.\nWhere the Bank can act is around the persistence of this inflation into 2023 and 2024. They do now feel there is a risk that pressures from rising prices last. If interest rates were kept at these emergency lows, the Bank forecasts inflation would still be about 3% in late 2024.\nBut acting now would have required immediate evidence of a spiral in wage rises across the economy. On balance, the members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee want to see official data in a fortnight on the impact of the end of the furlough scheme on the jobs market."

      "tags": "Asia,Western Australia,Australia",
      "text": "Australian police have released an audio recording of the moment they found abducted four-year-old Cleo Smith in a locked house. \n\"We've got her, we've got her,\" an officer says before asking the child what her name is. \n\"My name is Cleo,\" the child responds, to the audible joy of the officers who say \"hello Cleo!\"\nCleo disappeared from her family's tent at a campsite on 16 October, triggering a massive search.\nA 36-year-old man will be charged in connection with her disappearance. This is likely due to take place later this afternoon, police said earlier on Thursday. \nShe was found in a house in Carnarvon, about six minutes' drive away from her family home. \nDetective Sergeant Cameron Blaine, one of the officers who found her, said Cleo was alert and aware at the time she was rescued.\nThe lights had been on in the house and she had been playing with toys. \nAuthorities say the man in custody has no connection to the Smith family. \nDetective Superintendent Rod Wilde told reporters that he would likely be charged this afternoon.  \nHe added that the man had been admitted to hospital after trying to harm himself while in police custody, but was now back at the station and was being interviewed by detectives. \nHe said they expected to produce him before a magistrate later today once those interviews were concluded. \nDetective Blaine told reporters of his joy and relief to find the child alive and well.\n\"It was amazing to see her behave like a normal four-year-old child would,\" he said.\nDetective Blaine added that he had been to see Cleo and she had been \"bubbly and laughing\" and playing in her backyard. \n\"She was eating an icy pole, she told me it was very sticky to eat, she was just delightful.\"\nWest Australia premier Mark McGowan told media that he had also been to meet Cleo, calling her a \"delightful little girl\".\nHe took two teddy bears - one for Cleo and one for her baby sister Isla - and said that he had suggested naming them Rob and Cameron after the two police officers investigating her case, but she \"didn't seem to like that\". \nHe also praised her family, calling them \"fundamentally decent, honest, human beings\" and said they were very grateful for everything the police had done.\n\"[Cleo] has done a bit of sleeping and a lot of eating, a lot of lying around and cuddling, just connecting [as] parents with their little daughters,\" he said.\nPolice added that the family would be counselled on the next steps in the probe. \nDetective Wilde said they had experts who would interview Cleo, cautioning that it had to be done very carefully and that it could take days before they were able to get any information from her. \nPolice have not formally named the man suspected of taking her, but there has been massive interest in his identity.\nLocal media have been carrying images of the house where Cleo Smith was locked up and spoken to the man's neighbours who have expressed shock that he might have been involved. \nThe West Australian said that he had been described as a \"very quiet\" man who \"kept to himself\", adding that everyone on the street had said that they knew him. \nABC News reported that he had been recently spotted by a neighbour buying nappies.\n\"We didn't click who\u2026 he was buying them for,\" the neighbour was quoted as saying. \nAn image by 7News, believed to be of the man has also been widely circulated on social media and other news platforms.\nIt shows a man underneath a blanket in the back of an ambulance. \nWestern Australia Deputy Commissioner Col Blanch said police had a duty to ensure anyone in custody medically fit enough to undergo questioning and to ensure that the court process is validated. \nHe added that the man had been \"assisting\" with the investigation. \nNews of Cleo's rescue has been welcomed by relieved Australians. \nAustralian PM Scott Morrison tweeted it was \"wonderful, relieving news\". Commissioner Dawson said: \"I think Australia is rejoicing.\"\n\"To find a little girl - a vulnerable little girl - after 18 days. You know, obviously people think the worst, but importantly hope was never lost,\" the commissioner added.\nThe girl has been reunited with her parents, who had made desperate pleas for Cleo's return.\n\"Our family is whole again,\" her mother, Ellie Smith, wrote on Instagram."

      "text": "The Department of Education (DE) will need an extra \u00a3350m in funding in 2022-23 to meet \"inescapable pressures\".\nGary Fair, DE's director of finance, told a Stormont committee there had been \"progressive underfunding\" of education.\nA recent Institute for Fiscal Studies report found Northern Ireland spent less on each school pupil's education than any other part of the UK.\nThe education budget is one of Stormont's biggest.\nIt covers schools, youth services and early years and comes in at about \u00a32.2bn a year.\nMr Fair, who was addressing the Education Committee, told SDLP assembly member (MLA) Daniel McCrossan that a \"very poor budget settlement\" for the next three years would lead to more of a crisis.\nIn response to a subsequent question from DUP MLA Diane Dodds, Mr Fair said the department would need an extra \u00a3350m in its budget next year.\n\"We have estimated certainly for next year that we'll be requiring probably an extra \u00a3350m,\" he said.\nMrs Dodds asked if measures like the Fair Start recommendations to tackle educational underachievement were dependent on additional money.\n\"Those are inescapable pressures really - \u00a3350m,\" replied Mr Fair.\n\"Our baseline every year doesn't reflect what we actually should have or need in our baseline so it is a problem.\n\"There's a risk in assuming that certain things will be taken forward without additional money.\"\nThe committee's chairman, Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle, asked Mr Fair about the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) report's conclusions that pupils in Northern Ireland had less spent per head on their education than elsewhere in the UK.\n\"Do pupils in Northern Ireland get less spent on them in education than the rest of these islands?\" Mr Lyttle asked.\n\"The figures would seem to indicate that, yes,\" replied Mr Fair.\n\"It has to be linked to progressive underfunding over the last number of years and the lack of certainty around budgets moving forward, and the lack of baseline just to cover even what's required every year.\"\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy has previously warned some departments may face \"more pain\" as he prepares a budget which could increase spending on health.\nMr Murphy has also disputed a claim by Chancellor Rishi Sunak that Northern Ireland will receive substantial extra funding for public services.\nThe department had bid for an additional \u00a384m in day-to-day spending and \u00a311.5m in capital funding in the October monitoring round.\nA monitoring round is a budget exercise in which money is reallocated to departments.\nHealth received about \u00a3200m of extra money in the October monitoring round with education receiving \u00a39.2m in day-to-day resource funding - mainly for special educational needs (SEN) pressures - and \u00a311.5m in capital funding.\nThe capital funding included \u00a38m for \"minor works\" to schools - which is often used to pay for essential repairs for school buildings.\nBut a DE official, Seamus Gallagher, told MLAs that much more money was needed.\n\"In terms of the state of the schools estate, we could probably spend \u00a3500m on the school estate every year and still spend 10 years bringing it up to where we would like it to be,\" he said.\n\"But we're constrained by budget and then have to allocate money in priority order where it's most required.\""

      "tags": "Owen Paterson,Parliamentary Standards Commissioner ",
      "text": "Conservative Owen Paterson has avoided punishment for now as the government ordered its MPs to back a review of standards investigations. \nThe result of the vote was met with cries of \"shame\" from opposition MPs.\nMr Paterson was found to have misused his position as an MP to benefit two companies he worked for.\nBut he said the probe into his conduct had been unfair - and the government backed plans by his allies to overhaul the system.\nLabour, the SNP and Lib Dems voted against the plans, along with 13 Conservative MPs, but it was carried by 18 votes after a heated Commons debate. \nIn a statement after the vote, Mr Paterson said: \"After two years of hell, I now have the opportunity to clear my name.\"\nIn an interview with the BBC, he thanked the MPs who voted for the overhaul, acknowledging they had \"taken a political hit\".\n\"But we will at last now be able to create a proper system, based on the rules of natural justice,\" he added. \nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the Conservatives of being \"rotten to the core\" and called the move an \"absolute disgrace\".\nShe said Labour would \"not be taking any part in this sham process or any corrupt committee\", with the SNP and Lib Dems also saying they would boycott the overhaul.\nThe controversy comes after a committee of MPs recommended Mr Paterson be suspended from the Commons for 30 days, following a damning report into his conduct by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone.\nThe report said the former Northern Ireland secretary had breached Commons rules by lobbying government bodies about Randox and Lynn's Country Foods, which employed him as a paid consultant.\nAfter the vote not to uphold the committee's recommendation, the BBC understands Ms Stone will not be resigning as standards commissioner.\nThe government did not order its MPs to uphold the proposed suspension, which could have led to Mr Paterson facing a by-election in his North Shropshire constituency. \nInstead, they were told to back an amendment drawn up by Tory former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom to pause his suspension and set up a new Tory-majority committee to look at how investigations are carried out.\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said MPs found to have broken the rules should get a right of appeal, as would happen with doctors and teachers found guilty of misconduct.\nBut the SNP's Pete Wishart accused the government of \"attempting to turn back the clock to the worst examples of 1990s Tory sleaze\". \nAhead of the vote, the committee's Labour chairman Chris Bryant told MPs Mr Paterson had lobbied ministers \"time and again, in a way that conferred a direct benefit on his paying clients\".\n\"That is expressly forbidden. It is a corrupt practice,\" he added.\nHe said Mr Paterson had been given \"every opportunity\" to put his case across - and his arguments had been heard \"respectfully and fairly\".\nEvery MP who backed today's move can expect to have it used against them on political leaflets or Facebook campaigns. \nThere could be serious consequences in Parliament if the opposition parties decide to use this moment to withdraw cooperation on other committees or ways of working. \nSome ministers already fear this is an episode that Downing Street may come to regret. \nOwen Paterson is adamant that he did nothing wrong, and has been denied natural justice. \nBut with this Tory response, voters may well come to wonder, what's fair about this?\nRead Laura's full blog\nThe Commons standards committee found that Mr Paterson had used his parliamentary office on 16 occasions for meetings relating to his outside business interests and sent two letters relating to business interests on House of Commons-headed notepaper.\nIt described the MP's actions as \"an egregious case of paid advocacy\".\nHowever Mr Paterson denied any wrongdoing, and argued his approaches had been within the rules because he was seeking to alert ministers to defects in safety regulations.\nHe said the investigation had \"a major contributory factor\" in the death of his wife, Rose, who took her own life last year.\nHe claimed he had been pronounced guilty \"without being spoken to\" and that \"no proper investigation was undertaken\".\nThirteen Conservatives voted against Ms Leadsom's amendment, while 98 had no vote recorded - either by a deliberate abstention or because they were not able to vote. \nTory MP Angela Richardson appeared to confirm she was no longer a parliamentary aide to ministers after defying government orders to vote for the amendment and abstaining instead.\nAs a parliamentary private secretary, she would normally be expected to resign in order to oppose the government.\nWriting on Twitter, she said: \"I abstained on the Leadsom amendment aware that my job was at risk, but it was a matter of principle for me.\"\nAaron Bell - a Tory who opposed the amendment - said the proposals made it look \"like we're moving the goalposts\" and that any reform of the rules needed support across the Commons. \nLiberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain described the amendment as a \"stitch-up\", adding: \"You expect in a tin-pot dictatorship, not the home of parliamentary democracy.\""

      "text": "Two students were expelled from Oxford Brookes University following an allegation of gang rape, the BBC can confirm.\nA third was suspended after an appeal, and a fourth given a less serious punishment.\nThe incident, first revealed in The Times, was reported to the university in February 2018.\nThe university said it issued \"appropriate penalties\".\nThe alleged victim was a 19-year-old student who claimed she did not consent to sex with any of the four students, according to the Times.\nA police investigation was carried out \"over a period of several months\" in 2018, a spokesman for Thames Valley Police told the BBC.\nHowever, it was \"decided that there was insufficient evidence to progress the case further\".\nThe spokesman added that any new information relating to the investigation should be reported to the force.\nThe Times reported that a separate investigation by the university resulted in two of the students being expelled.\nA third student's punishment was reduced - following an appeal - from expulsion to a term's suspension, and an order to write an apology letter to the alleged victim.\nA fourth was not found to have breached university regulations and was given a written warning, the paper added.\nQuestions have been raised over the university's admissions policy, after it was reported that one of the students had been under investigation for sexual offences at a US university.\nThe university said in a statement that sexual violence and harassment had \"no place at Oxford Brookes\".\nIt said the incident was \"thoroughly investigated\" and that the university had liaised with the police.\n\"Appropriate penalties, including the most severe penalties available to the University in relation to some of the students, were applied and were upheld on appeal,\" it said.\nIt said it recognised the \"very distressing nature of the allegations\" and that specialist support services had helped \"those most closely affected\".\n\"As part of our commitment to maintaining an inclusive and respectful culture, we are reviewing behaviour and practices within Brookes Sport, including all clubs, to ensure that policies and practices promote the culture, behaviours and values we expect of all our students,\" it added.\nOxford Brookes was one of dozens of universities mentioned on the Everyone's Invited website, which made headlines in March after thousands of victims shared experiences of sexual assault and rape at schools and universities in the UK.\nAt the time, the university said it was \"very concerned\" by accounts of \"traumatic experiences\" at Oxford Brookes, and encouraged students to report incidents.\nAround the same time, a group of Oxford Brookes students campaigned for better lighting in parts of the city, after Sarah Everard's murder sparked a debate over women's safety.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, you can find services that can help on BBC Action Line."

      "text": "\"You could have seen this coming from space\", said one insider, as ministers moved to ditch their plan to tear down the system that checks up on MPs' behaviour. \nAs U-turns go, it was a quick one. \nBut as U-turns go, it is a highly visible, highly embarrassing one. \nSome Tory MPs are cross that they were made to vote for something contentious and controversial, more furious still that they had to take that political hit for something that was junked just hours later. \nThe attempt to protect former cabinet minister Owen Paterson from suspension, by suggesting an overhaul of the whole system, has failed.\nBut the change of heart was too late to stop the social media blitz against MPs who backed it on Wednesday, with accusations of cronyism, of voting to protect one of their own. \nAnd it's a gift for the opposition, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer publicly accusing the prime minister of corruption that goes to the very top. \nWhat looks like a shambles has caused problems in several different directions. \nThere is particular concern among Tory MPs elected for the first time in 2019 - a new generation questioning the attitudes and, some believe, entitlement of their political seniors. \nIn the words of one MP it has \"destroyed a lot of goodwill\" and, without doubt, will make them less willing to defend the government the next time something goes wrong. \nOwen Paterson and his supporters, who genuinely believe he has been wronged, are now left dangling, and, arguably, there will now be even more attention and more anguish around his case.  \nBoris Johnson has left himself vulnerable to suspicions about his own personal interest in the system, which just happens to have found that he has made mistakes over the years. \nIt also raises questions over Downing Street's political antennae too.  \nThe government was blasted by the man whose job it is to keep our democracy on the right lines, the former MI5 boss, Lord Evans. \nAnd the impression given to many members of the public is that once again, MPs are tangled up in a conversation about sleaze and suspect behaviour. There was political damage from trying to pull what looked like a stunt. But stopping it happening also creates a stink. "

      "tags": "Owen Paterson",
      "text": "Conservative MP and former minister Owen Paterson has said he will resign his North Shropshire seat, after 24 years saying he wanted to escape \"the cruel world of politics\". \nMr Paterson had been facing a 30 days suspension after he was found to have broken parliamentary rules.\nA group of Conservatives - backed by the government - tried to pause his suspension until a review of the system for investigating MPs had been carried out.\nHowever following an angry backlash, Downing Street halted the plans. \nI have today, after consultation with my family, and with much sadness decided to resign as the MP for North Shropshire.\nThe last two years have been an indescribable nightmare for my family and me.\nMy integrity, which I hold very dear, has been repeatedly and publicly questioned. \nI maintain that I am totally innocent of what I have been accused of and I acted at all times in the interests of public health and safety. \nI, my family and those closest to me know the same. I am unable to clear my name under the current system.\nFar, far worse than having my honesty questioned was, of course, the suicide of my beloved and wonderful wife, Rose. \nShe was everything to my children and me. We miss her everyday and the world will always be grey, sad and ultimately meaningless without her.\nThe last few days have been intolerable for us. \nWorst of all was seeing people, including MPs, publicly mock and deride Rose's death and belittle our pain. \nMy children have therefore asked me to leave politics altogether, for my sake as well as theirs. \nI agree with them. \nI do not want my wife's memory and reputation to become a political football. Above all, I always put my family first. \nThis is a painful decision but I believe the right one. \nI have loved being the MP for North Shropshire and have considered it a privilege to have been elected to serve my constituents for 24 years. \nI would like to thank my staff who have worked for me so loyally over many years. \nI also want to thank those who have stood by me so staunchly.  \nI wish them all the best in that difficult but vital job of being a Member of Parliament.\nI will remain a public servant but outside the cruel world of politics. \nI intend to devote myself to public service in whatever ways I can but especially in the world of suicide prevention.\nAt this incredibly difficult time for my family, we ask that the media respects our privacy and lets us grieve my beloved Rose, the best person I ever met."
