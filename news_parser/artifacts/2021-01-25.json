      "title": "Mastercard to push up fees for UK purchases from EU",
      "tags": "Credit cards",
      "text": "Credit card giant Mastercard is to raise the fees it charges EU merchants when UK cardholders buy goods and services from them online by fivefold.\nIt has sparked fears that consumer prices could rise if merchants choose to pass on those costs, especially on items not available from UK retailers.\nTransactions with airlines, hotels, car rentals and holiday firms based in the EU could all be affected. \nMastercard attributed the move to the UK's decision to leave the EU. \nIt said that only online sales would be affected and that \"in practice\" UK consumers would not notice the change. \nThe change affects the \"interchange\" fees Mastercard sets on behalf of big banks, so that its customers can use their payment networks. \nFrom October, Mastercard said it would increase these fees to 1.5% on every transaction, up from 0.3%.\nThe EU introduced a cap on such fees in 2015 after concerns they pushed prices up for consumers and unfairly burdened companies.\nBritish customers makes tens of billions of pounds of purchases every year from European merchants on credit cards alone - and the hike in fees from Mastercard will affect the majority of those. \nThe increase may be relatively small but it's significant, coming at a time when retailers may face extra paperwork and checks - higher costs - for goods coming into the UK. \nWith Covid  restrictions bringing their own challenges, businesses, especially smaller ones,  may be compelled to pass on the costs to consumers.\nAnd it's not just items crossing borders. The payments for most items bought on Amazon in the UK are processed via its Luxembourg headquarters.\nWith the increase not coming in for several months, international companies may look at ways to reclassify UK sales, to avoid the charges. \nMastercard is implementing the rises simply as it's no longer bound by the restrictions imposed by the UK being in the EU. The banks which receive the fees have said in the past that they are invested in areas such as card security and innovation. This time, however, the trade body which represents them has declined to comment on the rises.\nBut Mastercard said that since the end of the Brexit transition period, the cap no longer applied to many payments between the UK and European Economic Area (which also includes Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).\n\"As a result of the UK leaving the EEA, Mastercard will adapt interchange rates on UK cards to the commitments it gave the European Commission in 2019 for non-EEA card transactions,\" the company said.\n\"In practice, only EEA merchants making e-commerce sales to UK cardholders will see a change.\"\nKevin Hollinrake, chair of the parliamentary group on Fair Business Banking, told the Financial Times, which first reported the story, that the move \"smacks of opportunism\".\nAnd Callum Godwin, chief economist at CMSPI, the global payments consultancy, said airlines, hotels, car rentals and travel groups would be hit. \n\"[This will happen] anywhere the consumer is in the UK and the merchant is in the EU,\" he said. \nHe added that many firms in these industries were already struggling due to the pandemic.\u00a0\nVisa, Mastercard's larger rival, has not announced plans to change its fees but told the FT it was keeping the issue under review. \nCompanies in the UK and EU are already facing added costs and delays due to post-Brexit trade rules brought in on 1 January.\nSome EU exporters have already stopped deliveries to the UK because of new VAT related charges.\nMeanwhile, UK consumers who have bought goods from firms based in the bloc have found themselves facing hefty charges to cover customs duties, taxes and administration."

      "text": "Israel has started vaccinating 16 to 18-year-olds against Covid-19, in an effort to enable them to sit exams.\nMore than a quarter of Israel's population of nine million have received at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine since 19 December, its health ministry says. \nIt started with the elderly and others at high risk, but people aged 40 and over can also now get the jab.\nIsrael hopes to start reopening its economy in February.\nThe inclusion of 16 to 18-year-olds - with parental permission - is meant \"to enable their return (to school) and the orderly holding of exams\", an education ministry spokeswoman said.\nThe matriculation exams that Israeli students sit at the end of high school play an important role in deciding where they will go to university. Their results can also affect their placement in the military, where many young Israelis do compulsory service.\nThe education ministry has said it is too early to say whether schools will reopen next month. \nIsrael started its rapid vaccination drive - the fastest in the world - on 19 December, reaching 10% of its population by the end of 2020.\nIsrael has recorded more than 596,000 cases and 4,392 deaths with Covid-19, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.\nOn Sunday, the government said it would ban passenger flights in and out of the country from Monday night for the rest of January, in an effort to halt the spread of new virus variants.\n\"Other than rare exceptions, we are closing the sky hermetically to prevent the entry of the virus variants and also to ensure that we progress quickly with our vaccination campaign,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\nForeigners have largely been blocked from entering Israel during the pandemic."

When in a poor state, financial worries cause stress and our cognition fails,\" said Keiron Sparrowhawk, a cognition expert from the Being Well Group, which runs the MyCognition app.\nThis could lead to depression and hasty, ill-thought-out decisions, he said.\n\"Together, depression and anxiety are distressing and disabling, causing us to spiral out of control and enter a pit of hell,\" he said.\nSource: Money and Pensions Service"

      "tags": "Companies,Retailing,Boohoo,Debenhams",
      "text": "Fashion retailer Boohoo has bought the Debenhams brand and website for \u00a355m.\nHowever, it will not take on any of the firm's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce.  \nBoohoo said it was a \"transformational deal\" and a \"huge step\". But the deal means that up to 12,000 jobs at the department store chain are set to go.\nThe 242-year-old Debenhams chain is already in the process of closing down, after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the business.\nIn a separate development, Asos says it is in \"exclusive\" talks to buy the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands out of administration.\nBut the online retailer said it only wanted the brands, not their shops, suggesting any deal would cost jobs.\nThe current owner of the brands, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, fell into administration last November putting 13,000 jobs at risk.\nA closing-down sale at 124 Debenhams stores began in December, as the administrators continued to seek offers for all or parts of the business. \nThe company announced recently that six shops would not reopen after lockdown, including its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street. \nThe administrators of Debenhams UK, FRP Advisory, said they had undertaken a \"thorough and robust process\" to achieve \"the best outcome for Debenhams' stakeholders\". \n\"This transaction will allow a new Debenhams-branded business to emerge under strong new ownership, including an online operation and the opportunity to secure an international franchise network that will operate under licence using the Debenhams name,\" they added.\nBoohoo has already bought a number of High Street brands out of administration. It snapped up Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen, but not the associated stores. \nIts executive chairman, Mahmud Kamani, said: \"This is a transformational deal for the group, which allows us to capture the fantastic opportunity as ecommerce continues to grow. Our ambition is to create the UK's largest marketplace. \n\"Our acquisition of the Debenhams brand is strategically significant as it represents a huge step which accelerates our ambition to be a leader, not just in fashion ecommerce, but in new categories including beauty, sport and homeware.\"\nBoohoo said Debenhams was expected to relaunch on Boohoo's web platform later this year.\nIn the meantime, Debenhams will continue to operate its website for an agreed period.\nBoohoo has recently come under fire over workers' pay and conditions and its ultra-low pricing.\nAs well as facing questions about the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business model, there have been accusations of  widespread abuse of employment law at some of Boohoo's suppliers in Leicester. \nInvestigations last year suggested workers were being paid below the minimum wage.\nAfter an independent review of the claims found a series of failings, Mr Kamani said last month that the firm was working to fix the problems, adding: \"We will make a better Boohoo.\"\nWhile online retailers have been whittling away at their High Street rivals for years, few could have predicted how quickly bricks-and-mortar stalwarts have collapsed. The pandemic has fatally undermined their already parlous finances. Businesses that appeared to have a chance of survival just a year ago have been wiped out and their brands bought by online players.  \nThe scale of the change is profound: when Debenhams listed on the stock exchange in 2011, investors valued it at \u00a31.6bn. Boohoo, which was founded only in 2006, already has a stock market value of \u00a34.4bn. Asos, a bit player two decades ago when Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group was riding high and toying with a bid for Marks & Spencer, is now valued by the stock market at \u00a35bn. \nNeither Boohoo or Asos see any value in the Debenhams or Topshop High Street estates. Instead, they will concentrate on development of the brands and the associated customer data. This is bad news for the 19,000-odd people who work in the branches of Debenhams and Topshop, and will leave councils around the country wondering how they will fill town centres that were based on retail. \nBut just as canny entrepreneurs and private equity companies are gearing up to buy struggling pub chains, in the hope of a recovery once lockdown restrictions are eased, so will some investors be wondering what next for the High Street. The British love affair with shopping will not end overnight and a well-placed punt now could have big rewards.\nDebenhams has struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping has moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April.\nHowever, its position became untenable during the coronavirus pandemic as non-essential retailers were forced to close for prolonged periods.\nThe firm had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May, as it struggled to stay afloat.\nBusinessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April.\nHowever, the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of \u00a3125m, was rejected as being too low.\nMeanwhile, one of House of Fraser's flagship outlets, the Jenners department store in Edinburgh, is to leave its Princes Street home after 183 years. It will close on 3 May with the loss of 200 jobs.\nThe building's owner, Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, announced in November 2019 that he intended to convert the site, replacing Jenners with a hotel, cafes, a rooftop restaurant and luxury shops.\nHowever, a spokesperson for Frasers Group said it had been \"unable to reach an agreement\" with Mr Povlsen and that the closure of Jenners would leave \"a vacant site for the foreseeable future with no immediate plans\". \nDo you work for Debenhams?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,NHS Wales",
      "text": "It is hoped 70% of the over-80s in Wales will get the first dose of a Covid vaccine by the end of the weekend.\nBut it could be a few days before the official figures are published so we know for sure. \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said, because he has access to \"day-by-day\" data, it gives him confidence to know that by the end of Sunday, the target should be met\nBut with criticism of a slow start to its vaccination roll-out, has Wales been lagging behind other nations?\nWales reported 28,230 first dose vaccinations on Saturday - a 29% rise in its daily total on the day before.\nIf this was maintained at the same level, it is well on course to see the target of first doses of the first four priority groups being met by 14 February.\nWith 7.6% of the population getting the first dose, this is now even a little ahead of Scotland (7%), based on rates of population. \nEngland has reached 9% of its population. But comparisons are complicated and here's why. \nThe vaccine figures we see every day are already a few days old. It takes up to five days after a person receives a dose for the data to be actually published. \nGPs are asked to input data as soon as possible but it then has to be checked and verified by the national immunisation service and Public Health Wales - to ensure people aren't double-counted for instance - before it is actually published.\nSo there is a built-in lag between what NHS Wales bosses are seeing happening daily and when we see the figures.\nOne health official said they were under-reporting rather than leaving \"any chance of over-reporting\".\nThat enables Mr Drakeford, from the information he has to hand each day, to have confidence.\n\"Ministers every day see information, operational data that comes in from the health service, more or less, in real time,\" he said. \n\"The statistics that are published every day have a lag in them. They have to be collected formally from the health service. \n\"They have to be interrogated, they have to be quality assured, and then they are published as formal figures.\"\nIn England, \"real time\" data is published the next day, which is then subject to changes if necessary at a later date.\nSo, the official figures from NHS England - showing a higher rate - are actually ahead in time compared to Wales. \nIt pointed to its website which states that data was \"provisional\", showing doses, as reported by midnight on the date before publication. \n\"The weekly release then provides more accurate and detailed data by dose and age,\" it added. \nWales had 6% of people given a first dose by 21 January, England had reached 6% four days earlier - but without the publishing lag.\nThe figure for Saturday was 9% of population in England and 7.6% in Wales. Four days earlier, the figure in England was 6.5%.\nWales admittedly seemed to make a slow start last month, compared to other UK nations.\nOne of the explanations from health bosses in Wales is that it was a product of the different approaches taken by the UK nations to start with. \nThey expect things to even out between now and February.\nNorthern Ireland focused on mobile vaccination units to care homes, England focused on its primary care hubs, doing about two-thirds of vaccinations, while Wales started with mass vaccination centres before bringing in its network of GPs - increasing as more of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine became available.\nSome GPs were frustrated they did not get supplies early on. This was because vaccine batches could not be split up and had to be sent in their original sized packs, but as supplies increased this issue was expected to be ironed out.\nHealth officials in Wales said GPs were condensing a lot of their vaccine clinics from Wednesday onwards and then into the weekends.\nVaccination figures are not normally published at weekends in Wales in any case. But with the data lag, we should see the proof in the pudding later in the week.\nA total of 650,000 in the four first priority groups are expected to get first doses of vaccines by mid-February.\nMass vaccination centres (MVCs) - about 40% will be delivered through this network of approximately 35 centres, with the Pfizer vaccine. These includes healthcare and care home workers, and in the weeks to come the over-70s and second doses. If there is more supply of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, some MVCs could be adapted to take this too.\nGP practices - about 48% of vaccines are expected for the first priority groups from 250 GP centres, involving Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines to the over-80s initially.\nMobile units will deliver about 5% to isolated people and those in care homes and 7% by a hybrid model with vaccine centres that might open for short time. \nThe planning of the programme and how many vaccines will be delivered from these different areas of the health service will depend on supply, but health officials are planning for centres opening later - including possibly 24 hours in future.\nThey are looking to train opticians and dentists to help, as well as the likes of St John Ambulance and 50 firefighters.\nNHS Wales is using what has been called its own \"seamless\" booking and tracking system for the immunisation programme. \nUpdated four times a day, it manages supply and can see who is scheduled to be vaccinated and where. \nIt means appointments can be sent quickly, which can be used by GPs, to see who on their list may have been seen and to hopefully avoid double bookings.\nHealth officials certainly hope so. They say since the start of the roll-out, 180,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and 140,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca doses - 320,000 in all - have gone out to health boards, will \"go into arms\" and will start to show up in figures. \nThe gap between supplies going out and actual vaccinations is getting smaller all the time, indicating a step-up.\nFriday's figures showed 30% of over-80s and 60% of care home residents had received a first dose; on Saturday it had risen to 38.7% and 63.2%. These would be lagged figures. \nHowever, the changes in daily numbers for the over-80s - increases of 11,500 and 15,451 in successive days - suggest we are starting to see the results of the roll-out in GP clinics.\nThe hope is that 70% of over-80s and care home residents will have had the vaccine (or been offered it, they might refuse) by the weekend. The target is that all will be reached by the end of January.\nIf at the current rate - and if it stayed the same - that 70% target for the over-80s would be reached in about six days. But the trend is expected to be upward.\nThose in charge of the programme say they can see a steep rise in the numbers of over-80s and care home staff getting their dose, while the health minister said he expected the programme to \"significantly ramp up\"."

Meteorologists say the conditions are influenced by a La Nina phenomenon.\nAustralia has warmed on average by 1.4C since national records began in 1910, according to its science and weather agencies.\nThat's led to an increase in the number of extreme heat events, as well as increased fire danger days.\n\"In summer we now see a greater frequency of very hot days compared to earlier decades,\" said BoM and the national science agency, CSIRO, in their 2020 State of the Climate report.\nThe same report noted that 2019 - Australia's hottest year on record - had 33 days where the national maximum temperature exceeded 39C.  That surpassed the total number of days over 39C in the previous six decades.\nHeatwaves are Australia's deadliest natural disaster and have killed thousands more people than bushfires or floods."

      "tags": "Skewen,Storm Christoph,Mining,Coal mining",
      "text": "The coalmining heritage of Wales has been implicated in flooding of homes - but what has happened in Skewen?\nAbout 80 people were evacuated from the Neath Port Talbot village, with at least eight streets left under water.\nCouncil leader Rob Jones says the flood appears to be related to mine works - but the volume of water involved has hampered a full assessment so far.\nThe Coal Authority is investigating how \"historic underground mining features\" in the area exacerbated the problem.\nA geologist says there are tens of thousands of old mine shafts across the former south Wales coalfield and it is \"incredibly difficult\" to monitor them all.\nSkewen lies within an old coal mining hotspot, with several former colliery sites near the village that operated in the 19th and early 20th Century. \nThere were colliery sites near what is now Drummau Road, in the north of the village and another close to Old Road, near Neath Abbey. \nSkewen was part of a collection of collieries that stretched between Neath and Llanelli on the western side of south Wales' coalfield.\nGraham Levins, secretary of the Welsh Mines Preservation Trust, said old mines often contain groundwater which can flood in heavy rain. \nHe said: \"A lot of them go very, very deep down, much below the local water level and that's why they had all the big wheels to pump the water out. \n\"It fills up with water and will find a way out. Normally rainfall you get it doesn't cause a lot of problems but when you get really heavy rain, the water drains down through the ground and builds up.\"\nGeologist Tom Backhouse said water was coming out of an area near the junction of Goshen Park and Drummau Road, where there is a record of a mine shaft dating from the turn of the 20th Century.\nIt then started \"rushing down\" Drummau Road, causing the flooding that forced evacuations.\n\"What we can expect to have happened is that the water level in the mines rose to a point where it's burst out of that entry point from the mine workings below. \n\"Also, there are images of very ochre like orange-coloured water and again, that may well be issuing from the mine workings on the highlands to the east of the property on the hill behind. \n\"That may be where the shallow workings have flooded.\"\nHe said old mine working across the former coalfield area hold water at a certain depth, but when an event such as Storm Christoph drops \"a huge amount in a small area\", the levels rise quickly.\n\"As it gets closer and closer to the surface, it basically looks for an escape, the pressure builds up,\" he continued.\n\"What it looks like has happened on the junction of Goshen Park and Drummau Road, where the mine shaft is recorded, is that pressure has built up at that point and then burst out through the shaft which is very likely to have been capped with wood or something like that.\n\"Where you've got those mine shafts, which ultimately are vertical tunnels down into the mine workings below, the water has literally forced itself up through that shaft, and the pressure is obviously so great it's caused this devastating flash flood.\"\nThere are about 13 shafts recorded within about 820ft (250m) of the one in Goshen Park, so Mr Backhouse said it is possible more than one may have burst.\nThere are tens of thousands in south Wales and he said it was \"incredibly difficult\" to check them all, but there were \"tell tale signs\" as to why they may collapse such as age or what type of developments are around them. \n\"Not to try and fear-monger or anything but of course this sort of thing can happen again,\" he said.\n\"If another event like Storm Christoph happens, the water levels in the mine rises as quickly as it did, there's absolutely nothing to say that it wouldn't happen again in the future. \n\"And obviously as climate changes and we have many more events like Storm Christoph, they are going to increase in frequency, they are going to be much more severe.\n\"The Coal Authority will have to consider the risk in places like Skewen, and they'll have to understand how it will affect residents and proactively manage that and look at how to reduce the risks for residents.\""

December pay is often early, so the money has to stretch\u00a0further, and if you put any Christmas presents or expenses on your Barclaycard, this month's bill will be high anyway,\" she said.\u00a0 \n\"For people who were hardly managing\u00a0before, the increase to the minimum payments may tip the bill over into being unaffordable.\"\nDebt charities had already warned that the coronavirus pandemic meant the\u00a0UK was \"sleepwalking into a debt crisis\".\nThe government-backed Money and Pensions Service - which offers free guidance - said it was expecting a call about debt at least every four minutes throughout January.\nBarclaycard said the timing of the changes - which coincide with lockdown and many people on a reduced furlough income - was unintentional and had been signalled some time ago.\nAny borrowers who feel the new repayment levels are unaffordable are being asked to contact the company.\nMore broadly, anyone struggling to make debt repayments of any kind is being urged to face their difficulties and seek help.\n\"Financial worries negatively affect our 'cognition', which are the thinking processes that support and maintain our mental health. When in a poor state, financial worries cause stress and our cognition fails,\" said Keiron Sparrowhawk, a cognition expert from the Being Well Group, which runs the MyCognition app.\nThis could lead to depression and hasty, ill-thought-out decisions, he said.\n\"Together, depression and anxiety are distressing and disabling, causing us to spiral out of control and enter a pit of hell,\" he said.\nSource: Money and Pensions Service"

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Scottish independence,Gordon Brown,Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The public's trust in the way the UK is run is breaking down, former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has warned.\nHe said Covid-19 had exposed \"tensions\" between Whitehall and the nations and regions, who were often treated by the centre as if they were \"invisible\". \nMr Brown is urging Boris Johnson to set up a commission to review how the country is governed and powers shared.\nBut the PM said his focus was on the pandemic, stressing the benefits of the union could be \"seen everywhere\". \nRecent opinion polls have suggested rising support for Scottish independence and potentially for a border vote in Northern Ireland.\nMr Brown's intervention comes amid a looming clash between Mr Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has demanded the UK agree to another Scottish independence referendum if the SNP wins a majority in May's Holyrood elections. \nThe Court of Session is hearing arguments about whether Holyrood can legislate to hold one even if the UK government continues to object.\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Brown - who advocates a federal system with more power for nations and regions - says the pandemic has \"brought to the surface tensions and grievances that have been simmering for years\" between Downing Street and the various parts of the UK.\nHe points to \"bitter disputes\" over issues such as lockdown restrictions and furlough and said unless underlying tensions were resolved, the UK risked becoming a \"failed state\". \nIn an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today, he said at a time \"when all should be pulling together and intensifying co-operation across the UK\" there was division and claims by the leaders of Scotland and Wales and the English regions that they were not being properly consulted. \nLast year there were rows between the government and local authorities over coronavirus tiers, with the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, objecting to plans to put the region into the strictest level of restrictions.\nMr Brown told Today that while he was \"confident\" that Scotland would still be part of the UK in ten years time, the way the UK was governed had to change. \n\"I think the public are fed up. I think in many ways, they feel they are being treated as second class citizens, particularly in the outlying areas, that they are invisible and forgotten.\"\n\"Something has broken down in trust and has to be repaired.\"\nMr Brown is advising the Labour Party on its devolution strategy - but has also held talks with government ministers including Michael Gove in recent weeks. \nGovernment sources say they are focused on taking tangible steps to demonstrate the value of the UK.\nThe idea of a fundamental review of the UK's power structures has been suggested as one possible way to counter support for Scottish independence ahead of May's Holyrood election. \nBut a series of polls now suggest support for independence is higher than support for the union - and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will demand another referendum if, as seems likely, her party - the SNP - wins in May.  \nHe is calling on Boris Johnson to immediately set up a commission on democracy to review how the UK is governed, something the Conservatives promised in their manifesto before the last general election.\nIn his Telegraph article, he suggests it would find that the UK needs a Forum of the Nations and Regions, citizens' assemblies, and a greater focus on the benefits of cooperation in areas such as the NHS and the armed forces.\nThe current Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer also supports devolving more powers from Westminster but opposes another Scottish independence referendum.\nThe SNP said last week that there would be a \"legal referendum\" after the pandemic if May's Holyrood election returned a pro-independence majority.\nAsked if he would stand in the way of this, Mr Johnson said what the British public wanted was for its political leaders to focus on beating coronavirus, adding that the advantages of the UK's four nations working together \"spoke for themselves\". \n\"I think people can see everywhere in the UK the visible benefits of our wonderful union,\" he said.\n\"A vaccine programme that is being rolled out by a National Health Service, a vaccine that was developed in labs in Oxford and is being administered by the British Army.\"\nBut the SNP said the Scottish people, not Westminster-based politicians, should decide the country's future. \n\"No amount of constitutional tinkering from Labour would protect Scotland from Brexit or the Tory power grab - only independence can do that,\" said Kirsten Oswald, the party's deputy Westminster leader.\n\"The Scottish people will see right through this attempt to deny their democratic right.\"\nA poll commissioned by the Sunday Times in Northern Ireland found 51% of people wanted a referendum on Irish unity in the next five years.\nDUP leader and Northern Irish First Minister Arlene Foster said such a vote would be \"absolutely reckless\".\nNumbers supporting Wales breaking away from the UK also appear to be rising. The pro-independence campaign group Yes Cymru has said membership swelled from 2,000 at the start of 2020 to more than 17,000. \nPlaid Cymru has also promised to hold an independence referendum if it wins the next Senedd election.\nResponding to Mr Brown's intervention, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: \"It's been clear for many years that the UK doesn't work for Wales - I'm glad that the Labour Party are starting to see that.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has identified 77 cases of the coronavirus variant first detected in South Africa, the health secretary has said.\nCases are linked to travellers arriving in the UK, rather than community transmission, Matt Hancock added.\nHe told the BBC's Andrew Marr cases were under \"very close\" observation and enhanced contact tracing was under way.\nMinisters are due to meet on Monday to consider imposing tougher restrictions on people arriving from abroad. \nScientists have said there is a chance the South African variant may harm the effectiveness of current vaccines.\nMeanwhile, Mr Hancock said that \"three quarters of all the 80-year-olds in the country and a similar number of care homes\" have received their first doses of the vaccine.\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses, and figures so far reflect those given the first dose.\nMr Hancock said that it was \"far too early to say\" what proportion of the population needed to be vaccinated before lockdown restrictions could be eased.\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, mutate, and variants have been first located in the UK, South Africa and Brazil.\nThe South Africa variant has been found in at least 20 other countries, including the UK.\nMr Hancock said that all the South Africa variant cases in the UK were linked to travel.\n\"That's why we have got such stringent border measures in place against movement from South Africa,\" he added.\nThe UK closed all travel corridors last week until at least 15 February, with almost all travellers arriving in the country now required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has not ruled out bringing in tougher measures at UK borders, telling a Downing Street news conference on Friday: \"We don't want to put that (efforts to control Covid) at risk by having a new variant come back in.\"\nMinisters are set to discuss whether to tighten border restrictions further, including the possibility of hotel quarantines for travellers.\nMr Hancock said: \"We have got to be cautious at the borders.\"\nAsked for a date on when lockdown restrictions might end, Mr Hancock said it was \"one of the many things that we don't yet know the answer to\".\nGovernment data on 14 January showed there were 35 confirmed cases of the South Africa variant identified in the UK, and a further 12 \"probable\" cases.\nMr Hancock said nine cases of the Brazil variant had been found in the UK, adding \"we are monitoring each and every one very closely\".\nShadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that Labour had been \"pushing the government to take tougher measures at the border since last spring\".\nShe said: \"We would fully expect the government to bring in tougher quarantine measures, we would expect them to roll out a proper testing strategy and we would expect them as well to start checking up on the people who are quarantining.\n\"Only three out of every hundred people who are asked to quarantine when they arrive into the UK actually face any checks at all - that's just simply not sufficient.\"\nOn Friday, Mr Johnson said there was \"some evidence\" the UK variant may be associated with \"a higher degree of mortality\".\nThe UK government's chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, said there was \"a lot of uncertainty around these numbers\" but that early evidence suggested the variant could be about 30% more deadly.\nThe PM said on Friday that there was evidence that both the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine and Oxford-AstraZeneca jab were effective against the variant first detected in the UK. \nSir Patrick has warned that the variants in South Africa and Brazil might \"have certain features which means they might be less susceptible to vaccines\".\nBut he said \"there is no evidence\" that the two variants have transmission advantages over those already in the UK and so having cases here doesn't mean \"they will take off\".\nMeanwhile, England's deputy chief medical officer warned that people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine could still pass the virus on to others and should continue following lockdown rules.\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam stressed that scientists \"do not yet know the impact of the vaccine on transmission\".\nHe said vaccines offer \"hope\" but infection rates must come down quickly.\nIt's a key question but the fact is that no one can be sure. \nThat's because the trials of the vaccines explored the safety of the drugs and how well they prevent people from becoming ill - with good results for both. \nBut they did not investigate whether vaccination also stops infection and therefore whether people who've been immunised can still spread the virus to others. \nIf a vaccinated person did become infected, they probably wouldn't realise because they wouldn't have any symptoms. That's why health officials and ministers are so concerned. \nIt's possible that the antibodies boosted by the vaccine suppress the effects of the virus but don't eliminate it from the upper airway.  \nMany scientists are cautiously hopeful that in this scenario, the amount of virus would be reduced but they're waiting for the results of studies under way now.\nAnd until there's an answer, it's difficult to calculate how and when it's safe to ease restrictions and allow people to mix again. \nA further 610 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK on Sunday - down from 671 deaths last Sunday - in addition to 30,004 new infections.\nThe number of positive cases has fallen for the fourth day in a row and is the lowest figure since before Christmas.\nThe death figures tend to be lower on a Sunday and Monday because of weekend lags in reporting of the data.\nMeanwhile, more than six million people have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine - with the figure now standing at 6,353,321.\nNadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said on Twitter that 6,353,321 of the \"most vulnerable and frontline heroes\" had received a first dose of the vaccine, but there was still \"much more to do\".\nThere were 4,076 Covid patients in mechanical ventilation beds in UK hospitals as of Friday, according to government data.\nThat is higher than during the first wave, when the peak was 3,301 on 12 April.\nIn other developments:"

Devon County Council urged people to avoid travel unless it was absolutely essential and not to travel to find snow.  \nMet Office forecaster Simon Partridge said a band of hail, sleet, snow and rain moved in through Wales and south-west England in the early hours before sweeping across the UK and stalling over the Midlands, which saw some of the heaviest snow. \nColeshill, near Birmingham, had seen had 3.5in (9cm) by Sunday lunchtime. \nThe snow clouds eased away on Sunday evening but overnight temperatures could be as low as -4C to -6C (25F to 21F) for a lot of the south of the UK, the forecaster added.\n\"Some localised spots, likely in the Midlands, could see it as low as -10C (14F),\" he said.\nChris Fawkes of BBC Weather said some stretches of the M4 and M5 had been completely covered in snow at some points on Sunday morning. \nHe said this was partly because traffic has been low due to lockdown restrictions - and vehicles are needed to help grit mix into snow to make it melt."

Ms Sturgeon says the programme is \"on track\" to having this group complete by the middle of February.\nThere has been some criticism of the speed of the rollout in Scotland, with a greater proportion of over-80s having already received a jab in England.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon said the programme was \"making good progress\" and said any differences with the rest of the UK were because of an early focus on vaccinating older care home residents - 95% of whom have now had their first dose.\nShe said she was \"absolutely confident\" that the government would hit its targets.\nAnd the first minister said consideration was being given to how to speed up the programme further, saying her government is \"looking at all sorts of ways to accelerate things\".\nShe said: \"We are looking at piloting 24/7 arrangements so that when we get into wider groups of the population, people will have choices about the time they turn up for vaccines.\n\"There's been debate about whether people will want to turn up in the middle of the night to get vaccinated - some will and some won't. If that sort of thing is going to add to what we are able to do, it is likely to have the greatest impact when you get down into the relatively younger age groups.\n\"If we think it is appropriate there may be some things we try just to see if they would work, and if they don't we won't continue with them.\n\"We are looking at all of these options to make sure that as the supply increases, we can get it to people as quickly as possible.\"\nMs Sturgeon said there was \"some early evidence\" that lockdown was reducing the number of new Covid-19 cases, although she said the government would take a \"cautious\" approach to restrictions - which are currently due to run into mid-February at the earliest.\nShe also voiced some \"cautious grounds for optimism\" that admissions to hospital are starting to \"tail off slightly\", although she warned that pressure on the NHS would remain \"acute\" for some time.\nOpposition leaders called for the vaccine programme to be accelerated and for support to be targeted at key workers.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"People are talking about a 24/7 approach here in Scotland - I think based on the figures so far we need to focus just on a seven day approach, because we are not vaccinating people quickly enough.\n\"We are not making the progress we need to, to get people vaccinated as quickly as possible.\"\nScottish Labour MSP Sarah Boyack said the vaccine programme \"needs to be accelerated as fast as possible\"\nShe said: \"We are all behind this vaccine being rolled out - but it has to be as soon as possible, because people are getting nervous.\n\"Whether it's police staff, construction staff, care staff who have been worried for weeks - the vaccine has got to be the top priority, along with the test and trace so we can monitor the impact on the ground and get targeted support to people.\"\nScottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Scotland was \"slipping further and further behind England\" and added: \"The first minister's excuses on the rollout of the vaccine are wearing very thin.\""

      "text": "Vaccination appointments for people aged 70-79 are being delivered from Monday - but plans to use distinctive blue envelopes in some parts of the country have been delayed. \nThe aim is to have this group receive their first dose by mid-February.\nOn Sunday morning, the Scottish government said some letters would be sent out in blue envelopes and given Royal Mail priority. \nBut in a statement published later it said the envelopes were not yet ready.\nIt added that the change has no impact on the vaccination programme timetable.\nVaccinations for over-80s are continuing, with Nicola Sturgeon revealing on Sunday that about 40% of this age group had received a first dose of the vaccine.\nAll appointments will initially be sent out in white envelopes which will have a window and a black NHS logo on the right hand side. \nThe blue envelopes were due to be sent out in Fife, Forth Valley, Ayrshire and Arran, Lanarkshire, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Lothian as part of a new booking system. \nUnder the system, patients are scheduled in order of priority and more boards are expected to make use of the technology as the vaccination programme expands. \nA Scottish government spokesman said the blue envelopes would be introduced \"as quickly as possible\". \nHe added: \"The blue envelopes we hoped to use were not ready in time for the first tranche of vaccine appointment invitations so distinctive NHS branded white envelopes are being used as a temporary measure.\n\"The absolute priority remains the roll-out of vaccinations and this temporary change to the envelope colour has absolutely no impact to our timetable.\n\"We continue to strongly urge everyone in the 70-79 age group to check all their post in the coming weeks and take up the offer of the vaccine when it is received,\" he added. \nAccording to the Scottish government's vaccine deployment plan, the 470,000 people aged in the 70 and 79 age bracket should receive their first dose by mid-February.\nSome patients may receive a phone call from their local health board as part of the appointment process. \nAnd all patients aged 75 to 79 in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde will be invited via phone. \nA Royal Mail spokesman said \"clearly marked envelopes\" would be used to make it easier for the postal service to identify and prioritise this mail during sorting and delivery process. \nHe added: \"We are poised to make these letters even more noticeable in the coming weeks as we have agreed.\"\nMeanwhile, the Scottish government has said it is on track for all those aged 80 and over to have received their first dose of the vaccine by the end of the first week in February.\nThis age group are being contacted by telephone or another form of letter.\nMinisters have faced criticism over the pace of the vaccine rollout, and accusations that Scotland is \"lagging behind\" England on the vaccine roll-out. \nOpposition parties say vaccines are not being supplied to GPs' surgeries fast enough. \nAnd they point to the latest official figures which show that 13% of over 80s in Scotland had their first dose by Sunday 17 January, while 56.3% of same age group had been vaccinated in England. \nMs Sturgeon told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that, a week on, the figure had reached about 40%. \nThe UK government Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Andrew Marr on Sunday that 75% of over-80s and three-quarters of UK care homes had received a first Covid vaccine in England. \nAbout 95% of Scottish care home residents have received their first dose, Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish government briefing on Friday. \nShe said the over-80s roll-out has been slower because the Scottish government has \"very deliberately\" concentrated on vaccinating care home residents first, which is \"more time consuming and labour intensive\".\nThis was designed to target the most vulnerable and was in line with the priority list compiled by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises on vaccine rollout across the UK, she said.\nScotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch has defended the plan, which has been challenged by the British Medical Association (BMA) for not getting second doses out quickly enough.\nProf Leitch told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"The difficulty with the BMA's position is that we would have to de-prioritise another group, either care home residents or the over-80s, in order to give a second dose to younger people.\n\"And that's what the Joint Committee on Vaccination have told us not to do.\n\"They have told us in very clear terms - give the first dose to as many vulnerable people as you can and that gives us the best chance of saving the most lives.\"\nMeanwhile, Deputy First Minister John Swinney told Politics Scotland that the Scottish government was \"actively exploring\" the possibility of stricter rules around facemasks. \nHe said the issue was being \"looked at\" after new rules announced in Germany last week required people to wear medical-grade facemasks on public transport and in shops. \nMr Swinney said progress was being made in reducing cases but hospitals were still under \"enormous pressure\" and it would be \"foolish\" to rule out strengthening restrictions further in the future.

Whilst referring to Mr McCourt's long history in republicanism, we accept the phrase was open to misinterpretation."

They have asked us to reiterate the request for residents to stay away and that it is not safe to return today or tomorrow.\"\nIt is not known how many residents were thought to have returned to their flooded homes or how long they were there for.\nBigger equipment is being brought in to \"understand in detail what has caused the blow out\", according to Coal Authority chief executive Lisa Pinney.\nThe Coal Authority, which manages the effects of past mining on communities, said it believed the \"blow out\" was likely to have been caused by a blockage underground which caused water to back up before breaking out.\nCouncil leader Rob Jones warned residents it was unlikely that they could return home by Monday.\nMs Pinney said a hand-drilling crew \"determined the precise location and extension of the collapsed mine shaft\" on Saturday. \n\"This now allows us to bring in larger equipment to investigate the wider mine workings and drainage channels in the area around it, so we can understand in detail what has caused the blow out,\" she said.\n\"We have checked all recorded shafts in the immediate area and found them all to be safe. \n\"We will be checking over a wider area in the days ahead.\"\nDuring his visit to the village Mr Drakeford was shown the sinkhole which had opened up on Thursday, leading to the flooding.\nOn Friday the Welsh Government confirmed financial support would be made available to people affected by the floods, up to \u00a31,000 per household.\nMr Drakeford said on Sunday: \"Particularly for families who have no insurance, this is a devastating event.\n\"They will know that the Welsh Government is there to help and we will do that through the local authority which has been here very visibly, helping people in the last couple of days.\""

      "tags": "Home Office,Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government,Travellers",
      "text": "There is a \"shocking\" lack of places for traveller families to live in England, according to a charity.\nOnly 18 out of 251 registered traveller sites have any spaces available, research from Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT) suggests. \nIt says the government must \"do more\" to identify land for the community to live on. \nThe government says councils are \"best placed\" to assess the local need for permanent traveller sites.\nIn October, FFT wrote to all local authorities and private registered site providers in England to ask how many pitches they had available. \nIt received responses relating to 251 out of 266 traveller sites - which represented 3,482 permanent pitches and 304 transit pitches. \nA transit pitch is a short-term place where people can stay for a set period of usually up to three months. \nThe research found:\nBethany Rose, 26, and her two children have been on a waiting list for a pitch in West Sussex for more than a year.\nShe is currently staying with her parents in their caravan on a registered traveller site. But this is against the rules of their tenancy contract and she will have to move out once the coronavirus pandemic is over.\nBethany has a health condition which means she can often be paralysed from the waist down and she needs to be close to her mum who is her carer.\n\"It's frustrating, annoying, aggravating, I feel let down,\" she says. \"I'm disabled. I'm homeless and I have two kids. \n\"For anyone normally it would just be like, 'Boof, there you go, there's a property, go and live there'. But I can't do that. I can't even get a house, I can't buy a plot of land, I can't do anything.\"\nIt's estimated about 1.1 million households are on local authority housing waiting lists, but Bethany believes it would be easier for her to get a home if she wasn't a traveller. \nShe says being a traveller is a huge part of her identity and she wants to live on a site so she can continue to be connected to her heritage.\n\"A whole community is there if you need something or something happens,\" she said. \"If you fall or you go to hospital, you can guarantee your neighbour will watch the kids until you come back. If you need a cup of sugar, you can just go round.\"\nThe research from FFT comes as MPs were due to debate a petition on Monday against government proposals to criminalise trespassing. However, this has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. \nThe new measures could see travellers facing a fine or prison if they set up unauthorised encampments - currently it's a civil offence.\nIn a consultation paper published in 2019, the Home Office said there had been \"long-standing concerns\" about the distress they caused to local communities.\nIn June 2020, residents in Dorset complained about mess left by travellers on a local park - which included a car being abandoned in the middle of a cricket pitch, rubbish dumped in green spaces and human waste deposited in the pond and lake.\nFFT says councils are failing to provide enough sites for travellers to live on.\nIn January 2019, plans to spend \u00a35m on new traveller pitches in Milton Keynes were put on hold after a \"heated\" meeting with local residents.\nBethany believes councils are not doing more to provide extra sites because of discrimination towards travellers.\n\"They're building 50,000 new houses in West Sussex, not one of those places is having a site,\" she said. \"So you've got the Nimby (Not In My Back Yard) culture attached to that. \n\"For every 50 houses, they could put a site of five which is a whole little community that they can get used to and go, 'Yeah, OK, they're not as bad as people say.' \n\"That also means we're not pulling up the side of the roads. We're not being moved off. We're just trying to live like everyone else.\"\nWest Sussex County Council says when a vacancy comes up on a permanent site all those who have expressed an interest in that location are considered for the pitch.\nThe FFT wants the government to reintroduce pitch targets and a statutory duty on local authorities to meet the assessed need for Gypsy and traveller sites.\nIt also calls on the government to abandon its proposal to criminalise trespassing.\nSarah Sweeney, policy and communications manager at FFT, said: \"It is deeply unfair that while the government is dramatically failing to identify enough land for Gypsy and traveller families to live on, the home secretary is working to create laws to imprison, fine and remove the homes of families living on roadside camps for the 'crime' of having nowhere else to go.\"\nThe Local Government Association says it wants the government to publish \"better data\" on the scale of unauthorised encampments and the availability of authorised sites to help councils in England meet their planning obligations.\nA spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \"Unauthorised encampments cause distress and disruption for many people across the country so it's right we are giving the police the powers they need to address this issue.\n\"Councils are best placed to assess the local need for permanent traveller sites and decide where they should be, and can apply for funding through our Shared Ownership and Affordable Homes Programme to help build them.\""

      "tags": "Coedely,Cwm Taf maternity investigation,Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board,Pregnancy",
      "text": "A major independent review gave a damning verdict on maternity services in Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board.\nIt followed concerns that emerged in late 2018 that women and babies may have come to harm because of staff shortages and failures to report serious incidents.\nThe review by experts from two royal colleges was in addition to the health board's own investigation. Maternity services in Cwm Taf are now in special measures and an independent panel was set up to drive improvements.\nHow many incidents are we talking about?\nThe health board's own investigation looked at 43 cases, including 25 serious incidents. Of these initial cases, 20 were at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and 23 at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. The serious incidents include eight stillbirths and five deaths shortly after birth, all between January 2016 and last September. \nThey came to light after concerns were raised that staff had not been reporting serious incidents. \nThe health board said it faced \"extreme\" staff shortages and was urgently trying to make improvements.\nBut the review team cast doubt on the ability of the health board to make changes, without more support. It said it was \"dismayed\" that an internal report, written by a consultant midwife, highlighting many safety concerns last September was not acted upon, \"thereby continuing to expose women to unacceptable risks\". \nA consultant midwife also identified 67 stillbirths, going back to 2010, which had not been reported by the health board. \nThe independent panel decided to widen its scope to look at 350 cases of women who were transferred out of the health board area.\nIn October 2019, the panel said it was looking at a total of 150 cases between 2016 and 2018 - including the 43 cases initially investigated. There is still scope to look back at further years.\nWho has been investigating?\nThe health minister Vaughan Gething ordered an \"independent external review\" by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology and the Royal College of Midwives last October. \nIts findings, published in April 2019, were damning and found services \"under extreme pressure\" and \"dysfunctional\", while mothers had distressing experiences in how they were treated. \nCwm Taf's maternity services were placed in special measures and the independent panel overseeing changes has indicated as well as looking back in detail at past cases it wanted to ensure improvements were robust and to look at lessons that could be learned across Wales.\nHave any changes been made?\nThe royal colleges review team ordered urgent action after visiting hospitals in January 2019 - finding \"a number of immediate quality and safety concerns\".  \nMeasures included more cover by doctors, strengthened processes for flagging up problems and more support for junior doctors. Cwm Taf now says these have all been completed. \nMeanwhile, a separate unplanned visit by health inspectors found \"significant\" maternity staff shortages. \nThe latest progress report from the independent panel in January 2020 found the most urgent improvements had been made.\nStaffing levels and training had improved, there was a better system for flagging up complaints and surveys found \"high levels of satisfaction\" from women using Prince Charles Hospital.\nThe panel was \"cautiously optimistic\" that long term improvements would be made.\nWhat about parents?\nThe review's parallel report on how families were dealt with was perhaps the most powerful testimony on the problems at Cwm Taf.\nMothers were said to have been ignored or made to feel worthless.\nThey spoke of being ignored or patronised.\nOne mother said: \"I want having a baby to be a good experience. It's ruined it.\"\nThere was the case of Sarah Handy, who was sent home from hospital in pain with laxatives, before giving birth prematurely at home. Her daughter died. \nChioma Udeogu's daughter was delivered stillborn after failings in her care at the Royal Glamorgan hospital in January 2017. An internal investigation has already found midwives failed for 12 hours to carry out antenatal checks on Mrs Udeogu, an engineering student at the University of South Wales at the time. \n\"I believe that if I was properly monitored in the hospital I wouldn't have lost her,\" she said.\nJessica Western, from Rhoose, in the Vale of Glamorgan, said she was not listened to when she could not feel her baby move in the month before the birth.\nHer daughter Macie died in March 2018, 19 days after she was born.\n\"I'm only young and I do want to have more kids eventually, but I'm not prepared to put myself through a pregnancy if this could happen again,\" she said.\nAnother, Monique Aziz, from Coedely, Rhondda Cynon Taff, whose baby son died days after leaving hospital, said: \"I just want to know if he would have still been here if things had been done differently.\"\nWhat else has been happening?\nIn the background, there have been long planned changes in how maternity services are organised. \nFrom March 2019, doctor-led care for mothers in labour or for babies needing specialist neonatal care is now only provided on one site - Prince Charles Hospital. The Royal Glamorgan still has a 24-hour midwife unit for less complicated births and will continue to provide all antenatal services, clinic appointments, scans and tests during pregnancy. \nThe changes follow long-standing concerns that specialist maternity staff had been spread too thinly. The health board says those changes will help address challenges, including over staffing.\nAfter the critical report, the health board's chief executive went on sickness leave and then resigned in August 2019.\nStress and sickness absence was reported to be an issue among midwives, in the aftermath of the review.\nHow far back to those concerns go?\nThe fragility of maternity services in the area can be traced back for at least a decade. In a review in 2011 the Wales Audit Office raised concerns about staffing, skill mix and absences and the health board's ability to deliver maternity services on two sites.\nConcerns about the quality of maternity care were also at the heart of a controversial plan in 2014 to centralise some specialist services in fewer hospitals along the M4 corridor.  It recommended moving doctor-led care for mothers and children (along with A&E) from the Royal Glamorgan hospital.   \nCwm Taf health board initially rejected the plan and several months of wrangling followed.\nFour years later, the proposals on maternity services are only now being finally implemented. \nWhat is the independent panel doing?\nThe chairman Mick Giannasi - who has a track record going into troubled organisations, like Anglesey Council and the Welsh Ambulance Service - brings clinical expertise. He is also setting up a system so families can be involved and kept fully informed.\nHis brief is to:\nIn the first progress report in October 2019, the panel said there had been progress - around a third of the action points in the improvement plan had been delivered - but a \"significant amount of work\" still needed to be done. \nThere had been \"significant\" progress by January 2020 although with more than two thirds of recommendations it was still \"work in progress\"."

      "tags": "Communications satellites,Earth observation,SpaceX,Florida,Space exploration,United States",
      "text": "A new world record has been set for the number of satellites sent to space on a single rocket.\nThe 143 payloads, of all shapes and sizes, rode to orbit on a SpaceX Falcon rocket that launched out of Florida.\nThe number beats the previous record of 104 satellites carried aloft by an Indian vehicle in 2017.\nIt's further evidence of the major structural changes taking place in space activity that are allowing many more actors to get involved.\nThis shift is the result of a revolution in robust, miniaturised, low-cost components - many taken direct from consumer electronics such as smartphones - that mean pretty much anyone can now build a capable satellite in a very small package.\nAnd with SpaceX offering to transport those packages to orbit for just $1m, the commercial opportunities will continue to open up.\nSpaceX itself had 10 satellites on the Falcon - the latest additions to its Starlink telecommunications mega-constellation, which is going to deliver broadband internet connections around the globe.\nSan Francisco's Planet company had the most satellites of all on the flight - 48. \nThese were another batch of its SuperDove models that image the Earth's surface daily at a resolution of 3-5m. The new spacecraft take the firm's operational fleet now in orbit to more than 200.\nThe SuperDoves are the size of a shoebox. Many of the other payloads on the Falcon rocket were little bigger than a coffee mug, however; and some were smaller even than a paperback book.\nSwarm Technologies is rolling out what it calls the SpaceBees. They're just 10cm by 10cm by 2.5cm.\nThey'll act as telecommunications nodes to connect devices that are attached to all manner of objects on the ground, from migrating animals to shipping containers. \nSome of the larger items on the Falcon rocket were suitcase-sized. Among these were several radar satellites. Radar has been one of the major beneficiaries of the revolution in componentry.\nTraditionally, radar satellites were big, multi-tonne objects that cost hundreds of millions of dollars to fly, which essentially meant only the military or major space agencies could afford to operate them.\nBut the adoption of new materials and compact \"off the shelf\" parts have dramatically shrunk the size (to under 100kg) and price (a couple of million dollars) of these spacecraft.\nIceye from Finland, Capella from the US, and iQPS of Japan all took the ride to orbit on Sunday. These start-ups are establishing constellations in the sky that will return rapid, repeat imagery of the Earth. \nRadar has the advantage over standard optical cameras of being able to pierce cloud, and to sense the Earth's surface whether it is day or night. We're entering an age when any change on the planet, wherever it happens, will be picked up almost immediately.\nThe Falcon carried the 143 satellites into a 500km-high path that runs from pole to pole. This is one of the drawbacks of a big rideshare mission: you go where the rocket goes, and for some that might not be ideal. \nA number of satellite missions will want an orbit that's higher or lower in the sky, or on a different inclination to the equator.\nThis can be achieved by mounting the satellites on \"space tugs\" which, after coming off the top of the rocket, modify the final parameters for their \"passengers\" over the course of several weeks. Sunday's Falcon carried two such tugs.\nBut for some missions a bespoke ride is going to be the only satisfactory solution. It's why we're now witnessing a rush to produce small rockets that can run dedicated flights.\nThese smaller rockets will not be able to compete on cost with the big vehicles, such as SpaceX's Falcon-9, but they should attract the custom of those with very specific or urgent needs.\nDan Hart, the CEO of Virgin Orbit, which has developed a small rocket that can be launched from under the wing of a Boeing 747, says the start-ups are becoming more discerning.\n\"These small satellites used to be points of fascination and interest, and it was a case of finding the cheapest way possible to get into space,\" he explained. \n\"That's rapidly changing. These are now businesses with critical missions that risk losing revenue if they have to wait on others or go into an unsuitable orbit. And that's why you're going to see people who will pay that little bit more to get to where they want to go when they absolutely need to go there,\" he told BBC News.\nWith the roll call of satellites going into orbit now accelerating rapidly, the issue of traffic management is becoming a hot topic.\nFull-on collisions are currently rare, but a surprisingly large number (10%) of satellites will even now experience sudden, unexpected momentum changes, most probably the result of being hit by some small fragment from a previous mission.\nThe space sector needs to find smarter ways to track objects in orbit and to command timely avoidance manoeuvres, otherwise certain altitudes could ultimately become unusable because of the presence of dangerously dense debris fields. \nJonathan McDowell from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics is a noted historian of astronautics. \nHe commented: \"There are now over 3,000 working satellites in orbit. The number of satellites launched last year at over 1,200 is over twice as many as in any previous year. And the ones launched today - that used to be the number you'd launch in a whole year. So it's getting really crowded up there.\"\nWill Marshall, the CEO of Planet, said his company, and indeed all of the companies on Sunday's flight, were accutley aware of the issue. \n\"We are seeing crowded areas in certain orbits,\" he told BBC News. \n\"Most of the crowded piece that is in danger of what they call Kessler Syndrome (runaway collisions) is quite high up. So one of the tricks that all of these satellites that were launched today use is to just stay really low where there's still a lot of atmospheric drag and eventually those satellites just come down.\""

      "tags": "China,Taiwan",
      "text": "Taiwan has reported a \"large incursion\" by Chinese warplanes for the second day running, a show of force that coincides with the first days of US President Joe Biden's term of office.\nSunday's operation involved 15 aircraft and followed a similar drill that led to a warning from Washington.\nChina sees democratic Taiwan as a breakaway province, but Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state.\nAnalysts say China is testing the level of support of Mr Biden for Taiwan.\nIn the US's first public remarks on Taiwan since Mr Biden came into power, the US State Department reaffirmed its \"rock-solid commitment\" to helping it defend itself.   \nChina has carried out regular flights over the international waters between the southern part of Taiwan and the Taiwanese-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea in recent months.\nBut they are usually conducted by one to three reconnaissance or anti-submarine warfare aircraft, according to Taiwan.\nTaiwan's defence ministry said eight Chinese bomber planes capable of carrying nuclear weapons, four fighter jets and one anti-submarine aircraft entered its self-declared south-western air defence identification zone on Saturday.\nSunday's operation involved 12 fighters, two anti-submarine aircraft and a reconnaissance plane, the ministry said. On both occasions, Taiwan's air force warned away the aircraft and deployed air defence missile systems to monitor the planes. \nThe drills come days after the inauguration of President Biden, who is expected to maintain pressure on China over a wide range of issues including human rights, trade disputes, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which has been a major thorn in the deteriorating relationship between the two powers.\nThe Trump administration established closer ties with Taipei, ramping up arms sales and sending senior officials to the territory despite fierce warnings from China. Days before he left office, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lifted long-standing restrictions on contacts between American and Taiwanese officials.\nOn Monday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said US military activities in the region were not good for peace.\n\"The United States frequently sends aircraft and vessels into the South China Sea to flex its muscles,\" he told reporters. \"This is not conducive to peace and stability in the region.\"\nHe condemned a US aircraft carrier group sailing into the South China Sea on Saturday as \"a show of force\". The US says it is a \"freedom of navigation\" exercise.\nThe substance of the new US administration's policies on China and Taiwan remains to be seen but, in response to Saturday's operation, state department spokesman Ned Price said the US would continue to deepen its ties with the island.\n\"The United States notes with concern the pattern of ongoing PRC attempts to intimidate its neighbours, including Taiwan,\" he said in a statement, in reference to the People's Republic of China.\n\"We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected representatives.\"\nLast week, the island's de-facto ambassador to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, was invited to attend Mr Biden's inauguration, in what was seen as another sign of the new administration's support for Taiwan.\nLo Chih-cheng, a senior lawmaker for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said China's moves were an attempt to deter the new US government from backing the island. \"It's sending a message to the Biden administration,\" he told the Reuters news agency.\nBy Cindy Sui, BBC News, Taipei\nChina refrained from flying into Taiwan's south-west air defence identification zone for years, even though it had the right to do so - such zones are not recognised in international law. So the Taiwanese government calls China's flyovers \"incursions\", but technically they are not. \nAnalysts believe China wants to show dissatisfaction towards what it sees as former US President Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen changing the status quo over the past four years. \nJust because there's now a change in US president, doesn't mean Beijing will stop asserting what it has long seen as its right to fly in its own backyard. It also wants to warn President Tsai against taking further steps towards formal independence.\nPerhaps more importantly, Beijing wants to send a strong message early on in Joe Biden's presidency that the Taiwan issue is dangerous and remind him not to play with fire by emboldening Ms Tsai, as the Trump administration did. \nInstead it's hoping Mr Biden will mitigate the risk by scaling down support for Taiwan, or at least sending a message to Taipei not to be a troublemaker. Regardless of the reason, it may be hard to convince Beijing to return to the gentler old days.\nChina and Taiwan have had separate governments since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing has long tried to limit Taiwan's international activities and both have vied for influence in the Pacific region.\nTensions have increased in recent years and Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to take the island back.\nAlthough Taiwan is officially recognised by only a handful of nations, its democratically elected government has strong commercial and informal links with many countries.\nLike most nations, the US has no official diplomatic ties with Taipei, but a US law does require it to provide the island with the means to defend itself."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "Fraud has reached epidemic levels in the UK and should be seen as a national security issue, says think tank the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).\nThe scale of credit card, identity and cyber-fraud makes it the most prevalent crime, costing up to \u00a3190bn a year. \nUK intelligence agencies should play a greater role in responding, the RUSI argues in a report.\nPolicing should be better resourced, working more closely with the private sector, it adds.\nThe report argues that the scale of fraud against the private sector has an impact on the reputation of the UK as a place to do business.\nMeanwhile, the amount lost by the government in fraudulent claims represents a \"heist\" on the public purse, undermining faith and trust, it says.\nIt is the crime UK citizens are most likely to fall victim to, but the failures in responding risk undermining public confidence in the rule of law.\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales found 3.7 million reported incidents in 2019-20 of members of the public being targeted by credit card, identity and cyber-fraud.\nThe private sector takes the biggest financial losses. One estimate from 2017 put the cost of fraud to businesses at \u00a3140bn.\nFraud against the public sector, including benefit, tax credit and student loan fraud, is estimated to cost \u00a331-48bn a year, the upper figure larger than the UK's annual defence budget.\nThe losses go beyond the financial, the authors say. \n\"Fraud has the potential to disrupt society in multiple ways, by psychologically impacting individuals, undermining the viability of businesses, putting pressure on public services, fuelling organised crime and funding terrorism,\" they add.\nThe report cites evidence that terrorist groups and lone actors turn to fraud in order to finance their activities.\nIn one case, eight supporters of the Islamic State group were convicted of defrauding UK pensioners out of more than \u00a31m, which was alleged to be used in part to fund travel from the UK to Syria. \nThe men carried out a type of courier fraud in which they pretended to be police officers, telling victims that their bank accounts had been compromised and needed to be transferred.\nBut despite the growing scale of the problem, there is no national strategy for tackling the issue, while the police response is underfunded and lacking focus.\nThis makes fraud \"everyone's problem but no-one's priority\", according to the report, written by RUSI experts Helena Wood, Tom Keatinge, Keith Ditcham and Ardi Janjev.\nThe digitisation of everyday life - accelerated by Covid - has only increased the risks, with organised crime groups showing increased sophistication in their tactics.\n\"The UK has become a target destination for global fraudsters,\" the RUSI argues. \nBut the extent to which international criminals focus on the UK is hard to gauge, because intelligence agencies have not traditionally focused on the issue. \nOne senior fraud professional interviewed by the researchers said that despite 30 years of investigating fraud, they still had no idea what proportion of the threat emanated from overseas.\nClassifying fraud as a national security issue would help ensure the right level of resourcing and prioritisation, the authors argue. \nThey also recommend more focused intelligence direction from the National Security Council, including greater tasking for GCHQ as well as the National Crime Agency to understand the issue. \nThey call for better information-sharing and use of data analytics, as well as more money and attention from police forces to address what they call a \"responsibility vacuum\"."

      "text": "Vaccination appointments for people aged 70-79 are being delivered from Monday - but plans to use distinctive blue envelopes in some parts of the country have been delayed. \nThe aim is to have this group receive their first dose by mid-February.\nOn Sunday morning, the Scottish government said some letters would be sent out in blue envelopes and given Royal Mail priority. \nBut in a statement published later it said the envelopes were not yet ready.\nIt added that the change has no impact on the vaccination programme timetable.\nVaccinations for over-80s are continuing, with Nicola Sturgeon revealing on Sunday that about 40% of this age group had received a first dose of the vaccine.\nAll appointments will initially be sent out in white envelopes which will have a window and a black NHS logo on the right hand side. \nThe blue envelopes were due to be sent out in Fife, Forth Valley, Ayrshire and Arran, Lanarkshire, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Lothian as part of a new booking system. \nUnder the system, patients are scheduled in order of priority and more boards are expected to make use of the technology as the vaccination programme expands. \nA Scottish government spokesman said the blue envelopes would be introduced \"as quickly as possible\". \nHe added: \"The blue envelopes we hoped to use were not ready in time for the first tranche of vaccine appointment invitations so distinctive NHS branded white envelopes are being used as a temporary measure.\n\"The absolute priority remains the roll-out of vaccinations and this temporary change to the envelope colour has absolutely no impact to our timetable.\n\"We continue to strongly urge everyone in the 70-79 age group to check all their post in the coming weeks and take up the offer of the vaccine when it is received,\" he added. \nAccording to the Scottish government's vaccine deployment plan, the 470,000 people aged in the 70 and 79 age bracket should receive their first dose by mid-February.\nSome patients may receive a phone call from their local health board as part of the appointment process. \nAnd all patients aged 75 to 79 in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde will be invited via phone. \nA Royal Mail spokesman said \"clearly marked envelopes\" would be used to make it easier for the postal service to identify and prioritise this mail during sorting and delivery process. \nHe added: \"We are poised to make these letters even more noticeable in the coming weeks as we have agreed.\"\nMeanwhile, the Scottish government has said it is on track for all those aged 80 and over to have received their first dose of the vaccine by the end of the first week in February.\nThis age group are being contacted by telephone or another form of letter.\nMinisters have faced criticism over the pace of the vaccine rollout, and accusations that Scotland is \"lagging behind\" England on the vaccine roll-out. \nOpposition parties say vaccines are not being supplied to GPs' surgeries fast enough. \nAnd they point to the latest official figures which show that 13% of over 80s in Scotland had their first dose by Sunday 17 January, while 56.3% of same age group had been vaccinated in England. \nMs Sturgeon told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that, a week on, the figure had reached about 40%. \nThe UK government Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Andrew Marr on Sunday that 75% of over-80s and three-quarters of UK care homes had received a first Covid vaccine in England. \nAbout 95% of Scottish care home residents have received their first dose, Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish government briefing on Friday. \nShe said the over-80s roll-out has been slower because the Scottish government has \"very deliberately\" concentrated on vaccinating care home residents first, which is \"more time consuming and labour intensive\".\nThis was designed to target the most vulnerable and was in line with the priority list compiled by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises on vaccine rollout across the UK, she said.\nScotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch has defended the plan, which has been challenged by the British Medical Association (BMA) for not getting second doses out quickly enough.\nProf Leitch told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"The difficulty with the BMA's position is that we would have to de-prioritise another group, either care home residents or the over-80s, in order to give a second dose to younger people.\n\"And that's what the Joint Committee on Vaccination have told us not to do.\n\"They have told us in very clear terms - give the first dose to as many vulnerable people as you can and that gives us the best chance of saving the most lives.\"\nMeanwhile, Deputy First Minister John Swinney told Politics Scotland that the Scottish government was \"actively exploring\" the possibility of stricter rules around facemasks. \nHe said the issue was being \"looked at\" after new rules announced in Germany last week required people to wear medical-grade facemasks on public transport and in shops. \nMr Swinney said progress was being made in reducing cases but hospitals were still under \"enormous pressure\" and it would be \"foolish\" to rule out strengthening restrictions further in the future.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,United States,Coronavirus pandemic,Joe Biden",
      "text": "After criticism that his original goal was not bold enough, US President Joe Biden has said he expects the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day.\nHe had announced last week that 1m vaccines would be administered daily in the first 100 days of his presidency.\nBut some media noted the US had already nearly reached that target under the Trump administration.\nMr Biden also renewed Trump-era Covid bans on Monday, adding South Africa.\nIn the first time formally taking reporters' questions during his presidency, Mr Biden said on Monday that he hoped they would be able to get to 1.5 million vaccinations administered daily.\n\"I think with the grace of God... we'll be able to get that to 1.5 million a day,\" the Democrat said.\nHe added: \"I hope we'll be able to increase as we go along so we'll get to 1.5 million. That's my hope.\"\nSome media had questioned whether the new president's target of one million shots per day was ambitious enough. \nLast week, at the tail-end of the Trump administration, the US had already reached an average of around 980,000 vaccine doses administered daily.\nWhen an Associated Press news agency reporter asked last Thursday why Mr Biden had not aimed higher, he shot back: \"You all said it's not possible. Come on, give me a break man.\" \nBut CNN rated the president's claim about the media as false.\nDuring Monday's press conference, a reporter suggested to Mr Biden that he had changed his tone on defeating the public health crisis, pointing out that as a candidate he had vowed to \"shut down\" Covid-19, only to say last week: \"There's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months.\"\nMr Biden replied: \"What I meant was it took a long time to get here and it's going to take a long time to beat it.\"\n\"I'm confident we will beat this virus,\" he added, \"but we're still going to be talking about it in the summer and dealing with it in the fall.\"\nThe Biden administration on Monday renewed Trump-era Covid-19 travel bans on non-US visitors from Brazil and most of Europe, including the UK and Ireland.\nThe White House also imposed a new ban on South Africa over its virus variant.\nFormer President Donald Trump had ordered the bans to end on 26 January as one of his final acts in office.\nThe new travel restrictions came as Minnesota recorded the first US case of the Brazil variant from a resident who had recently travelled to that country.\n\"This case marks the first documented instance of the Brazil P.1 variant in the United States,\" said the Minnesota Department of Health on Monday.\nThe unnamed patient lives in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area, said the department.\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the decision to continue the restrictions on foreign travellers on Monday. \nShe told reporters: \"With the pandemic worsening and more contagious variants spreading, this isn't the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel.\"\nAll international travellers must also present a negative test within three days of air travel to the US.\nTravel restrictions have been in place since mid-March. \nWhen Mr Trump ordered a ban on flights from China in February, citing the \"Chinese virus\", Mr Biden railed against Mr Trump's \"hysterical xenophobia\". At the time, the Biden campaign denied the remark was about Mr Trump's travel ban.\nMs Psaki was asked on Monday about Mr Biden's stance in light of the \"xenophobic\" remark. She said: \"He was critical of the former president for having a policy that was not more comprehensive than travel restrictions and he conveyed at the time - and more recently - the importance of having a multi-faceted approach.\"\nThe US has had more than double the cases of the next highest country, India. There have been over 420,000 deaths - nearly twice as many as Brazil, the second highest - and above 25 million cases.\nNew York City - the most populous urban area in the country - has postponed plans for three mass vaccination sites due to a low supply of vaccine doses.\nCity authorities were co-ordinating plans to turn two baseball stadiums as well as an outlet mall into inoculation hubs, but vaccine supply has not kept up with demand.\nAlso on Monday, California lifted a stay-at-home order imposed in December as officials said projections for hospital intensive care capacity had improved. The Golden State has been hard hit by a post-holiday surge that stretched hospitals to their limits.\nGovernor Gavin Newsom is facing intense criticism over his refusal to share the data used by his administration to drive Covid policy decisions. State health officials said the metric is complicated, and would only confuse the public if released.\nThe stay-at-home order had been in place for Southern California, the San Joaquin Valley and the Bay Area, which are home to over 90% of the state's residents.\nThe region is still under restrictions, however - non-essential businesses are still to remain closed and restaurants must serve outdoors only.\nThe Biden administration is proposing another economic rescue package, this one worth $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn).\nHowever, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday he was against \"an imprecise deluge of borrowed money that would direct huge sums toward those who don't need it\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The prime minister says it is too soon to say whether lockdown will be lifted in the spring.\nBut with the most vulnerable to be offered vaccination by mid-February, what is standing in the way?\nLockdown looks to be having an impact on infection levels with the number of new cases starting to fall.\nBut there are only tentative signs this has filtered through to a slowing of new admissions to hospital.\nAnd even if they start coming down, the overall number of patients in hospital will remain high as patients are being discharged at a much slower rate than they are coming in.\nChris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, predicts hospitals will remain under the current \"intense pressure\" perhaps until the end of February.\nWith no headroom in the NHS, ministers will be cautious about lifting many of the restrictions, especially with the threat of the new faster-spreading variant.\nThere are no guarantees the government will meet the mid-February target.\nThe UK has certainly made a good start. Per head of population, only Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have vaccinated more.\nOver the past week more than two million people have received their first dose. \nThat puts the government on track for achieving its aim of offering a vaccine to everyone over 70, the extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care workers. \nBut the supply chain remains fragile. Pfizer has announced a slowdown in manufacturing for the next couple of weeks so it can upgrade its facilities and ramp up production in the spring.\nThe UK is less reliant on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine than other countries, as we manufacture the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine here.\nThere are millions of doses already made but not all of it has been through the final packaging process or safety checks.\nEnsuring this happens will be crucial to allowing the NHS to keep its foot on the accelerator, especially as the vaccination clinics will have to start factoring in giving second doses from late February onwards.\nThose close to the programme say it will be \"touch and go\" especially if extra supplies of the Pfizer vaccine do not come back on stream as quick as the company is saying they will.\nEven if the supply is good, there will still be lots of vulnerable people.\nNearly 90% of Covid deaths have been in the groups due to get the jab by mid-February.\nBut no vaccine is 100% effective and uptake will not be 100%.\nWhat is more there will still be many vulnerable people in the over-60s age group.\nAs we get further into spring, everyone over the age of 50, as well as younger adults with health conditions, will be offered a vaccine. \nBut even that may not be enough, according to some.\nModelling by the University of Warwick suggests that, even with 85% uptake, a complete lifting of restrictions in April could lead to very high levels of deaths.\n\"Vaccines are not a panacea,\" says Prof Matt Keeling, who led the research.\nAnd for younger age groups, who are at little risk of dying from the virus, there is still the risk of long-Covid, he says. \nAlthough he acknowledges there is still little hard data to quantify this, some studies have suggested one in 10 suffers long-lasting symptoms from infection.\nThe factor that could have a significant impact on spread is whether vaccination stops transmission. \nThe trials showed the vaccines were good at stopping symptoms developing.\nBut it is not yet known whether those who have been vaccinated will still be able to pass the virus on.\nMost people expect there will be some disruption to transmission but how much is not clear - and will not be for months.\nBut on the other side of all this is the huge impact lockdown has. \nThe first priority will, of course, be the re-opening of schools. \nRussell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, says everything must be done to make this happen.\nHe says while schools contributed to spread of the virus, they were not a \"significant driver\", adding schools were closed for the \"benefit of the population\" but at great expense to children.\nOnce schools are open some tough calls will have to be made - and this is where the debate is going to rage.\nBackbench Tory MPs are putting the pressure on the prime minister with the Covid Recovery Group calling for a \"gradually unwrapping\" of society from early March.\nIn the end, it is going to come down to what society is willing to tolerate.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has spoken about \"de-risking\" Covid.\nHis point is that we will reach a situation at which the level of death and illness caused by Covid is at a level society can \"tolerate\" - just as we tolerate 7,000 to 20,000 people dying from flu every year.\nSociologist Prof Robert Dingwall, who advises the government on the science of human behaviour, believes that point will be reached sooner rather than later.\n\"I think we will see a pretty rapid lifting of restrictions in the spring and summer. \n\"There are some sections of the science community that want to pursue an elimination strategy - but once you start seeing fatality levels down at the level of flu I think the public will accept that.\""

      "text": "The combined wealth of the world's 10 richest men rose by $540bn (\u00a3400bn) during the pandemic, according to Oxfam. \nThe charity claims this amount would be enough to prevent the world from falling into poverty because of the virus, and pay for vaccines for all. \nThe organisation is urging governments to consider taxes on the super-rich.\nOxfam's report comes as global leaders gather virtually for the World Economic Forum's \"Davos Dialogue\" meeting.\nIn December 2020, the total wealth of billionaires worldwide hit $11.95tn - equivalent to the recovery spending of all the G20 governments put together, according to the charity.\nThe 10 richest people, whose fortunes rose by $540bn since March 2020, include Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla founder Elon Musk and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\nOxfam claims that the billionaires' fortunes rose due to rebounding stock markets and a \"rigged economy\", causing rising inequality during the \"worst economic downturn in a century\". \nMany tech giants saw sales - and share prices - rise in 2020, as lockdowns led to a jump in demand for digital services. \nThis inflated the wealth of men like Mr Bezos, whose giant fortunes are driven by the value of holdings such as property and the shares they own, rather than wages.\nHowever, \"wealth\" does not equal income. Wealth estimates refer to the net worth of an individual, including their money, the value of their assets and also the \"notional\" value of the shares they hold. \nA rise in share prices pertains to the perceived net worth of a company as a whole, rather than the shareholders themselves. \nThe report said that Mr Bezos's worth had climbed so much between March-September 2020 that he could have given all 876,000 Amazon employees a $105,000 bonus and still have been as wealthy as he was before the pandemic.\nThis compares with the world's poorest, for whom economic recovery could take more than a decade. Oxfam estimates that between 200 million and 500 million more people were living in poverty in 2020, reversing the decline in global poverty seen over the last two decades.\n\"We think that this is... an opportunity to do something radical about building back fairer to think about wealth taxes, to think about corporation taxes, to think about increasing the basic social floor for every citizen,\" Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam's chief executive told the BBC.\nWith reference to the UK, he said imposing a tax could raise millions.  \nYes - some are. There have been a relatively high number of charitable mega-donations since the pandemic began, with celebrities, sports stars and business leaders responding to the Covid-19 emergency.\nIn an October report, UBS said 209 billionaires had committed a total equivalent to $7.2bn from March to June 2020 to fight Covid-19.\n\"They have reacted quickly, in a way that's akin to disaster relief, providing unrestricted grants to allow grantees to decide how best to use funds,\" the report added.\nLast month, MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, revealed she had donated more than $4bn to food banks and emergency relief funds in four months.\nIn a blog post, Ms Scott said she wanted to help Americans who were struggling because of the pandemic. \nAs of June last year, Mr Bezos was said to have donated $125m to the coronavirus effort.\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced in April that he was moving $1bn of his assets into a fund to support pandemic relief efforts and other causes. This represents about a quarter of his $3.9bn net worth.\nHarry Potter author JK Rowling has donated \u00a31m to help homeless people and those affected by domestic abuse during the pandemic.\nMeanwhile, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, says it has committed a total of $1.75bn to the global Covid-19 response, including for the development and delivery of vaccines and tests. \nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is also the third-largest donor to the World Health Organization."

      "tags": "Patrick Vallance,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scientists say signs a new coronavirus variant is more deadly than the earlier version should not be a \"game changer\" in the UK's response to the pandemic.\nBoris Johnson has said there is \"some evidence\" the variant may be associated with \"a higher degree of mortality\".\nBut the co-author of the study the PM was referring to said the variant's deadliness remained an \"open question\".\nAnother adviser said he was surprised Mr Johnson had shared the findings when the data was \"not particularly strong\".\nA third top medic said it was \"too early\" to be \"absolutely clear\".\nAt a Downing Street coronavirus news conference on Friday, the prime minister said: \"In addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant - the variant that was first identified in London and the South East - may be associated with a higher degree of mortality.\"\nSpeaking alongside the PM, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said there was \"a lot of uncertainty around these numbers\" but that early evidence suggested the variant could be about 30% more deadly.\nFor example, Sir Patrick said if 1,000 men in their 60s were infected with the old variant, roughly 10 of them would be expected to die - but this rises to about 13 with the new variant.\nThe announcement followed a briefing by scientists on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) which concluded there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the variant was associated with an increased risk of death.\nBut one of the briefing's co-authors, Prof Graham Medley, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The question about whether it is more dangerous in terms of mortality I think is still open.\" \n\"In terms of making the situation worse it is not a game changer. It is a very bad thing that is slightly worse,\" added Prof Medley, who is a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \nAnother 1,348 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK on Saturday, in addition to 33,552 new infections, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.\nThere is huge uncertainty in the evidence on how lethal the variant is. \nThe scientific experts that reviewed the data used a precise phrase saying it was a \"realistic possibility\" the new variant is more deadly.\nThat means there's a roughly 50-50 chance it will turn out to be true.\nWith time, and sadly more deaths, the picture will become clearer. \nWhile people debate the uncertainties though, we already know this variant has the ability to kill more people than the old ones. \nA virus that spreads faster (this one is 30-70% faster) will infect more people, more quickly, putting a greater strain on hospitals and leading to a sharper spike in deaths. \nIt is why viruses becoming more transmissible can be a bigger problem than ones becoming more deadly.\nNervtag's chairman Prof Peter Horby defended the government's \"transparency\" in making the announcement.\n\"Scientists are looking at the possibility that there is increased severity... and after a week of looking at the data we came to the conclusion that it was a realistic possibility,\" he said.\n\"We need to be transparent about that. If we were not telling people about this we would be accused of covering it up.\"\nBut Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of Sage subgroup the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), agreed it was too early to draw \"strong conclusions\" as the suggested increased mortality rates were based on \"a relatively small amount of data\".\nHe told BBC Breakfast he was \"actually quite surprised\" Mr Johnson had made the early findings public rather than monitoring the data \"for a week or two more\".\n\"I just worry that where we report things pre-emptively where the data are not really particularly strong,\" Dr Tildesley added. \nPublic Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle also said it was not \"absolutely clear\" the new variant was more deadly than the original.\n\"There is some evidence, but it is very early evidence. It is small numbers of cases and it is far too early to say,\" she told the Today programme.\nMeanwhile, senior doctors are calling on England's chief medical officer to cut the gap between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe British Medical Association told Prof Chris Whitty an extension to the maximum gap between jab from three weeks to 12 weeks, to get the first dose to more people, was \"difficult to justify\"."

      "text": "Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is self-isolating for the third time, after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus. \nHe said he would be working from home until next Monday after being notified of the contact earlier. \nSir Keir confirmed on Twitter that he had no symptoms.\nThe Labour leader last self-isolated in December after a member of his staff tested positive for Covid-19, but he never showed any symptoms of the virus. \nHe also self-isolated in September after a member of his family showed symptoms - but they later tested negative, allowing Sir Keir to get back to Westminster.\nIf you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace and told you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus, you have a legal obligation to self-isolate. \nYou then have to stay at home, not going out for any reason, for 10 days from the time you last saw the contact. \nIf you don't stick to the rules, the police can issue you with a fine, starting at \u00a31,000. \nFor Sir Keir, he needs to stay indoors until next Monday and cancel all his upcoming plans for the week. \nHe will still be able to take part in Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday via video link.\nThe current list of MPs set to question Boris Johnson, shows that only one will now physically be in the Commons with the PM. \nA number of politicians have had to self-isolate during the pandemic, including the prime minister. \nThe latest was Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who got a notification from the NHS app to stay at home.\nHe had the virus last March, but said self-isolation was \"perhaps the most important part of all the social distancing\" and urged others to do the same if contacted.\nMr Hancock's isolation period was due to end on Sunday, so he is expected back in Whitehall this week."

      "text": "Media regulator Ofcom has decided not to take any action over Channel 4's use of a \"deepfaked\" video of the Queen.\nThe \"alternative Christmas message\" attracted 354 complaints about decency after it aired on Christmas Day.\nIt showed an AI-generated version of the Queen, who made jokes about the Royal Family and the prime minister, and danced on top of a table.\nBut after assessing things, Ofcom decided not to pursue the complaints about disrespecting the monarch.\n\"In our view, Channel 4 made clear that the images were deliberately manipulated as a device to question societal trust in what we see online,\" a spokeswoman for the regulator said.\n\"We also consider that the satirical tone of the film was in keeping with audience expectations of this  broadcaster,\" it added.\nThat decision is similar to Channel 4's own defence of the satire, in which it argued that the parody left viewers \"in no doubt that it was not real\".\nIt also argued the message of the video as a whole was a warning about the importance of trust, and how easily convincing fake images and video can be created - even uploading a behind-the-scenes video about its creation.\nAfter airing on national television in the UK, the video has spread widely online, racking up nearly two million views on YouTube alone.\nIt has not, however, been universally popular - on top of the formal complaints to Ofcom, it has a poor ratio of likes-to-dislikes on YouTube - with more than 19,000 likes, but nearly 5,000 dislikes.\nDeepfakes work by training a computer to draw a person's face by showing it thousands of photographs of that person, ideally from many different angles and in different lighting conditions.\nThe computer can then draw that person's face on top of another actor's performance. \nThe more varied and numerous the images used in training the model, the better the result - which is why it is almost universally used to fake the appearance of celebrities, who already have hours of available film or television footage available.\nBut there are other limitations on the technology, too.\nThe similarity in facial structure, size, and appearance of the actor whose face is being replaced affects the realism of the finished deepfake. It is also far easier to produce a convincing result if the person remains still, as movement can often reveal the artificial nature of the animation.\nThe voice must also be replaced by an impersonator and the entire process is incredibly demanding, even for high-end computers, often taking many days of computation.\nHowever, the technique is advancing rapidly, and the results are becoming more convincing with each passing year, with major film firms such as Disney actively exploring the technique and developing their own variants."

      "text": "\"Wholesale\" return of pupils to school after February half term is \"unlikely\", Wales' first minister has said. \nMark Drakeford said there were \"intermediate positions between where we are today, with very few children in school, and everybody being back\".\nPreviously, ministers said schools would stay closed to most until February half term unless Covid cases fell significantly. \nThose preparing for qualifications and very young children may return first.\nMr Drakeford told a coronavirus briefing on Friday he had recently chaired a meeting of the teaching unions and local education authorities.\n\"We all agreed that we would work purposefully together to find ways of bringing more young people back into the classroom,\" he said.\n\"Does that mean that we will see a wholesale return of every child in every classroom, every day of the week across Wales? I do think that that is probably unlikely.\n\"But there are intermediate positions between where we are today, with very few children in school, and everybody being back.\"\nHe said there had been \"practical, creative, imaginative\" proposals put forward which could mean some children being back in the classroom for some of the week.\nThese could include \"children preparing for qualifications [and] very young children for whom online learning really isn't a genuine possibility\".\n\"I certainly don't rule out making some of those things happen after the February half term, but I do think it's unlikely in the way you said that we would see every child back full-time in every classroom in the way that we would ideally wish to do,\" he added.\nAll schools and colleges moved to online learning before Christmas, following concerns from unions over the new coronavirus variant.\nThey have remained open for children of critical workers and vulnerable learners, as well as for learners who needed to complete essential exams or assessments.\nEarlier this month, when Education Minister Kirsty Williams said schools and colleges would stay closed to most pupils until the February half term, unions welcomed the news, saying the health and safety of pupils and staff \"had to be a priority\".\nBut, they added, teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools could begin.\nTeachers are still not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition.\nAt the time, Laura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said: \"Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus.\n\"Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want.\"\nOpposition parties have called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a \"digital divide\".\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: \"The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff.\"\nWelsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and said money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning."

      "text": "Two-thirds of women at the heart of a review into maternity services at a Welsh health board could have had very different outcomes if they had received better care, a report has found.\nThe Independent Maternity Services Oversight Panel (Imsop) focused on the experiences of pregnant women at Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board.\nIts maternity services have been in special measures since \"serious failings\" were found two years ago.\nThe health board noted the findings.\nConcerns emerged in late 2018 that women and babies may have come to harm because of staff shortages and failures to report serious incidents. \nThis sparked a major independent review, which gave a damning verdict on maternity services in the health board area that covers about 450,000 people living in Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend and Merthyr Tydfil.\nPublished on Monday, the Imsop report focuses on the care of 27 women, most of whom were admitted to an intensive care unit during 28 \"episodes of care\" between January 2016 and September 2018.\nIt found that 19 reviews of maternal care (68%) revealed at least one factor where \"different management would reasonably have been expected to alter the outcome\".\nThe panel's chairman, Mick Giannasi, said: \"These findings will be concerning and potentially distressing for the women and families involved, and it will be difficult for staff. \n\"Of the 28 episodes of care, we concluded that in 27 of them, our independent teams who reviewed the care would have done something differently. Put simply, what went wrong, might not have gone wrong if things had been done differently.\"\nTwo further reviews of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and morbidity will follow later this year. In total, all three independent reviews will looks at 160 cases.\nImsop's findings reinforce those of the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.\nThe royal colleges' 2019 investigation found mothers faced \"distressing experiences and poor care\" at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, with maternity services deemed \"dysfunctional\".\nFour key areas have been identified by Imsop as factors which contributed to poor care. These are:\nWales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the latest report recognises things are moving in the right direction for the health board, but more needs to be done.\n\"The report highlights that women weren't always at the centre of their care and that women weren't always listened to, and that led to harm that could have been avoided,\" Mr Gething told reporters at the latest Welsh Government press briefing.\n\"Nothing will be able to change what these women and their families experienced at these two hospitals or the outcome for those families whose babies died or came to harm. \n\"I am deeply sorry for everything that happened.\"\nHe said he hoped \"families can take some comfort\" from the reviews that have provided answers to questions they were asking.\n\"My thoughts are with everyone affected by this report today and those who are still awaiting the outcome of their reviews,\" Mr Gething added.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board said it has been \"working with the panel and families\" to put in place a \"comprehensive maternity and neonatal improvement programme\".\n\"It has been a period of reflection during which we have examined the regrettable failings in maternity services of the former Cwm Taf University Health Board and we acknowledge the fact that we still have some way to go,\" said Greg Dix, the health board's executive director of nursing and midwifery.\n\"We will never forget the tragedies suffered by women, their families and our staff, and the learning from these cases is a key corner stone on which we are building our improvement plans.\""

      "tags": "NHS,Cancer",
      "text": "A care home worker who was wrongly diagnosed with cancer said she thought it was a \"cruel joke\" when she was told doctors had made a mistake and she did not have cancer at all.\nMum-of-four Janice Johnston said her \"world crumbled\" when she learned she had a rare form of blood cancer at Kent and Canterbury Hospital in 2017.\nShe had 18 months of oral chemotherapy treatment, during which she experienced weight loss, nausea and bone pain, and had to give up her job as an auxiliary nurse. \nWhen the treatment did not appear to be working, she says, medics upped the dosage.\nIn 2018, she sought alternative treatment at Guy's Hospital in London. It was there a specialist told her she did not have cancer at all but a different condition. \nMrs Johnston was awarded \u00a375,950 in damages after East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust admitted liability. Staff at the hospital had failed to do the necessary ultrasound scan and bone marrow biopsy before diagnosing her.\nMrs Johnston, 53, said: \"The cancer diagnosis was an absolute shock. They said my life span would be shortened. \n\"I was at high risk of a fatal stroke or heart attack and I could drop down at any minute. It was heartbreaking and devastating.\n\"It didn't sink in until I saw the haematologist. I was in a room with people having serious chemotherapy who looked incredibly ill. I thought: 'I'm like them'.\"\nMrs Johnston says doctors told her she would need chemotherapy for life. \nThe side-effects led to her feeling \"wiped out\", her hair thinning, her teeth becoming loose and her gums receding. \nShe says occupational health told her that her immune system was jeopardised and she could pick up infections easily. That meant she was forced to resign from her job. \n\"Giving up work was horrible,\" Mrs Johnston says. \nShe was also worried she would not get to see some of her daughters get married or her grandchildren grow up.\nAfter searching on the internet to find out more about the blood cancer she was told she had - Polycythaemia vera (PV) - she learned that Guy's Hospital offered a different type of chemotherapy and asked her consultant for an appointment there.\nMrs Johnston recalls: \"The specialist at Guy's looked over my blood counts and said: 'I don't think you have blood cancer'.\"\nThe doctor told Mrs Johnston she had a different condition called secondary PV which is not cancer.\n\"She asked if I'd had a bone marrow test and scan of the spleen to confirm the diagnosis - I hadn't had either. My husband thought it was fantastic but I was angry. \n\"I thought it was a cruel joke on me. It didn't sink in. My husband couldn't understand why I wasn't jumping for joy - but it had taken my life.\"\nOne of the hardest things to cope with for Mrs Johnston was thinking she had been a \"fraud\". \n\"I'd been doing some fundraising to try and have something positive to focus on. Cancer Research UK asked if I'd be guest of honour at a charity run in Margate. I stood on stage in front of 3,000 women saying I had cancer. \n\"I'm mortified that people will think I made it up. It has made me feel awful and like I have lied to everyone,\" she said.\nMrs Johnston now has severe anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\"I still get flashbacks to it,\" she says. \"It was two years of my life. They took so much away from me.\"\nShe says she wants to \"raise awareness\" about her experience, and for \"anyone that does get diagnosed with it, to ask questions and learn as much as they can about it and if they feel any doubt, to get a second opinion\".\nA spokesperson for East Kent Hospitals said: \"A misdiagnosis of this kind is exceptionally rare and we wholeheartedly apologise to Ms Johnston.\""

      "text": "Flood victims will not be able to return to their homes until their safety can be assured, a council leader has said.\nThe Coal Authority has said initial checks suggested water built up in a mine shaft causing a \"blow out\" that flooded properties in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot.\nAbout 80 people were evacuated as water rushed through the village on Thursday.\nCouncil leader Rob Jones said it was unlikely residents could return Monday.\nHe said underground investigations would begin on Saturday and the work could take two to three days.\n\"Safety is the paramount concern for us,\" he said.\n\"Because we can't guarantee the site safety - that's the reason why people will remain away from their properties until such time as we can give the all clear.\n\"We don't know what the water has done underground.\"\nThe fire service said on Saturday morning the pumping operation was \"making good progress\".\nMr Jones told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast people may be able to return next week but \"did not want to raise hopes\" it will be Monday.\nHe said the flooding was \"more than likely\" related to old mine workings with six mines known about in area. He said the industry dated back 300 years.\nSkewen resident John Thomas returned home from a funeral with wife Lynne on Thursday to find their house had turned into \"a lake\".\nHe said: \"The water was around the level of the bottom of the doors so we couldn't go in, so we just had to stand there and watch this orange-coloured water just piling up and up and up.\n\"Other people who were evacuated had the chance to move things upstairs, I didn't have a chance to do that because I couldn't get in to it.\"\nLocal MP Stephen Kinnock said affected residents were staying in \"lots of different places\" across the region.\nAnd he praised the \"extraordinary\" generosity of the community and the support of the Salvation Army with donations of food, clothing and toiletries.\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) said officers were continuing to look at how to minimise the risk of pollution to nearby rivers, and investigating any impacts on the River Neath.\nThe Coal Authority, which manages the effects of past coal mining, is investigating the incident.\nChief executive Lisa Pinney said equipment, due on site on Saturday, would be used to drill into mine workings to \"fully investigate what has happened\".\n\"The blow out is likely to have been caused by a blockage underground which has caused water to back up and to break out using the easiest path,\" she said.\n\"The excessive rainfall of the past few days and the prolonged rainfall this winter, will have put additional pressure on the system. \n\"We know that people will want to get back to their homes and we will continue to progress these works as soon as possible, but public safety has to come first.\"\nThere are a number of historical mine workings in Skewen dating back beyond 1850.\nOn Saturday, Mr Jones said water was still pouring out of the affected site so workers were diverting it, while machines cleared gulleys and drains to give the water the chance to enter drainage systems.\nA residents' incident support centre has been set up at Abbey Primary School to offer help and information over the weekend, between 09:00-17:00 GMT.\nThe council has asked residents to be \"patient as the investigation continues\" and has set up a helpline.

      "text": "Moderna's Covid vaccine appears to work against new, more infectious variants of the pandemic virus found in the UK and South Africa, say scientists from the US pharmaceutical company. \nEarly laboratory tests suggest antibodies triggered by the vaccine can recognise and fight the new variants. \nMore studies are needed to confirm this is true for people who have been vaccinated.\nThe new variants have been spreading fast in a number of nations.\nThey have undergone changes or mutations that mean they can infect human cells more easily than the original version of coronavirus that started the pandemic. \nExperts think the UK strain, which emerged in September, may be up to 70% more transmissible. \nCurrent vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists believe they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. There are already some early results that suggest the Pfizer vaccine protects against the new UK variant.\nFor the Moderna study, researchers looked at blood samples taken from eight people who had received the recommended two doses of the Moderna vaccine. \nThe findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but suggest immunity from the vaccine recognises the new variants. \nNeutralising antibodies, made by the body's immune system, stop the virus from entering cells. \nBlood samples exposed to the new variants appeared to have sufficient antibodies to achieve this neutralising effect, although it was not as strong for the South Africa variant as for the UK one.  \nModerna says this could mean that protection against the South Africa variant might disappear more quickly. \nProf Lawrence Young, a virus expert at Warwick Medical School in the UK, said this would be concerning. \nModerna is currently testing whether giving a third booster shot might be beneficial. \nLike other scientists, the company is also investigating whether redesigning the booster to be a better match for the new variants will be beneficial. \nStephane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said the company believed it was \"imperative to be proactive as the virus evolves\".\nUK regulators have already approved Moderna's vaccine for rollout on the NHS, but the 17m pre-ordered doses are not expected to arrive until Spring. \nThe vaccine works in a similar way to the Pfizer one already being used in the UK. \nMore than 6.3 million people in the UK have already received a first dose of either the Pfizer or the AstraZeneca vaccine.

      "text": "The Scottish government is \"looking at all sorts of ways\" to accelerate its Covid-19 vaccine programme, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nThe government is considering a pilot of 24/7 vaccine arrangements, chiefly aimed at younger age groups.\nA total of 46% of over-80s in Scotland have now had a first dose, along with 95% of older care home residents.\nMs Sturgeon said the programme was \"picking up pace\" and \"on track\" to reach all over-70s by mid-February.\nShe said the government was \"looking at all options\" to get the vaccine out to people as quickly as possible.\nThe government aims to have the top priority groups - including care home residents and staff, frontline health workers and all those aged over 80 - given a first dose by the end of the first week in February.\nFrom Monday, letters are being sent out to people aged 70 to 79 inviting them to receive their first doses. Ms Sturgeon says the programme is \"on track\" to having this group complete by the middle of February.\nThere has been some criticism of the speed of the rollout in Scotland, with a greater proportion of over-80s having already received a jab in England.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon said the programme was \"making good progress\" and said any differences with the rest of the UK were because of an early focus on vaccinating older care home residents - 95% of whom have now had their first dose.\nShe said she was \"absolutely confident\" that the government would hit its targets.\nAnd the first minister said consideration was being given to how to speed up the programme further, saying her government is \"looking at all sorts of ways to accelerate things\".\nShe said: \"We are looking at piloting 24/7 arrangements so that when we get into wider groups of the population, people will have choices about the time they turn up for vaccines.\n\"There's been debate about whether people will want to turn up in the middle of the night to get vaccinated - some will and some won't. If that sort of thing is going to add to what we are able to do, it is likely to have the greatest impact when you get down into the relatively younger age groups.\n\"If we think it is appropriate there may be some things we try just to see if they would work, and if they don't we won't continue with them.\n\"We are looking at all of these options to make sure that as the supply increases, we can get it to people as quickly as possible.\"\nMs Sturgeon said there was \"some early evidence\" that lockdown was reducing the number of new Covid-19 cases, although she said the government would take a \"cautious\" approach to restrictions - which are currently due to run into mid-February at the earliest.\nShe also voiced some \"cautious grounds for optimism\" that admissions to hospital are starting to \"tail off slightly\", although she warned that pressure on the NHS would remain \"acute\" for some time.\nOpposition leaders called for the vaccine programme to be accelerated and for support to be targeted at key workers.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"People are talking about a 24/7 approach here in Scotland - I think based on the figures so far we need to focus just on a seven day approach, because we are not vaccinating people quickly enough.\n\"We are not making the progress we need to, to get people vaccinated as quickly as possible.\"\nScottish Labour MSP Sarah Boyack said the vaccine programme \"needs to be accelerated as fast as possible\"\nShe said: \"We are all behind this vaccine being rolled out - but it has to be as soon as possible, because people are getting nervous.\n\"Whether it's police staff, construction staff, care staff who have been worried for weeks - the vaccine has got to be the top priority, along with the test and trace so we can monitor the impact on the ground and get targeted support to people.\"\nScottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Scotland was \"slipping further and further behind England\" and added: \"The first minister's excuses on the rollout of the vaccine are wearing very thin.\""

      "text": "Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents.\nThis winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again.\n\"There's a sense of fatigue,\" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own \"concentration levels have fallen dramatically\".\n\"It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,\" she says of the latest lockdown and the \"silent struggle\" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated.\nThere might have been some guilty enjoyment at the start of the year when the school term was initially delayed, not having to get up and out on cold January mornings. \nUntil it dawned on them that this was becoming something much longer than a few weeks. \nIt's morphed from early January to half term in mid-February and now maybe Easter in early April or even later. And Jacqueline says, as a matter of \"respect\", parents need to know what's happening about schools.\nThe confusion over a return date seems to have further frayed the nerves of parents.\nThe mother, who lives outside Canterbury in Kent, says she worries about the pressures building up on young people.\nFor teenagers like her sons, she says this \"should be a pivotal time in their lives,\" when they're beginning to get some independence and when social lives are hugely important - but instead they're stuck inside with their parents.\n\"We can't live like the Waltons forever,\" she says, referencing the US TV series of a folksy family relying on each other.\nThe first lockdown created an unexpected sense of togetherness, an \"enforced bonding\" that she says turned out to be a \"massive positive\".\nBut Jacqueline, who works as a writer, sees no such upside to the latest lockdown. There is a collective frustration - and she says it has been made even worse by the confusion about when schools will go back.\nThe online home-schooling seems to be working, she says, with teachers trying to boost the enthusiasm levels, but it's no real substitute for being in school. And she wants much more clarity about when they will go back.\n\"I've tried not to be political about decisions being made, but you can't help but feel disappointed. They don't seem to understand how real people are living,\" she says.\nShe says when politicians say maybe schools will or won't be back by Easter, they don't realise how much that uncertainty affects families trying to plan for what comes next.\nEducational psychologist Dan O'Hare says the \"key word is 'uncertainty'\".\nNot knowing what is coming next adds to the pressure, he says, and children out of school are already facing big unknowns such as what's going to happen about exams or when will they see their friends and teachers.\n\"It's really stressful for children and their families,\" says Dr O'Hare, who is co-chair of the British Psychological Society's division for educational and child psychology. \"They need a sense of a plan.\"\nThis lockdown is also in the depths of winter - and he says employers need to think about making sure staff working from home are able to take a break in daylight hours, so that families can get outside.\nIt's no use asking parents to answer work emails all day and expect them to go out when it's dark.\nFor some families it has got very difficult.\n\"It's affected her emotionally a lot,\" says Dave in Bolton, who is worrying about his six-year-old daughter, who has been crying because she misses her friends.\n\"It's awful, you can't put a positive spin on it. She's at that age where she's enjoying her friends, becoming more socialised,\" he told BBC 5 Live.\n\"She's quite a confident little girl and I can't help worry that being stuck at home is going to impact her in the longer term.\"\nThe father says many of her classmates are still going into school - and that makes it even harder when she sees her friends on school Zoom calls.\nJen Locke in Newcastle makes the point that women can often be \"the most adversely affected by the decision to keep schools closed\". \nShe says home schooling has \"fallen squarely on my shoulders\", helping her children in the day and then shifting her work with an IT company into the evening, so it's an early start through to a very late finish.\n\"It's a huge mental strain\u2026 I'm knackered from it all,\" she says, right down to trying to get children to bed who aren't tired because they're not going out.\nA lockdown weariness seems to be out there, despite the best efforts of schools.\nSimon Armstrong in Bristol, whose son is in secondary school, says: \"Virtual lessons, no matter how well delivered, are a woeful substitute for real lessons.\"\n\"I am at the end of my tether,\" he says.\nThe Department for Education said: \"We are committed to reopening schools as soon as the public health picture allows, and will inform schools, parents and pupils of plans ahead of February half term.\" \nBut Labour has accused the government of causing \"chaos and confusion\" for parents and schools.\nThe National Association of Head Teachers said: \"Now is the moment for calm heads to decide on a sustainable return to school, not another chaotic and last-minute set of decisions that could easily result in a yo-yo return to lockdown.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 180 people were arrested in 10 Dutch cities as protesters defying a curfew clashed with riot police for a third night running.\nShops in Rotterdam were looted and police used water cannon, as rioters resisted latest Covid restrictions.\nPrime Minister Mark Rutte condemned \"criminal violence\" and the justice minister said the curfew would remain.\nThe Dutch chief of police said the riots no longer had \"anything to do with the basic right to demonstrate\".\nThe Netherlands has had nearly one million confirmed Covid cases since the start of the outbreak, with more than 13,500 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US, which is tracking the pandemic. \nThe government recently introduced a night-time curfew which runs from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30. Anyone caught violating it faces a \u20ac95 (\u00a384) fine.\nThere were further violent scenes in many towns and cities. Riot police clashed with protesters in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, as well as Amersfoort, Den Bosch, Alphen and Helmond.\nSome of the worst disturbances were in the south of Rotterdam where police said 10 officers were hurt. Across the country 184 people were arrested. Amsterdam's mayor appealed to parents to keep young people indoors.\nFires were lit on the streets of The Hague, where police on bicycles attempted to move small clusters of men who threw stones and fireworks. There was violence in the southern city of Den Bosch, where rioters set off fireworks, broke windows, looted a supermarket and overturned cars. \nA woman living near Den Bosch train station told Dutch radio that masked youths had left a trail of destruction in the city centre. \"I saw windows smashed and fireworks going off. Really crazy, just like a war zone,\" the woman said. Roads into the city were closed to stop people joining the rioters and Mayor Jack Mikkers imposed an emergency order banning gatherings on Tuesday.\nThe ignition of discontent has rocked the core of Dutch society. \nIn the absence of any legitimate way to socialise, is this simply an outlet for young men to feel part of something, their masks concealing their identities and enabling them to violently channel their frustrations?\nThere are more sinister influences at play. Messages on social media, overt and covert, have whipped up anger. Misinformation has even been spread by some politicians.\nSome feared a curfew would be a tipping point, as Dutch restrictions tighten while some neighbouring countries relax their rules. The vast majority of people in the Netherlands are peacefully observing the curfew.\nThe unrest was initially seen as a response to the first \"stay-at-home\" order imposed since Nazi occupation during World War Two. That notion has been dismissed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said the rioters were simply criminals and would be treated as such. \nBut there are simmering anxieties in Dutch towns and cities, and with less than two months before a general election, voters are vulnerable and the streets volatile. \nThere has been widespread shock at the violence. In Rotterdam, where police used water cannon during clashes with rioters, Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb signed an emergency decree, giving police broader powers of arrest. He reacted furiously to shops being looted in the south of the city, condemning \"shameless thieves, I can't call it anything else\".\nThe prime minister said the police had the government's full support: \"The riots have nothing to do with protesting or fighting for freedom.\" \nRotterdam shop-owner Emrah K\u00f6ker said he had no words for what he had seen. \"How can this happen in the Netherlands?\" he asked Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhuis challenged anyone to explain what looting a shop had to do with coronavirus.\nThe mayor of Den Bosch said police had struggled to respond to the violence because they were needed in other nearby towns.\nFootball fans of the Willem II club took to the streets of Tilburg to \"protect their city\" against rioters, news site Brabants Dagblad reports.\nMayors in several cities have vowed to introduce emergency measures in an effort to prevent more disturbances."

I'm not interested in doing that.\n\"Saying that, there's times where I go, 'Yeah, I completely see where this sex would be really good in this film and you basically just need somebody to look hot', so therefore you can use somebody else.\n\"Because I'm too vain, and the body has had two children now, and I'd just rather not stand in front of a group of men naked.\"\nKnightley has starred in films including Bend It Like Beckham, Atonement and Pirates of the Caribbean. Last year, she appeared in Misbehaviour, a comedy-drama about the women's liberation movement in 1970s London.\nThe actress has previously said she banned her daughter from watching Disney films which portrayed women in ways she disagreed with.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

One person is dragged under the car.\nTacoma Police Department said multiple vehicles and approximately 100 people were blocking an intersection when officers arrived on the scene. The group was apparently watching street racers doing \"burnouts\".\n\"During the operation, a responding Tacoma police vehicle was surrounded by the crowd. People hit the body of the police vehicle and its windows as the officer was stopped in the street,\" police said in a statement. \n\"The officer, fearing for his safety, tried to back up, but was unable to do so because of the crowd,\" it said. \n\"While trying to extricate himself from an unsafe position, the officer drove forward striking one individual and may have impacted others,\" it said.\nThe person who was run over was rushed to hospital. Their condition is as yet unclear.\nThe Pierce County Force Investigation Team is investigating the incident, the statement said. The police officer has not been identified.\n\"I am concerned that our department is experiencing another use of deadly force incident,\" Interim Police Chief Mike Ake said in the statement.\n\"I send my thoughts to anyone who was injured in tonight's event, and am committed to our department's full co-operation in the independent investigation and to assess the actions of the department's response during the incident.\"\nThe incident comes at a time of rising anger over the use of excessive force by police in the US. \nPeople across the world took to the streets last year to demonstrate their anger at the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, and to demand an end to police brutality and what they see as systemic racism."

She argued that plans to raise taxes must be seen in the context of financing bigger investments necessary to make the US economy competitive.\n\"The focus now is not on tax increases. It is on programmes to help us get through the pandemic,\" she stressed.\nJanet Yellen was previously chair of the US Federal Reserve. She was known for focusing more attention on the impact of the central bank's policies on workers and the costs of America's rising inequality.\nBefore then-President Barack Obama named her to lead the Fed in 2014, she had served as one of its board members for a decade, including four years as vice-chair.\nDonald Trump bucked Washington tradition when he opted not to appoint Ms Yellen to a second four-year term at the Fed. \nHowever, her climb to the top of the economics profession had made her a feminist icon in the economics world.\nWhen she left the Fed in 2018, many paid tribute to her leadership by imitating her signature look of a blazer with a popped collar.\nMs Yellen is seen as someone able to satisfy both progressive and centrist members of Mr Biden's Democratic party. Her nomination to lead the Fed in 2014 won support from some Republicans.\nHer focus on employment, rather than inflation, gave her a reputation of favouring low interest rates, which spur economic activity by making it less expensive to borrow money.\nBut under her leadership, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 - albeit less aggressively than some more conservative commentators supported.\nHer stewardship of that process has won praise on Wall Street, even as it remains hotly debated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,NHS Wales",
      "text": "The health minister has been accused of \"misleading\" people after claiming the majority of over 80s had been vaccinated against Covid-19.\nVaughan Gething said he understood most people in the age group had received their first dose of the vaccine.\nFigures show there have been 43,879 doses issued - 23.9% of the priority group.\nThe Welsh Conservatives accused him of misleading people, but Mr Gething said he had made an \"innocent mistake\".\nAccording to Public Health Wales figures, the total number of first dose vaccinations has reached 190,435 in Wales - 6% of the population.\nThe figures also show 86,717 front-line health workers have also been given a first dose.\nMore than half of care home residents and two thirds of care home workers have also had their first doses.\nIn a virtual session of the Senedd on Tuesday, Mr Gething appeared to contradict the figures, saying it was his \"understanding\" that the vaccine roll out had reached \"the majority\" of Wales' over 80s population.\nMr Gething also told the Welsh Parliament that he expected 70% of over 80s in Wales and 70% of care home residents and staff to receive their first jab by the end of this weekend.\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies accused Mr Gething of misleading the Senedd, saying: \"We need an urgent statement from the health minister clarifying the situation.\"\nMr Gething has since admitted making \"an innocent mistake\" and said: \"There was a minor amount of confusion about the difference between care home residents, where we had vaccinated a majority, and over 80s.\"\nHe said that vaccination for that cohort is a \"significant priority\" and he was still \"positive\" that the target to vaccinated 70 per cent by the end of the week can be achieved.\nHe added that over 70s would be contacted soon, \"I fully expect that every health board will be inviting people over 70 to come forward for their vaccination over the next week.\"\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said that Mr Gething's aim to have over 70% of over 80s would have the jab by the end of the week, would have been \"quite a task in three days\".\n\"The health minister should explain if he thinks we're still on track. Communication is key in building public trust,\" he added.\nIn total, 9,364 (56%) of care home residents and 20,087 (67.5%) of care home workers have been given a first dose.\nThe aim is for 70% of the over 80s and care home residents to be given a first dose of vaccine by 24 January.\nThere are another 30,388 people, not designated, who have been given first doses. These include social workers and some in the main priority groups, where the data is not quite ready to be included.\nHealth officials also say there is a time lag - which can be up to five days - between the day a person is vaccinated and when the recorded data is checked and finally published. \nThis week, more than 60,000 doses of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine and 90,000 of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines to hospitals and GP practices would be rolled out. \nAsked if he shared the same confidence as the health minister that they could meet the 70% target by the weekend, Wales' chief pharmaceutical officer said he expected the roll-out to increase further, particularly as GPs would be prioritising the over 80s and care home residents into the weekend.\nThese include GPs vaccinating into the evening and over the weekend, although it could again be a few more days before those doses finally show up on the officially published data.\n\"I'm very confident that the numbers will be reflected for the over 80s by the end of the week,\" said Andrew Evans.\n\"We know that GPs across Wales are very keen to get their hands on the vaccine and, as it has happened, supply hasn't been able to meet their demand so we're confident there's the capacity and the system.\"\n\"We're all very focused on making sure we offer as many people in those [priority] groups get the vaccine as quickly as possible.\"\nResponding to criticism that the Welsh Government was falling behind other nations in administering the vaccine, Mr Evans said that Wales was moving as quickly as possible.\nHe explained that there were challenges around transportation and storage of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine which has to be kept at ultra-low temperatures in specialist centres. \nMr Evans also said that plans for the Oxford AstaZenca vaccine were based on the allotted number that they received by Public Health England each week.\n\"We get an indication week of what allocation we're getting for next week for the AstraZenca of vaccine,\" he added.\n\"It doesn't have the same shelf-life problems that the Pfizer vaccine does, so it's not the case that every dose delivered gets delivered immediately, but we know that all the professionals who are involved in the programme are ensuring that as much vaccine as they get is used within a week of receiving it.\"\nMore people have now had the first dose of the vaccine than the number - 185,035 - who have tested positive for Covid-19.\nMeanwhile, weekly figures - up to Sunday - show the vaccine roll-out across different parts of Wales, by health board.\nThe rates of first doses to Welsh residents range from 4.4% of the population in north Wales to 5.8% in Powys.\nMr Evans said the amount of vaccine a health board might have at any one time reflected the capacity or number of appointments it might have booked for its vaccination centres. \n\"That's what explains some of the variation in uptake between areas in Wales,\" he added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus vaccination campaign is now well under way in Scotland, and we have a good idea of how plans to deploy the vaccine are shaping up. \nThe Scottish government has said the first two priority groups - including care home staff and residents, frontline health workers and over-80s in the community - would have had their first jab by 5 February. \nThose aged 70 and over will be vaccinated by mid-February.\nPeople aged over 65 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be vaccinated by early March.\nThis covers the first five of the nine priority groups, which is just over 1.4 million people.\nThree vaccines have now been approved by UK regulators - those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna. \nThey have been purchased by the UK government and Scotland will get a share of them, based on its population. \nCurrent modelling indicates that Scotland will have the capacity to deliver about 400,000 vaccinations a week from the end of February.  \nGP practices, health centres and local clinics have already been delivering vaccinations.\nFrom Monday 1 February, mass vaccination centres, including Edinburgh International Conference Centre (EICC) and Aberdeen's P&J LIVE at TECA, will be in operation. \nThe Scottish government said the EICC will have capacity to vaccinate more than 21,000 people a week at 45 stations. \nThe centre in Aberdeen will start with 20 booths, vaccinating around 6000 people weekly. \nThe NHS Louisa Jordan mass vaccination centre in Glasgow has been operating since 8 December, carrying out 1,000 to 5,000 vaccinations daily. The facility has the capacity to move to 10,000 per day.\nOther large centres will operate at Ravenscraig Sports Facility in Motherwell and Queen Margaret University in Musselburgh - as well as at leisure centres and town halls. \nCentres were planning initially to be opened seven days from 08:00 to 22:00, but that could be extended.\nIt won't be practical for everyone in Scotland to travel to receive their vaccine. \nSo, in some remote communities, a mobile vaccination unit will be set up to offer immunisations. \nIn this case, public health officials say they will likely make one trip to the area and vaccinate everyone in the priority group at once - which might mean someone lower down the priority list will get vaccinated earlier than they would had they lived in an urban area.  \nOne plan public health officials are looking at is using mobile libraries to deliver vaccines in remote communities. \nThe hope is to have people aged 50 and over vaccinated by the start of May.\nThe number of injections vaccinators will administer will be dependent on supply - so there might not be a smooth increase in how many people have received their immunisation. \nQuite quickly it's expected the number of injections given to begin increasing. \nThat's because initially things were very focused on getting those in care homes vaccinated first. \nBecause the vaccine had to be taken to the homes, it has taken a longer time to get through than if the same number of people had been able to turn up at a mass vaccination site. \nBy the autumn everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 should have been offered one of the Covid vaccinations. That's 4.4 million people. \nBut this will depend entirely on supplies - and just now, public health experts say they only know how many doses they can expect until June. \nFrom March, a second stream of second doses of the vaccinations will also be getting under way as the latest guidance is that the second jab should be received up to 12 weeks after the first. \nThere are no plans to make vaccinations mandatory.\nThe UK government is ordering vaccines on behalf of the four nations, and the supply is then be divided up between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland on the basis of population. \nScotland's share of the UK's vaccine supply equates to its 8.2% share of the UK population.\nThe UK government has secured early access to more than 400 million doses of experimental vaccines.\nThere are more than enough supplies of approved vaccines to give every adult in the UK both doses. \nData suggests that whilst the efficacy of both vaccines is optimised when a second dose is administered, they offer considerable protection after a single dose, at least in the short term.  \nSo the new plan is for more people to be given a first dose, rather than holding back stock to administer down the line as second doses. \nEveryone should still receive a second dose within 12 weeks of the first. \nTrials of the Oxford vaccine, which was developed by British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca and Oxford University, show it stops an average of 70% of people developing Covid symptoms.\nNobody who was given the vaccine in the trial developed severe disease or needed hospital treatment. \nThere is also data that suggests adjusting the dose could increase protection up to 90%. \nThis vaccine takes a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees and genetically modifies it to resemble coronavirus to try to provoke an immune response.\nThe manufacturers of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine say the jab could prevent 95% of people from becoming ill with Covid-19.\nIt is what's known as an RNA vaccine - a new type of technology. It involves injecting part of the virus' genetic code into the body to train the immune system.\nAntibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus.\nThere were fears that the requirement for it to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures would pose problems in getting it to care homes or to remote communities. \nHowever, it has since transpired that the vaccine can be moved around in an unfrozen state for up to 12 hours and can be stored undiluted for up to five days.\nThe Moderna vaccine is an RNA vaccine, like Pfizer's, which uses part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response.\nIt requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer.\nSeveral other vaccines are in the final testing stage, and more results from other teams working on advanced trials are also expected in the coming weeks and months.\nThe JCVI has said it does not have a preference for one vaccine above the other, but it's unlikely you'll get to choose which you get. \nThat depends on a number of factors - what is available, where you are being vaccinated, and what we know about how the vaccines work by the time you are being vaccinated. \nThe Scottish government has said that it will be distributing supplies so that they can offer the most \"extensive and timely\" coverage possible, so for that reason \"one vaccine may be offered in certain settings over another\".\nAnd scientists will be studying the efficacy of the injections as people are given them, and it may well turn out that different vaccines suit different parts of the population. \nSo, it may be that what vaccine you get is dependent on your age or where you live, for example. But it is early days - we'll learn more in the months ahead. \nPublic health officials said when the Pfizer jab was approved that pregnant and breastfeeding women should not be given the injection, due to the limited amount of data available on its use within that group.\nHowever, the regulator has since updated its advice to say that when the potential benefits outweigh the risks, the decision can be made for the woman to be vaccinated. \nFor the Oxford vaccine, the advice is the same - it can be administered when the potential benefits outweigh the risk. \nMost children aged 18 and under will not get the Pfizer vaccine. This is because not enough research on using this vaccine on children has been carried out yet. \nAnd, so far, the Oxford vaccine has only been approved for those over 18.  \nRegulators initially said that people with a history of significant allergic reactions should not have the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab. \nBut they have now said they have received further assurances, and that those with allergies to food or other medicines or vaccines can have this injection. \nHowever, anyone with a history of allergic reaction to this vaccine or any of its ingredients should not receive this injection. \nThe Oxford vaccine can also be given to those with allergies to other medicines or food. \nAgain, it's only those with a known history of reacting to any of its ingredients who should not have it. \nAnyone who has previously reacted to a vaccine should speak to their doctor first.

      "text": "A health board criticised for severe maternity failings put too much emphasis on targets instead of patient safety, according to a new review. \nIt found wider failings in Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board's governance.\nHealthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) and the Wales Audit Office (WAO) also found a high level of risk to patient safety was accepted as the norm in some departments.\nThe health board said work was under way to address the issues raised.\nThe report was not an assessment of front-line care, but spoke to staff about procedures for reporting and learning from problems. \nIt found Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board had not given enough attention to the safety of its services, in contrast to a strong focus on targets and financial controls.  \nAdrian Crompton, the auditor general for Wales, said while finance and performance targets were \"vitally important\", the review raised questions about how the performance of the health service was assessed. \n\"This piece of work suggests one part of the health service perhaps over-prioritised these issues and has taken its eye off the ball in respect of issues related to patient care,\" he said.\nThe regulator HIW found examples where working at high levels of risk had become \"normalised\". \nOn visits to the emergency departments at the Prince Charles and Royal Glamorgan hospitals, the review found \"areas of concern which we felt could pose an immediate risk to the safety of patients\", including issues around nurse and doctor staffing levels and the safety and dignity of managing patients in corridors.\n\"Staff said they had repeatedly raised concerns and now felt they could do no more to escalate their concerns,\" the report said. \nThe review found there was a muddled system and a lack of leadership as to who was in charge of safety at various levels and no formal process for learning from problems. \nFor example, staff may not have been aware that other parts of the organisation had been inspected and needed improvement.  \nThe review found gaps in how information and incidents were reported to the board. \nKate Chamberlain, chief executive of HIW, said what concerned them most was \"the lack of clarity about how front-line staff... can escalate their concerns and make them known\".\n\"It is absolutely fundamental to patient safety that there should be a good flow of information,\" she said.\nThe report said there still appeared to be a culture of fear and blame in some parts of the organisation relating to the reporting of incidents. \nA quarter of the staff who answered the review's survey felt the organisation blamed or punished people who were involved in errors, near misses or incidents, and nearly half of the respondents felt managers would not act on feedback from staff.\nThe report also raised concerns the health board had not addressed weaknesses identified in a previous HIW report in 2012. \nMr Crompton said the two organisations were already planning the joint review before the recent maternity failings emerged. \nBut the review found some cause for optimism given the new set of managers.\nIn December the two organisations will meet the Welsh Government to give their recommendation on whether the whole health board needs to be put into special measures. \nAt present it is one step down from special measures and the maternity unit is already at the highest level of oversight. \nSharon Hopkins, interim chief executive of the health board, welcomed the review and accepted all 14 of the recommendations made, \nMs Hopkins told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast she was \"confident care in maternity services is improving\".\n\"You can never say 100% of the time somebody's experience will be absolutely as we would like it.,\" she said.\n\"But I think we can be confident with what we are doing now, and how hard people are working, that care in maternity services is of a good quality, and improving all the time.\"\nShe said improvements included making the structure of the organisation better, increasing \"engagement with staff and partners\" and strengthening governance arrangements.\nIn October an independent review panel said there was a \"very long way to go\" before maternity services at a health board could be declared safe.\nIf would like to get in touch about this story, please email: news.focus.team@bbc.co.uk\nIf you have been affected by stillbirth, the following organisations might be able to help:\nTommy's\nSands - Stillbirth and neonatal death charity\nSaying Goodbye - support for miscarriage and baby and infant loss"

      "tags": "Welsh government,Nursing,NHS Wales,NHS,Royal College of Nursing,Mental health,PTSD,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A long-term plan is needed to help nurses cope with post-traumatic stress resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, union officials have said.\nLast year the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) ran a survey looking at its impact on front-line staff and how it had changed nurses' lives.\nOf 2,000 Welsh members who took part, 75.9% reported increased stress and 52% were worried about their mental health.\nThe Welsh Government said it recognised the pressures on NHS workers.\nCarol Doggett, senior matron at Swansea's Morriston Hospital, said nurses were often becoming patients' \"next of kin\" during the pandemic, due to the \"absence of family, particularly at end of life\".\n\"Which we would do anyway, naturally, but in the absence of family it's far more profound than supporting them in a holistic way if they were present with us,\" she said.\nMs Doggett said the extreme pressure experienced in intensive care had been felt throughout the hospital.\n\"Patients are coming in through [the emergency department]. They are sicker. The number of sicker patients has definitely increased,\" she said.\n\"That results in them having an extended period in hospital. They can stay beyond Covid. They continue to suffer with those conditions that present themselves as a result of Covid.\"\nOn Sunday, Ms Doggett's colleague, Morriston intensive care consultant John Gorst, said as many as five patients are dying with Covid during a single 12-hour shift.\nNicky Hughes, associate director of nursing at RCN Wales, said: \"The Welsh Government needs to set a long-term plan in place to deal with post-traumatic stress and other mental health issues amongst nurses as a result of the pandemic.\n\"Nurses are exhausted, stressed and nearing burnout. Every day they tell us that they feel that they have nothing left to give and feel devalued.\"\nAlmost a year on from the start of the pandemic nurses have had to find \"ever more physical and emotional strength\" to cope with Covid-19, said Ms Hughes. \nThe RCN told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme nurses needed \"adequate psychological support\". \nMental health charity Mind Cymru agreed with the RCN that a \"coherent long-term strategy\" was needed to help front-line workers deal with the pandemic's effect on their mental health. \n\"We urge Welsh Government to factor this in to their plans and take the necessary steps to give people the support they need,\" said Simon Jones, Mind Cymru's head of policy.\n\"Nursing staff and other healthcare professionals have played, and continue to play, a vital role in combatting the pandemic, often putting their own health and wellbeing at risk.\n\"Even before the outbreak, we heard from many healthcare professionals struggling with the mental health impact of things like long working hours without breaks, unsociable shift patterns, and dealing with traumatic events.\"\nA mental health support hotline for front-line NHS staff in Wales - Health for Health Professionals (HHP) Wales - has been set up by Cardiff University and has received Welsh Government funding.\nThe hotline's director Prof Jonathan Bisson said he was \"encouraged\" by the Welsh Government's investment in HHP Wales along with Traumatic Stress Wales, which helps people who have experienced traumatic events.\n\"These two initiatives are taking a long term strategic approach to support health workers exposed to traumatic events,\" Prof Bisson said. \n\"HHP Wales offers access to mental health support for any member of NHS staff in Wales and has linked with Traumatic Stress Wales to provide evidence-based treatment to health workers who are experiencing post traumatic stress disorder as a result of traumatic experiences related to the pandemic and other causes.\"\nPlaid Cymru said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and care workers \"mustn't be underestimated\".\n\"The Welsh Government must demonstrate that they're taking this seriously with a robust workforce strategy that takes into account the mental health needs of workers, including sufficient down time after the pandemic, and addresses the need to retain and recruit more staff,\" said Plaid's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth.\nThe Welsh Government called the \"commitment and tireless hard work\" of nurses across Wales \"truly remarkable\". \nA spokesman said: \"We recognise the pressures the NHS workforce is experiencing and have worked closely with NHS employers and trade unions to create a comprehensive wellbeing package to help support them, which includes a dedicated and confidential Samaritans listening support helpline. \n\"We have also expanded our Health for Health Professionals Wales service which offers psychological and mental health support, as well as a number of free-to-access health and wellbeing support apps.\"\nRCN Wales said it was glad the Welsh Government was backing projects supporting health workers.\nIt said it encouraged the continued development of a \"long-term strategy to deal with the lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our nursing workforce.\""

      "text": "Testing for different variants of Covid-19 is \"massively more advanced\" in NI than in the Republic, the first minister has said.\nArlene Foster commented on social media after Taoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin said his \"understanding\" was NI was not testing for the new variant.\nMrs Foster said she had spoken to Mr Martin on Monday.\nShe tweeted that he had \"accepted that Northern Ireland is testing for SARS-CoV-2\".  \nSpeaking to Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 on Saturday, Mr Martin had said: \"When I discussed this with the leaders, their view was the variant doesn't appear to be as big an issue in the north... I can't understand that.\"\nOn Monday, the NI Department of Health announced 17 further deaths linked to Covid-19 and 422 more cases of the virus.\nThe Republic of Ireland reported a further seven Covid-19 related deaths and 1,372 more cases.\nThe department released a statement on Sunday saying \"in light of some misleading commentary in recent days\", it wanted to detail \"the ongoing work in Northern Ireland to identify new variants of the Covid-19\".\nIt said that \"whole genome sequencing\", which is used to identify and track new strains of Covid-19, had been in place in Northern Ireland \"from an early stage of this pandemic\". \nIt is thought that up to 50% of current Covid-19 cases could be related to the new \"English\" variant, which is thought to be about 50-70% more infectious than the original strain.\nSpeaking on BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen's University, said: \"I think we need to be fairly concerned about this, for a couple of these variants they're actually changing how the virus behaves.\n\"This one, in particular, seems to be more transmissible, which means more people getting infected, more people getting sick and more people dying.\"\nWhen asked on Good Morning Ulster about the new variant, Dr David Farren, a consultant microbiologist, said: \"It's not true to say we're not looking for it, but we are only looking for it, in a small number of cases.\" \nWhen asked if it is inevitable that the new variant becomes the dominant variant he said there's \"certainly a high risk of that\".\nMrs Foster also said on Twitter that she \"pressed\" the taoiseach on sharing travel locator forms and that he \"committed to movement soon on that issue\".\nThe first minister and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill have criticised Dublin for failing to share information on travellers arriving there during the pandemic in order to help control the spread of any new Covid-19 variant.\nMs O'Neill said she was \"hopeful\" the Irish government will soon share information with the executive about the movement of visitors to the Republic.\nShe added that there needed to be greater co-operation between the two governments and that it should not be \"an orange and green issue\". \nMeanwhile, numbers being immunised at NI's vaccination centres have declined as the phase focused on healthcare workers comes to an end, the Department of Health has said.\nHealth trusts are now planning to invite clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) patients to receive their vaccine.\nThe department said CEV patients would be contacted in due course.\nIt also urged healthcare workers to take up the offer of a jab quickly.\nThe department said there was no \"diminution\" of work at vaccine centres after a letter from the Southern Health Trust indicated the need for some vaccinators would be \"limited\" in the next four to six weeks.\nThe speed at which the vaccines are being delivered has slowed somewhat over the past week, according to official government data, but Northern Ireland remains one of the vaccination success stories.\nThe Department of Health said the NI vaccination data for 23 and 24 January - as reported at UK-wide level - \"is only partial information as it does not contain the GP vaccination figures\".  \nAs of Monday, 159,642 people in Northern Ireland had received a first vaccine dose.\nThat represents more than 10.5% of the NI population.\nMore than 20,000 people have received a second dose.\nThe Department of Health said that a further announcement on the timing of the start of vaccinations for those aged 70 and over, the wider clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) group and those aged 65 and over will be confirmed later this week. \nIn a separate development, the military medical personnel who will be assisting in the battle against Covid-19, will be in hospitals in Northern Ireland by the end of the week.\nThe medics who are of paramedic grade in the RAF, Army and Navy will take up nursing assistant roles.

      "text": "Budweiser has said it will not advertise its beer during the Super Bowl this year, joining a growing number of big brands sitting out the annual American football championship. \nThe event remains one of the most-watched in the US each year, drawing more than 100 million viewers in 2020.\nThe advertisements are often as much a conversation-starter as the game itself, sometimes sparking controversy. \nFirms say the virus has made finding the right message especially difficult.\nOthers are grappling with financial hits caused by the pandemic, which has dampened spending on many items, while also casting more than 10 million Americans out of work, resurfacing racial and economic inequalities and sharpening political divisions.\nBudweiser's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, said it planned to reallocate the money it would have spent on a 30-second Budweiser spot during the game to support an Ad Council campaign promoting coronavirus vaccination. \nIt is the first time the flagship brand will not make a game-time appearance in 37 years. \n\"This commitment is an investment in a future where we can all get back together safely over a beer\", it said, adding that it would still promote some of its other brands, such as Bud Light, during the game.\nOn Monday, Budweiser released a full 90-second Super Bowl ad on YouTube entitled \"Bigger Picture\", which showed US citizens overcoming pandemic challenges together and aimed to raise awareness about Covid-19 vaccines. \nCoke, Pepsi and Hyundai are among the other major names also planning to forego airtime during the broadcast.\nCoca-Cola said it had made the \"difficult choice\" to \"ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times\". The firm did not advertise during the 2019 game either.\nHyundai cited \"marketing priorities\" and the timing of upcoming vehicle launches.\nPepsi has also said it would not promote its flagship soda during the game. Instead, it is spending money on an advert airing to promote the Super Bowl halftime show it has sponsored for almost a decade.\nGiven all the economic, political and health questions of 2020, companies may have felt it was prudent to pull back - especially several months ago, when they would have had to start planning for such a high-profile night, said Kimberly Whitler, professor at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business \n\"It's the biggest night of TV watching and so they have to plan it months in advance,\" she said. \"There was so much uncertainty that to go and invest in a Super Bowl ad might have actually felt or seemed frivolous at the time.\"\nThe decision goes \"beyond finances\", she added. \"It's also, 'How do we identify the right tone that will match the moment'.\" \nThis year's Super Bowl will see star quarterback Tom Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers face off against reigning champions the Kansas City Chiefs on 7 February.\nLast year, firms spent an average of $5.25m (\u00a33.8m) for a 30-second spot during the championship, driving Super Bowl ad spending to a record $450m, according to Kantar consultancy. \nThe firm has said its research suggests Super Bowl ads are \"typically 20 times more effective\" in changing a brand's perception than a normal advert.\nAnheuser-Busch, an official sponsor of the National Football League, is typically one of the night's top spenders, so the absence of its flagship brand may create its own buzz, said Satya Menon, a Chicago-based managing partner of of ROI practice at Kantar.\n\"Budweiser in particular is a very established brand ... so for them, it's all about generating love and goodwill and maybe this is another way,\" she says. \n\"They do have a lot of pre-game advertising out there. When people have the expectation that they wil be there and then they don't see the brand, they'll start thinking why are they not.\"\nMeanwhile, the sports showdown still seems to be finding plenty of firms ready to fill spots left by the stalwarts. Names of newcomers include Chipotle and Fiverr, a freelance platform that has seen business soar during the pandemic. \n\"It doesn't get any bigger than the Super Bowl from a branding and marketing perspective,\" said Fiverr's chief marketing officer Gali Arnon. \"We believe this is a major opportunity for us to introduce the world to Fiverr in a unique and creative way.\" \nMany of this year's advertisers are firms coming from the e-commerce sector, which have benefited from the pandemic, Ms Menon said.  \nAnd though audience numbers for NFL games have slipped this year, for those firms making their game-night debuts, Ms Menon says she still expects ads to have a big impact - even if the pandemic puts a damper on the traditional Super Bowl parties and other festivities, which can make championship feel like an unofficial national holiday.\n\"There isn't very much going on in life, so it will always have that great reach,\" she says. \"Some of that excitement may not be there, but watching will definitely be there.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus vaccines,Gavin Williamson,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government will tell teachers and parents when schools in England can reopen \"as soon as we can\", the prime minister has said.\nMPs have called on the government to set out a \"route map\" for reopening amid concerns for children's education.\nBoris Johnson said he understood why people wanted a timetable but he did not want to lift restrictions while the infection rate was \"still very high\".\nHe would not guarantee schools would reopen before April's Easter break.\nMr Johnson said: \"We've now got the R [reproduction rate] down below 1 across the whole of the country, that's a great achievement, we don't want to see a huge surge of infection just when we've got the vaccination programme going so well and people working so hard.\n\"I understand why people want to get a timetable from me today, what I can tell you is we'll tell you, tell parents, tell teachers as much as we can as soon as we can.\"\nHe said the government would be \"looking at the potential of relaxing some measures\" before mid-February, with Downing Street clarifying that this meant looking at the data to decide \"what we may or may not be able to ease from 15 February onwards\".\nA further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded, according to Monday's government figures.\nAt Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose.\nBut he said the NHS continues to be under \"intense pressure\", with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, saying there are \"twice the number of people in hospital than we had in the first wave\" of the pandemic.\nRobert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast there was \"enormous uncertainty\" and called for the government to set out what the conditions needed to be for pupils to return to schools.\nThe Conservative MP for Harlow suggested the government could consider tighter restrictions in other parts of society and the economy, in order to enable schools to open.\nTory MPs were enraged by reports over the weekend that schools might not re-open fully until after the Easter holidays. \nMinisters say it's the progress of the pandemic that will determine their decision rather than a pre-agreed timetable. \nYet whenever the government speaks, parents hear dates. Whether it's that the situation will be reviewed at half-term. Or a pledge to give two weeks' notice when classes will come back. \nMPs are now pushing for more transparency from the government about how they'll assess the data, and for some ideas between school being mostly closed or totally open.\nThis issue is a perfect metaphor for the situation facing the entire country. Too much hope breeds disappointment, but living with uncertainty is just as hard. And you can come up with a plan but it might have to be junked if the virus has other ideas. \nChildren's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield joined the call for clarity and told the BBC: \"Children are more withdrawn, they are really suffering in terms of isolation, their confidence levels are falling, and for some there are serious issues.\" \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government wanted to \"see all children back at the very earliest moment\".\nSchools in England have been closed to most pupils since the national lockdown began on 5 January due to high levels of Covid transmission in the community.\nThere have been calls for teachers to be vaccinated sooner, although it is not clear if that would allow schools to reopen earlier.\nCovid death rates among educational professionals are not \"statistically significantly different\" to those in the general population, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, but secondary school teachers appeared to have an elevated risk compared particularly with people working in office-type jobs.\nAmong secondary school teachers Covid death rates were 39.2 deaths per 100,000 males, compared with 31.4 for all males aged 20 to 64, and 21.2 per 100,000 females, compared with 16.8, but the ONS said these were \"not statistically significantly different than those of the same age and sex in the wider population\".\nSchools will remain closed in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales until at least the February half-term - with the Welsh first minister saying it is \"unlikely\" all pupils will return after the break.\nGemma Cocker from Brighton is one of the many parents struggling to balance childcare, home learning and work. \nShe says she's having to share her work laptop with her son, who has already missed learning time after the family moved home and did not have internet access. \"We didn't have any internet. The school said they had reached their limit so couldn't take him,\" she says.  \nAnd because her children are young, she says: \"They're never just going to watch a classroom by themselves, you have to be with them the whole time.\"\nKitty Jones, 11, is in her last year of primary school and she says home learning is \"tricky\" because she is not used to using different remote platforms like Google Classroom and she wants to return \"as soon as possible\".\n\"I still think that I'm learning a bit, but I don't think I'm learning as much as I would be in person,\" she tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.\nHolly Agbukor, 18, is studying for her A-levels, says it is \"quite stressful\" learning at home, as it is a \"different environment, so it is not as easy to be fully present in the lessons\".\nBut, she says, while is it \"difficult\" working at home, \"I don't think it is worth the cost of reintroducing the virus into society and making things worse overall\".\nIn other developments:\nHow has home-schooling been going for your family?

It will remain a department store.\"\nHe also expects the Jenners name will remain on the side of the building.\nMr Povlsen, whose parents set up Scandinavian fashion company Bestseller, is believed to be worth \u00a34.5bn. As well as owning Bestseller he is a major shareholder in online retailer Asos.\nHe has previously revealed plans to use parts of the Princes Street building for a hotel, with the rest reserved for retail. \nThe plans included the restoration of the building's Victorian facade and central atrium, which is a three-storey, top-lit grand saloon. A rooftop restaurant and bar would overlook nearby St Andrew Square.\nMr Vogdrup said the plans to refurbish the store were now on hold due to the current economic climate.\nJenners has dominated Edinburgh's main shopping thoroughfare since the mid-19th Century.\nIt was opened in 1838 by local drapers Charles Jenner and Charles Kennington, who found themselves out of work after being sacked for taking a day off to go to the races in Musselburgh. \nInitially called Kennington & Jenner, the boutique store proved popular for keeping the people of Edinburgh in fine silks and linen, which could normally only be found in London.\nBy 1890 the shop had changed name to Charles Jenner & Co and had expanded to adjoining buildings, making it one of the biggest stores in Scotland.\nBut just two years later fire destroyed the shop and ambitious plans - backed by the local council - were launched for a new look Jenners.\nCelebrated architect William Hamilton Beattie, who also designed the Balmoral and Carlton Hotel, was brought in for the redesign.\nCharles Jenner died in 1893 before the work was completed in 1895.\nIn 1911 the popular store was given a Royal Warrant. \nAfter struggling in the the 21st Century, the Jenners brand was sold to rivals House of Fraser for \u00a346m in 2005.\nIn 2018, House of Fraser was bought by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct group."

      "text": "The full extent of the problems with maternity services at two hospitals in the south Wales valleys rings out when the voices of women and families are listened to.\n\"Overwhelmingly\" mothers faced \"distressing experiences and poor care\", the review team found.\nAs one said: \"I want having a baby to be a good experience. It's ruined it.\"\nWomen repeatedly stated they were not listened to and their concerns were not taken seriously or valued.\nThey spoke of being ignored or patronised while being cared for at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil.\nOften, their suspicions and concerns were found to have reflected a genuine problem that emerged later, but at the time they were dismissed when they tried to voice their concerns.\nA major independent review has found Cwm Taf health board's maternity services were \"under extreme pressure\" and the health minister has ordered them be put into special measures.\nIt was prompted by 25 serious incidents, including eight stillbirths and four neonatal deaths, between January 2016 and last September. \nThe independent review team has released a separate, damning 78-page report, which shares the views of 140 family members, including mothers about their experiences at the hospitals. \nNearly two thirds of women questioned felt they had not had good quality care during their pregnancy.\nThe review said: \"Many women had felt something was wrong with their baby or tried to convey the level of pain they were experiencing but they were ignored or patronised, and no action was taken, with tragic outcomes including stillbirth and neonatal death of their babies.\"\nOne woman said she felt worthless, adding: \"I'm broken from the whole experience, the lack of care and compassion.\"\nOn the care itself, repeatedly the review team heard from mothers who did not always believe the right level of skills and expertise were available at the right time.\nThere was a failure to seek a second, more senior opinion, and to escalate concerns, especially with women with complex pregnancies.\nOne mother said: \"He told me there was no point calling the consultant on a Sunday as no one would come.\"\nAnother said: \"I never saw the same consultant. They didn't know me, and they didn't want to know me. I was pushed in and out of rooms with all sorts of people.\"\nMothers faced too many variables in the service offered - from the time of day they used it, to staffing levels and the communication skills of the staff they met.\nThe case of Sarah Handy\nSarah Handy's experience is highlighted in the report as illustrating a number of serious issues.\nIn pain, she was begging to see a doctor when she arrived in hospital in April 2017 and was left for nearly three hours without examination before being told it was constipation.\nMs Handy, 33, was sent back home to Merthyr Tydfil with laxatives and pain relief and that evening her baby Jennifer was delivered prematurely by her husband and mother-in-law. \nDespite their efforts to give CPR to save her life, Jennifer died.\nThe review said it showed:\nMs Handy said after the report came out: \"Today it's been proven in black and white that we were right to highlight our concerns and push for further investigation into our Jennifer's death.\n\"We just wish that this report will now do what it promised and improve the quality of care so that no other family has to go the traumatic experience we went through.\"\nOn communication, although individual staff were spoken of as excellent, many women felt during their care this aspect was extremely poor.\nWhen concerns were raised, there was a \"significant dissatisfaction\" with how they were dealt with, with dismissive attitudes.\nMany women were not listened to or taken seriously, one saying she was \"laughed at\" when she expressed concern.\nOther responses included: \"I was never asked, never believed.\n\"If only they had asked the right questions.\n\"Most importantly, we were not listened to. By the time we were it was too late.\"\nThe review said women reported an \"almost callous and brutal use of language\" and disregard for feelings.\nWhen one mother was concerned that she may be losing her baby she was told to \"prepare for the worst - it could be a miscarriage\" and then told to go home as \"there wasn't a lot she could do.\"\nYounger mothers in particular often felt their concerns were dismissed, which became an \"emerging theme\" for the review team.\nThere were failures to apologise, lack of access to notes and comprehensive investigations over concerns.\nWith high risk pregnancies, one woman interviewed believed that there was a lack of expertise and that \"anything different from the norm, they didn't seem set up to deal with it\".\nAnother described the antenatal clinic as being \"like a cattle-market\".\nWhen babies were lost, \"many women and families received no bereavement counselling or support and continue to experience emotional distress\".\nBut staffing shortages were recognised.\nOne mother talking about the demand on midwives and doctors in the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, said it was \"no way a reflection on them\". \n\"They would always spend as much time as possible with me but unfortunately when needs must I was left with some questions but again this was due to staff shortages,\" she said.\nAnother said: \"There were so many jobs for one midwife to do and then people wonder why mistakes get made. They are human and are exhausted\".\nThe review team said it was disappointing that lessons had not been learnt from a review of Furness General Hospital services four years ago.\nProf Jean White, chief nursing officer, said: \"It should be a joyous occasion giving birth to a child. Many of the women who shared their stories had care well below the standards we expect and that's not right.\n\"I think over time there appears to be a culture that has developed rather than an open culture where people are encouraged to say what's gone wrong, there is a blame culture.\"\nIn the words of another parent: \"Listen to women and families and believe what they tell you when they are in pain.\"\nThe review team concludes: \"The strong message heard from women and families in Cwm Taf is that they don't want their experiences to happen to anyone else and the importance to them that the organisation learns from these experiences to ensure that improvement and change occurs.\"\nCwm Taf chief executive Allison Williams said she was deeply sorry, is taking the findings very seriously but recognised \"significant work\" was still needed.\n\"Some of the feedback we have received from patients is extremely distressing and their experience in our maternity service has been totally unacceptable,\" she added.\nIf you have been affected by stillbirth, the following organisations might be able to help:\nTommy's - Funding research, saving babies' lives\nSands - Stillbirth and neonatal death charity\nSaying Goodbye - support for miscarriage and baby and infant loss"

Services in place are very variable. Failure to do more could have long-term consequences.\"\nA spokesman for NHS England said it was clear the pandemic had \"turned lives upside down\".\nHe said all Covid survivors who stayed in hospital will have a follow up appointment with either their GP or hospital team where their mental health would be assessed.\nThey were also able to refer themselves for psychological support, he added.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick\nHow have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Children,Child abuse,Bereavement,Self-isolation,Mental health,PTSD,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Children are developing serious mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress, because of the coronavirus pandemic, a charity has warned.\nIn a report, the Childhood Trust says disadvantage is leaving children extremely vulnerable.\nAs well as anxiety about their loved ones' health, many children are facing social isolation and hunger.\nLack of internet access is also setting disadvantaged children back.\nWith many classrooms still closed for lockdown, children unable to access the internet at home have been effectively shut out of online lessons. Teachers warn this will lead to entrenched inequalities between them and classmates from more affluent families.\nChildren in this position are also unable to access online therapy or other healthcare appointments they need.\nA lack of contact with teachers and GPs, who are trained to spot the signs of abuse and neglect, is also leaving kids who are experiencing abuse at home hidden and in danger.\nLaurence Guinness, chief executive of the Childhood Trust, told BBC News many children it had spoken to were experiencing \"vivid nightmares\" about the coronavirus and death - a possible side-effect of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nThese children had been particularly affected by the global death tolls, he said, which had made them worried their parents and friends would die of coronavirus. \n\"The rising death tolls being reported every day - these kids have seen all of that and internalised it,\" he said.\nThe report also quotes Dr Maria Loades, a clinical psychologist from the University of Bath, saying lockdown measures are \"likely to increase the risk of depression and probable anxiety, as well as possible post-traumatic stress\".\nGaliema Amien-Cloete, a primary school headteacher in London, told the BBC she'd also seen parents' anxieties around the coronavirus \"transferred to their children\".\nFor children, she added, the loss of routine, contact with friends and regular education is often experienced \"like a bereavement\". \nChildren in low-income households are also likely to develop anxiety when one or both parents is a key worker - hundreds of thousands of whom earn below the Living Wage Foundation's recommended living wage, according to BBC analysis. The anxiety is not only because of food shortages and poverty, but also because their parents are in high-risk professions.\nOne primary-school-age girl from London, quoted in the report, said she feels \"anxious because my mum works for the NHS, and I don't know if she's going to catch it or not\". Another young girl said every time her mother left the house to go to work she thought, \"mum's going to die, she's not coming back\".\nThe trust, which works with about 200 charities, also spoke to children with existing histories of mental health problems, to find out whether they were able to access the support they need. Of the 2,000 children with mental health conditions it spoke to, 83% said the coronavirus outbreak had made their mental health worse.\nUnder lockdown, community centres and support groups have adapted by moving their services online. However, these are not accessible to children without internet access - for example, those who are homeless and living in temporary accommodation, or in overcrowded housing without broadband.\nThese inequalities are interconnected, too. Children from black and other ethnic minority backgrounds, are more likely to live in overcrowded housing, making access to mental health help harder. At the same time, their parents are more likely to become seriously ill and to die of the coronavirus, making trauma in the kids more likely.\nMr Guinness told the BBC that children with special educational needs are also particularly hard-hit. For those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), for example, the loss of extra tuition and their set routines has been \"catastrophic\". Some parents said their children's development had already slipped back by as much as a year.\nVictims of child abuse and child sexual exploitation are also particularly at risk under lockdown, the report states. Former Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned of a \"surge\" in cases of child abuse earlier this month.\nThe Childhood Trust also points to a 21% rise in alcohol sales during the lockdown period, and quotes a statistic saying there are 2.6 million children living with a parent drinking hazardously, and 705,000 living with a dependent drinker.\n\"Children and young people caring for family members with substance abuse and/or alcohol problems may find their physical and mental health, relationships, and educational outcomes significantly more impacted than prior to the Covid-19 restrictions,\" the report says. This is particularly because of a lack of contact with teachers and health professionals who are trained to spot the signs of abuse.\nHeadteacher Ms Amien-Cloete told the BBC she believes these issues will continue to affect this entire generation of children well after the coronavirus crisis has passed.\n\"People keep saying 'when the coronavirus is over',\" she said. \"But there is no 'when this is over'. \n\"I think we need to be mindful that this won't be over for a long time, because we will have to cope with the impact of this on children. It's like grief - they say you never get over someone's passing, you only learn how to live with it. We shouldn't think it's all going to go back to normal when there are no more cases.\""

      "text": "Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from France have to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. \nThe government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. \nFrench authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France.\nBeta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa.\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants.\nThese tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. \nMost are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. \nSome of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations.\nBeta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled \"variants of concern\". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on.\nBeta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. \nAnother mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. \nThere is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people.\nAs with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions.\nVaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. \nThere is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections.\nBut experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary.\nA trial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK.\nSome of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. \nThe Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. \nSo far, the UK has recorded just over 1,000 cases of Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. \nSouth Africa has reported higher cases of Beta.\nWhen it was first identified in the UK, the government recommended surge testing in the community in some regions to help stop the spread. \nA system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. \nAlthough adults who were fully jabbed in the UK now no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. \nThey will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious. \nUK scientists are tracking variants, including Beta, to learn more and are providing genomic sequencing help to other countries so that they can do the same.

      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus vaccines,Gavin Williamson,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government will tell teachers and parents when schools in England can reopen \"as soon as we can\", the prime minister has said.\nMPs have called on the government to set out a \"route map\" for reopening amid concerns for children's education.\nBoris Johnson said he understood why people wanted a timetable but he did not want to lift restrictions while the infection rate was \"still very high\".\nHe would not guarantee schools would reopen before April's Easter break.\nMr Johnson said: \"We've now got the R [reproduction rate] down below 1 across the whole of the country, that's a great achievement, we don't want to see a huge surge of infection just when we've got the vaccination programme going so well and people working so hard.\n\"I understand why people want to get a timetable from me today, what I can tell you is we'll tell you, tell parents, tell teachers as much as we can as soon as we can.\"\nHe said the government would be \"looking at the potential of relaxing some measures\" before mid-February, with Downing Street clarifying that this meant looking at the data to decide \"what we may or may not be able to ease from 15 February onwards\".\nA further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded, according to Monday's government figures.\nAt Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose.\nBut he said the NHS continues to be under \"intense pressure\", with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, saying there are \"twice the number of people in hospital than we had in the first wave\" of the pandemic.\nRobert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast there was \"enormous uncertainty\" and called for the government to set out what the conditions needed to be for pupils to return to schools.\nThe Conservative MP for Harlow suggested the government could consider tighter restrictions in other parts of society and the economy, in order to enable schools to open.\nTory MPs were enraged by reports over the weekend that schools might not re-open fully until after the Easter holidays. \nMinisters say it's the progress of the pandemic that will determine their decision rather than a pre-agreed timetable. \nYet whenever the government speaks, parents hear dates. Whether it's that the situation will be reviewed at half-term. Or a pledge to give two weeks' notice when classes will come back. \nMPs are now pushing for more transparency from the government about how they'll assess the data, and for some ideas between school being mostly closed or totally open.\nThis issue is a perfect metaphor for the situation facing the entire country. Too much hope breeds disappointment, but living with uncertainty is just as hard. And you can come up with a plan but it might have to be junked if the virus has other ideas. \nChildren's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield joined the call for clarity and told the BBC: \"Children are more withdrawn, they are really suffering in terms of isolation, their confidence levels are falling, and for some there are serious issues.\" \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government wanted to \"see all children back at the very earliest moment\".\nSchools in England have been closed to most pupils since the national lockdown began on 5 January due to high levels of Covid transmission in the community.\nThere have been calls for teachers to be vaccinated sooner, although it is not clear if that would allow schools to reopen earlier.\nCovid death rates among educational professionals are not \"statistically significantly different\" to those in the general population, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, but secondary school teachers appeared to have an elevated risk compared particularly with people working in office-type jobs.\nAmong secondary school teachers Covid death rates were 39.2 deaths per 100,000 males, compared with 31.4 for all males aged 20 to 64, and 21.2 per 100,000 females, compared with 16.8, but the ONS said these were \"not statistically significantly different than those of the same age and sex in the wider population\".\nSchools will remain closed in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales until at least the February half-term - with the Welsh first minister saying it is \"unlikely\" all pupils will return after the break.\nGemma Cocker from Brighton is one of the many parents struggling to balance childcare, home learning and work. \nShe says she's having to share her work laptop with her son, who has already missed learning time after the family moved home and did not have internet access. \"We didn't have any internet. The school said they had reached their limit so couldn't take him,\" she says.  \nAnd because her children are young, she says: \"They're never just going to watch a classroom by themselves, you have to be with them the whole time.\"\nKitty Jones, 11, is in her last year of primary school and she says home learning is \"tricky\" because she is not used to using different remote platforms like Google Classroom and she wants to return \"as soon as possible\".\n\"I still think that I'm learning a bit, but I don't think I'm learning as much as I would be in person,\" she tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.\nHolly Agbukor, 18, is studying for her A-levels, says it is \"quite stressful\" learning at home, as it is a \"different environment, so it is not as easy to be fully present in the lessons\".\nBut, she says, while is it \"difficult\" working at home, \"I don't think it is worth the cost of reintroducing the virus into society and making things worse overall\".\nIn other developments:\nHow has home-schooling been going for your family?

      "tags": "Teaching,Schools,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Teachers were not at significantly higher risk of death from Covid-19 than the general population, Office for National Statistics figures suggest. \nRestaurant staff, people working in factories and care workers had among the highest death rates, followed by taxi drivers and security guards.\nNurses were more than twice as likely as their peers to die of coronavirus.\nSecondary school teachers may have been at slightly, but not measurably, higher risk than the average.\nThe ONS looked at death rates from coronavirus in England and Wales between 9 March and 28 December 2020.\nIt found 31 in every 100,000 working-age men and 17 in every 100,000 working-age women had died of Covid-19. \nThis equated to just under 8,000 deaths among 20-64-year-olds. \nBut care workers, security guards and people working in certain manufacturing roles died at more than three times the rate of their peers. \nTwo-thirds of deaths were among men.\nAs well as being more likely to be male, working-age people who died of Covid last year had other things in common: they were much more likely to work in jobs where they were either regularly exposed to known Covid cases or working in close proximity with other people more generally.\nMany of the highest-risk jobs were also relatively low paid and may be more likely to be casual or insecure, without sick pay, including hospitality, care work and taxi driving.\nAmong teachers, there were 18 deaths per 100,000 among men and 10 per 100,000 among women.\nBreaking that down by role, secondary school teachers appear to have a very slightly elevated risk at 39 deaths per 100,000 people in men and 21 per 100,000 in women.\nPer 100,000 men aged 20-64, 31 died in the population as a whole compared with:\nPer 100,000 women aged 20-64, 17 died in the population as a whole compared with:\nThese are illustrative examples, not an exhaustive league table. \nThe ONS calculated the rate by dividing the number of deaths by the number of workers in each job role.  \nBecause the numbers for secondary teachers were comparatively small - 52 deaths in total - it's difficult to be certain about their exact risk, but any increase there might be compared with the general population was not considered statistically significant.\nHowever, while teachers were not at higher risk than the average, they did appear to be at higher risk than some other professional job roles, which have seen very few or no deaths.\nThe ONS excluded from its analysis any occupation that had seen fewer than 10 deaths, and the average death rate for the whole population masks this variation.\nThe study also covers periods where there were limited numbers of children attending school. \nBut the figures do tell us teachers didn't have an elevated risk of the magnitude faced by health and care staff and by lower-paid manual and service workers.\nOther groups of staff studied with higher death rates, including hospitality and some factory and construction workers, also had their usual work paused for similar chunks of that period. \nWhile these figures tell us the death rates in each occupation group, they do not tell us the jobs are themselves causing more infections.\nThe ONS looked at age and sex but did not adjust for ethnicity, health or socioeconomic status which might influence an individual's risk.\nONS analyst Ben Humberstone said: \"As the pandemic has progressed, we have learnt more about the disease and the communities it impacts most. There are a complex combination of factors that influence the risk of death; from your age and your ethnicity, where you live and who you live with, to pre-existing health conditions. \n\"Our findings do not prove that the rates of death involving COVID-19 are caused by differences in occupational exposure,\" he added.\nThis also just refers to deaths, not infections which may result in serious illness.\nSome earlier ONS data suggested certain types of teacher may have an increased risk of catching coronavirus, although again the body did not consider this to be statistically significant.  \nDirector of policy for the Association of School and College Leaders teachers' union, Julie McCulloch, said: \"When trying to understand rates of coronavirus-related deaths, there are likely to be many complex factors and we need to be careful not to jump to conclusions about the relative risks of different workplaces. \n\"What we do know is that, when schools are fully open, education staff are asked to work in environments that are inherently busy and crowded. In order to give them reassurance, and to minimise the disruption to education, it is vital that they are prioritised for vaccination as soon as possible.\"\nWhether teachers should be prioritised for vaccines has been a matter of debate. \nAt the moment the programme is being rolled out based on what will save the most lives and prevent the most severe illness.\nAfter the oldest age groups, people with health conditions and frontline staff who are regularly exposed to the virus, the government will have to publish a new raft of priorities. \nVaccines minister Nadim Zahawi has indicated more people could be prioritised on the basis of their job role, including teachers, shop workers and police officers."

      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "text": "Boohoo is set to buy the Debenhams brand and website, the BBC understands.\nHowever, the fast fashion retailer will not be taking on any of the company's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce.  \nThe announcement could come as early as Monday morning. \nThe 242-year-old chain is already in the process of closing down, after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the business, with the likely loss of 12,000 jobs. \nA closing down sale at 124 Debenhams stores began in December, as administrators continued to seek offers for all, or parts of the business. \nIn the last week or so, the company announced that six shops would not reopen after lockdown, including its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street. \nBoohoo has already bought a number of High Street brands out of administration. It snapped up Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen, but not the associated stores. \nDebenhams and Boohoo declined to comment. \nDebenhams has struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping has moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April.\nHowever, its position became untenable during the coronavirus pandemic as non-essential retailers were forced to close for prolonged periods.\nThe firm had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May, as it struggled to stay afloat.\nBusinessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April.\nHowever the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of \u00a3125m, was rejected as being too low, leaving JD Sports as the last remaining bidder.\nMr Ashley had previously built up a 29% stake in the chain, but saw his \u00a3150m holding wiped out in 2019, when the company fell into administration and then ended up in the hands of its lenders - a consortium led by hedge fund Silverpoint.\nIn early December, the Frasers Group confirmed that it was working on a possible last minute rescue of Debenhams.\nThe announcement came five days after staff were informed and liquidators moved in to Debenhams' stores to start clearing stock, after a potential rescue deal with JD Sports fell through.\nBut Frasers said there was \"no certainty\" it could save the chain.\nOne of the biggest issues, it said, was the collapse into administration last week of another High Street giant, Arcadia, which is the biggest concession holder in Debenhams department stores."

      "tags": "Russia,Alexei Navalny,Moscow,Vladimir Putin,European Union",
      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has condemned as \"illegal and dangerous\" the mass rallies in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\nTens of thousands defied a heavy police presence to join the rallies across Russia on Saturday. More than 3,500 were detained, monitors say.\nEU foreign ministers discussed the protests on Monday, but did not agree on further sanctions on Russia.\nIn Moscow riot police were seen beating and dragging away demonstrators.\nThe foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are demanding \"restrictive measures against Russian officials responsible for arrests\".\nPoland's President Andrzej Duda also urged the EU to step up sanctions on Russia following the arrest of Mr Navalny. A week ago he was sentenced to 30 days in jail for violating parole conditions - a case he condemns as fabricated.\nMr Navalny, President Putin's most high-profile critic, called for protests after he was arrested at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, on arrival from Berlin on 17 January.\nDemonstrations were held on Saturday in about 100 cities and towns from Russia's Far East and Siberia to Moscow and St Petersburg. \nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the arrests as a \"slide towards authoritarianism\" and called for further sanctions against Russia.\n\"Change is in the air in Russia,\" declared Lithuania's new Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, as he arrived for his first meeting with EU counterparts.\nBut he soon discovered that change is not always in the air in Brussels.\nA couple of years ago, one seasoned Spanish politician lamented the meetings of the 27 EU foreign ministers as being \"more a valley of tears\" than a place for decision-making: \"We express our condolence and concern\u2026 but no capacity for action comes out of it.\"\nUnfortunately for that same politician - Josep Borrell - he's now the man who chairs these gatherings.\nThe EU has already imposed sanctions on six senior Russian officials - including the head of the FSB security service - over the nerve agent attack on Mr Navalny last August.\nBut MEPs are urging the EU to go further and hit Mr Putin's administration \"where it really hurts - the money\".\nIn December, the EU unveiled a tougher sanctions regime, including asset freezes and travel bans for foreign individuals accused of human rights violations. It puts the bloc alongside the US and UK, which adopted so-called Magnitsky Acts. \nThey take the name of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after reporting massive fraud by Russian tax officials. The EU version does not bear his name, to avoid alienating Russia-leaning member states.\nAgreeing on EU sanctions is always tough, as it requires all 27 countries to agree and we're told no concrete proposal was discussed by foreign ministers today.  \nObservers say the scale of the Russia-wide demonstrations was unprecedented for recent years, and the Moscow protest was the capital's largest in almost a decade.\nThey appeared to enjoy widespread passive support, with trolley bus passengers waving to the crowds and large numbers of car drivers beeping their horns.\nThe protests were also notable for the high proportion of young Russians who turned out. Opposition rallies have attracted more young people since Mr Navalny began releasing online investigations into alleged government corruption.\nOne such investigation released last week claimed President Putin had spent illicit funds on an extravagant Black Sea palace. The film, which was posted on YouTube, has been viewed more than 85 million times. Mr Putin has denied having any links with the palace in question.\nMany protesters said they were angered by the findings of that report, and chants of \"Putin is a thief!\" were heard during Saturday's demonstrations.\nSocial media also played a key role in driving young people - many of whom have only ever known a Putin-led Russia - to take to the streets. Posts promoting the demonstrations were viewed hundreds of millions of times on TikTok.\nThe flood of videos prompted Russia's official media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, to demand the app take down any information \"encouraging minors to act illegally\".\nMr Putin has said no underage children should take part in the protests: \"One must under no circumstances push forward underage people. After all, it is terrorists who act like that, when they drive in front of them women and children. The emphasis is slightly different, but essentially, this is the same thing.\"\nPolice should also act within the law, he said.\nNo-one should seek to advance \"their ambitious objectives and goals, particularly in politics\" through protests, he added, in an apparent reference to Mr Navalny.\nOn Sunday Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticised a message from the US embassy in Moscow warning people to avoid the demonstrations, branding the warning an \"interference in our domestic affairs\".\nThe embassy said such warnings were a \"common and routine practice\". \nMeanwhile, the Russian embassy in the UK also accused Western nations of using their embassies to encourage the protests.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is not yet clear if a pledge to vaccinate 70% of over-80s and those in care homes has been reached, Wales' health minister has said.\nVaughan Gething said it would not be known for the \"next day or two\" if the target - which was due to be hit by the weekend - was met.\nMore than 270,000 people have had their first dose of the vaccine.\nHe said the programme had \"gathered pace,\" with a \"sharp acceleration\" in the vaccines given.\nFigures show that 8.6% of Wales' population had been vaccinated in seven weeks. \nThis is currently above both Scotland (7.6%) and Northern Ireland (8.4%), according to latest figures.\nAsked why the daily figure - 6,295 - was so low, the Welsh Government said it was a combination of a delay in data entry and verification over the weekend and snowfall, which closed four vaccine centres.\nA spokesperson said: \"Data takes time to feed through to us, and snowfall meant some centres and GP clinics were closed, and people chose to reschedule their appointments this weekend.\n\"A massive amount of work was done last week and will be done this week. We fully expect to catch up with those missed appointments this week, with tremendous effort being made over the next 48 hours.\"\nWales' opposition parties welcomed the increase in vaccination rates in Wales over the past few days, but warned there should be no \"let-up\" going forward.\nLast week, Mr Gething was criticised after he said a majority of over-80s had been vaccinated when they had not - he later said he made a mistake.\nThe latest Public Health Wales figures show 270,833 people have had their first dose of the vaccine, including 88,005 of over-80s - or 48.1%.\nHowever Mr Gething said there was a \"lag\" in the statistics.\nHealth officials say this is to allow verification and quality assurance work on the figures, which have to be inputted by GP clinics carrying out the immunisation. This work can take four or five days.\nBased on the latest figures, Wales needs to give first doses to about 23,500 people a day to meet its target of reaching the four priority groups by mid-February.\nIn the Senedd last Tuesday Mr Gething said he expected 70% of over-80s in Wales, and 70% of care home residents, to receive their first jab by the end of the weekend.\nAt the press conference the minster said: \"We don't have all the data back from the vaccination centres and GP practices around Wales.\"\nHe hoped to publish the data by Wednesday. \nMore than 70% of care home workers had been reached, he said, and all 16 GP practices in Powys will start vaccinating this week.\nThe health minister said some people in their 70s were getting the vaccine ahead of those in the over-80s bracket because of the progress that had been made.\n\"Because we've made such good progress in vaccinating over-80s in large parts of Wales... some health boards are able to make progress with that part of the programme,\" he said. \nMr Gething added that Wales was \"on track\" to offer vaccines to the top four priority groups by mid-February. \nVaccinating more than 20,000 people each day is \"what we can do on a regular basis if we have the supply,\" he said, saying they were aiming to vaccinate \"north of 140,000 each week on a regular basis\".\nThe new Conservative leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said it was \"really good to see that everyone's pulling together to get this ramp up in the rollout of the vaccine\" but warned that \"it's all got to be repeated again\" in providing the second dose. \n\"Everyone is going to have to have a second vaccination and the energy and effort that's going to be required in that is going to be huge, and that's why we keep calling for a vaccination minister to be at the heart of this to ensure that there is no lack of energy, no lack of decision-making energy, within this rollout.\"\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said that it was \"great to see the heroic efforts over the last few days, and this huge acceleration in the rate of vaccination is very welcome\".\nBut he said it was \"very important now that we see no let-up, because whether or not the Welsh Government has met the target, there will still be many people in Wales in the top priority group that will want to be vaccinated yet.\""

It's cheaper to come to South Tyneside and take it away,\" he said.  \n\"But what we are doing is urging people not to come here and take it away, it's there for a reason.\"\nThe Pampas grass helps to bond poor soils found at the coast, while Marram grass helps to prevent erosion in the dunes.\nSigns are to be erected warning people not to pick the grass because it is already in need of replenishment, the council said. \n\"Through Covid, we have a massive amount of people coming to the coastal town, it's Benidorm without the sunshine,\" he added.\n\"It's great to see people at the seaside enjoying it [the grass] and that's what it's part of. It's there for everybody to view.\"\nGarden designer George Wright said Pampas grass was \"very popular\" and he had seen demand increase two or three times at his nursery in West Boldon. He also expressed concern for the area.\n\"Once they take the flower heads themselves they take the seeds. Eventually this will become very much a patchy area and they will all start to decline.\n\"Pampas grass is becoming more and and more popular at the moment and I think a lot of it is people are starting to extend their houses into the garden so they want something nice in there, and also it's being used for interior decoration in houses.\"\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nThe government will give a timetable for when pupils in England can go back to school \"as soon as we can\", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said - but there's no guarantee schools will reopen before April's Easter break. Amid concerns for children's education and wellbeing - as well as parents saying they're \"knackered and confused\" by home schooling - the PM said he understood why people want a timetable, but that he doesn't want to lift restrictions while the coronavirus infection rate remain \"very high\". In a Downing Street news conference, Health Secretary Matt Hancock added that the pressure on the NHS remains \"relentless\" with more Covid patients on ventilators in the UK now than at any time in the pandemic. So, what could allow schools to reopen?\nModerna's Covid vaccine appears to work against new, more infectious variants of the virus originally found in the UK and South Africa, say scientists from the pharmaceutical company. Early laboratory tests suggest antibodies triggered by the vaccine can recognise and fight the new variants, which have been spreading fast in dozens of countries. More studies are needed to confirm this is true for people that have been vaccinated.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer is self-isolating for the third time, after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus. He said he has no symptoms but will be working from home until next Monday after being notified of the contact. Sir Keir last self-isolated in December after a member of his staff tested positive for Covid-19, and also self-isolated in September after a member of his family showed symptoms.\nPeople in Lebanon are living under one of the world's strictest lockdowns. Under the round-the-clock curfew, citizens who are not \"essential workers\" have been barred from leaving their homes since 14 January. Twelve-year-old student Laila (pictured below) says she misses her friends and struggles to study in the same room as family members also working remotely. Read our full story to hear more from Laila and other residents of the Lebanese capital, Beirut.\nA sea shanty singer has become an internet star at the age of 82 with his recording of a song aimed at encouraging people to have the Covid vaccine.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "The UK has embarked on the most ambitious public health campaign in NHS history - vaccinating tens of millions of adults against the potentially deadly Covid-19 virus.\nEngland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all set targets to immunise the most at risk first. The common pledge is that by mid-February, all those aged 70 and over will have been offered the first of two injections.\nSo, with just one week of January left, what do we know about the vaccine rollout? \nThe latest Scottish Covid vaccination figures show 46% of people aged 80 and over have received their first dose. And the most recently published figure for England reports that 56.3% of the over-80s group have been vaccinated. However, those two percentages do not paint the most up-to-date picture.\nWhile Scotland's numbers show a daily breakdown on who has had the jab, the English figures come from a weekly report.\nThis make it difficult to compare between the four UK nations, and explains why politicians often cite vaccine numbers that don't match the most recently published data.\nFor example, UK government Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Monday's teatime briefing that 78.7% of over-80s had received a first vaccine.\nThis is much higher than the 56.3% \"official\" published figure from NHS England.\nMr Hancock said that the UK had a better supply of the vaccines than \"nearly every other country in the world\" and it was a \"magnificent feat\" by the NHS that three quarters of all over 80s had been vaccinated. He added that \"three-quarters of care homes\" in England had been covered in the rollout. Mr Hancock has lauded the programme so far but he admitted that the \"rate-limiting factor is supply, and supply is tight\". \nPublic Health Scotland also publishes a weekly report with a full vaccination breakdown and from Monday 25 January it is also highlighting the daily statistics about the priority vaccination groups. \nOn Monday, Ms Sturgeon said 95% of care home residents and 95% of frontline care workers had received the first of their two jabs. However, she acknowledged the lower percentage of over-80s in the community being vaccinated.\nShe explained: \"I have set out many times why in focusing on care homes first we are at a slightly lower proportion of over-80s but that is picking up pace now, and I am absolutely confident in meeting the targets that we have set. \n\"So, yes I am confident and assured  around the planning of this but I am not complacent about it - we continue to make sure that we are, on a daily basis, taking the decisions and supporting the wider service to get this programme administered as quickly as possible.\n\"This is the most important thing the government is doing at the moment.\"\nWhen Scotland's vaccination programme got under way on Monday, 14 December it \"very deliberately\" set out to target care homes, care home workers and NHS staff.\nThe policy was designed to focus on the most vulnerable and was in line with the priority list compiled by the JCVI, which advises on vaccine rollout across the UK.\nAccording to the latest figures, about 116,000 of 270,000 people in the over-80s group have been given their first dose of the vaccine.\nThis means that about 77,000 people a week will need to be vaccinated over the next two weeks to meet the 5 February target.\nAnother 474,000 people between 70 and 80 will need to be vaccinated by a week later.\nDaily figures for Monday 25 January also show that England has vaccinated 12.9% of the total adult population with the first dose and Scotland has so far reached 9.4%.\nDaily vaccination figures do not include a breakdown of the over-80s group across all UK nations. England provides these detailed statistics only in a weekly report. \nThe latest figures show:\nNicola Sturgeon has said Scotland is on track for all over-80s to have been offered the first dose by the end of the first week in February.\nIn Scotland people under 50 account for almost half of vaccinations administered up to Sunday 17 January (46.6%).\nThree-quarters of those vaccinated were are female, perhaps reflecting the make-up of the staff in the NHS and care homes.\nAs of Monday 25 January, 218,985 vaccinations have gone to health care workers and 36,108 to care home staff.\nWhen the most at risk are vaccinated the immunisation programme will move to younger members of society. The Scottish government's vaccine deployment plan dates include:\nBy early March:\nBy early May:"

      "text": "Nine Chinese miners have been found dead a day after 11 of their colleagues were rescued after two weeks trapped in a gold mine in Shandong province.\nThe Yantai city mayor confirmed the deaths, state broadcaster CCTV said. One miner remains missing. Another died last week after falling into a coma.\nThe miners became trapped in the Hushan mine when the entrance to the tunnel collapsed after a blast on 10 January.\nThere was joy on Sunday after the 11 were brought to the surface.\n\"From Sunday afternoon to this afternoon, rescue workers have not stopped searching, and found a further nine trapped miners who unfortunately all died,\" Yantai Mayor Chen Fei told a briefing on Monday.\n\"Along with one miner who died on Thursday, the bodies of the nine deceased miners were all lifted out of the mine.\"\nRescue efforts had been expected to take weeks, but took a \"big step forwards\" on Sunday morning when \"a huge obstacle blocking the well suddenly fell to the bottom of the shaft,\" lead rescue worker Du Bingjian told the state-run Global Times.\nThe first man to be rescued had been trapped in a different part of the gold mine to the main group of 10.\nTV footage showed him being lifted out as emergency workers cheered. He was blindfolded to protect his eyes from the light and was immediately taken to hospital for treatment, with his condition described as \"extremely weak\".\nAbout an hour after his rescue, 10 more miners were brought out from a different section of the mine. CCTV said one of them was injured. \nSeveral others were seen walking by themselves, supported by rescue workers, before being transported to hospital.\nThe nine dead miners were believed to have been in the \"Sixth Central Section\" of the mine, but details of how they were located are not yet known.\nThe miners had been working 600m (2,000ft) beneath the surface when the unexplained explosion happened, severely damaging entry to the mine and cutting off communication. \nFor a week, there was no sign of life. Then, on 17 January, rescuers felt a pull on one of the ropes they were lowering into small shafts leading down into the dark.\nA paper note was then sent up on a rope from a group of 12 surviving miners - 11 trapped in one place and a 12th trapped further below.\nAfter that, the contact with the 12th miner was lost, while one of the group of 11, who had fallen into a coma after sustaining a head wound in the explosion, was confirmed dead on Thursday. \nA communication line was established and food and medicine were lowered down through a narrow shaft. \nThe miners received porridge and nutritional liquids, and a few days before their rescue, requested a traditional meal of sausages. \nMining accidents are not uncommon in China, where the industry safety regulations can be poorly enforced. In December last year, 23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine. \nIn September, 16 workers were killed at another mine on the outskirts of Chongqing, also due to carbon monoxide. In December 2019, an explosion at a coal mine in Guizhou province, south-west China, killed at least 14 people."

      "text": "A senior White House official has criticised the Trump administration's rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine calling it \"chaotic\" and \"very limited\".\nPresident Joe Biden's Chief of Staff Ron Klain said there was no plan in the federal government for the distribution of vaccines across the US.\nThe president, who took office last Wednesday, has promised 100 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days.\nThe US has now reported more than 25 million Covid-19 cases.\nAbout 417,500 deaths have been linked to the virus. In recent weeks, the daily number of Covid-linked deaths in the US has, on some days, exceeded 4,000.\nPresident Biden signed a raft of new measures last week, including boosting vaccinations and testing. He has implored Americans to wear masks and warned that the death toll could get much worse.\n\"Let me be clear - things will continue to get worse before they get better\", he said.\nPresident Biden's efforts follow widespread criticism of the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic and of the vaccination programme. \nVaccines have been distributed to states, and states and cities are carrying out the inoculations. But some have complained they are struggling with supply.\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 41 million doses had been distributed by Saturday across the country, but only 20.5 million had been administered.\nSpeaking to NBC News, Mr Klain said: \"The process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole, did not really exist when we came into the White House.\"\nHe said it was a \"complex\" process but that the Biden administration would set up federal vaccination sites to help states without enough places.\nTotal cases went over 25 million on Sunday, according to tracking data from Johns Hopkins University.\nInfections have spiralled in recent months - with a jump in new infections after Thanksgiving and Christmas, according to the Covid Tracking Project.\nHospital numbers hit their highest levels during the pandemic earlier this month but are slowly starting to drop alongside daily cases.\nDr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said on Thursday that rolling average data appeared to show infections levelling off.\nAlthough the national picture has stabilised slightly, he warned the country remained in a \"very serious situation\".\nThe CDC is particularly concerned that new variants could accelerate the virus spread. It issued a warning that the new more transmissible strain first detected in the UK could become the dominant strain across the US by March.\nThe strain has been detected in 20 states, Dr Fauci said Thursday, but warned the country had \"limited ability\" to track its spread through the population. \nPresident Biden has already enacted a raft of executive measures to combat the virus and he wants Congress to pass a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) package of economic relief funding. \nThe president is hoping to get bipartisan approval for his broad stimulus agenda, but the proposal has already been met with scepticism and resistance by some Republicans. \nAnother one of the new president's key promises is to oversee 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office, but some have criticised this policy as not ambitious enough.\n\"When I announced it, you all said it's not possible,\" Mr Biden said on Thursday when asked if his goal was high enough. \"Come on, give me a break, man. It's a good start.\"\nThe current approved suppliers - Moderna and Pfizer - have pledged to deliver 200 million doses by March. Dr Fauci has also suggested emergency approval of a third vaccine, a single-dose jab by Johnson & Johnson, could be just weeks away.\nDr Fauci, who was appointed chief medical adviser by the new president, has expressed hope that if 70-85% of the US population is vaccinated by the end of summer, the country could \"approach a degree of normality\" by autumn. \n\"It's not going to be perfectly normal, but one that I think will take a lot of pressure off the American public,\" he told a White House briefing.\nPresident Biden's administration has also re-engaged with the World Health Organization (WHO) and is joining its Covax programme to help ensure vaccine access worldwide. The move was welcomed by WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "

      "text": "A person's pupils can reveal if they have suffered a traumatic experience in the past, according to new research. \nThe joint Swansea and Cardiff universities study found the eyes of people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) behave differently. \nIt found their pupils have an exaggerated response when viewing exciting or dangerous images.\nThose behind the study said it could be useful in diagnosis, treatment and in bench-marking progress. \nNormally pupil size fluctuates with changing light levels, but it can also alter when a person is scared, excited, or even concentrating hard. \nShocking or surprising images can cause pupils to enlarge, however the researchers discovered this reaction was highly exaggerated in people who have experienced a traumatic event.\nThree groups of people were tested - some with diagnosed PTSD, others who had experienced a traumatic event but had no PTSD, and a control group of people with no previous issues.\nProf Nicola Gray, of Swansea University, co-authored the study with Prof Robert Snowden of Cardiff University. \nShe said: \"The pupil normally shows a fast constriction when the person sees a new image, but then the pupil gets bigger - especially if the picture is arousing, such as a scary image of, for example, fierce animals or weapons. \n\"However, the patients with PTSD behaved differently in both phases. First, their pupil did not constrict much when shown a new picture, and then it expanded more to the scary images than for people without PTSD.\"\nOne man with PTSD who wished to remain anonymous described how, after his time in the Army, he was left unable to drive at night because his pupils could not contract sufficiently in response to street lights and on-coming headlights, leaving him dazzled and unable to see properly.\nThe research found the PTSD group showed enlarged pupils to images which were positive and exciting. \n\"When we displayed exciting scenes, such as a sporting triumph or an image of a person sky-diving, these images elicited the same enhanced pupil response in the PTSD group as the frightening pictures,\" Prof Snowden said.\n\"The subjects weren't frightened by these images, but the images were arousing. Once again, the people with PTSD showed a far greater response, indicating that they were even more aroused by these images than the other participants\". \nAccording to Prof Gray this finding could help to develop new therapies for PTSD.\n\"If exciting, but non-threatening, images elicit the same response, then it may be possible in the future to use them to gradually reduce the arousal levels of people experiencing PTSD.\"\nPTSD is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events.\nSomeone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt.\nThey may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult.\nThese symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person's day-to-day life.\nCauses of PTSD can include: \nSource: NHS \nProf Gray said the research may also be useful from a diagnostic perspective. \n\"PTSD comes in many forms, from people who have experienced a one-off sudden event like a car crash, to those who have gone through many traumatic events over a period of months or years via abuse.  \n\"Sometimes people struggle to express these thoughts, or might even play them down in order to please the therapist.  \n\"Having a more objective method to look for these signs of hypervigilance and hyperarousal may be useful in order to obtain a more accurate benchmark of how the person is progressing.\""

      "text": "Moderna's Covid vaccine appears to work against new, more infectious variants of the pandemic virus found in the UK and South Africa, say scientists from the US pharmaceutical company. \nEarly laboratory tests suggest antibodies triggered by the vaccine can recognise and fight the new variants. \nMore studies are needed to confirm this is true for people who have been vaccinated.\nThe new variants have been spreading fast in a number of nations.\nThey have undergone changes or mutations that mean they can infect human cells more easily than the original version of coronavirus that started the pandemic. \nExperts think the UK strain, which emerged in September, may be up to 70% more transmissible. \nCurrent vaccines were designed around earlier variants, but scientists believe they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. There are already some early results that suggest the Pfizer vaccine protects against the new UK variant.\nFor the Moderna study, researchers looked at blood samples taken from eight people who had received the recommended two doses of the Moderna vaccine. \nThe findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but suggest immunity from the vaccine recognises the new variants. \nNeutralising antibodies, made by the body's immune system, stop the virus from entering cells. \nBlood samples exposed to the new variants appeared to have sufficient antibodies to achieve this neutralising effect, although it was not as strong for the South Africa variant as for the UK one.  \nModerna says this could mean that protection against the South Africa variant might disappear more quickly. \nProf Lawrence Young, a virus expert at Warwick Medical School in the UK, said this would be concerning. \nModerna is currently testing whether giving a third booster shot might be beneficial. \nLike other scientists, the company is also investigating whether redesigning the booster to be a better match for the new variants will be beneficial. \nStephane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said the company believed it was \"imperative to be proactive as the virus evolves\".\nUK regulators have already approved Moderna's vaccine for rollout on the NHS, but the 17m pre-ordered doses are not expected to arrive until Spring. \nThe vaccine works in a similar way to the Pfizer one already being used in the UK. \nMore than 6.3 million people in the UK have already received a first dose of either the Pfizer or the AstraZeneca vaccine.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has resigned - and it is not clear if he will be able to form and lead a new coalition government.\nParties are divided over spending in the coronavirus crisis, in which more than 85,000 Italians have died. \nMr Conte met President Sergio Mattarella, who may ask him to form a stronger government. Last week he lost his Senate majority. \nBut someone else could become Italy's PM, or a snap election could be called. \nThe law professor, who has headed coalition governments since 2018, tendered his resignation to the president. And now Mr Conte is discussing the political crisis with Senate president Elisabetta Casellati. \nPresident Mattarella is expected to spend two days in talks with party leaders, as it is up to the president to decide the next move.\nThe centrist coalition government was plunged into crisis two weeks ago when former PM Matteo Renzi pulled his small, liberal Italia Viva party out of it. He said he would only return if Mr Conte accepted a list of demands. \nMr Conte survived a vote of confidence in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, last week. He then won a Senate vote, but without an absolute majority.\nThe lack of a majority would restrict government business - hence the political shake-up.\nMr Renzi's main objection was to Mr Conte's plans for spending \u20ac209bn (\u00a3186bn; $254bn) of EU recovery funds - part of a \u20ac750bn EU rescue for the Covid crisis.\nMr Renzi says EU funds should be invested in promising sectors like digital and green technologies, and wants MPs, rather than technocrats, to decide on the allocations. But he also wants more investment in the embattled health service. \nItaly, now mired in recession, was at the epicentre of the pandemic in Europe last year.\nMr Renzi governed Italy in 2014-2016, but currently his Italia Viva party is polling below 3%.\nAnd so Italy's 66th government since World War Two comes to a close. A country of seemingly perennial political crises has chosen the worst possible time to face another - in the grip of a pandemic that has killed more than 85,000 Italians and unleashed the worst economic collapse in decades. \nThat's why Giuseppe Conte may manage to come back with a new revamped government, arguing the need to avoid the turmoil of fresh elections at such a difficult time. Added to that, polls suggest an early vote would be won by the far right. So Mr Conte is hoping that the threat of losing their seats might tempt enough centrist politicians to jump the opposition ship and join a reformed coalition. \nItaly's 29th prime minister since the war is hoping to return as\u2026 Italy's 29th prime minister since the war. But his opponents are circling. And he won't have much time to convince parliament that he can become the new, stronger comeback kid. \nThere are several options: \nMr Conte, an independent technocrat, has led two very different, successive governments.\nFor 15 months he headed a coalition between M5S and the far-right League, whose leader Matteo Salvini pulled out in a failed bid to force elections.\nSince then he has led a four-party, centre-left coalition dominated by M5S and the PD."

      "tags": "Companies,Boeing 737 Max 8,Aviation accidents and incidents,Boeing,Aviation safety,Lion Air plane crash,Air travel,Ethiopian Airlines crash,European Union,United States",
      "text": "A former senior manager at Boeing's 737 plant in Seattle has raised new concerns over the safety of the company's 737 Max.\nThe aircraft, which was grounded after two accidents in which 346 people died, has already been cleared to resume flights in North America and Brazil, and is expected to gain approval in Europe this week. \nBut in a new report, Ed Pierson claims that further investigation of electrical issues and production quality problems at the 737 factory is badly needed.\nRegulators in the US and Europe insist their reviews have been thorough, and that the 737 Max aircraft is now safe.\nIn his report, Mr Pierson claims that regulators and investigators have largely ignored factors, which he believes, may have played a direct role in the accidents. \nHe explicitly links them to conditions at the company's factory in Renton, near Seattle at the time. Boeing says this is unfounded.\nLion Air flight JT610 crashed into the sea off Indonesia in October 2018. Five months later, Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 came down minutes after take-off from the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.\nInvestigators believe both accidents were triggered by the failure of a single sensor. It sent inaccurate data to a piece of flight control software, called MCAS. \nThis automated system then repeatedly forced the nose of the aircraft downwards, when the pilots were trying to gain height. Ultimately each aircraft was pushed into an unrecoverable dive.\nEfforts to make the 737 Max safe have focused on redesigning the MCAS software, and ensuring it can no longer be triggered by a single sensor failure.\nFor Ed Pierson, this does not go nearly far enough. A US Navy veteran, who had a senior role on the 737 production line from 2015-2018, he was a star witness during congressional hearings into the disasters involving the Max.\nHe told lawmakers he had become so concerned about conditions at the factory, he had told his bosses that he was hesitant about taking his own family on a Boeing plane.\nHe testified that during 2018, the factory was in a \"chaotic\" and \"dysfunctional\" state as, he claimed, staff there struggled under pressure from managers to build new planes as quickly as possible.\nNow, he is worried that these issues have been overlooked in the rush to get the 737 Max back in the air.\nHis report draws on material from the official investigations. It claims that both of the crashed aircraft suffered from - what he believes were - production defects, almost from the moment they entered service. \nThese included intermittent flight control system problems and electrical anomalies that occurred in the days and weeks before the accidents. \nHe claims these may have been symptoms of flaws in the aircrafts' highly complex wiring systems, which could have contributed to the erroneous deployment of MCAS.\nHe also points out that sensor failures contributed to both accidents and asks why such failures were happening on brand new machines.\nIn the case of the Lion Air plane, a faulty sensor was replaced with another part that was not properly calibrated.\nAll signs, Mr Pierson says, \"point back to where these airplanes were produced, the 737 factory\". \nHowever, he insists that the possibility of production defects playing a role in the accidents has not been addressed by regulators.\nHe claims this could lead to further tragedies, involving the Max or even a previous version of the 737.\nMr Pierson's concerns are supported by the celebrated aviation safety campaigner Captain Chesley Sullenberger.  \nBest known as \"Sully\", one of the pilots who safely ditched a crippled and engineless Airbus plane in the Hudson river off Manhattan in 2009, he too believes that modifications to the Max do not go far enough. \nHe believes changes are needed to warning systems aboard the plane, which were carried over from a previous version of the 737 and are \"not up to modern standards\".\n\"Ed Pierson's report is very disturbing, about manufacturing issues in the Boeing factories that go well beyond just the Max, and also affect\u2026 the previous version of the 737,\" says Capt Sullenberger.\n\"There are many critically important unanswered questions that must be answered. \n\"Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must finally become more transparent, and begin to provide information and data, so that independent experts can determine the worthiness of the work that's been done.\"\nThe BBC has also spoken to a former senior inspector with the UK's Air Accident Investigations Branch (AAIB), who now works as a safety specialist. He warns that Mr Pierson's findings should be viewed in a wider context. \nThe report, he says, does make some \"valid observations\" about the pressures on Boeing's production line and quality control, and concerns about specific components. \nHowever, he adds that \"taking the limited information in any accident report\u2026 and making fresh interpretations of it, is not the same as conducting a new investigation\". \nThe issues highlighted, he adds, \"may have been investigated and dismissed already, for good reason\". \nThe FAA, meanwhile, insists it only approved the return to service of the Max, following a \"comprehensive and methodical safety review process\". \nIt adds: \"None of the many investigations of the two accidents produced evidence that a production flaw played a role\", and emphasises that \"every aircraft leaving the factory is inspected by a team of FAA inspectors before it is cleared for delivery\".\nBoeing itself will not comment on whether the electrical and flight control problems highlighted by Mr Pierson may have played a factor in the two accidents, on the grounds that this is a matter for the investigating authorities.\nIt has, however, described suggestions of any link between conditions at Renton and the two accidents as \"completely unfounded\", emphasising that none of the authorities investigating the crashes has found any such link. \nPatrick Ky, the head of Europe's aviation safety agency, EASA, has previously told the BBC he is \"certain\" the plane is safe to fly.\nBut relatives of those who died aboard ET302 are continuing to urge the agency not to allow the 737 Max to operate in Europe, \"until continuing concerns about the aircraft's safety have been fully and openly addressed\"."

      "text": "Testing for different variants of Covid-19 is \"massively more advanced\" in NI than in the Republic, the first minister has said.\nArlene Foster commented on social media after Taoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin said his \"understanding\" was NI was not testing for the new variant.\nMrs Foster said she had spoken to Mr Martin on Monday.\nShe tweeted that he had \"accepted that Northern Ireland is testing for SARS-CoV-2\".  \nSpeaking to Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 on Saturday, Mr Martin had said: \"When I discussed this with the leaders, their view was the variant doesn't appear to be as big an issue in the north... I can't understand that.\"\nOn Monday, the NI Department of Health announced 17 further deaths linked to Covid-19 and 422 more cases of the virus.\nThe Republic of Ireland reported a further seven Covid-19 related deaths and 1,372 more cases.\nThe department released a statement on Sunday saying \"in light of some misleading commentary in recent days\", it wanted to detail \"the ongoing work in Northern Ireland to identify new variants of the Covid-19\".\nIt said that \"whole genome sequencing\", which is used to identify and track new strains of Covid-19, had been in place in Northern Ireland \"from an early stage of this pandemic\". \nIt is thought that up to 50% of current Covid-19 cases could be related to the new \"English\" variant, which is thought to be about 50-70% more infectious than the original strain.\nSpeaking on BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen's University, said: \"I think we need to be fairly concerned about this, for a couple of these variants they're actually changing how the virus behaves.\n\"This one, in particular, seems to be more transmissible, which means more people getting infected, more people getting sick and more people dying.\"\nWhen asked on Good Morning Ulster about the new variant, Dr David Farren, a consultant microbiologist, said: \"It's not true to say we're not looking for it, but we are only looking for it, in a small number of cases.\" \nWhen asked if it is inevitable that the new variant becomes the dominant variant he said there's \"certainly a high risk of that\".\nMrs Foster also said on Twitter that she \"pressed\" the taoiseach on sharing travel locator forms and that he \"committed to movement soon on that issue\".\nThe first minister and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill have criticised Dublin for failing to share information on travellers arriving there during the pandemic in order to help control the spread of any new Covid-19 variant.\nMs O'Neill said she was \"hopeful\" the Irish government will soon share information with the executive about the movement of visitors to the Republic.\nShe added that there needed to be greater co-operation between the two governments and that it should not be \"an orange and green issue\". \nMeanwhile, numbers being immunised at NI's vaccination centres have declined as the phase focused on healthcare workers comes to an end, the Department of Health has said.\nHealth trusts are now planning to invite clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) patients to receive their vaccine.\nThe department said CEV patients would be contacted in due course.\nIt also urged healthcare workers to take up the offer of a jab quickly.\nThe department said there was no \"diminution\" of work at vaccine centres after a letter from the Southern Health Trust indicated the need for some vaccinators would be \"limited\" in the next four to six weeks.\nThe speed at which the vaccines are being delivered has slowed somewhat over the past week, according to official government data, but Northern Ireland remains one of the vaccination success stories.\nThe Department of Health said the NI vaccination data for 23 and 24 January - as reported at UK-wide level - \"is only partial information as it does not contain the GP vaccination figures\".  \nAs of Monday, 159,642 people in Northern Ireland had received a first vaccine dose.\nThat represents more than 10.5% of the NI population.\nMore than 20,000 people have received a second dose.\nThe Department of Health said that a further announcement on the timing of the start of vaccinations for those aged 70 and over, the wider clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) group and those aged 65 and over will be confirmed later this week. \nIn a separate development, the military medical personnel who will be assisting in the battle against Covid-19, will be in hospitals in Northern Ireland by the end of the week.\nThe medics who are of paramedic grade in the RAF, Army and Navy will take up nursing assistant roles.

There was sewage in the house, so his ground floor needs totally gutting.\"\nMr Morris said Gareth and his girlfriend are staying in a hotel as they wait to be allowed back to assess the damage.\nHe hopes their insurance firm will pay to rent a home for them, adding: \"I can honestly see them being out of their house for between six and 10 months.\n\"They are obviously devastated - they have only been in there for 12 months so everything was near enough brand new.\"\nCerys Thomas was at her mother's house with her son, in Goshen Park, when she saw water coming through the front door. \nShe said: \"I said to my mother to get my son and herself out and up toward the street. I phoned the police then, because I could see it was going to be an emergency, and within minutes my parents' conservatory doors just blew through. \n\"The pressure of the water just blew through the house and the water, within minutes, was up to my waist. \n\"Trying to get out of the house was very scary because the pressure of the front door was getting pushed back.\" \nShe said the street was under water \"within seven minutes\". \n\"It was something you would see in a movie,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, the Coal Authority said it has identified the cause of the \"blow out\".\nChief executive Lisa Pinney told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"Firstly, I just want to say our thoughts are with everyone affected by this flooding and we are genuinely sorry people have been affected in this way.\n\"What we know so far is the blow out was caused by a blockage underground which caused water to break out, basically to find the easiest path, and there's no doubt the excessive rainfall in the days before was also a factor in that.\"\nMs Pinney said crews had been able to find the site of the collapsed mineshaft which had caused the flooding, and the authority had started to \"develop options\".\n\"We really understand people want to get back into their homes, they want to collect things, they want to know what the next steps are,\" she continued.\n\"We are working as fast as possible to make that happen and we hope to be able to provide some more information in the next day or so, but you will understand that we have to be sure for public safety.\"\nMs Pinney said there are almost 300 mine shafts or entries across the Skewen mine works, which covers an area of about 12 sq km (7.6 sq miles).\nShe added: \"We have checked all recorded shafts in the immediate area and we are doing continued checks over the coming days.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Scottish independence,Gordon Brown,Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The public's trust in the way the UK is run is breaking down, former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has warned.\nHe said Covid-19 had exposed \"tensions\" between Whitehall and the nations and regions, who were often treated by the centre as if they were \"invisible\". \nMr Brown is urging Boris Johnson to set up a commission to review how the country is governed and powers shared.\nBut the PM said his focus was on the pandemic, stressing the benefits of the union could be \"seen everywhere\". \nRecent opinion polls have suggested rising support for Scottish independence and potentially for a border vote in Northern Ireland.\nMr Brown's intervention comes amid a looming clash between Mr Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has demanded the UK agree to another Scottish independence referendum if the SNP wins a majority in May's Holyrood elections. \nThe Court of Session is hearing arguments about whether Holyrood can legislate to hold one even if the UK government continues to object.\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Brown - who advocates a federal system with more power for nations and regions - says the pandemic has \"brought to the surface tensions and grievances that have been simmering for years\" between Downing Street and the various parts of the UK.\nHe points to \"bitter disputes\" over issues such as lockdown restrictions and furlough and said unless underlying tensions were resolved, the UK risked becoming a \"failed state\". \nIn an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today, he said at a time \"when all should be pulling together and intensifying co-operation across the UK\" there was division and claims by the leaders of Scotland and Wales and the English regions that they were not being properly consulted. \nLast year there were rows between the government and local authorities over coronavirus tiers, with the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, objecting to plans to put the region into the strictest level of restrictions.\nMr Brown told Today that while he was \"confident\" that Scotland would still be part of the UK in ten years time, the way the UK was governed had to change. \n\"I think the public are fed up. I think in many ways, they feel they are being treated as second class citizens, particularly in the outlying areas, that they are invisible and forgotten.\"\n\"Something has broken down in trust and has to be repaired.\"\nMr Brown is advising the Labour Party on its devolution strategy - but has also held talks with government ministers including Michael Gove in recent weeks. \nGovernment sources say they are focused on taking tangible steps to demonstrate the value of the UK.\nThe idea of a fundamental review of the UK's power structures has been suggested as one possible way to counter support for Scottish independence ahead of May's Holyrood election. \nBut a series of polls now suggest support for independence is higher than support for the union - and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will demand another referendum if, as seems likely, her party - the SNP - wins in May.  \nHe is calling on Boris Johnson to immediately set up a commission on democracy to review how the UK is governed, something the Conservatives promised in their manifesto before the last general election.\nIn his Telegraph article, he suggests it would find that the UK needs a Forum of the Nations and Regions, citizens' assemblies, and a greater focus on the benefits of cooperation in areas such as the NHS and the armed forces.\nThe current Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer also supports devolving more powers from Westminster but opposes another Scottish independence referendum.\nThe SNP said last week that there would be a \"legal referendum\" after the pandemic if May's Holyrood election returned a pro-independence majority.\nAsked if he would stand in the way of this, Mr Johnson said what the British public wanted was for its political leaders to focus on beating coronavirus, adding that the advantages of the UK's four nations working together \"spoke for themselves\". \n\"I think people can see everywhere in the UK the visible benefits of our wonderful union,\" he said.\n\"A vaccine programme that is being rolled out by a National Health Service, a vaccine that was developed in labs in Oxford and is being administered by the British Army.\"\nBut the SNP said the Scottish people, not Westminster-based politicians, should decide the country's future. \n\"No amount of constitutional tinkering from Labour would protect Scotland from Brexit or the Tory power grab - only independence can do that,\" said Kirsten Oswald, the party's deputy Westminster leader.\n\"The Scottish people will see right through this attempt to deny their democratic right.\"\nA poll commissioned by the Sunday Times in Northern Ireland found 51% of people wanted a referendum on Irish unity in the next five years.\nDUP leader and Northern Irish First Minister Arlene Foster said such a vote would be \"absolutely reckless\".\nNumbers supporting Wales breaking away from the UK also appear to be rising. The pro-independence campaign group Yes Cymru has said membership swelled from 2,000 at the start of 2020 to more than 17,000. \nPlaid Cymru has also promised to hold an independence referendum if it wins the next Senedd election.\nResponding to Mr Brown's intervention, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: \"It's been clear for many years that the UK doesn't work for Wales - I'm glad that the Labour Party are starting to see that.\""

      "text": "It is \"difficult to put a timeline\" on when England's lockdown could be lifted, Matt Hancock has said.\nThe health secretary said there were \"early signs\" the measures were working but it was \"not a moment to ease up\".\nHe said there were 37,000 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK and \"more people on ventilators than at any time in this whole pandemic\".\n\"The pressure on the NHS remains huge and we've got to get that case rate down,\" he said.\nThe number of coronavirus cases in the UK has been falling, but the number of people in hospital remains high, as does the UK's daily death numbers.\nA further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded, according to Monday's government figures.\nThe are 4,076 people in hospital on ventilators.\nUnder the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons.\nThis includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAt Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said: \"I understand the yearning people have to get out of this.\n\"The thing is that we have to look at the facts on the ground and we have to monitor those facts.\n\"And of course, everybody wants to have a timeline for that, but I think most people understand why it is difficult to put a timeline on it because it's a matter of monitoring the data.\"\nHe set out the factors the government would take into account when reaching decisions over lifting the restrictions, including: the death rate, the number of people in hospital, whether there were new coronavirus variants and the success of the vaccine rollout.\nAlmost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, Mr Hancock said, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose.\nThe falling numbers of infections being reported and the rising rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming forward for a test because of the snow.\nBut that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of lockdown.\nWhat is concerning ministers are the high numbers in hospital.\nThe number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but at a very high rate.\nClose to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to hospital.\nTo put that in context, that is four times the total number of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter.\nIt means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave.\nWith better treatments available, patients are spending longer in hospital.\nSo come mid-February the pressures in hospital are likely to be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions.\nThe big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly vaccination will have an effect on admissions.\nThere is encouraging early news from Israel that hospitalisation really starts to drop three weeks after the first dose.\nIf that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change.\nBut until that happens the government - in the words of Health Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve.\nSpeaking at the Downing Street press conference, Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, warned: \"We are not out of this by a very long way.\"\nShe said current coronavirus rates were still causing concern, patience was needed about the vaccination programme and the NHS still faced its usual winter pressures.\nSusan Hopkins, from Public Health England, said the UK need to see the death rate \"fall much lower\" before any decision to ease measures.\nShe said teams were currently studying the impact on the UK's vaccine programme of the variant first identified in South Africa.\nBut she added the \"consensus view\" from four UK laboratories suggested that \"the current vaccine works against the variant that was first discovered in the UK\".\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Credit cards",
      "text": "Credit card giant Mastercard is to raise the fees it charges EU merchants when UK cardholders buy goods and services from them online by fivefold.\nIt has sparked fears that consumer prices could rise if merchants choose to pass on those costs, especially on items not available from UK retailers.\nTransactions with airlines, hotels, car rentals and holiday firms based in the EU could all be affected. \nMastercard attributed the move to the UK's decision to leave the EU. \nIt said that only online sales would be affected and that \"in practice\" UK consumers would not notice the change. \nThe change affects the \"interchange\" fees Mastercard sets on behalf of big banks, so that its customers can use their payment networks. \nFrom October, Mastercard said it would increase these fees to 1.5% on every transaction, up from 0.3%.\nThe EU introduced a cap on such fees in 2015 after concerns they pushed prices up for consumers and unfairly burdened companies.\nBritish customers makes tens of billions of pounds of purchases every year from European merchants on credit cards alone - and the hike in fees from Mastercard will affect the majority of those. \nThe increase may be relatively small but it's significant, coming at a time when retailers may face extra paperwork and checks - higher costs - for goods coming into the UK. \nWith Covid  restrictions bringing their own challenges, businesses, especially smaller ones,  may be compelled to pass on the costs to consumers.\nAnd it's not just items crossing borders. The payments for most items bought on Amazon in the UK are processed via its Luxembourg headquarters.\nWith the increase not coming in for several months, international companies may look at ways to reclassify UK sales, to avoid the charges. \nMastercard is implementing the rises simply as it's no longer bound by the restrictions imposed by the UK being in the EU. The banks which receive the fees have said in the past that they are invested in areas such as card security and innovation. This time, however, the trade body which represents them has declined to comment on the rises.\nBut Mastercard said that since the end of the Brexit transition period, the cap no longer applied to many payments between the UK and European Economic Area (which also includes Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).\n\"As a result of the UK leaving the EEA, Mastercard will adapt interchange rates on UK cards to the commitments it gave the European Commission in 2019 for non-EEA card transactions,\" the company said.\n\"In practice, only EEA merchants making e-commerce sales to UK cardholders will see a change.\"\nKevin Hollinrake, chair of the parliamentary group on Fair Business Banking, told the Financial Times, which first reported the story, that the move \"smacks of opportunism\".\nAnd Callum Godwin, chief economist at CMSPI, the global payments consultancy, said airlines, hotels, car rentals and travel groups would be hit. \n\"[This will happen] anywhere the consumer is in the UK and the merchant is in the EU,\" he said. \nHe added that many firms in these industries were already struggling due to the pandemic.\u00a0\nVisa, Mastercard's larger rival, has not announced plans to change its fees but told the FT it was keeping the issue under review. \nCompanies in the UK and EU are already facing added costs and delays due to post-Brexit trade rules brought in on 1 January.\nSome EU exporters have already stopped deliveries to the UK because of new VAT related charges.\nMeanwhile, UK consumers who have bought goods from firms based in the bloc have found themselves facing hefty charges to cover customs duties, taxes and administration."

Some reports said sticks and stones were used, but there were no gunshots.\nAn Indian army statement played down the incident, saying there \"was a minor face-off at Naku La area of North Sikkim on 20 January 2021 and the same was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols\".\nOne source told the Times of India that both sides brought in reinforcements after a \"brawl\" but there was no gunfire and the situation was under control.\nChina's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian did not give details of the incident, but said China's troops were \"committed to upholding peace\" and urged India to \"refrain from actions that might escalate or complicate the situation along the border\".\nThe editor-in-chief of China's state-affiliated Global Times tweeted there was \"no record of this clash in the patrol log of the Chinese side\".\nAnalysis by Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi\nThe latest reports about skirmishes show that tensions are still running high. The Indian army statement shows that both nations are still keen on keeping the dialogue route open and don't want skirmishes to derail the process.\nThey have conducted several military-level talks to ease tensions but nothing concrete has come of them yet.\nAnd troops are still facing each other at several flashpoints along their contested border.\nSome former Indian officers say such exchanges can't be avoided when the situation is so fluid. But they agree that talks need to continue as both nations would not want a war - not even a limited one. \nA lot of the 3,440km (2,100-mile) border is ill defined. Rivers, lakes and snowcaps mean the line can shift, bringing soldiers face to face at many points, sometimes leading to confrontations.\nThere was a minor clash last May at Naku La, which is at an altitude of more than 5,000m (16,000ft). One month later a deadly clash erupted in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh. In addition to the Indian deaths, China also reportedly suffered casualties although it made no official comment.\nSince the savage hand-to-hand fighting there, in which no shots were fired, the two sides have held de-escalation talks. The ninth round of them took place between military commanders on Sunday in eastern Ladakh but there have been no details of any agreements.\nThe nuclear-armed neighbours have a lot to lose, with China one of India's biggest trading partners.\nRelations have worsened amid the border face-off. Both have stepped up infrastructure construction along some of the border areas.\nIndia's government has also banned more than 200 Chinese apps, citing cyber security concerns.\nThe two countries have fought only one war, in 1962, when India suffered a heavy defeat.\nAn agreement was signed in 1996 barring the use of guns and explosives from the Line of Actual Control, as the disputed border is known. It has held, although both sides did accuse each other of firing warning shots or shots into the air in Ladakh last September.\nThe tiny east Himalayan region has been a key flashpoint between India and China for decades. It saw clashes in their 1962 war. Five years later, fighting along its border left several hundred soldiers dead on either side.\nThe former kingdom was an Indian protectorate at the time, and only became the country's 22nd state after a referendum in 1975.\nSikkim is near a high-altitude plateau known as Doklam in India and Donglang in China.\nIndia fears that greater Chinese road access to the plateau would threaten India's strategically vulnerable \"chicken's neck\", the 20km (12-mile) wide Siliguri Corridor that links seven north-eastern states, including Assam, to the rest of the country.\nThe border in Sikkim is also crucial for another reason. Indian military experts say it's the only area through which India could make an offensive response to a Chinese incursion, and the only stretch of the Himalayan frontier where Indian troops have a terrain and tactical advantage. They have higher ground, and the Chinese positions there are squeezed between India and Bhutan."

      "text": "It is not yet clear if a pledge to vaccinate 70% of over-80s and those in care homes has been reached, Wales' health minister has said.\nVaughan Gething said it would not be known for the \"next day or two\" if the target - which was due to be hit by the weekend - was met.\nMore than 270,000 people have had their first dose of the vaccine.\nHe said the programme had \"gathered pace,\" with a \"sharp acceleration\" in the vaccines given.\nFigures show that 8.6% of Wales' population had been vaccinated in seven weeks. \nThis is currently above both Scotland (7.6%) and Northern Ireland (8.4%), according to latest figures.\nAsked why the daily figure - 6,295 - was so low, the Welsh Government said it was a combination of a delay in data entry and verification over the weekend and snowfall, which closed four vaccine centres.\nA spokesperson said: \"Data takes time to feed through to us, and snowfall meant some centres and GP clinics were closed, and people chose to reschedule their appointments this weekend.\n\"A massive amount of work was done last week and will be done this week. We fully expect to catch up with those missed appointments this week, with tremendous effort being made over the next 48 hours.\"\nWales' opposition parties welcomed the increase in vaccination rates in Wales over the past few days, but warned there should be no \"let-up\" going forward.\nLast week, Mr Gething was criticised after he said a majority of over-80s had been vaccinated when they had not - he later said he made a mistake.\nThe latest Public Health Wales figures show 270,833 people have had their first dose of the vaccine, including 88,005 of over-80s - or 48.1%.\nHowever Mr Gething said there was a \"lag\" in the statistics.\nHealth officials say this is to allow verification and quality assurance work on the figures, which have to be inputted by GP clinics carrying out the immunisation. This work can take four or five days.\nBased on the latest figures, Wales needs to give first doses to about 23,500 people a day to meet its target of reaching the four priority groups by mid-February.\nIn the Senedd last Tuesday Mr Gething said he expected 70% of over-80s in Wales, and 70% of care home residents, to receive their first jab by the end of the weekend.\nAt the press conference the minster said: \"We don't have all the data back from the vaccination centres and GP practices around Wales.\"\nHe hoped to publish the data by Wednesday. \nMore than 70% of care home workers had been reached, he said, and all 16 GP practices in Powys will start vaccinating this week.\nThe health minister said some people in their 70s were getting the vaccine ahead of those in the over-80s bracket because of the progress that had been made.\n\"Because we've made such good progress in vaccinating over-80s in large parts of Wales... some health boards are able to make progress with that part of the programme,\" he said. \nMr Gething added that Wales was \"on track\" to offer vaccines to the top four priority groups by mid-February. \nVaccinating more than 20,000 people each day is \"what we can do on a regular basis if we have the supply,\" he said, saying they were aiming to vaccinate \"north of 140,000 each week on a regular basis\".\nThe new Conservative leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said it was \"really good to see that everyone's pulling together to get this ramp up in the rollout of the vaccine\" but warned that \"it's all got to be repeated again\" in providing the second dose. \n\"Everyone is going to have to have a second vaccination and the energy and effort that's going to be required in that is going to be huge, and that's why we keep calling for a vaccination minister to be at the heart of this to ensure that there is no lack of energy, no lack of decision-making energy, within this rollout.\"\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said that it was \"great to see the heroic efforts over the last few days, and this huge acceleration in the rate of vaccination is very welcome\".\nBut he said it was \"very important now that we see no let-up, because whether or not the Welsh Government has met the target, there will still be many people in Wales in the top priority group that will want to be vaccinated yet.\""

      "text": "Riot police in the Netherlands have clashed with protesters angry at new coronavirus restrictions.\nOfficers used water cannon and tear gas to clear demonstrators in Eindhoven. They had gathered in defiance of a new 21:00 (20:00 GMT) curfew.\nSome protesters threw fireworks, looted supermarkets and smashed shop windows. There were smaller demonstrations in the capital, Amsterdam.\nMore than 100 people have been arrested.\nSome of the demonstrators threw fireworks and grabbed bicycles to build barricades against the police, who eventually used tear gas to clear the streets.\nA Covid-19 testing centre was also set alight on Saturday evening in the northern village of Urk, local authorities said. \n\"The fire in a screening centre in Urk goes beyond all limits,\" Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said.\nThe 21:00 to 04:30 curfew, enforced on Saturday, is the first in the Netherlands since World War II. Violators face a \u20ac95 (\u00a384) fine.\nBurning bikes were built into barricades, supermarkets looted.\nIn Eindhoven, golf balls and fireworks were hurled at police in full riot gear, who eventually used tear gas to clear the crowds.\nThe scenes of violent unrest spread across the country: Amsterdam, Tilburg and Enschede, where young men threw stones at a hospital and torched a Covid testing centre. \nNational Security Council Chairman Hubert Bruls said that, while he understood the protesters' frustrations, the more the Dutch persevere now, the sooner they can get their freedoms back. He labelled those involved in the violence not demonstrators, but \"corona hooligans\". \nActually many see vaccines as the key, and the Netherlands is lagging behind there - last in the EU to roll out its vaccine programme, to date 77,000 people have been given their first dose. \nAt the start of the outbreak, the Dutch government resisted measures like masks and curfews, telling Dutch citizens they were sensible, rule-abiding and didn't need to be treated like children. \nThat sense of exceptionalism has come back to haunt them. Almost a year on, some people are struggling to do the mental pivot required to accept that the Netherlands has been forced to introduce draconian measures it initially dismissed. \nThe curfew was passed in parliament on Thursday, albeit with a slightly later start time than the proposed 20:30.\nThe country's bars and restaurants have been shut since October, while schools and non-essential shops closed last month. \nA ban on flights from the UK, South Africa and South America has been put in place due to fears over new variants of the virus. \nThere have been more than 944,000 cases and 13,646 confirmed deaths from Covid-19 in the Netherlands.

      "tags": "The Flaming Lips,Live music,Coronavirus pandemic,Music",
      "text": "The Flaming Lips have staged a unique pair of gigs in Oklahoma, with both the band and their audience inside individual inflatable balls.\nEach show accommodated 100 bubbles, holding up to three people each, with the band inside their own capsules.\nThe concept came from frontman Wayne Coyne, who often rolls over the crowd in a Zorb ball during the band's gigs.\nSpeaking ahead of the concerts, Coyne said they would be \"safer than going to the grocery store\".\nInside each bubble was a high frequency supplemental speaker - which helped prevent the sound being muffled - as well as a water bottle, a battery-operated fan, a towel and a \"I gotta go pee/hot in here\" sign.\nIf it got too hot, the bubble was refilled with cool air using a leaf blower, and fans who needed the bathroom were escorted by venue staff once they had put on a mask and stepped outside their cocoon.\nThe shows were postponed from their original dates in December due to a spike in coronavirus cases in Oklahoma before Christmas.\nThe band held a test run for the concerts in October after debuting the idea in a one-song performance for Stephen Colbert's US chat show last June.\n\"It's a very restricted, weird event. But the weirdness is so we can enjoy a concert before putting our families and everybody at risk,\" Coyne told Rolling Stone last month. \n\"I think it's a bit of a new normal - you might go to a show, you might not, but I think we're going to be able to work it out.\"\nFriday's show saw the band play classics including Do You Realize, She Don't Use Jelly and Race For The Prize alongside tracks from last year's American Head album.\nThey also played a cover of Daniel Johnston's True Love Will Find You in the End on what would have been the singer's 60th birthday.\nThe gigs were filmed by a professional crew, and cameraman Nathan Poppe documented the process of putting the show together on Twitter.\nHe explained that the ground floor of The Criterion theatre was divided into a 10x10 grid, with a space bubble inside each square.\nPoppe added that, because the sound of the audience was muted, clapping was replaced by people \"punching the top of their bubble\".\nThe success of the concerts raises the question: Could other bands replicate the experience?\nThe answer seems to be yes, as long as the right venue is found and staff and audience members take reasonable precautions.\nSpeaking to TMZ last year, Coyne explained that you need a lot of open space around the venue so that masked ticketholders can remain socially-distanced before they get into the bubbles - a process that takes about 20 minutes. \nThe bubbles, he added, hold enough oxygen for three people to breathe for \"over an hour and 10 minutes\" before they need to be refreshed, although a towel is needed to wipe down the condensation.\nAccording to an instructional video posted on the singer's Instagram feed, the concert ends with everyone rolling their bubbles to the exit door, where they must re-attach masks before unzipping and leaving the venue.\n\"Safety, safety, safety,\" Coyne told fans. \"But fun too!\"\nWhile packed concerts may be little more than a hazy memory in most parts of the world, 22,000 fans flocked to see rock band Six60 in Hastings, New Zealand, on Saturday with no need for masks or social distancing.\nIt was the second date of their tour, after another 20,000 watched them play in Waitangi last weekend.\nThe fans were asked to check in to the venue by scanning a QR code, and to have a Covid-tracing Bluetooth app enabled in case they did come into close contact with anyone with the virus.\nThe country, with a population of five million, has recorded 1,927 confirmed cases and 25 deaths over the course of the pandemic. On Sunday, it reported its first case outside a quarantine facility in more than two months.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "France's top medical adviser said on Sunday that a third national lockdown would probably soon be needed to combat coronavirus in the country.\nA strict curfew was implemented last weekend, but cases continue to climb.\nProf Jean-Francois Delfraissy, head of the scientific council that advises leaders on Covid-19, said \"there is an emergency\" and this week was critical.\nHe called for swift government action, amid rising concerns about the spread of new variants of the coronavirus. \nProf Delfraissy said data showed a new more transmissible variant first detected in the UK now makes up between 7-9% of cases in some French regions and will be hard to stop. \nHe said the country was in a better situation than others in Europe, but described the new variants as the \"equivalent of a second pandemic\".\n\"If we do not tighten regulations, we will find ourselves in an extremely difficult situation from mid-March,\" the advisor warned during an interview with BFM television.\nThe French government is expected to meet on Wednesday to decide if further measures are needed.\nOfficials have so far resisted implementing a third national lockdown, preferring an overnight curfew system which allows schools to stay open.\nBut daily infection numbers are rising - with the seven-day moving average now above 20,000 despite the 18:00 curfew. \nFrench Prime Minister Jean Castex previously said restrictions could be imposed \"without delay\" if the situation deteriorated further.\nThe country's virus death toll topped 73,000 on Sunday, as the country tightened restrictions on arrivals into the country. \nUnder new rules anyone entering from inside the EU by air or ferry must now present a negative Covid-19 test result within 72 hours of travel. Those entering France from the EU by road, including cross-border workers, will not be required to take a test.\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said last week that all non-essential travel \"must be strongly advised against\" but EU nations have so far agreed to keep borders open.

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nMost pupils across the UK have not been in school since before the Christmas holidays - and now Tory MPs are calling for a \"route map\" for the reopening of schools in England. Pupils have been told they will be learning from home until at least the February half-term holidays. And Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says schools will be given at least two weeks' notice to reopen - which he \"hopes\" will happen before Easter. So, with no firm timetable, the chairman of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, has called for a plan to be laid out to MPs. He has asked for an urgent question in the Commons - if granted, Mr Williamson must respond. No part of the UK has yet announced a firm date for schools' reopening - you can read about the different nations' plans here.\nThe UK must reform how it is governed or risk becoming a \"failed state\", former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has warned. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he says Covid has exposed \"tensions\" between Whitehall and the nations and regions. Recent polls have suggested rising support for Scottish independence - and a potential border vote in Northern Ireland. \"The complaint is that Whitehall does not fully understand the country it is supposed to govern,\" says Mr Brown.\nFrance's top medical adviser says a third national lockdown will probably soon be needed to combat Covid-19. Prof Jean-Francois Delfraissy says \"there is an emergency\", adding that the \"UK variant\" now makes up between 7-9% of cases in some French regions. A strict curfew was implemented last weekend but cases continue to climb. You can see police enforcing the 6pm shutdown below.\nRiot police in the Netherlands have clashed with protesters who are angry at new coronavirus restrictions. Officers used water cannon and tear gas to clear demonstrators in Eindhoven. They had gathered in defiance of a new 9pm curfew. Some protesters threw fireworks, looted supermarkets and smashed shop windows. There were smaller demonstrations in the capital, Amsterdam. \nAustralia has suspended a travel bubble with New Zealand - after NZ's first Covid case in months was confirmed to be the South African variant. The infected patient had served 14 days in quarantine and tested negative twice before developing symptoms later. Travellers coming from New Zealand to Australia in the next 72 hours will now have to go through hotel quarantine.

      "text": "Fewer than 2,000 young people have so far started new roles under the government's \u00a32bn Kickstart jobs scheme, data shows. \nThe programme, which launched in September, has created 120,000 temporary jobs to date.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC coronavirus restrictions were making it harder for more young people to get started.  \nHowever, he expected the number to rise once restrictions are lifted. \n\"Obviously because of the lockdowns and restrictions, that hampers businesses' ability to bring people into work,\" said Mr Sunak, \n\"What we can look forward to, as the restrictions ease, is more of these young people starting those placements.\n\"But taking a step back, we announced this scheme first week of July, it went live the first week of September and here we are, just a few months later, with 120,000 jobs having being vetted, funded and created.\"\nThe Chancellor insisted that the government had moved at an \"enormous pace\" to set up the programme, which targets youths at risk of long-term unemployment. \n\"I've always said my priority through this crisis is to protect, support and create as many jobs as possible, and young people in particular have been at the forefront of my mind,\" said Mr Sunak.\n\"We know that they're most likely to work in affected sectors, they're twice as likely to be furloughed, and the ones leaving college are entering a really difficult labour market.\"\nYouth unemployment rose to 14.5% between August to October 2020, with 597,000 people aged 16 to 24 unemployed, up from 11% in the same period in 2019.\nLatest data from the Department of Work Pensions shows that as of 15 January, 1,868 young people had begun their placements. \nHayden Finlayson, 24, is one of them. He was made redundant from a retail job last summer. \nLooking for work during the pandemic proved difficult: \"You start thinking about things - whether you're going to find work again.\"\nHe has secured a Kickstart placement at a Whistl distribution centre in Bedford, an opportunity for which he is grateful. \n\"I gave it a go. It's a new experience and I want to do new things,\" he said. \"[I'm learning] different skills every day, things I've never done before.\"\nBusinesses apply to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to create Kickstart places, which are then vetted for suitability. \nYoung people aged between 16 and 24 who are on Universal Credit are matched to roles by their job centre work coaches. \nThey are then interviewed by the prospective employer, which decides whether to take them on. \nFor each successful placement, the government covers the National Minimum Wage for a six-month period, at 25 hours per week. \nA further \u00a31,500 grant is available per placement to help cover setup costs and assist in the development of employability skills. The current \u00a32bn budget allows for around 250,000 roles.\nFollowing criticism from small businesses, firms who wish to create just a handful of roles will have the option of applying direct to the Department for Work and Pensions.\nPreviously, small firms who wanted to create fewer than 30 Kickstart jobs had to group together, or use a \"gateway\" provider as an intermediary. \nMore than 600 gateways have now been approved, but small businesses complained that they found the process slow and difficult.\n\"The decision should have been made in September,\" said Craig Beaumont, chief of external affairs at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).\n\"There is now a backlog of cases of people who've been appointed through intermediaries, who've not been able to access that work yet. So we need a real focus from the government to clear that.\"\nAsked if the scheme would need extending because continuing restrictions could prevent its aims being achieved this year, Mr Sunak left the possibility open.  \nAnna Szymanowska runs Fighter Shots, which makes ginger-based remedy drinks.  She is keen to create three digital marketing Kickstart roles as soon as possible. \nHowever, she says her application - which was done in a pool with other businesses - took a long time.\n\"It was a little bit lengthy, because the first time I heard of the scheme was July or August,\" she told the BBC.\n\"We applied within a month [of hearing about it], and just yesterday we received a contract to sign. So it was lengthy but otherwise well managed.\"\nThe Chancellor told the BBC that the changes hadn't been made earlier because Kickstart had been set up \"at speed\". He pointed out other interventions aimed at supporting young people's jobs, including investment in employment support schemes, training and apprenticeships. \nTracy Fishwick is the managing director of Transform Lives Company, a social enterprise which helps people into work. \nShe believes that the young people chosen to have Kickstart placements will be very important.\n\"The young people who really probably would already get a job with a little bit of help - we don't want all the Kickstart jobs going to those young people,\" said Ms Fishwick, who previously worked with the Future Jobs Fund - a scheme for young people created by Labour in 2009.\n\"We need to be able to put things in place to support those young people who were already unemployed before Covid.\""
