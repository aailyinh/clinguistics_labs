      "tags": "Abortion,US Supreme Court,Texas,US abortion debate",
      "text": "The US Supreme Court will allow Texas to maintain a near-total ban on abortions, but will take up the case next month in a rare sped-up process.\nThe law, known as SB8, gives any person the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past six-weeks - before most women know they are pregnant.\nThe Supreme Court said it will focus on how the law was crafted and whether it can be legally challenged. \nIt is considered extraordinarily rare for the top US court to expedite cases. \nLower courts have yet to issue final rulings on the so-called Texas Heartbeat Act.\nThe controversial law - which makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest - bans abortion after what some refer to as a foetal heartbeat. \nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says that at six weeks a foetus has not yet developed a heartbeat, but rather an \"electrically induced flickering\" of tissue that will become the heart.\nThe Texas law is enforced by giving any individual - from Texas or elsewhere - the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point. However, it does not allow the women who get the procedure to be sued.\nThe Biden administration has previously said it would ask the court to block the law. Since 1973's landmark Roe v Wade Supreme Court case, US women have had a right to abortions until a foetus is able to survive outside the womb - usually between 22 and 24 weeks into pregnancy.\nThe US is one of seven out of 198 countries to allow elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Washington Post.\nLawyers for the state of Texas asked the justices on the court to consider overruling the landmark Roe decision, as well as a separate case that affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion. The court did not accept that request.\nOral arguments in the case have been set for 1 November. The Supreme Court said that it would wait for those arguments to take place before taking any action. \nIn a written dissent, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the expedited timeframe would offer \"cold comfort\" for women in Texas who are hoping for abortion treatment. \nShe was the only one of the Supreme Court's nine judges to advocate blocking the law in the short-term. \n\"Women seeking abortion care in Texas are entitled to relief from this court now,\" she wrote. \"Because of the court's failure to act today, that relief, if it comes, will be too late for many.\"\nThe law came into effect in Texas on 1 September. \nAbortion providers and opponents of the law had called for it to be lifted until the Supreme Court took up the case. \nWhole Woman's Health, which operates four clinics in Texas, tweeted that \"the legal limbo is excruciating for both patients and our clinic staff\". \nExperts believe that the oral arguments may provide a glimpse into how the Supreme Court will approach other abortion cases. \nIn December, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a separate case regarding a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks."

      "tags": "Carbon capture and storage,Greenhouse gas emissions,COP26,Climate change,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Countries have set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.\nThey hope to achieve the target of \"net zero\" by 2050, to help slow global warming.\nNet zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nAchieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.\nGreenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.\nMeanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.\nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises \"well below\" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. \nExperts say that to achieve this, net zero must be reached by 2050. \nNot all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain have to be compensated for, or offset - for example, by planting more trees.\nAlmost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of reducing carbon, although there may not be enough space for the number required.\nCarbon capture and storage has also been suggested as another solution. \nThis involves using machinery to remove carbon from the air, then solidifying it and burying it underground.\nHowever, the technology is still emerging, very expensive and as yet unproven.\nIt won't be easy. \nReaching net zero will involve moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our power, and abandoning vehicles run on petrol and diesel, in favour of those powered by electricity and hydrogen.\nGas central heating will need to be replaced by alternative sources, such as heat pumps. \nReaching net zero could also mean flying far less in future, and eating less red meat.\nPresenting the government's net zero strategy to the House of Commons in the run up to COP26, the government pledged:\nThe government had already announced a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, and that all the UK's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035.\nAt the time, Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband called the latest announcements \"a massive let-down\".\nMore than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050.\nHowever, China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 in the world - says it's aiming for \"carbon neutrality\" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. \nRussia - the third-largest producer of oil worldwide - has also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. \nUntil recently President Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures.\nUS President Joe Biden criticised the Russian and Chinese leaders for not attending the COP26 summit. \nIndia - the world's fourth biggest emitter of CO2 after China, the US and the EU - has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070. \nSome of the world's most heavily populated countries - including Indonesia - haven't made any net zero commitment.\nBut many of the announcements which have already come out of the COP26 summit on deforestation, cutting methane and reducing coal are directly linked to helping countries hit their net zero goal.\nThere's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.\nFor instance, Country A might record lower emissions if it shuts down energy-intensive industries such as steel production. \nBut if Country A then imports steel from Country B, it's effectively handed on its carbon emissions to Country B instead of reducing the sum total of greenhouse gases.\nThere are schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. \nHowever, some climate scientists worry such arrangements could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their own fossil fuel usage. \nAnd it's hard to say that initiatives funded to offset emissions elsewhere would not have happened anyway.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "Transport,COP26,Glasgow City Council",
      "text": "Disruption is expected in Glasgow over the weekend as the first major road closures for COP26 take effect.\nRoutes including the Clyde Arc and part of the Clydeside Expressway closed on Saturday night while Finnieston Street will only allow local access on Sunday.\nRail strikes also look set to go ahead for the duration of the summit, following a breakdown in union talks. \nThe climate conference is expected to draw 25,000 delegates and runs from 31 October to 12 November. \nSecurity is expected to be tight, particularly around the attendance of some 120 world leaders, and police have announced how they plan to approach disruptive climate activists.\nRoad closures will last until Monday 15 November. \nSome days are expected to be busier than others, with the biggest disruption expected on Saturday 6 November which has been designated as the Global Day For Climate Justice.\nAbout 100,000 protesters are expected in Glasgow, with a march which begins at Kelvingrove Park at noon before making its way to Glasgow Green for about 15:00.\nPeople across the city can expect to be affected by delays, diversions or road congestion, from pedestrians and cyclists to drivers and those using public transport.\nThe RMT confirmed that strikes during COP26 would go ahead, with ScotRail workers planning action from 1-12 November amid an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions.\nThe union's general secretary Mick Lynch said the decision to press on with industrial action was made on Friday after the train company \"failed to get serious\" in talks with the union.\nHe said ScotRail had missed \"a golden opportunity\" for progress by offering \"nothing of any consequence\". \nMr Lynch continued that there was still time to avoid \"the chaos of a transport shutdown during COP26 if the key players get back with some serious proposals\". \nA Scottish government spokesperson welcomed that three out of four railway trade unions had now accepted, or recommended acceptance of, the pay offer. \nThat offer amounts to a 2.5% pay increase backdated to 1 April 2021, and a 2.2% increase effective from 1 April 2022, with a one-off \u00a3300 payment for staff working during COP26.\nBut the government said it was \"disappointed\" the offer was rejected by the RMT. \nA spokesperson said after this, ScotRail sought to focus the issue of rest day working, which the RMT said needed to be addressed. \nHowever, an offer on rest day working was \"rejected out of hand\" and the union returned to the issue of pay, according to the government.  \nIt said: \"We don't think anyone, including the membership of the RMT, wants to disrupt COP26 or the chance to showcase Scotland's green, clean railway to a global audience. We hope that encompasses the RMT leadership too, although their approach to seeking resolution does appear to call this into question.\"\nMeanwhile, Ian McConnell, of ScotRail, said he was \"incredibly frustrated\" that the union had \"point blank rejected\" the latest proposal. \nHe accused the leadership of having \"moved the goalposts without consulting their members\". \nMr McConnell said time was running out to reach agreement, adding: \"It seems RMT bosses are intent on sabotaging Scotland's railway's role during COP26.\" \nContingency plans were being developed to provide a core service for the duration of the summit, he said. \nAppearing on BBC Radio Scotland, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken urged people to plan ahead of travelling and check the Get Ready Glasgow website for more information.\nMs Aitken also said cleansing teams were out clearing up fly-tipping \"hotspots\" after the issue of mounting rubbish in the city was raised on Question Time. \nAbout 1,500 Glasgow City Council staff including those in refuse collection and cleansing plan to strike for a week during the climate summit due to an ongoing pay dispute.\nUnion members rejected an \u00a3850-a-year increase for staff earning up to \u00a325,000 a year, and are instead calling for a \u00a32,000 pay rise for staff.\nConcerns have also been raised about the impact the summit could have on Scotland's Covid cases. \nProf Devi Sridhar, of Edinburgh University, tweeted that a mass event such as COP26 \"will cause an increase in cases\" and could \"trigger a need for further restrictions\".\nJillian Evans, head of health intelligence for NHS Grampian, said the risk of infection during mass events was high even if safety precautions were in place. \nShe warned many of those attending would not be fully vaccinated.  \nMs Evans added: \"We've got a really fragile situation, the number of cases in Scotland have been plateauing - plateaued at higher levels than ever before.\" \n\"You're looking at numbers we probably haven't seen before, whether that leads to restrictions will depend on the scale of this. I would say the stakes are really high,\" she said. \nThe Scottish government has said appropriate mitigation measures will be in place for the summit and Covid-19 continues to be closely monitored.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "House of Commons,Online Safety Bill,Social media,Ofcom,Online abuse",
      "text": "Government plans for social media regulation need \"far more clarity\", a Twitter boss has told the BBC.\nKaty Minshall said the draft Online Safety Bill failed to answer key questions such as how to define legal but harmful material. \nInstead of simply targeting those who post offensive content, the bill would put more responsibility on platforms.\nThe culture secretary said the bill would make the UK \"the safest place in the world to be online\".  \nWriting in the Daily Mail, Nadine Dorries said \"online hate has poisoned public life, it's intolerable, it's often unbearable and it has to end\". \n\"Enough is enough. Social media companies have no excuses. And once this bill passes through Parliament, they will have no choice.\"\nShe also said the government had decided to \"re-examine how our legislation can go even further to ensure the biggest social media companies properly protect users from anonymous abuse\". \nMeanwhile, a senior government source said \"social media giants could be acting now to stamp out abuse but instead they're out making excuses\".\nRuth Moss, whose daughter Sophie took her own life aged 13 in 2014, is calling for social media companies to take more action to address harmful material on their platforms. \nAfter her daughter's death, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she found numerous \"deeply disturbing\" images and instructions on self-harm and suicide on Sophie's phone and tablet. \nDespite limiting her internet use at home, she said Sophie, who suffered from depression, was still able to use her phone on the bus or with friends and it was \"impossible\" for parents to know what their child was doing online all the time. \nUnder the draft Online Safety Bill, the regulator Ofcom would have the power to levy fines of up to \u00a318m or 10% of global profits, whichever is higher, on social media platforms which fail to comply with the new laws.\nOfcom would also be given the power to block services from the UK if they are deemed to present a risk of significant harm to UK citizens.\nBut Twitter is concerned the bill gives too much influence to the culture secretary over Ofcom.\nThe current draft bill would allow Ms Dorries to change the Ofcom code of practice that would be used to regulate the likes of Facebook and Twitter.\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme, Ms Minshall - the head of policy in the UK for Twitter - said the bill gave the minister \"unusual powers\", leaving Ofcom to \"muddle through\". \nShe also rejected the idea of stronger rules around online anonymity - something some MPs have campaigned for.\nConservative MP Mark Francois said people sending \"horrendous abuse\" online should not be allowed to \"hide behind a cloak of anonymity with the connivance of the social media companies for profit\".\nBut Ms Minshall argued that clamping down on anonymous accounts would \"fail to deal with the problems of online abuse\" and could damage people who rely on \"pseudonymity\". \n\"If you're a young person exploring their sexuality or you're a victim of domestic violence looking online for help and for support, pseudonymity is a really important safety tool for you.\"\nShe added that users already had to provide a date of birth, full name and email address when signing up, meaning that the police could access data about an account, even if someone had used a pseudonym. \nAsked about the fines that could be levied on companies, she said such penalties were \"almost existential\".\nIn February of this year, Twitter boss Jack Dorsey said his company had experienced an \"extraordinary year\" in 2020, with revenues growing by 28% to $1.29bn (\u00a3930m) compared to the last quarter of 2019.\nMs Minshall said the bill had thrown up \"all sorts of really important questions\", such as \"how do we define legal but harmful content\" and \"what sorts of exemptions should we make for journalistic content or content of democratic importance\".\n\"These are questions that Parliament needs to answer,\" she added.\nMPs and peers are currently scrutinising the draft bill and next Thursday they will hear evidence from representatives of Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube and TikTok.\nWriting in the Mirror, Labour's shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens described the government's bill as \"weak and ineffective\", adding \"it won't do the job we need it to do\".\nShe said the government should introduce criminal sanctions against the bosses of big technology companies who repeatedly break the new laws. \nShe also raised concern that small companies would be subject to less stringent rules.

      "text": "Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer who died when actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun on a film set, has been remembered as \"an incredible artist\".\nHutchins had been working as director of photography on the set of Rust.\nAmerican Cinematographer magazine had named her one of its rising stars in 2019, and she previously worked on 2020 independent superhero film Archenemy.\nArchenemy director Adam Egypt Mortimer told BBC News the fact she had died on a set was \"really unbelievable\".\nHe said: \"Halyna was an incredible artist who was just starting a career I think people were really starting to notice.\n\"The fact that she would be killed on a set in an accident like this is unfathomable. It just seems inconceivable.\"\nHutchins' most recent post on Instagram, from Tuesday, showed her riding horses on set.\nOn Twitter, Alec Baldwin said \"there are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours.\"\n\"My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna,\" he added.\nFellow cinematographer Catherine Goldschmidt described Hutchins as \"lovely, warm, funny, charming, outgoing\", and praised her for being \"so talented\".\n\"What's so tragic is she's made beautiful films already but when you think about what was ahead of her, that is also so sad,\" she told BBC News.\n\"She was also a mum, which I think is very difficult,\" Goldschmidt added. \"When I first met her I remember being really impressed, shocked even that this beautiful, creative, outgoing, enthusiastic talented cinematographer also is raising the child.\n\"I think for women in this industry it is very difficult. So I was very impressed that she was able to do that.\"\nAlex Fedosov, who like Hutchins is a Ukrainian film-maker working Hollywood, said she was \"rising fast in her career\" and was \"an artist and a visionary\".\n\"She was so talented, a photography director with her own vision, her own strong ideas,\" he told BBC News Ukrainian.\n\"When we worked together on set, I was assistant director, I would rush her and say, 'Hurry up, we need to film this'. She would smile calmly but carry on in her own rhythm because she knew what she wanted to achieve.\"\nInnovative Artists, the agency that represented her, described her as \"a ray of light\" in a statement.\n\"Her talent was immense, only surpassed by the love she had for her family,\" the agency wrote. \"All those in her orbit knew what was coming; a star director of photography, who would be a force to be reckoned with.\"\nFedosov added Hutchins was a \"wonderful mother, first and foremost\".\nHe also questioned how her death could have happened, saying: \"Standards of safety in the US are very high. There is always an expert on set. There are always checks ahead of filming. Blanks are used sometimes to achieve a better effect on camera but it is always done with high degree of safety.\"\nDirector Adam Egypt Mortimer told the BBC that safety on movie sets is paramount. \"The fact that a gun went off and killed Halyna is both shocking from an industry point of view and just absolutely tragic from the point of view of knowing this amazing artist who suddenly not with us.\"\nJames Gunn, director of The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy, said: \"My greatest fear is that someone will be fatally hurt on one of my sets. I pray this will never happen. My heart goes out to all of those affected by the tragedy today on Rust, especially Halyna Hutchins and her family.\"\nDirector and cinematographer Elle Schneider wrote a thread on Twitter about the death of her \"friend and rockstar cinematographer\".\n\"I don't have words to describe this tragedy. I want answers. I want her family to somehow find peace among this horrific, horrific loss,\" she said.\n\"Women cinematographers have historically been kept from genre film, and it seems especially cruel that one of the rising stars who was able to break through had her life cut short on the kind of project we've been fighting for.\"\nThe American Film Institute Conservatory also paid tribute.\nHutchins was born in Ukraine in 1979 and grew up on a Soviet military base in the Arctic Circle.\nHer website said she spent her upbringing \"surrounded by reindeer and nuclear submarines\".\nShe entered the film industry after gaining a degree in international journalism from Kyiv State University. After working on documentaries in the UK, she moved to Los Angeles, where she graduated from the American Film Institute conservatory in 2015.\nShe began working her way up in Hollywood, with credits on films including Blindfire, which she described as a \"racially charged cop drama\" written and directed by Mike Nell.\nShe also worked on horror feature Darlin', directed by Pollyanna McIntosh, which debuted at the SXSW film festival 2019.\nAmerican Cinematographer, a monthly magazine published by the American Society of Cinematographers, interviewed Hutchins in 2019.\nShe explained to them why she moved from journalism to cinematography, saying: \"My transition from journalism began when I was working on British film productions in eastern Europe, travelling with crews to remote locations and seeing how the cinematographer worked.\n\"I was fascinated with storytelling based on real characters.\" \nHer early life as a self-described \"army brat\" meant she was \"already a movie fan because 'there wasn't that much to do outside'\", the magazine added.\nIt said she gained \"hands-on shooting experience from documenting her forays into such extreme sports as parachuting and cave exploration\".\nAfter her death, the magazine paid tribute to the film-maker, saying: \"We're deeply saddened by the news from Santa Fe regarding the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Safety on the set should always be of paramount concern to everyone, especially when working with firearms.\""

Scotland and Northern Ireland have indicated they may follow suit.\nBefore then, anyone travelling on to the other UK nations in the 10 days after arrival in England must follow the rules for testing and quarantine in those places.\nThe latest change to the travel rules in England comes in time for many families going on half-term holidays.\nThe lateral flow tests for returning travellers must be bought from private providers - NHS kits cannot be used - with prices listed on the government website starting at \u00a319.\nPassengers need to book tests before travelling to the UK. They must send a picture of their lateral flow test to verify the result, and failure to do so could result in a fine of \u00a31,000.\nThe change also applies to under-18s who live in the UK, whether or not they are vaccinated.\nTravellers will still need to complete a passenger locator form before they return.\nThe Department of Health said that anyone who tested positive would have to take a PCR test, which they could get free through the NHS. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"I'm delighted that from today eligible travellers to England, who have had the life-saving Covid-19 vaccine, can benefit from a cheaper lateral flow test, providing faster results.\n\"This huge boost to the travel industry and the public will make it easier and cheaper for people to book holidays and travel abroad.\"\nDr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said it was \"critical\" that people with positive lateral flow tests \"get this checked\" with an NHS PCR test.\n\"This way we can continue to monitor new variants and stay on top of the virus,\" she added. \nSince 4 October, fully-vaccinated passengers travelling to the UK from any non-red list country no longer have to take a Covid test before setting off.\nPeople who are not fully vaccinated - and are 18 or over - still have to self-isolate at home for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeated his call for people to get their booster jabs as the UK reported more than 40,000 daily Covid cases for the 11th day in a row.\nOn Saturday there were 44,985 cases recorded and a further 135 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.\nMr Johnson, who has so far resisted calls by some health experts to reintroduce Covid restrictions despite rising infection levels, said: \"Vaccines are our way through this winter.\n\"We've made phenomenal progress but our job isn't finished yet, and we know that vaccine protection can drop after six months.\n\"This is a call to everyone, whether you're eligible for a booster, haven't got round to your second dose yet, or your child is eligible for a dose - vaccines are safe, they save lives, and they are our way out of this pandemic.\"\nPeople eligible for boosters include anyone aged 50 and over, those living and working in care homes for the elderly, and frontline health and social care workers.\nProf Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, warned the country faced the prospect of a \"tough winter\". \nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, he said vaccines remained \"the strongest weapon in the armoury\" and urged people to get their booster jabs to \"protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned\".\nOn Saturday, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which advises the government, said he was \"fearful\" there could be another lockdown Christmas if measures were not brought in soon. \nProf Peter Openshaw told BBC Breakfast: \"We all really, really want a wonderful family Christmas where we can all get back together.\n\"If that's what we want, we need to get these measures in place now in order to get transmission rates right down so that we can actually get together and see one another over Christmas.\" "

      "text": "The world's biggest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, has pledged to cut its carbon emissions to net zero by 2060.\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the Gulf state would invest more than $180bn (\u00a3130bn) to reach the goal.\nBut he said the kingdom would continue to produce oil for decades to come.\nThe announcement comes days before the COP26 climate change summit, at which world leaders will be pressed on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce global warming.\nSaudi Arabia now joins more than 100 countries that have committed to reaching net-zero emissions.\nNet zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nIt is achieved by a combination of cutting emissions as much as possible - mainly by reducing gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), which are released in the use of fossil fuels - and so-called offsetting measures, such as planting trees and carbon-capture technology.\nWhile China and Russia have plans to reach net zero by 2060, other countries - including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia's neighbour the United Arab Emirates, another major oil producer, aim to achieve the goal 10 years earlier.\nSaudi Arabia's move does mark a shift for the world's 10th-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. It has long resisted calls to cut its investment in fossil fuels.\nThis week, documents leaked to the BBC revealed Saudi officials asked the UN to play down the need to rapidly move away from fossil fuels, ahead of the COP26 meeting, which starts in Glasgow on 31 October.\nAt the launch of a climate conference in Riyadh, Prince Mohammed - Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler - said it would reach the target without affecting the \"stability of global energy markets\".\nHe said the country also would cut its emissions of methane by 30% by 2030.\nThe plans would rely on \"the availability of the required technologies to manage and reduce emissions\", the prince said.\nEnergy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said the country would use carbon capture - technology that extracts CO2 from the air - to help it meet the goal.\nEarlier this year, Saudi Arabia said it would reduce carbon emissions by shifting to renewable energy and planting billions of trees.\nRichard Black, senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a UK-based think tank, described Saudi Arabia's net-zero target as \"very welcome\" but said the kingdom needed to publish a plan of how it would be achieved.\n\"There's a lack of clarity... it would be really good to see that stuff made clear,\" he said, adding that the carbon-capture commitments were \"really speculative\".\nSince the net-zero target only applies to domestic emissions, it may mean Saudi Arabia will not need to reduce its oil and gas production. Carbon emissions from fossil fuels burned by other nations once the kingdom ships them abroad will not be counted.\n\"There's a lot of people who will be cynical about this unless Saudi Arabia plans to ramp down its production of oil and gas, which it has no plans on doing,\" Mr Black said.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

A motive is not yet clear.\nTributes have been pouring in for Mr Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez, 32, who was described by Ecuador's athletics federation as the country's greatest sprinter.\nPresident Guillermo Lasso promised that those behind the killing will be found and punished.\nIt comes after a 60-day nationwide state of emergency came into force in Ecuador on Monday in response to a wave of violent crime.\nOfficial figures suggest the number of murders in the first eight months of this year are double those in the same period last year.\n\"With great sadness, we confirm the murder of our sportsman Alex Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez,\" the Sports Ministry announced on Twitter.\n\"We have lost a great sportsman, someone who allowed us to dream, who moved us....he was the greatest sprinter this country produced.\"\nMr Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez won bronze in the 200 metres at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha. He was suspended prior to the Tokyo Olympics due to \"breach of his whereabouts obligations\".\nPresident Lasso tweeted his condolences. \n\"May he rest in peace. Those who take the lives of Ecuadoreans will not remain unpunished,\" he said. \nThis is the second killing of an international athlete this month. \nAgnes Tirop, a Kenyan runner who recently broke the women-only 10km road race world record, was stabbed to death in her home. Her husband has been arrested on suspicion of murder."

      "tags": "Film,New Mexico,United States",
      "text": "The gun that actor Alec Baldwin fired on set, killing a woman, was handed to him by a director who told him it was safe, court records show.\nAssistant director Dave Halls did not know the prop contained live ammunition and indicated it was unloaded by shouting \"cold gun!\", the records say.\nCinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot in the chest in Thursday's incident on the set of the film Rust. \nDirector Joel Souza, who was standing behind her, was wounded.\nThe 48-year-old received emergency treatment for a shoulder injury and was later released from hospital.\nFurther details of the police investigation were released on Friday when a search warrant was filed at a court in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nIt noted that Baldwin's blood-stained outfit was taken as evidence along with the gun. Ammunition and other prop weapons were also taken from the set by police.\nThe 63-year-old actor was questioned by law enforcement, but no-one has been charged over the incident. \nEarlier on Friday, Baldwin - who was the star and producer of the film - said he was \"fully co-operating\" with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.\n\"My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\"There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours.\"\nMs Hutchins, 42, was from Ukraine and grew up on a Soviet military base in the Arctic Circle. She studied journalism in Kyiv, and film in Los Angeles, and was named a \"rising star\" by the American Cinematographer magazine in 2019.\nShe was the director of photography for the 2020 action film Archenemy, directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer.\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, about half a dozen members of the camera crew on Rust walked out hours before the tragedy after protesting over working conditions on the set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe.\nThe union members had reportedly complained that they were promised hotel rooms in Santa Fe, but once filming of the Western began they were required to drive 50 miles (80km) from Albuquerque every morning.\nMeanwhile, the BBC has obtained a document showing which crew members were listed as scheduled to be on set that day.\nIt names a head armourer, the crew member responsible for checking firearms. Hannah Gutierrez Reed is in her twenties and, according to the LA Times, had recently worked in this role for the first time.\nThe prop gun that Baldwin fired contained a \"live single round\", according to an email sent by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees to its membership, reports Variety.\nIn Rust, Baldwin was starring as an outlaw whose grandson is sentenced to hang for an accidental killing.\nThe actor is best known for his role as Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock and for his portrayal of Donald Trump on the sketch show Saturday Night Live.\nSuch incidents on film sets are extremely rare. \nReal firearms are often used in filming, and are loaded with blanks - cartridges that create a flash and a bang without discharging a projectile. \nIn 1993, Brandon Lee - the 28-year-old son of the late martial arts star Bruce Lee - died on set after being accidentally shot with a prop gun while filming a death scene for the film The Crow."

      "tags": "Turkey,Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "text": "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has ordered 10 ambassadors, including those from the US, Germany and France, be declared persona non grata.\nIt follows a statement from the envoys calling for the urgent release of activist Osman Kavala.\nHe has been in jail for more than four years over protests and a coup attempt, although he has not been convicted.\nPersona non grata can remove diplomatic status and often results in expulsion or withdrawal of recognition of envoys.\nThis week's statement on Mr Kavala jointly came from the embassies of the US, Canada, France, Finland, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. Seven are fellow Nato allies of Turkey.\nThe Council of Europe, Europe's main human rights watchdog, has given Turkey a final warning to heed a European Court of Human Rights ruling to free Mr Kavala pending trial.\nAddressing a crowd in Eskisehir on Saturday, Mr Erdogan said the ambassadors \"cannot dare to come to the Turkish foreign ministry and give orders\".\nHe said: \"I gave the necessary order to our foreign minister and said what must be done. These 10 ambassadors must be declared persona non grata at once. You will sort it out immediately.\"\nHowever, what will happen now remains unclear.\nMr Erdogan said the envoys should either understand Turkey or leave, Turkish media reported.\nThere has been little response from the ambassadors so far, although the German foreign ministry said the nations involved were in \"intensive consultation\".\nNo official notification has been received from Turkish authorities.\nThe Norwegian foreign ministry told Reuters its envoy had \"not done anything that warrants an expulsion\".\nTurkey's foreign ministry had summoned the ambassadors on Tuesday to protest at their \"irresponsible\" statement on the Kavala case.\nThe embassies' statement had criticised the \"continuing delays\" in Osman Kavala's trial, which \"cast a shadow over respect for democracy, the rule of law and transparency in the Turkish judiciary system\".\nIt urges a speedy resolution and calls for \"Turkey to secure his urgent release\".\nMr Kavala was last year acquitted of charges over nationwide protests in 2013, but almost immediately rearrested.\nThe acquittal was overturned and new charges were added relating to the military coup attempt against the Erdogan government in 2016.\nMr Kavala denies any wrongdoing and critics of the Erdogan government say his case is an example of a widespread crackdown on dissent.\nEarlier this week, Mr Erdogan defended Turkey's judicial system, saying: \"I told our foreign minister: We can't have the luxury of hosting this lot in our country. Is it for you to give Turkey such a lesson? Who do you think you are?\"\nBy Ece Goksedef, BBC Turkish\nThe Kavala case has been a source of tension between the Turkish government and its Western allies. Turkey has been accused of applying criminal law against its critics and breaching the rule of law. The Kavala case is one example.\nAs a businessman, Mr Kavala had been campaigning for freedom of speech and democracy. President Erdogan says he supported the Gezi protests in Turkey in 2013. He believes those protests were aimed at toppling himself and his government. That is why he believes all the calls for Mr Kavala's release are directly targeting himself. Hence his harsh response.\nTurkish officials told me that they did not know when the trial should start. But if it does, we can expect a response from the countries now speaking out, and that will have consequences for the Turkish economy, which is already struggling, since some of those countries are Turkey's biggest trade partners.\nThis is a very bold move, probably a show of strength, especially for domestic politics a year and a half before elections. Some analysts believe it is rhetoric for domestic consumption. But others argue Mr Erdogan may be serious in pursuing this order. It remains to be seen."

      "tags": "Alcohol,Tax,UK National Minimum Wage,Student debt,Budget 2021,Students,Pensions,Income tax,Student finance",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will lay out the government's latest tax and spending plans on Wednesday 27 October.\nIt's the government's second Budget of the year, after one in March, and will coincide with the conclusions of the 2021 Spending Review, which will give details of how government will fund public services for the next three years.\nResponding to the most recent public sector finance data this week, the chancellor said: \"At the Budget and Spending Review next week, I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future.\"\nWhat are his options? Here we look at six things to watch out for in the Budget that could affect your personal finances.\nThe chancellor is reportedly considering a cut to the 5% rate of value added tax on household energy bills.\nThe move would be popular and timely against the background of soaring energy bills this winter and is something the government is now able to do because of Brexit.\nBut the move could attract criticism as it would - in effect - mean subsidising fossil fuels ahead of the climate summit.\nAlso, a VAT cut on domestic energy bills would cost about \u00a31.5bn a year, which may just be too much for the chancellor.\nThere are rumours the chancellor is planning to simplify the way that alcohol is taxed in the UK.\nThe 2019 Conservative election manifesto promised to review it, so now could be the time.\nOne suggestion is to reduce the premium on sparkling wine to the same level as still wine, which could knock 83p off a bottle of Champagne or Prosecco.\n\"The government should stop trying to favour certain parts of the industry, instead focusing on removing distortions and creating a simpler system of alcohol taxes targeted at socially costly drinking,\" said Kate Smith, associate director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nThe drinks levies have been in place since the 1600s and raise \u00a312bn a year for the government.\nThere are rumours that the current Capital Gains Tax rates may be tinkered with.\nThe tax is paid when people sell assets such as shares or a second home.\nIt's been suggested that rates could be aligned more closely with income tax rates, which could mean scrapping the current tax rates of 10% and 20% (or 18% and 28% for property) and instead making everyone pay income tax rates on their gains.\nA report by the Office of Tax Simplification, published in November 2020, recommended that CGT rates should be increased to bring them into line with income tax.\nBut it would be unlikely to raise significant extra amounts of tax, as it is typically paid by only about 275,000 taxpayers and raises less than \u00a310bn a year. \nThere are reports that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier.\nThe chancellor could do that by lowering the threshold at which people start repaying their student loans, a move that could save the Treasury about \u00a32bn a year. \nCurrently, English and Welsh students who enrolled at university after 2012 pay 9% of everything they earn above \u00a327,295 per year. They repay the same 9% until the loan is fully repaid or until 30 years after graduating. \nIf the threshold were reduced to \u00a325,000, it would cost anyone earning more than the current limit an extra \u00a3206 a year, while if it were slashed to \u00a320,000, it would cost an extra \u00a3656 a year.\nMinisters are rumoured to have proposed cutting the threshold to as low as \u00a323,000 and giving graduates 40 years as opposed to 30 to repay their debt. \n In his March Budget, Mr Sunak announced that the National Living Wage (what the governments call the minimum wage) would increase for workers over the age of 23.\nSince then, the government has come under pressure to help employees further - especially as younger workers have been some of the worst hit by the economic downturn.\nOne solution the chancellor has been reportedly looking at is to increase the National Living Wage by 5.7% to \u00a39.42 per hour from its current rate of \u00a38.91.\nThat would bring it close to the Living Wage Foundation's current recommendation of \u00a39.50 an hour. \nThe government could raise cash by cutting tax relief on pension savings for those on high salaries. \nBut pension experts warn such a move would not be as simple as it sounds, Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: \"A move to a flat rate of pensions tax relief, rather than the current system where relief is based on the rate of income tax paid, would be far from simple to implement.\"\nHe said it would be particularly difficult for defined-benefit schemes and could mean medium to high earners, including doctors in public sector schemes, facing big tax bills. \n\"Removing higher-rate relief would be a direct attack on middle Britain, leading to people who do the right thing and save for their future being hit with extra tax costs,\" said Tom Selby, head of retirement policy at AJ Bell."

We'll have another update for you tomorrow.\nMore than half of 12 to 15-year-olds living in Scotland have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, official figures show. Take-up in some areas is much higher - 66.0% in Aberdeenshire and 63.8% in Perth & Kinross. The take-up among the youngest age group has been brisk - faster than any age group under 65. Elsewhere in the UK progress among the youngest age group has been slower - in England take-up among 12-15s is at 18.9%, while in Wales the figure is 32.5%. Figures from Northern Ireland have not been published yet.\nPeople have tried to sell their lockdown dogs on Gumtree before disguising them as \"fake strays\" to rescue centres, an animal charity has said. In March, it was reported that households in the UK had bought more than 3.2 million pets during lockdown. Hope Rescue in Wales said centres had seen an increase in dogs being dropped off and the number was now at its highest in its 15-year history. One-year-old Maggie, an old English sheepdog crossed with a golden retriever, was taken in as a stray but the next day staff saw a recent advert on Gumtree, putting her up for sale for \u00a3500.\nRomania is in the grip of a wave of Covid-19 far more deadly than anything it has experienced until now. And to make matters worse, the country has had no effective government since the start of the month. Romania's 2,000 intensive care beds are all full, and patients are now having to wait outside. The first 50 critically ill patients have been transferred to hospitals in Hungary and Poland. Vaccination levels now stand at little more than 34% of the adult population - the second lowest in the EU after Bulgaria. Read Eastern Europe correspondent Nick Thorpe's full analysis of the situation.\nA hospital boss has said reinstating measures such as face masks would help to alleviate pressure on the NHS. Kevin McNamara, the chief executive of Great Western Hospital in Swindon, said he supported masks being made mandatory in public spaces again. He said 99% of beds are occupied at GWH and numbers are moving in the wrong direction as winter approaches. The number of Covid patients was comparable and at times had exceeded what was seen last November during lockdown, he added.\nThree months after Boris Johnson brought an end to most legal restrictions on social contact in England, Ros Atkins looks at where the UK is now - and what should happen next.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWith coronavirus ending commuting for some and home deliveries booming, your car which once racked up hundreds of miles a week may not be working so hard.

Had I been, I would have spoken strongly in favour\". \nIt also explained his change of heart on the issue, saying: \"I changed my mind on assisted dying when an MP friend was dying of cancer and wanted to die early before the full horror effects set in, but was denied this opportunity.\"\nLord Field said one particular argument against the bill was \"unfounded\", adding: \"It is thought by some the culture would change and people would be pressured into ending their lives.\n\"[But] the number of assisted deaths in Australia and the US remains very low - under 1% - and a former supreme court judge in Victoria, Australia, [talking] about pressure from relatives has said it just hasn't been an issue.\"\nHe concluded: \"I hope the house will today vote for the assisted dying bill.\"\nThe new bill has been proposed by Lady Meacher - a crossbench peer - and would give patients of sound mind, with six months or less left to live, the right to die by taking life-ending medication.\nThe person wanting to end their life would have to sign a declaration that was approved by two doctors and signed off by the High Court.\nThe bill passed its first stage - known as its second reading - unopposed and will undergo further scrutiny in the House of Lords at a later date. \nBut even if it was passed in the Lords, it would not become law unless it was backed by MPs in the Commons, and the government.\nLady Meacher and Lord Field are among the peers in favour of the changes, but others have spoken out against the bill, including the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who told BBC Breakfast vulnerable people could face \"intangible\" pressure to end their lives.\nSpeaking in Friday's debate, another crossbench peer Lord Curry, also opposed the bill, describing how it would have been a \"tragedy\" if his daughter - who had a learning disability and died aged 42 - had had her life cut short. \n\"She breathed her last while we held her hands, a very emotional and precious moment for us,\" he said.\n\"If someone at that time had offered an assisted dying, assisted suicide option, I firmly believe that in that heightened emotional state we were in, not thinking rationally, we may have been tempted to agree to her premature death. Had we done that, it'd have troubled us for the rest of our lives.\""

      "text": "The US says more than 1.7 million migrants were detained along its border with Mexico in the past 12 months - the highest number ever recorded. \nMore than one million of them were expelled to Mexico or their native countries, according to data from US Customs and Border Protection.\nAgents apprehended people from more than 160 countries.\nPresident Joe Biden's popularity in opinion polls has been sinking, partly as a result of his immigration policy.\nJust 35% of Americans said they approved of his handling of the issue, in an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey earlier this month. \nMr Biden promised a more humane immigration policy than his predecessor Donald Trump, but the US-Mexico border has been engulfed in crisis for much of the Democrat's nine-month-old presidency.\nThe detention numbers for the 2021 fiscal year, which ended in September, are the highest since 2000. That year, more than 1.6 million migrants were held at the US-Mexico border. But the number has not reached 1.7 million since US authorities first began tracking such entries in the 1960s.\n\"The large number of expulsions during the pandemic has contributed to a larger-than-usual number of migrants making multiple border crossing attempts,\" the US Customs and Border Protection said.\nThose trying to enter the US illegally were mainly from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\nOf all those detained, the biggest category were adults travelling without children - more than 1.1 million (or 64%).\nAt the same time, the US authorities said they encountered more than 145,000 unaccompanied children - a record number. \nAlmost 11,000 of those children remained in government custody on Friday.\nA BBC investigation of the Fort Bliss detention centre in Texas earlier this year found reports of sexual abuse, Covid and lice outbreaks, hungry children being served undercooked meat and sandstorms engulfing the desert tent camps where the young people were being held.\nRepublicans have blamed Mr Biden's promise to create a pathway to citizenship for immigrants for fuelling the surge.\nMr Biden - who is making one of his regular trips to his home in Delaware this weekend - has been facing questions this week about why he has not visited the border.\nThe White House press secretary told reporters on Friday that Mr Biden drove by the border in 2008 when he was campaigning to be Barack Obama's vice-president."

      "text": "Film director Joel Souza says he is \"gutted by the loss of my friend and colleague\" Halyna Hutchins, in his first statement since a gun accident on the set of a movie in New Mexico.\nMs Hutchins was killed and Mr Souza wounded when a prop gun with a live round was fired by actor Alec Baldwin.\nMr Souza thanked well-wishers for their \"outpouring of affection\".\nCourt records say Mr Baldwin was handed the gun by an assistant director who told the actor that it was safe.\nMs Hutchins, a 42-year-old cinematographer, was fatally shot in the chest in Thursday's incident on the set of the film Rust in Santa Fe. Mr Souza, 48, who had been standing behind Ms Hutchins, was treated in hospital for a wound to the shoulder and later discharged.\nPolice are still investigating the incident and no charges have been brought.\nIn his statement, Mr Souza said: \"I am gutted by the loss of my friend and colleague, Halyna. She was kind, vibrant, incredibly talented, fought for every inch and always pushed me to be better.\n\"My thoughts are with her family at this most difficult time. I am humbled and grateful by the outpouring of affection we have received from our filmmaking community, the people of Santa Fe, and the hundreds of strangers who have reached out\u2026 It will surely aid in my recovery.\"\nCourt submissions show the assistant director, Dave Halls, did not know the prop contained live ammunition and indicated it was unloaded by shouting \"cold gun!\"\nOn Friday, Mr Baldwin - who was the star and producer of the film - said he was \"fully co-operating\" with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.\n\"My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nMs Hutchins, 42, was from Ukraine and grew up on a Soviet military base in the Arctic Circle. She studied journalism in Kyiv and film in Los Angeles. She was the director of photography for the 2020 action film Archenemy.\nShe leaves a husband, Matthew, and a nine-year-old son.\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, about half a dozen members of the camera crew on Rust had walked out hours before the tragedy after protesting over working conditions on the set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe.\nThere had been at least three earlier prop gun misfires on the set, sources told the Times.\nThe union members had also complained that they were promised hotel rooms in Santa Fe, but once filming of the Western began they were required to drive 50 miles (80km) from Albuquerque every morning.\nThe BBC has obtained a document showing which crew members were listed as scheduled to be on set that day.\nIt names a head armourer, the crew member responsible for checking firearms. Hannah Gutierrez Reed is in her twenties and had recently worked in this role for the first time, on the movie The Old Way.\nIn a podcast in September she said she almost turned down that job \"'cause I wasn't sure if I was ready... but doing it, like, it went really smoothly\".\nThe prop gun that Baldwin fired contained a \"live single round\", according to an email sent by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees to its membership, reports Variety.\nIn Rust, Baldwin was starring as an outlaw whose grandson is sentenced to hang for an accidental killing.\nThe actor is best known for his role as Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock and for his portrayal of Donald Trump on the sketch show Saturday Night Live.\nSuch incidents on film sets are extremely rare. \nReal firearms are often used in filming, and are loaded with blanks - cartridges that create a flash and a bang without discharging a projectile. \nIn 1993, Brandon Lee - the 28-year-old son of the late martial arts star Bruce Lee - died on set after being accidentally shot with a prop gun while filming a death scene for the film The Crow."

      "text": "Advising people to work from home is likely to have the most impact on stopping Covid spreading this winter, scientists advising the government say.\nStricter virus restrictions should now be prepared for \"rapid deployment\", the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said.\nIt said \"presenteeism\" - or pressure to be in work - could become an increasing cause of infections in workplaces. \nAsked about working from home, the PM said all measures were under review.\nBoris Johnson added: \"We do whatever we have to do to protect the public but the numbers that we're seeing at the moment are fully in line with what we expected in the autumn and winter plan.\"\nMinisters in England are resisting calls to switch to their winter Plan B that would see measures like compulsory face coverings in certain places.\nCovid hospital admissions and deaths across the UK are rising slowly, and the UK has recorded over 40,000 new daily Covid cases for the past ten days.\nOn Friday, a further 49,298 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK, alongside 180 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nAny advice to work from home would only apply to those who are able to do their job away from the workplace.\nIn April 2020, at the height of the first pandemic lockdown, less than half of people in employment, some 46.6%, did some work at home, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nIn minutes of a meeting of scientific advisers on 14 October, published on Friday, they warn that acting earlier rather than later could reduce the need for stricter measures over a longer timeframe \"to avoid an unacceptable level of hospitalisations\".\nThey added that any measures introduced must be clearly communicated. \nThe advisers, led by Sir Patrick Vallance, say models forecasting the coming winter suggest Covid hospital admissions are \"increasingly unlikely\" to rise above the levels of January 2021 peak.\nBut they say they are unsure of the impact of \"waning immunity and people's behaviour\".\nThere has been a noticeable dip in people saying they are wearing face coverings and latest figures from the ONS suggest more than half of British working adults are now travelling to work.\nSage says making face coverings compulsory in some places is likely to help reduce the spread of Covid as well as other winter viruses, such as flu.\nIt also notes the risks of high levels of the virus circulating in the UK, compared with other countries.\n\"Cases and admissions are currently at much higher levels than in European comparators, which have retained additional measures and have greater vaccine coverage, especially in children,\" the scientists say.\n\"Reducing prevalence from a high level requires greater intervention than reducing from a lower level.\"\nAnother worry is the emergence of a new variant that becomes \"dominant globally\", which they call \"a very real possibility\".\nThe great Plan B debate for England has moved up another gear.  \nDemands for more widespread mask wearing, more working from home and vaccine passports have been growing - with the NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association throwing their weight behind measures which the government has branded its Plan B.\nMembers of the expert committee Sage, according to minutes of recent meetings, seem to favour acting sooner rather than later - \"earlier intervention may reduce the need for more stringent, disruptive and longer-lasting measures\".\nThey pointedly note that cases are much lower in European countries which have tougher rules on masks and vaccine passports. \nBoris Johnson said all measures were being kept under review but the focus was still on getting more people vaccinated.  \nThe government then is resisting pressure for Plan B in England.  \nBut the notably more cautious tone from Health Secretary Sajid Javid recently suggests that the views of official experts and advisers are having an impact. \nThe advisers warn that the prospect of people being infected with Covid, flu and other respiratory viruses this winter could be \"a significant challenge\".\nThey say people who show symptoms of an infection should stay at home to stop it spreading to others.\nThis message needs to come from government, employers, universities and schools to be most effective, they say.\nOne in 55 people in England was infected with coronavirus in the week ending 16 October, according to latest estimates from the ONS - more than at any time since the end of January.\nInfections continue to fall in Scotland, and remain flat in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe percentage of people testing positive remained highest for those in school years seven to 11, the ONS estimates showed, ahead of half term for many pupils in England.\nIn the week ending 16 October, 7.8% of people in that age group were infected - compared to less than 2% of people in all older age groups.\nOfficial government data, which tracks people testing positive, shows that nearly 1,000 people a day are being admitted to UK hospitals with Covid and more than 8,000 in total are in hospital with the illness.\nThese figures are way below where they were in January because of protection from the vaccines, but doctors and health leaders have voiced concerns over the lack of curbs to control any further rises. \nWhen Mr Johnson was asked on Friday whether a full lockdown, with \"stay at home\" advice and shops closing, was out of the question this winter, he replied: \"I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that's on the cards at all.\""

      "tags": "Sussex Police,Sarah Everard murder,Avon and Somerset Constabulary,Dorset Police",
      "text": "Five police officers are facing misconduct proceedings over messages sent about Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens.\nThe police watchdog said it had carried out two investigations into messages sent on WhatsApp and Signal. \nThe officers are from four forces: the Metropolitan Police as well as Sussex, Dorset, and Avon and Somerset.\nIf proven, the claims could further undermine people's confidence in policing, the watchdog warned.\nCouzens, a former Met Police officer, was given a whole life sentence for Ms Everard's murder last month. He abducted her as she walked home from a friend's house in March.\nThe murder sparked a discussion over trust in the police, with the Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick saying she was determined to rebuild public confidence.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct - which handles complaints about forces in England and Wales - said it had run two separate investigations into social media messages, and found that a total of five police officers had cases to answer. \nIn the first investigation, it looked at claims that a probationary Met officer had shared an \"inappropriate graphic depicting violence against women\" with colleagues on WhatsApp.\nThe IOPC said the graphic was intended to refer to Ms Everard's kidnap and murder. Although the officer was off duty at the time, they later worked at a police cordon as part of the search.\nThe image was \"highly offensive\" and the officer will now face a misconduct meeting, the IOPC said.\nAnother probationary officer, also from the Met, will also face a misconduct meeting for allegedly sharing the graphic and not challenging it.\nA misconduct meeting is for cases which could result in a final written warning. It is different to a misconduct hearing, which is for more serious cases of gross misconduct which could result in the officer being dismissed from the force.\nThe IOPC also carried out a second investigation, looking at claims that seven officers from different forces shared information about Couzens' prosecution in a chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal.\nOne officer from Dorset Police was accused of sharing details of an interview given by Couzens under caution, which was not yet allowed to be reported. That officer will face a gross misconduct hearing.\nTwo other officers - from Sussex Police, and Avon and Somerset Constabulary - were also in the Signal conversation and were accused of making unprofessional remarks about Couzens and endorsing comments made by others.\nThe Sussex officer had a meeting this week and misconduct was not proven - although the officer was told to undergo \"the reflective practice review process\", the IOPC said.\nThe officer from Avon and Somerset Constabulary will face a misconduct meeting in due course.\n\"In April this year we warned about the unacceptable use of social media by officers based on a number of cases involving the posting of offensive and inappropriate material,\" said Sal Naseem from the IOPC.\n\"We wrote to the National Police Chiefs Council, asking them to remind forces and officers of their obligations under the police Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Behaviour.\n\"The allegations involved in these two investigations, if proven, have the capacity to further undermine public confidence in policing. They also once more illustrate the potential consequences for officers and come at a time when policing standards and culture have never been more firmly in the spotlight.\"\nThe IOPC said it was continuing to investigate the conduct of five other officers relating to messages sent in a WhatsApp chat group in 2019. The messages were recovered from an old mobile phone discovered during the police investigation into Ms Everard's murder, the IOPC said.\nThe IOPC is also still looking into how Kent Police in 2015, and the Met this year, handled allegations of indecent exposure which have been linked to Couzens.

      "text": "Home Secretary Priti Patel has backed calls to change the law to give victims of domestic abuse more time to report a crime, the BBC has been told.\nThere is currently a six-month time limit for a charge to be brought against someone for common assault. \nBut Ms Patel has agreed to extend the timeframe to up to two years. \nIt comes after the BBC revealed 13,000 cases in England and Wales had been dropped in five years because the six month limit had been breached.\nThe change is expected to come as part of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament. \nCampaigners have said the move would be very welcome, but they are waiting to see an official announcement. \nCommon assault cases include things like a push, threatening words or being spat at and are normally dealt with at magistrates court.\nThe clock starts from the date of the incident, and within the next six months, a victim needs to have come forward and the police have to have carried out their work to secure a charge against the alleged perpetrator, or the case will be dropped. \nVictims of domestic common assault are sometimes reluctant to report incidents and the cases can be complex - which is why campaigners say the police should be given more time before having to bring charges.\nThe argument for the time limit was to keep the criminal justice system moving, especially when there is now such a backlog of cases to be heard following Covid. \nBut Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the number of incidents being \"timed out\" because of the six month factor was \"shocking\".\nThe BBC has been told this time limit will now be extended to two years, and there will be a renewed push to ensure police and prosecutors are alive to incidents of coercive control, which are often linked with incidents of domestic abuse.\nMs Cooper said the change would be \"excellent news\", adding: \"Making this simple and practical change would give domestic abuse victims more time to report assault and means stronger action to tackle violence against women and girls - something that is badly needed right now.\" \nThree-quarters of all domestic abuse cases - including sexual assaults - are closed early without the suspect being charged, according to a report by HM inspector of constabulary.\nAnd just 1.6% of rape allegations in England and Wales result in someone being charged - something the government has said it is \"deeply ashamed\" about.\nFigures obtained by the BBC using Freedom of Information from 30 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, revealed a huge increase in allegations of common assault involving domestic abuse - but a fall in the number of charges being brought.\nFrom 2016-17 to 2020-21 there were at least 12,982 cases of common assault that were flagged as involving domestic abuse in which no-one was charged due to the time limit.\nIn the same time period, the total number of common assaults flagged as instances of domestic abuse increased by 71% from 99,134 to 170,013.\nBut the number of these common assaults that resulted in charges being brought fell by 23%.\nA government spokesman said all allegations should be investigated and pursued where possible, and money had been invested into supporting victims of such crimes during the pandemic."

      "text": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.\nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. \nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nClimate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. \nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. \nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. \nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. \nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. \nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. \nClimate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. \nIf temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:\nCountries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. \nThe UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. \nMany countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nExperts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.\nMajor changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "title": "Alec Baldwin: What are prop guns and why are they dangerous?",
      "tags": "Alec Baldwin,Firearms,Film,United States",
      "text": "On a film set, a real-life tragedy has happened. \nPolice say US actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza on a film set in New Mexico. They were working on the film Rust.\nTributes have been paid to Ms Hutchins, 42, while Mr Baldwin is said to be distraught. One local paper found him in tears outside Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.\nAn investigation is under way and we don't exactly know yet what went wrong. A spokesman for Mr Baldwin said there had been an accident on the set involving the misfire of a prop gun.\nCourt submissions later showed an assistant director, Dave Halls, had handed the gun to Mr Baldwin. It contained a live round but Mr Halls said he did not know that, and indicated it was unloaded by shouting \"cold gun!\"\nAn incident like this is rare and the news has stunned the film industry. The use of firearms on set is subject to stringent safety standards.\n\"On the film I recently made, even my plastic gun, I had to sign out, sign in every day,\" said Australian actor Rhys Muldoon. \"So that's why this particular case is so incredibly baffling.\"\nDespite sounding innocuous, both prop guns and blanks can be dangerous. Here's what we know about them.\nBlanks are used in the film industry to imitate live ammunition. \nThe reason they are so convincing is that blanks are essentially modified real bullets. \nWhile the term \"bullet\" is commonly used to describe what is loaded into weapons, more properly it is a cartridge that is loaded: a self-contained ammunition package made up of a casing holding an explosive powder that when fired, blasts out a projectile, or bullet. \nBlanks differ because although they use explosive they don't use a projectile. \nHowever the wadding materials which are used to keep the gunpower in place can be expelled from the gun when it is fired, potentially causing injury or even death at close range.\nA prop gun could mean a range of items, from non-functioning weapons to cap guns. \nBut it can also mean a real weapon, or one adapted for firing blanks. \nTogether they add authenticity to productions - fire a blank using a prop gun and you'll get a loud bang, a recoil and what's known as a muzzle flash, the visible light created by the combustion of the powder.\nYes. You may remember Brandon Lee, the actor son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee.\nBrandon Lee died aged just 28 in 1993 while filming The Crow, when a prop gun which mistakenly had a dummy round loaded in it was fired at him. \nDummy rounds contain no explosive charge and in this case were used to film a close-up. When blanks were loaded part of the dummy round remained in the gun. \nAfter Lee was shot, the cameras kept rolling. It was only when he did not get up at the end of the scene that those on set realised something was wrong. \nIn another incident, in 1984, US actor Jon-Erik Hexum started joking around on the set of a television show after being frustrated by delays in filming.\nHe loaded a revolver with a blank, spun the chamber, put the gun to his temple and fired. \nUnlike Lee, he was not killed by a projectile, but rather the force of the blast was strong enough to fracture his skull. He died days later in hospital. \nHexum's death highlights a problem with blanks - even without a projectile they pack enormous power.\nAdding to the risk, some film sets use extra powder to make the visual impact stronger.\nFilm sets usually have strict rules about the use of prop guns. Specialists provide weapons for use on film sets and advise on their use.\n\"There's basic safety measures on every set,\" said Mike Tristano, an armourer who has worked with Alec Baldwin in the past. \n\"You never point a gun, even if it is not a firing gun, at anyone else. I'm at a loss how this could have happened and how it could have done that much damage.\"\nA common shot in film shows an actor firing into the camera and Steven Hall, who has worked on films such as Fury and The Imitation Game, says it only happens with safeguards.\n\"If you are in the line of fire... You would have a face mask, you would have goggles, you would stand behind a Perspex screen, and you would minimise the number of people by the camera, \" he said.\n\"What I don't understand in this instance is how two people have been injured, one tragically killed, in the same event.\"\nOthers working in film wondered why, at a time when gun effects can be cheaply added using computers, blanks are still being used at all. \n\"There's no reason to have guns loaded with blanks or anything on set anymore. Should just be fully outlawed,\" tweeted Craig Zobel, an actor and director whose credits include Westworld and Mare of Easttown. \n\"Prop guns are guns,\" TV writer David Slack tweeted. \"Blanks have real gunpowder in them. They can injure or kill - and they have. If you're ever on a set where prop guns are treated without proper caution and safe handling, walk away.\n\"No show or shot is worth risking people's lives,\" he added. "

      "text": "Residents in a North Lincolnshire village have been left feeling a little disorientated after a road sign was erected welcoming people to Yorkshire.\nThe mysterious sign, which can be seen by motorists entering Sandtoft, appeared earlier this week.\nOne resident said it was about 150m (492ft) from the original Welcome to North Lincolnshire sign - on the same side of the road.\nSome have suggested it is the work of contractors unfamiliar with the area.\nThe local authority, North Lincolnshire Council, said it was unaware of the sign, while the neighbouring authority, Doncaster Council, has yet to respond to a request for comment.\nPosting in a local Facebook group, one resident said it appeared the sign had been put up on the wrong side of the road and facing the wrong way.\nHowever, some, including Steve Dale, who is originally from Yorkshire, welcomed the move.\n\"Glad about it. I get some right stick about moving to Lincolnshire and I argue that its still Yorkshire as my address... has a Donny [Doncaster] postcode,\" he wrote.\n\"I'm hoping they move the county lines a couple of miles to make it official.\"\nOthers were quite happy to remain in Lincolnshire, blaming the Yorkshire council for the error.\nOne just said whoever was responsible, it was \"a waste of money\".\nSandtoft is on the the Isle of Axholme, an area of North Lincolnshire comprising a number of communities, including Sandtoft, Haxey, and Epworth, on the border with South Yorkshire. \nThe name Isle is given to the low-lying area as each town or village was once built on dry, raised ground in the surrounding marshland, before it was drained.\nSandtoft boasts what is claimed to be the world's largest collection of trolleybuses, while Haxey is well known for its annual medieval mass scrum game, which dates back to the 14th Century and involves patrons pushing a leather tube to one of a number of North Lincolnshire pubs.\nActress Sheridan Smith, originally from Epworth, started her career performing gigs in the local area.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Advising people to work from home is likely to have the most impact on stopping Covid spreading this winter, scientists advising the government say.\nStricter virus restrictions should now be prepared for \"rapid deployment\", the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said.\nIt said \"presenteeism\" - or pressure to be in work - could become an increasing cause of infections in workplaces. \nAsked about working from home, the PM said all measures were under review.\nBoris Johnson added: \"We do whatever we have to do to protect the public but the numbers that we're seeing at the moment are fully in line with what we expected in the autumn and winter plan.\"\nMinisters in England are resisting calls to switch to their winter Plan B that would see measures like compulsory face coverings in certain places.\nCovid hospital admissions and deaths across the UK are rising slowly, and the UK has recorded over 40,000 new daily Covid cases for the past ten days.\nOn Friday, a further 49,298 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK, alongside 180 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nAny advice to work from home would only apply to those who are able to do their job away from the workplace.\nIn April 2020, at the height of the first pandemic lockdown, less than half of people in employment, some 46.6%, did some work at home, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nIn minutes of a meeting of scientific advisers on 14 October, published on Friday, they warn that acting earlier rather than later could reduce the need for stricter measures over a longer timeframe \"to avoid an unacceptable level of hospitalisations\".\nThey added that any measures introduced must be clearly communicated. \nThe advisers, led by Sir Patrick Vallance, say models forecasting the coming winter suggest Covid hospital admissions are \"increasingly unlikely\" to rise above the levels of January 2021 peak.\nBut they say they are unsure of the impact of \"waning immunity and people's behaviour\".\nThere has been a noticeable dip in people saying they are wearing face coverings and latest figures from the ONS suggest more than half of British working adults are now travelling to work.\nSage says making face coverings compulsory in some places is likely to help reduce the spread of Covid as well as other winter viruses, such as flu.\nIt also notes the risks of high levels of the virus circulating in the UK, compared with other countries.\n\"Cases and admissions are currently at much higher levels than in European comparators, which have retained additional measures and have greater vaccine coverage, especially in children,\" the scientists say.\n\"Reducing prevalence from a high level requires greater intervention than reducing from a lower level.\"\nAnother worry is the emergence of a new variant that becomes \"dominant globally\", which they call \"a very real possibility\".\nThe great Plan B debate for England has moved up another gear.  \nDemands for more widespread mask wearing, more working from home and vaccine passports have been growing - with the NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association throwing their weight behind measures which the government has branded its Plan B.\nMembers of the expert committee Sage, according to minutes of recent meetings, seem to favour acting sooner rather than later - \"earlier intervention may reduce the need for more stringent, disruptive and longer-lasting measures\".\nThey pointedly note that cases are much lower in European countries which have tougher rules on masks and vaccine passports. \nBoris Johnson said all measures were being kept under review but the focus was still on getting more people vaccinated.  \nThe government then is resisting pressure for Plan B in England.  \nBut the notably more cautious tone from Health Secretary Sajid Javid recently suggests that the views of official experts and advisers are having an impact. \nThe advisers warn that the prospect of people being infected with Covid, flu and other respiratory viruses this winter could be \"a significant challenge\".\nThey say people who show symptoms of an infection should stay at home to stop it spreading to others.\nThis message needs to come from government, employers, universities and schools to be most effective, they say.\nOne in 55 people in England was infected with coronavirus in the week ending 16 October, according to latest estimates from the ONS - more than at any time since the end of January.\nInfections continue to fall in Scotland, and remain flat in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe percentage of people testing positive remained highest for those in school years seven to 11, the ONS estimates showed, ahead of half term for many pupils in England.\nIn the week ending 16 October, 7.8% of people in that age group were infected - compared to less than 2% of people in all older age groups.\nOfficial government data, which tracks people testing positive, shows that nearly 1,000 people a day are being admitted to UK hospitals with Covid and more than 8,000 in total are in hospital with the illness.\nThese figures are way below where they were in January because of protection from the vaccines, but doctors and health leaders have voiced concerns over the lack of curbs to control any further rises. \nWhen Mr Johnson was asked on Friday whether a full lockdown, with \"stay at home\" advice and shops closing, was out of the question this winter, he replied: \"I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that's on the cards at all.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new mutated form of coronavirus that some are calling \"Delta Plus\" may spread more easily than regular Delta, UK experts now say. \nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has moved it up into the \"variant under investigation\" category, to reflect this possible risk. \nThere is no evidence yet that it causes worse illness. \nAnd scientists are confident that existing vaccines should still work well to protect people. \nAlthough regular Delta still accounts for most Covid infections in the UK, cases of \"Delta Plus\" or AY.4.2 have been increasing. \nLatest official data suggests 6% of Covid cases are of this type.\nExperts say it is unlikely to take off in a big way or escape current vaccines. But officials say there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta. \n\"This sub-lineage has become increasingly common in the UK in recent months, and there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta,\" the UKHSA said.\nUnlike Delta, however, it is not yet considered a \"variant of concern\" - the highest category assigned to variants according to their level of risk. \nThere are thousands of different types - or variants - of Covid circulating across the world. Viruses mutate all the time, so it is not surprising to see new versions emerge.\nAY.4.2 is an offshoot of Delta that includes some new mutations affecting the spike protein, which the virus uses to penetrate our cells. \nThe mutations - Y145H and A222V - have been found in various other coronavirus lineages since the beginning of the pandemic.\nA few cases have also been identified in the US. There had been some in Denmark, but new infections with AY.4.2 have since gone down there.\nThe UK is already offering booster doses of Covid vaccine to higher risk people ahead of winter, to make sure they have the fullest protection against coronavirus. \nThere is no suggestion that a new update of the vaccine will be needed to protect against any of the existing variants of the pandemic virus. \nDr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UKHSA, said: \"The public health advice is the same for all current variants. Get vaccinated and, for those eligible, come forward for your third or booster dose as appropriate as soon as you are called. \n\"Continue to exercise caution. Wear a mask in crowded spaces and, when meeting people indoors, open windows and doors to ventilate the room. If you have symptoms take a PCR test and isolate at home until you receive a negative result.\""

      "title": "Budget 2021: Rishi Sunak to pledge funding for T-levels",
      "text": "The government will reconfirm its commitment to a \"skills revolution\" with a spending package to be unveiled by the chancellor on Wednesday.\nRishi Sunak will announce \u00a31.6bn to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds, and \u00a3550m for adult skills in England in his autumn statement.\nAnd there will be \u00a3830m confirmed to continue a five-year-scheme to revamp and modernise colleges.\nCollege principals said the funding was welcome but would not go far enough.\nSixth form colleges and 16-19 education finances have been struggling for many years. \nA report by the IPPR think-tank last year suggested colleges in England would have needed an extra \u00a32.7bn a year since 2010 just to catch up with investment levels then.\nThe \u00a31.6bn cash investment for colleges over three years to 2024-25 will be used, in the main, to provide additional classroom hours for up to 100,000 young people taking T-levels. Presently there are about 6,000 students on T-level courses.\nThese are the government's new vocational qualifications, equivalent to three A-levels, that have been developed with businesses to meet the needs of industry. \nCurrently, there are 10 T-levels available currently However, in time the government wants the list to be expanded to include training for many more professions. \nThe funding will also cover inflationary pressures and accommodate the higher number of teenagers in the population.\nAn extra \u00a3550m is being invested in adult skills through the Skills Fund by 2024-25. This fund offers short courses and so-called \"skills boot camps\" for adults who have no qualifications beyond GCSE level.\nAnd there is a further \u00a3170m for apprenticeships and training.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"Our future economic success depends not just on the education we give to our children but the lifelong learning we offer to adults.\"\nHe said his \u00a33bn investment would create a \"skills revolution\", which would build on the government's job creation plans and spread opportunity across the UK by transforming post-16 education.\nMr Sunak told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show \"more sector-orientated training schemes have been shown to be really powerful\" and \"the best way to get to a high wage economy is to improve people's skills\". \nAt the heart of the government's plan for 16 to 19-year-olds in England is a qualification that few have yet heard of, the Technical or T-Level.  \nOne T-level is designed to be equivalent to three A-levels, or up to 3 BTecs. \nT-Levels are meant to be substantial and quite demanding courses, which include at least 45 days of work placement.  \nAt the moment, only around 6,000 students across England are enrolled to study the first T-levels, which they will complete next summer. \nThe government hopes to scale up the numbers rapidly as more T-levels are introduced, partly through a controversial decision to remove funding from popular BTecs in similar subjects.   \nAssociation of Colleges chief executive David Hughes said: \"We always expected the increased funding wouldn't go far enough, but in the circumstances we view this as a good start in a tough spending round.\n\"That the chancellor is leading with this announcement in advance of the Comprehensive Spending Review shows just how far we've come in making the government recognise the importance of investing in people to close the skills gap.\"\nHe added: \"I am hopeful that the lack of mention of education recovery is because of a significant announcement on Wednesday at the dispatch box.\"\nHe said his organisation had calculated that it was going to take at least \u00a3300m per year to support education recovery for 16 to 19-year-olds. \nBill Watkins, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said: \"Today's announcement focuses on the small minority of 16 to 18-year-olds that pursue a technical course. \n\"That's welcome, but all students deserve to have their education properly funded and we hope that Wednesday's spending review will also focus on the vast majority of young people that study A-level or BTec qualifications.\" \nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the investment in the further education sector, which he said had traditionally been \"starved of funding\". \nHowever, he told BBC Breakfast the move was a \"gamble\" when it was still unclear how many teenagers would want to do T-levels.

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Greta Thunberg",
      "text": "Climate activist Greta Thunberg has told the BBC that summits will not lead to action on climate goals unless the public demand change too. \nIn a wide-ranging interview ahead of the COP26 climate summit, she said the public needed to \"uproot the system\".\n\"The change is going to come when people are demanding change. So we can't expect everything to happen at these conferences,\" she said. \nShe also accused politicians of coming up with excuses.\nThe COP26 climate summit is taking place in Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, from 31 October to 12 November. \nIt is the biggest climate change conference since landmark talks in Paris in 2015. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming. \nMs Thunberg, who recently launched a global series of concerts highlighting climate change called Climate Live, confirmed she would be attending COP26. She said her message to world leaders was to \"be honest\".\n\"Be honest about where you are, how you have been failing, how you're still failing us... instead of trying to find solutions, real solutions that will actually lead somewhere, that would lead to a substantial change, fundamental change,\" she told the BBC's Rebecca Morelle.\n\"In my view, success would be that people finally start to realise the urgency of the situation and realise that we are facing an existential crisis, and that we are going to need big changes, that we're going to need to uproot the system, because that's where the change is going to come.\"\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nMs Thunberg did not believe that UK plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050 were sufficient, or that the UK was a climate leader. \n\"Unfortunately there are no climate leaders today, especially not in the so-called global north. But that doesn't mean that they can't suddenly decide that now we're going to take the process seriously,\" she said. \nSpeaking about the targets for reaching net zero - which means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - she said that it was a \"good start\", but cautioned that it \"doesn't really mean very much in practice\" if people continued to look for loopholes. \nCOP26 will be attended by climate activists from across the world. \nKevin Mtai, a climate justice campaigner from Kenya, told the BBC that inclusivity at the summit was important.\n\"I hope this climate conference is going to be an inclusive conference, to include all voices in the talks. They need to use indigenous people in the talks, marginalised people in the talks, people from the most affected areas,\" he said. \n\"It's very important for people from the global south to speak for themselves, not other parts of the globe to speak on their behalf. Because we are the ones who have been affected by climate change, so it's very important we can hear from our own people, with our own ideas, our own voice.\"\nFrom her home in Sweden, Ms Thunberg also spoke about her own role as a campaigner. \n\"I don't see myself as a climate celebrity, I see myself as a climate activist... I should be grateful because there are many, many people who don't have a platform and who are not being listened to, their voices are being oppressed and silenced.\n\"I'm a completely different person when I'm in private. I don't think people would recognise me in private. I'm not very serious in private. I appear very angry in the media, but I am silly in private.\" \nWhen asked about why she sang a Rick Astley hit at the launch of Climate Live, she said that it was a climate movement in-joke. She has previously taken part in the internet phenomenon \"rick-rolling\" by tweeting out what she said was a link to a new speech, but actually linked to the music video for the song.\n\"Why not? I mean we have internal jokes within the climate movement, where we always rickroll each other.\""

      "text": "England's city regions are set to receive billions of pounds to improve public transport in next week's Budget.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak will commit \u00a36.9bn towards train, tram, bus and cycle projects when he sets out his spending plans on Wednesday.\nGreater Manchester, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire are among the regions that will benefit.\nThe funding was welcomed by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham as \"an important first step\". \nEarlier this month, he launched a bid for \u00a31bn to create a London-style transport network for the region.\nAreas set to receive funding include:\nMr Sunak said: \"There is no reason why somebody working in the North and Midlands should have to wait several times longer for their bus or train to arrive in the morning compared to a commuter in the capital.\n\"This transport revolution will help redress that imbalance as we modernise our local transport networks so they are fit for our great cities and those people who live and work in them.\"\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England.\nThe \u00a35.7bn is a five-year settlement, and has been increased from the initial \u00a34.2bn proposed, the Treasury said.\nThe \u00a31.2bn of funding to make bus services cheaper and more frequent is part of \u00a33bn that Prime Minister Boris Johnson committed to spending on a \"bus revolution\" in March.\nLabour's Andy Burnham said the cash was \"an important first step towards a London-style public transport system for Greater Manchester\".\nBut he added: \"As welcome as it is, infrastructure investment alone will not make levelling up feel real to the people of Greater Manchester. \n\"That will only happen when the frequency and coverage of bus services are increased and fares are lowered to London levels,\" Mr Burnham added.\nAndy Street, Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, said he was \"absolutely delighted\" to get the funding, which he said was the largest single transport sum the area had ever received.\n\"From more metro lines and train stations, to new bus routes and electric vehicle charging points, this cash will help us to continue to build a clean, green transport network that connects communities and tackles the climate emergency.\"\nSilviya Barrett, head of policy and research at the Campaign for Better Transport, welcomed the increased funding for trams, trains and \"active travel\" but wanted the government to end the process of regions competing for bus funding.\n\"We are concerned that the competitive funding process for buses could mean that investment does not reach everywhere that needs it.\n\"Many areas have bus fares that are too high and gaping holes in services, so they need funding to put their bus service improvement plans in place,\" Ms Barrett said.\nThe Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents the bus and coach industry, said the fact the full \u00a33bn the government had committed to spending on buses had not yet been reached meant the government's \"rhetoric is unfortunately not being matched by reality\".\nIt comes as a new survey shows reliance on cars has reached a 15-year high despite fewer people commuting during the pandemic.\nMore than four in five (82%) of 2,652 UK motorists surveyed by the RAC motoring organisation said they would struggle without a car. That is up from 79% in 2020 and 74% the previous year.\nMore than half said that there were no feasible public transport services in their area.\nAnd people living in cities who have to drive are spending more time at the wheel, according to research from the Centre for Cities, which found motorists in Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester spend more than 50 hours a year stuck in traffic.\nDrivers in rural areas were also more likely to be car-dependent (87%) than their urban counterparts (77%)."

They also include former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and members of his cabinet.\nBut the defendant mocked Mr Gere's presence.\n\"I wonder if it's serious that Richard Gere of Hollywood is going to testify about my behaviour at a trial,\" he told journalists outside the court.\nMr Gere had boarded the Spanish ship the Open Arms before it docked after 19 days at sea on the island of Lampedusa with nearly 150 migrants on board.\nMr Salvini said he was defending his government's \"closed ports\" policy aimed at stopping migrants from making the dangerous Mediterranean crossing.\nBut his blockade of the ship caused an outcry and a serious split in the coalition government at the time. His League party was in a coalition with the anti-establishment Five Star.\nIn July last year, the Senate voted to strip him of his parliamentary immunity.\nMr Conte had called Mr Salvini \"obsessed\" with keeping migrants out of Italian ports.\nIn 2019 the Open Arms charity filed a legal complaint against Mr Salvini's block on their ship, which ended on 20 August.\nBy that time, many of the migrants had already been allowed off the ship.\nThe charity's founder Oscar Camps told reporters outside the trial on Saturday that saving lives should not be politicised.\n\"Rescuing people in the sea is no crime, it's an obligation not only for the captain but also for all states,\" he said.\nThe court adjourned after several hours.

The hospital declined to comment on Mr Souza's condition, citing privacy laws.\nA spokesman for Mr Baldwin, best known for his role as Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock and for his portrayal of Donald Trump on sketch show Saturday Night Live, said the incident involved the misfiring of a prop gun with blanks.\nPolice are trying to establish what type of projectile left the prop gun and how. Local media reported that Mr Baldwin was seen outside the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in tears.\nA spokeswoman for the local district attorney's office told BBC News that the investigation is still its \"preliminary\" stage.\n\"At this time, we do not know if charges will be filed,\" said\u00a0First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies.\nThe actor is a co-producer of Rust and plays its namesake, an outlaw whose 13-year-old grandson is convicted of manslaughter.\nThe eldest of four brothers, all actors, Mr Baldwin has starred in numerous TV and film roles since the 1980s.\nMs Hutchins was from Ukraine and grew up on a Soviet military base in the Arctic Circle, according to her personal website. She studied journalism in Kyiv, and film in Los Angeles, and was named a \"rising star\" by the American Cinematographer magazine in 2019.\nShe was the director of photography for the 2020 action film Archenemy, directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer.\n\"I'm so sad about losing Halyna. And so infuriated that this could happen on a set,\" Mr Mortimer said in a tweet. \nIn a statement, the International Cinematographer's Guild said Ms Hutchins' death was \"devastating news\" and \"a terrible loss\".\n\"The details are unclear at this moment, but we are working to learn more, and we support a full investigation into this tragic event,\" said guild president John Lindley and executive director Rebecca Rhine.\nMs Hutchins' talent agency, Innovative Artists, wrote in an Instagram post on Friday that she was \"a ray of light\".\n\"Her talent was immense, only surpassed by the love she had for her family.\"\nThe agency's statement added it hopes that the fatal incident \"will reveal new lessons for how to better ensure safety for every crew member on set.\"\nPolice said sheriff's deputies were dispatched to Bonanza Creek Ranch, a popular filming location, at around 13:50 local time (19:50 GMT) on Thursday after receiving an emergency call.\nSuch incidents on film sets are extremely rare, but not unheard of. \nReal firearms are often used in filming, and are loaded with blanks - cartridges that create a flash and a bang without discharging a projectile. \nIn 1993, Brandon Lee - the 28-year-old son of the late martial-arts star Bruce Lee - died on set after being accidentally shot with a prop gun while filming a death scene for the film The Crow. The gun mistakenly had a dummy round loaded in it.\nResponding to Thursday's news, Brandon Lee's sister Shannon tweeted: \"Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joel Souza and all involved in the incident on 'Rust'.

      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

But he didn't.\n\"I started to run and the man caught up with me and grabbed my arm.\"\nShe said she was assaulted and \"shoved him off\" before running away, only to be pursued again.\n\"He kept saying I was breaking his heart and that I was going to come home with him. \n\"I was sobbing and telling him 'no' over and over.\"\nShe said: \"At one point we reached a busy street and a car pulled up next to me. \n\"It was a male driver who asked if I was okay. Crying, I told him that I was being followed. \n\"The driver offered me a lift home but I realised he was also a stranger. \n\"I didn't know if he was a threat as well. I couldn't trust anyone - so I said 'no'.\"\nYou may also be interested in these stories:\nAs she approached Treforest railway station, she sent a text message to a friend who lived nearby and he arrived shortly afterwards. \n\"As I got to the station car park, the man grabbed me again and groped my breast,\" said Ms Dowler. \n\"Suddenly, I spotted my friend in the distance and I screamed for help. \n\"He ran towards us, screaming at the man to get off me. \n\"Thankfully, he let go of me and fled. I thought I was going to be raped or killed.\" \nShe reported what happened to police and Thanapalan was arrested after CCTV footage was seized and a Facebook profile of the defendant matched the description given.\nA DNA swab was taken and found to match that on his victim's cheek.\n\"If someone walks near me on the street now, I have a panic attack,\" said Ms Dowler.\n\"I don't know if I'll ever feel safe again.\"\nDuring sentencing, defence barrister Anthony O'Connell said his client was remorseful and had lost his previous good character.\nHe said he had suffered a self-inflicted \"spectacular fall from grace\", including losing his job."

      "text": "Ministers are to fund a network of \"family hubs\" in England as part of a \u00a3500m package to support parents and children.\nThe centres in 75 different areas will provide a \"one stop shop\" for support and advice, the government said.\nThe funding, to be announced by the chancellor in Wednesday's Budget, will also go towards breastfeeding advice and mental health services.\nLabour called the plans a \"smokescreen\" for failing to deliver for families. \nKate Green MP, Labour's shadow education secretary, said family hubs were \"a sticking plaster for a fractured childcare and children services landscape\".\n\"This supposed commitment rings hollow after 11 years of Conservative cuts have forced the closure of over a thousand children's centres, cutting off the early learning that sets children up for life,\" she said.\nThe funding includes \u00a3200m to support 300,000 families who face complex issues that could lead to family breakdown. \nSome \u00a382m will be given to 75 local authorities to fund the new family hubs, while another \u00a3100m will go towards mental health support for expectant parents.\nAnd \u00a350m will be spent on breastfeeding support - including antenatal classes and one-to-one support - to build upon best practice from areas such as Tower Hamlets in London, which has the highest breastfeeding rates at six to eight weeks in England.\nParenting programmes will receive \u00a350m and \u00a310m will go to signposting the Start4Life initiative, which offers help and advice from the NHS during pregnancy, birth and parenthood.\nAhead of the announcement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he \"passionately\" believed in giving children the \"best possible start in life\".\nHe said: \"We know that the first thousand and one days of a child's life are some of the most important in their development, which is why I'm thrilled that this investment will guarantee that thousands of families across England are given support to lead healthy and happy lives.\"\nThe government said the funding package addresses a report from March on improving the health and development of babies in England, which recommended more joined-up, welcoming support for families.\nNeil Leitch, of the Early Years Alliance, said the new money was \"welcome news for struggling families\" but criticised the government for failing to address existing problems within the early years sector, specifically among nurseries, childminders and pre-schools, where almost 3,000 providers have closed down since January.\nHe called for an independent review of the entire sector.  \"It's no good having a bit-piece approach to this, it needs a complete revamp,\" Mr Leitch told BBC Breakfast. \"If we fail to get it right effectively, it will cost us billions.\" \nHis concerns were echoed by Alison Morton, executive director of the Institute of Health Visiting.She said: \"We've had a really challenging time during the pandemic. Families have really faced the brunt of it - and whilst the government have poured a lot of money into other sectors, zero pounds, literally, has been spent on babies, young children and families.\"\"The government needs to go an awful lot further if they want to build back better for our babies and children,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will get an equivalent funding boost. The devolved governments will then decide how they want to spend the money.\nA separate \u00a3153m investment announced as part of the \u00a31.4bn education recovery package in Summer 2021 will enable nursery staff will to access more high-quality training.

      "text": "Just a week after being admitted to hospital with an infection, 92-year-old Esme Hanson was well enough to go home.\nBut it would be four months before she could return to her family because of a lack of available care.\nOne care provider told BBC Wales staff shortages were so bad, it handed care packages back to the local council.\nThe Welsh government admitted the situation was \"fragile\", and it had committed \u00a348m of extra funding to ease the social care crisis in Wales.\nWhen Mrs Hanson became unwell in May, she was admitted to Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Her care arrangements, put in place due to her dementia, were cancelled.\nHowever, it was not until September that a new package was finally re-instated, by which time her mental health had deteriorated, according her son Andrew.\nHe said his family were \"lucky\" to finally get her home.\n\"If you've got somebody over 70 that needs care, you don't know when they're going to come out of hospital,\" he added.\nIt was only after the Older People's Commissioner for Wales advised the family to organise their own care, and ask the council to fund it, that Mrs Hanson's care arrangements were put in place and she was discharged.\nHe said his mother now received \"wonderful\" care at home three times a day.\nSwansea council said it was extremely sorry for the delay and that every effort was made to find a package of care with a provider during the \"unprecedented\" times of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut Mrs Hanson's experience is not unique. There were more than 1,000 patients in Welsh hospitals unable to return home due to a lack of care, according to Welsh government figures last month.\nCare Forum Wales has warned the care sector is facing its biggest staffing crisis \"in living memory\".\nOne home care company, All Care, said staffing levels were at their lowest since 2002 and recruitment has been \"virtually zero\" for months. \nDirector Keri Llewellyn said \"a downward spiral\" of staffing shortages meant companies were handing back care packages to councils. \nShe added care staff were exhausted from working through the pandemic, while low wages made recruitment and staff retention difficult.\n\"I do need something for my staff now. Some hope, maybe a retention bonus,\" said Ms Llewellyn.\nCare manager Jane Davies has been helping with daily rounds due to staff shortages.\n\"You are very tired and you need to spend time with your own family, but you can't see those people go without care,\" she said.\nNicola Peta Hales, 54, said the stress of being a domiciliary care worker almost became too much.\n\"I did feel like quitting and I was very close to it not so long ago, but I decided to stay because I love the job.\"\nThe Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) Cymru has called on the UK and Welsh governments to provide more help.\nLast month, the UK government announced a national insurance tax rise, some of which will be used to help fund the care system. On Wednesday, the chancellor is due to outline spending plans for the next three years.\nThe Welsh government admitted the situation was \"fragile\".\nDeputy Minister of Health and Social Care Julie Morgan said implementing a living wage of \u00a39.50 per hour for carers was a priority, along with improving working conditions.\n\"We have to get the system to a place where there are not long waits,\" she added."

      "tags": "Texas,United States",
      "text": "Seven students are suing a Texas school district over its dress-code policy banning boys from having long hair.\nSchool officials suspended a 9-year-old boy for a month, barred him from recess and normal lunch breaks as punishment for long hair, the lawsuit claims.\nHe and the other students, aged 7 to 17, say the policy violates the constitution and Title IX - a  federal law prohibiting sex discrimination. \nThe school district said on Thursday it was reviewing the lawsuit.\nMagnolia Independent School District \"respects varying viewpoints, and we respect the rights of citizens to advocate for change,\" spokeswoman Denise Meyers said in an email to US media. \nThe district, which serves roughly 13,000 students about 40 miles (64km) northwest of Houston, did not return a request for comment from the BBC. \nAccording to its dress code policy, boys cannot wear their hair over their eyes, past the bottom of their ears, or past the bottom of a dress shirt collar. Facing backlash this summer, Magnolia defended the policy, saying it \"reflects the values of our community at large\". \nThe suit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas (ACLU) on Thursday on behalf of the students, argues the school district \"imposed immense and irreparable harm... solely because of these students' gender\". \nIt details a number of punishments given to the students - six boys and one non-binary child - for wearing long hair. \nOne, a nine-year-old identified as AC, is Latino, and wears his hair long like his father and uncle as a part of his family's heritage, the suit says. Another, an 11-year-old identified as TM, is non-binary and has worn long hair as a \"critical component\" of their gender expression. \nBoth have been subjected to punishments including suspension, denial of extracurricular activities and separation from their peers.  \n\"This rule is a complete and utter dinosaur,\" said parent Stanley Burkhead, whose son has long hair, at a school board meeting in August.\n\"Who are we to tell him who he can't be? Who are we to tell him what a boy should look like?\" he said. A survey by the ACLU of Texas last year found that nearly 500 public school districts in the state have some type of a hair-length policy only for boys. "

      "tags": "Machynlleth,Welshpool,Cardiff Council,Llanidloes,Cardiff,Transport,Carsharing,Electric cars,Environment,Motoring",
      "text": "You take your mobile phone out, walk up to a car, press your screen and the door opens.\nYes, yes, it's 2021, we know phones can do magic, right? But here's the catch: It's not your car.\nThe wonders of modern technology have meant that for those wanting to opt out of car ownership but still have access to a vehicle when necessary, joining a car club might just be the answer.\nWith coronavirus ending commuting for some and home deliveries booming, that car which once racked up hundreds of miles a week is doing next to nothing - so do you still need it? \nEssentially, car clubs offer vehicles to members which they can rent by time periods as short as an hour and collect from parking spaces in their locality without having to travel to a central base.\nThey might be run by a UK-wide operator or by a community-focused group.\nThere are car club schemes running across most major cities in Britain, including Cardiff, which has 21 vehicles available to members.\nNearly 635,000 people belong to a club in Wales, England and Scotland, with more than 6,000 cars available.\nResearch by transport charity CoMoUK found for every car club vehicle, 18 private cars are removed from the road, and 25% of club members sell a car once they join up.\nCardiff's club has run for over a decade, initially as a council-backed scheme run by City Car Club before being taken over by vehicle hire company Enterprise in 2015, and continued on a commercial basis with no affiliation to the council.\nHowever, the council is now hoping to expand shared car usage and have more integration with public transport, and is exploring a concept known as Mobility as a Service (Maas), where multiple transport options including buses, shared cars, rental bikes and scooters are bundled into one linked service.\nThe car club scheme is going out to tender, with the preferred bidder required to demonstrate how it would increase capacity and usage, as well as meeting minimum standards on emissions.\nDan Gursel, Enterprise's UK head of car club operations, said for many of their customers it was not so much about going completely car-free, but giving them an option not to have a second car that makes the car club attractive.\nHe said: \"As part of the pandemic, we're definitely seeing people's choices changing as a result.\"\nPeople were seeing their cars, especially second cars \"sitting on the driveway\" and looking at them as expensive assets while wondering: \"Do we need that or are there alternatives?\"\nHe admitted he was surprised to see that despite lockdowns, membership rose by 30% as coronavirus turned society upside down.\nBut it's not just about those with the means to afford to run a second car. Some 20% of their members don't have access to any car and part of their aim is to offer services in areas that have low car ownership.\nClimate crisis awareness is a key motivator for some. With the UK just weeks away from hosting the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, the need to reduce fossil fuel usage in our lives is taking centre stage.\nOffering low-emission vehicles is part of car clubs' strategy, with pure electric vehicles and hybrids making up a larger share of the fleet compared to the average private ownership model.\nResearch shows club vehicles emit 84% less nitrogen dioxide than the average car.\n\"We have got a growing base of customers that are very aware of the environment and we know our members have a much higher disposition for active travel,\" said Dan.\nSuch use of electric and hybrid cars is one of the hooks that could draw in those mindful of their carbon footprint, but unable to afford the cost of a newer electric vehicle (EV).\nA sudden and unforeseen parting with my own car left me without wheels and perfectly placed to test drive (excuse the dreadful pun) Cardiff's existing car club while looking for a more permanent solution.\nThe Enterprise scheme is app based. I applied to join, downloaded the app, took my driving licence to an office to be verified the next morning and was able to hire a car that day by reserving one which I located on the app, within reasonable walking distance from home.\nI walked up to the car, pressed \"start hire\" on the app and the doors unlocked.\nI entered a Pin code on a smart mile-counter pad kept with the key in the glove compartment to release the security system and start driving.\nAny issues can be dealt with by a call to the 24-hour service team, then I was off.\nI went in my temporary hybrid, feeling smug as I drove on electric power for short distances around the city before the petrol engine kicked in.\nOn schemes like these, operators charge either a monthly or yearly membership fee, and hourly or daily rates of hire for the vehicle.\nThen there is a per mile charge which varies depending on the type and size of vehicle. Electric vehicle mileage is substantially cheaper or even free with some car clubs.\nFuel or power is paid for via an account card housed in the smart meter so there are no out-of-pocket expenses to reclaim.\nOverall, for the long-distance journey I needed to take it was slightly cheaper to use the car club on its daily rate than to take public transport, and - crucially on this day - substantially faster. It also meant I had the car to use for errands and the usual weekend child taxi service for a few hours when I got home.\nI used car club vehicles twice more before getting my own wheels again, this time purely for local but essential trips.\nFor shorter hires, it did feel like a bit of an expensive way to get about but once again it was the time-saving factor which gave it the edge. I also used taxis and buses during this period, not to mention getting a fair bit more walking and cycling than usual done, which is a win for my health - and the planet's.\nWhile it is unremarkable to find them in cities - density of population, close proximity to a vehicle - a car share in more rural areas might seem more of a challenge.\nBut Llani Car Club proves it can be done. The club is in its 15th year and, after establishing itself in the Powys town of Llanidloes - population fewer than 3,000 - now operates in Newtown and Machynlleth and has just acquired a car to start up in Welshpool.\nThey run five cars in total, with nearly 50 members across the different sites, although the majority are based around Llanidloes.\nWith an electric car in each town and an additional petrol car in Llanidloes, the club's environmental credentials are an obvious draw to those concerned with their carbon footprint.\nBut what brings most people to the club is an external stimulus, such as a current car needing replacing or a change in personal circumstances.\nBeing a rural area, many people rely on their cars, but echoing Dan Gursel's words, club founder and member Andrew Capel said car club membership could be a positive option for those trying to avoid becoming a two-car household.\n\"Most people use it as a second car or as a way to avoid owning a second car,\" he explained, with the car club acting as a back up when the primary vehicle is in use.\nHowever, about a quarter of members do not own any vehicle, including him, but the decision to get rid of his own car was not easy, he admits.\n\"We'd set up the car club but hadn't got rid of our car immediately because I was actually dragging my feet, metaphorically speaking.\n\"There's a resistance to change. If it's forced on you in a way it's easier.\n\"Most people tend to give up their car when something happens to it, like with ours. It was coming to the end of its life and it wasn't worth putting it through the MOT.\n\"It is a leap of faith, but I tell people I think it's about education. I say, 'you give up your car, second car, and join the car club. If it doesn't work out for you, what's the worst thing that's going to happen?' [They're] going to go and get another car.\"\nUsing the club's car does mean he tends to maximise the value of a trip, so rather than just using it to go for a dental appointment in another town, for example, he will think of all the things he needs to do or get in advance and combine them into one journey.\nHe sees it as a mindset change. Rather than running the kids to school when it's raining, they have to accept they'll still be cycling if there is no car at hand.\nThe club was able to acquire electric cars to expand its services following a grant award. Despite being located in the middle of Wales it has not proved a problem for people to get around and recharge, Andrew said, pointing to an initiative by Powys council to install public fast electric charging points as a help.\nPeople start off taking shorter local trips but then \"after a short while they get more adventurous\".\nHe added: \"With a new car you're talking about a range officially of 246 miles so we've actually found that people get less preoccupied with range anxiety.\"\nBack in Cardiff, Caro Wild, the council's cabinet member for transport, is hoping an expanded car club could help transform a city which, like so many others, was simply not built for the volume of traffic it now hosts.\n\"It just hits a crisis point when there's too many cars trying to move around, too many cars trying to park places,\" he said.\nAs well as causing congestion and pollution, cars take up \"such a huge amount of space\".\n\"Surely there's something better that we can do with all that space? Far better for the environment, for people's health, for people's happiness, for housing.\"\nThe council has looked at different models, including an app-based model for wider transport, \"roaming\" cars that can be collected in one location and left in another, in a similar way to the existing bike scheme in the city.\nPeer-to-peer sharing is another possibility, where people living on a street get together locally to have a car for all residents to use.\nWhile the councillor cannot name a figure for how many cars the council would like removed, Cardiff's 10-year strategy is to see the number of car journeys halved.\n\"You look down a small urban street in Cardiff or elsewhere with maybe 100 cars parked on it and they're used 5% of the time,\" he said.\n\"Imagine if we could halve that number, the amount of space that would provide, what good that would be doing for the environment and how that would decrease the number of journeys as people start looking at different ways of getting around.\"\nHe hopes the scheme would be particularly attractive to those in multi-car households as a means of cutting overall car numbers.\n\"There's a massive amount of savings there for people. Some of the analysis we saw is a car on average costs \u00a33,500 per year - that's a huge amount off a family or individual's budget,\" he said.\nIn terms of numbers, he thinks a truly workable scheme would mean hundreds of cars dotted around the city, possibly 500 or more.\nThere are 1,598 car club vehicles across the whole of England and Wales, excluding London, which has 3,887, according to CoMoUK, so anything on that scale would make Cardiff a significant player in the car club world.\nOther things the council would consider to help boost the scheme could see free parking offered to club car users, \"mobility credits\" for people who gave up a car, or encouraging businesses to use the car club instead of their own pool cars.\nAs Caro Wild puts it: \"We'll need to make it better than owning your own car otherwise why would people bother using it?\""

      "tags": "HM Revenue & Customs,Student finance",
      "text": "Former student Rebecca Gale says she was \"surprised, shocked and then angry\" after getting a student loan refund six years after she finished paying it off.\nThe 35-year-old thought she'd heard the last from the Student Loans Company (SLC) when she made her last payment in 2015.\nBut just a few days ago she got a message on her phone saying she was owed \u00a31,109.\n\"So when I got the voice mail originally I thought 'this is a scam'.\n\"But we checked, rang them and I was initially surprised and delighted because who doesn't like a refund?\"\nRebecca's opinion on the matter started to change though when she began to realise the money had been with the SLC for six years when it should have been in her account.\nThe Manchester University graduate said: \"I was, to be honest, a little bit angry. I wanted to understand how it could take so long to repay something that should have been in my bank account for over half a decade.\n\"We're not talking about the difference between me putting food on the table or clothing my children but \u00a31,100 is still a month's mortgage paid off, that's a month's nursery costs or \u00a31,100 worth of credit debt I could have paid off.\n\"The point is that's my money and it should have been in my account and not theirs,\" said Rebecca, who lives in the Yorkshire Dales.\nThe SLC told Money Box it got some new information from HMRC in May 2021 about Rebecca's student loan repayments in the tax year 2010-11 which meant she had overpaid and was eligible for a refund.\nSLC said as soon as it got this new data it set about trying to contact Rebecca with the end result of the money hitting her account just a few days ago.\nSLC has a bad track record on overpayments, although it is getting better.\nThat's because it used to get annual updates from HMRC which kept a track of how much people had repaid of their student loans via PAYE.\nIn April 2019 those updates turned from once a year to once a week making the system much more efficient. Nonetheless, in the first year of the new system more than 54,000 former students still overpaid \u00a323m between them - an average of \u00a3424 each.\nPeople are now also encouraged to pay off the last couple of years of their loan payments by direct debit to limit the chance of overpayment even further, with some refunds also now taking place automatically (for amounts up to \u00a3750).\nMoney Box contacted HMRC to ask why it took six years to send through new information to SLC about Rebecca's historic payments. In a statement it said: \"Following a routine scan of our records earlier this year, we identified a small number of cases where repayment information had not been passed onto SLC.\n\"We corrected these cases as soon as they became known and notified SLC so that they could update their records.\"\nYou can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme on Saturday at 12pm on Radio 4 or by listening again here shortly after broadcast.\nFollow Money Box and Dan on Twitter."

      "tags": "Native Americans",
      "text": "An A-level history textbook has been withdrawn after a youth worker said she was \"horrified\" to discover an image asking whether the treatment of Native Americans had been exaggerated.\nThe AQA-approved book asked students to balance \"criticisms of treatment of Native Americans\" with \"defence\" of their treatment in the late 1800s.\nThe period saw some massacres of Native American tribes by the US government.\nThe publisher Hodder has withdrawn the book.\nIn one section the textbook - called The Making of a Superpower: USA 1865-1975 - asked students \"to what extent do you believe the treatment of Native Americans has been exaggerated?\"\nHannah Wilkinson, who offers history mentoring sessions at Durham Sixth Form Centre, said the exercise was \"quite problematic\". \n\"It was deeply shocking to see how ingrained racial injustice is,\" she told the BBC.\n\"The period we're looking at is a period of American policy where Native Americans were treated terribly,\" she said.\n\"The way the textbook framed it suggests that maybe the treatment of Native Americans has been exaggerated.\"\nFrom the early the 17th Century through to the late 19th Century a series of wars took place between European colonists and Native American tribes. They became known as the American-Indian Wars.\nIn this time the Native American population fell heavily, partly due to new diseases brought by the Europeans and partly due to wars and massacres. Several historians have accused the colonialists of a \"genocide\" against Native American tribes. \nWhether or not the US government's actions amounted to a genocide, it imposed policies that targeted Native American land, freedom, and wellbeing.\nMs Wilkinson teaches history for students who need extra support as part of her work with St Nicholas Church, Durham.\n\"My concern is that it presents really oppressive policies in an objective way. That didn't seem appropriate to the historical context,\" she said.\n\"I am definitely worried this is a wider pattern. We like to think that compared to America that we don't really have an issue of racial injustice.\"\nShe added: \"This period goes from slavery, to Jim Crow, to civil rights. If this is how they're presenting the history of Native Americans with such bias my concern is whether that is a repeated pattern in the framing of US history and whether that is coming up throughout the course.\"\nAQA has previously had to apologise for textbooks which contained racial stereotypes. \nAn AQA spokesperson said the exercise \"doesn't match our commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion and should never have made it through our process for approving textbooks\".\n\"We know our approval process wasn't always good enough in the past - but we've improved it since then and we do things differently now, including working with external diversity experts and providing better training for our reviewers and staff.\n\"We contacted the publisher as soon as we heard about this content, and we're pleased they've worked very quickly to put this right.\"\nAQA said publisher Hodder Education would remove book from sale \"and review its content\". \n\"We're also working together with publishers to ensure that new and updated editions of AQA-approved textbooks meet our commitment to EDI (equity, diversity and inclusion),\" the exam board said in its response to Ms Wilkinson's original tweet.\n\"We agree that this content is inappropriate and are going to remove this book from sale,\" HodderSchools tweeted. \"We will conduct a thorough review of the content with subject experts.\""
