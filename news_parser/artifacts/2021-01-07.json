      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Birmingham,Coronavirus testing,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "GPs in England are receiving doses of the Oxford Covid jab as medics warn about overstretched hospitals.\nThe rollout of the Oxford vaccine is part of the NHS's biggest-ever effort and aims to offer jabs to 13 million by mid-February - including all over-80s.\nBut Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted vaccine supply was a \"rate-limiting\" factor.\nBirmingham's NHS said there are enough supplies with more to come as politicians warned doses may run out.\nSome hospitals in England are at risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services.\nAnd hospital leaders have warned medics are becoming increasingly stretched with \"untrained staff\" used to fill gaps.\nIt came as a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities - and 52,618 new cases.\nThe latest NHS statistics also show that there were 30,370 patients with Covid in UK hospitals on Tuesday.\nThe rollout of the Oxford vaccine to GPs will help increase vaccinations among the top four priority groups who are first in line to receive doses.\nThe Department of Health said 1.3 million people in the UK, including almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England, have received at least one dose so far.\nWriting to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Birmingham political leaders criticised communication around the vaccination programme in the city.\n\"We acknowledge that the vaccination rollout is in its early days, but we have also learned today that Birmingham has not yet been supplied with any AstraZeneca stock, while current Pfizer stocks are scheduled to run out on Friday this week with currently no clarity on when further supplies will arrive.\"\nThey added \"it remains unclear who is responsible for overseeing the vaccination programme in Birmingham, and whom we should hold accountable for progress and delivery\".\nThe letter is signed by Labour leader of Birmingham City Council, Ian Ward; Liam Byrne MP, Labour's candidate for the West Midlands mayor, and by Conservative MP and ex-minister Andrew Mitchell.\nBut NHS Birmingham and Solihull told the BBC: \"Thousands of people in Birmingham and Solihull have already been vaccinated and this continues at pace. \n\"We have sufficient supplies and more will be coming.\"\nWest Midlands mayor Andy Street said he has been assured supplies of the Oxford vaccine will be delivered to Birmingham on Friday.\nElsewhere, Gillian McLauchlan, deputy director of public health at Salford Council, described \"teething\" issues with the vaccine rollout there.\nShe told councillors at a local scrutiny committee: \"We have no control over vaccine supplies. We are told literally two days in advance 'your next lot of vaccines are coming'.\"\nEngland's vaccination programme is described as the biggest in NHS history, with an aim to offer jabs to most care home residents by the end of January and the most vulnerable by mid-February.\nOfficials leading the vaccination programme are adamant rollout is going to plan - and are cautioning against judging performance too early.\nOf course, there will be teething problems, but the fact remains the UK has vaccinated more per head of population than any other country apart from Israel and Bahrain.\nWhile rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine started on Monday, it was actually only being used at the hospital hubs up to Thursday.\nDeliveries are now being made to hundreds of local vaccination centres. There are 17 in the Birmingham region so they should start to receive doses imminently.\nThat should mean there is a vaccine available if they do run out of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.\nAlthough disruption to the rollout of the programme in the city may still happen as local centres are warning they cannot book patients in until they know they have stock available.\nBut the fact the city's leaders felt compelled to write to the health secretary to warn about this is an illustration of the pressure in the system at the moment.\nGiven the high level of infections and current lockdown, there is a desperation in all quarters to get the most at-risk vaccinated as quickly as possible.\nAnd until the nation sees that translate into significant numbers of people getting vaccinated - 2 million a week is the goal - people will remain on edge.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for emergency use on 2 December but requires specialist storage unsuitable for most GP practices, with doses largely delivered in hospitals.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca jab was approved on 30 December and does not require specialist storage. It was first rolled out on Monday to hospitals and to GPs in England from Thursday.\nMr Hancock visited a GP surgery in London to promote the roll out earlier - but staff there said delivery of the Oxford vaccine had been delayed.\nThe health secretary said he was \"delighted\" care home residents would begin receiving their first Oxford jabs from GPs this week.\n\"This will ensure the most vulnerable are protected and will save tens of thousands of lives,\" he said.\nGP Ammara Hughes, a partner at Bloomsbury Surgery, told broadcasters its first delivery of the Oxford jab had been pushed back 24 hours to Thursday.\nShe said: \"It's just more frustrating than a concern because we've got the capacity to vaccinate. And if we had a regular supply - we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week.\"\nMr Hancock described supply of vaccine as a \"rate-limiting\" step.\nHe said: \"For the first three days with the Oxford vaccine we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well and it's working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed.\n\"The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We're working with the companies - both Pfizer and AstraZeneca - to increase the supply.\"\nMore than 700 local vaccination sites will administer jabs, with the government announcing a further seven mass vaccination sites across England.\nAnother 180 GP-led sites, 100 new hospital sites and a pilot scheme involving local pharmacies will open this week.\nMeanwhile, nearly 19,981 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab - which was the first to be approved for emergency use in the UK last month - were administered between 29 December and 3 January, NHS England said.\nIt came as Rupert Pearse, professor of intensive care medicine and a consultant at the Royal London, said his own intensive care staff are having to care for far more sick patients.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there would usually be a ratio of one fully-trained intensive care nurse for each patient in a unit but staff are becoming increasingly stretched.\n\"Right now we are diluting down to one [intensive care] nurse to three [patients] and filling those gaps with untrained staff and in some instances doctors helping nurses deliver their care... and we're even facing diluting that further to one in four,\" he said.\nAll of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown, and vaccinations are progressing across the devolved nations."

      "title": "'Stop the steal': The deep roots of Trump\u2019s 'voter fraud' strategy",
      "tags": "Social media,US election 2020,Fake News,Donald Trump",
      "text": "President Trump alleged \"fraud\" even while votes were still being counted - the culmination of a strategy at least months in the making.\nIn the early hours of a frosty November morning in Connecticut, 49-year-old Candy snuggled into her bed after a long night shift.\nShe immediately unlocked her phone - and began scrolling through her social media feed, as she does most nights. \nBut this was different - it was election night. The result was still hanging in the balance. Candy scrolled, catching up on the night's news while waiting for her favoured candidate to speak out. And just after 1 a.m., he did:\nCandy agreed. She was frustrated and she wanted to do something - so when one of her best friends invited her to join a Facebook group called Stop the Steal, she jumped at the opportunity. \n\"The Democrats have said since the beginning of all this Covid stuff that they're going to do whatever it takes to get Trump out - and I think that they have succeeded,\" she later said. \nLISTEN NOW: Trending from the BBC World Service\nCandy was expecting this. For months allegations of \"rigged elections\" and \"voter fraud\" have been punctuating her Facebook feed. \nAnd she's not the only American who had been exposed to voting disinformation for months before polling day. \nResearch by the BBC's Anti-disinformation unit reveals that disinformation about voter fraud has been plugged by influential accounts on social media repeatedly, for months. \nAnd it came from the very top. President Trump first started tweeting allegations of fraud as far back as April. \nBetween then and the election, he mentioned rigged elections or voter fraud more than 70 times. \nFor example, he tweeted this in June:\nAnd this in August:\nIt's not a new theme. Mr Trump made claims of voter fraud back in 2016 - after an election he won. \nBut this time around, the evidence suggests many more people have been seeing unsubstantiated claims all over their social media feeds for weeks. Candy is just one of them. Hundreds of thousands joined big Facebook groups under the \"Stop the Steal\" banner. \nOur research found that influential right-wing accounts were instrumental in amplifying these claims - and were frequently retweeted by President Trump. That includes a number of figures with big followings who have gone on to be involved in a protest movement centred around the unsubstantiated idea of a \"rigged\" election. \nOn election night the hashtag #StoptheSteal sprung up on Twitter after the first of many misleading videos about voter fraud went viral.\nThe video showed a poll watcher being denied entry to a Philadelphia polling station. It has almost two million views on Twitter, and was shared by multiple pro-Trump accounts. We investigated the video shortly after it was posted. \nThe man who features in it was asked to wait outside by officials - with a woman telling him that his poll-watching certificate was not valid at that particular polling station. \nThe video was authentic and, as it turns out, the woman was wrong. There was confusion over the rules. Poll watchers used to only be allowed into a particular station in Philadelphia, but they can now visit multiple sites across the city. \nThe situation was later clarified and the man was later allowed into the station, and given an apology. None of that was reflected in the video of course - and the hashtag had already gone viral.\nThe Stop the Steal slogan was then used by those setting up large Facebook groups which, since election night, have cumulatively amassed more than a million members.\nSeveral of these groups have been removed after users posted threats of violence and calls for \"civil war\". \nThey have become a hotbed for more misleading videos and false claims - similar to that incident in Philadelphia - which have flooded social media feeds of people like Candy. \n\"They were saying that we started the group to try to start riots in different places in the country, which wasn't true,\" Candy tells me, increasingly angry about her Stop the Steal Facebook group being closed down. \nCandy, along with most of the members of these groups, aren't calling for violence. She says she is simply pursuing what she thinks is the truth. \n\"Everybody was just out there putting out what fraud they were seeing going on with the election,\" she says.\nShe admits to me that she spends too much time on Facebook - and though she says she doesn't quite trust what she sees on the social network, at the same time it has been her main source of election information. \nShe mentioned a number of debunked or evidence-less claims: that certain types of pens were handed out that would invalidate ballots, or that ballots were being dumped or ripped up. \nWe investigated dozens of claims circulating online turned out to be made up, untrue or impossible to prove. \nOne example: A man said that he had thrown away Trump ballots in Wisconsin in a post that went viral on Facebook. But it turns out that he lives in the suburbs of Detroit - in a totally different state, Michigan. \nThe man, a 32-year-old butcher, revealed his real identity to BBC News, and insisted he had nothing to do with counting any ballots - in Wisconsin or anywhere else. The post, he said, was simply a joke. \nThere's no concrete evidence of votes - for any candidate - being thrown away or ripped up. \nThe claims keep coming.\n\"I saw a video somebody posted that a man had discovered that his wife voted this year,\" Candy says, \"but she died in 2017.\" \nAgain, we've looked into these allegations. Many claims about dead voters have been revealed as misinformation or mistaken identities by the authorities. We found one case where a living person accidently submitted an absentee ballot that was sent to a dead parent. \nThere are others where the voters in question died before the election. Authorities in Michigan confirmed that when that is the case, the vote is thrown out. \nIn the background - and occasional foreground - of this election is a series of increasingly popular conspiracy theories that encourage the idea everything is rigged, suspicious and not as it seems. \nProfessor Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University says the QAnon conspiracy theory may explain in part why these rumours about voting have spread like wildfire. \nThis is the baseless belief that President Trump is waging a secret war against Satanic paedophiles. \n\"Journalists and commentators have focused on the satanic child sex ring elements of the theory,\" she says. \"But buried within that narrative was a deeper 'deep state' narrative,\" which caused Trump supporters to question and doubt almost everything. \nIn her view, even before the first vote was cast there were \"breadcrumbs and a whole narrative framework\" that the Democrats were going to steal the election.\nHer greatest fear is not about violence on the streets. She doesn't think people like Candy who join Stop the Steal groups are going to riot because of fake news online.\nInstead, Whitney Philips and other experts I speak to worry about the slow, gradual erosion of people's faith in democracy.\nAdditional reporting by Olga Robinson\nSubscribe to the BBC Trending podcast or follow us on Twitter @BBCtrending or Facebook.

      "tags": "Knutsford,Bowdon,Ashley,Cheshire",
      "text": "A man who killed a schoolboy after paying him to stop their sexual relationship being revealed has been found guilty of murder.\nMatthew Mason admitted bludgeoning 15-year-old Alex Rodda with a wrench in Ashley, Cheshire, in 2019.\nThe 19-year-old paid Alex more than \u00a32,000 after he contacted his then girlfriend about \"flirty\" messages, Chester Crown Court heard.\nMason, of Ash Lane in Ollerton, will be sentenced on 25 January.\nLawyers acting for Mason, who denied murder, had claimed the killing was the result of self-defence or a loss of control.\nBut the jury rejected this and found him guilty of murdering Alex by a majority of 10 to two.\nAs the verdict was returned, Mason appeared to be crying in the dock. \nMembers of Alex's family were also in tears. In a statement, they said they had \"never come across a more selfish, cold and calculating person\" as Mason. \n\"Mason has attempted to blame Alex and discredit his name throughout this trial and thankfully the jury were able to see through his web of deceit,\" they said. \nSpeaking outside the court, Alex's father Adam Rodda said the trial had been \"very difficult\" for the family and they were relieved Mason had been found guilty of murder. \n\"We wouldn't have accepted anything else, we would have been distraught if any other verdict had been given. We prayed and we are obviously delighted that justice has been done,\" he said.\nOn the evening of 12 December, Mason said he had picked Alex up from his home and drove him to a remote area of woodland where he told him he could not afford to give him any more money.\nThe agricultural engineering student, who was the son of a farmer, told the court he had taken the wrench with him to \"scare him\".\nHe claimed that, once in the woods, Alex had threatened to ruin his life \"financially or socially\" and pushed him to the floor, grabbing the wrench and hitting Mason with it. \nMason said he managed to get the wrench from Alex and recalled hitting him with it twice, although the court heard evidence of further blows.\nAlex, a pupil at Holmes Chapel High School, was struck at least 15 times to the head and his body was found by refuse collectors the next morning.\nThe jury heard Mason had paid Alex more than \u00a32,000 to stop him reporting their \"intimate sexual relationship\".\nIn the month before the murder, Alex contacted Mason's girlfriend to tell her that her boyfriend had been messaging him \"in a flirty way\" and had sent an explicit photo and video.\nMason denied the claim but began making payments to the 15-year-old's bank account.\nBy the time of Alex's death, Mason had transferred more than \u00a32,200 and was asking friends and family to borrow money, the court was told.\nGiving evidence, Mason, who lived with his family on a farm near Knutsford, admitted having sex with Alex but said he thought it was \"wrong\".\nHe told the court he did not believe his friends would accept him if he was gay or bisexual. \nIn the week before Alex's death, Mason made internet searches for phrases including \"what would happen if you kicked someone down the stairs\", \"everyday poison\" and \"the mysteries of Cheshire unsolved deaths of missing people\".\nBut he told the court he had been searching the terms because he was suicidal.\nAfter killing Alex, Mason had a drink with friends in the Red Lion pub in Pickmere and The Golden Pheasant pub in Plumley, Cheshire Police said.\nHe later returned to the woods and the prosecution believe he dragged Alex's body to the side of the road and attempted to put him inside his car.\nAfter failing to do this, he drove away. But a witness had taken a photo of his Renault Clio car parked on the track and reported this to police.\nMason was identified as the owner and arrested the next day. \nPolice said Mason had dried blood on his hands and there was a bin bag in his boot with a blood-stained fleece, the wrench and Alex's jacket in it.\nDet Insp Nigel Reid said: \"Mason had murder on his mind as he drove Alex to his death under the pretence of sexual activity. \n\"He chose a secluded place to kill him in cold blood, a place he believed he would go unseen and his crime undetected.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

It expects January traffic to fall below 1.25 million.\nIt said it did not expect these latest flight cuts and further traffic reductions to materially affect its net loss for the year to 31 March 2021, since many of the flights would have been loss-making.\nRyanair hit out at Irish and UK governments for the latest lockdowns.\n\"The WHO have previously confirmed that governments should do everything possible to avoid brutal lockdowns, because lockdowns 'do not get rid of the virus',\" Ryanair said in a statement. \n\"Ireland's Covid-19 travel restrictions are already the most stringent in Europe, and so these new flight restrictions are inexplicable and ineffective when Ireland continues to operate an open border between the Republic and the North of Ireland.\"\nIt called on the Irish Government to accelerate the rollout of vaccines.\n\"The fact that the Danish Government, with a similar five million population, has already vaccinated 10 times more citizens than Ireland shows that emergency action is needed to speed Covid vaccinations in Ireland.\"\nRival low-cost carrier Norwegian said its traffic figures had been hit heavily by the pandemic, with customer numbers down 94% compared to the same period the previous year.\nIn December, 129,664 customers flew with Norwegian, with the capacity and total passenger traffic both down by 98%.\n\"2020 has been a very challenging year and we now find ourselves fighting for survival,\" said Jacob Schram, chief executive of Norwegian.\n\"The vaccination is now being rolled out across the world and is good news for both the aviation industry and those who want to travel.\""

      "tags": "Hong Kong anti-government protests,China,Hong Kong national security law,Hong Kong",
      "text": "More than 50 of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested in the biggest crackdown since China imposed a draconian security law last year.\nAbout 1,000 police took part in morning raids on 72 premises across the city.\nThose held helped run an unofficial \"primary\" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections.\nThey are accused of trying to \"overthrow\" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent.\nChina's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. \nBeijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop \"external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security\".\nBut the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are \"the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment\".\nDozens have been arrested under the security law since it was enacted in June, but never have so many been rounded up at the same time as on Wednesday, which marked a major escalation in the crackdown and sent a chill through pro-democracy figures.\nPolice fanned out around the city and in early morning raids detained 53 people who represent a who's who of democratic forces in the former British colony, young and old. They include: \nPolice also searched the home of already detained activist Joshua Wong, as well as three news outlets. \nApple Daily and Stand News, which had co-organised election forums for the primaries candidates, and In-Media, which ran ads around the primaries, were ordered to hand over information.\nMr Clancy, a veteran legal activist and long-time resident of Hong Kong, is chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the first US citizen held under the new law. He was detained when police searched the offices of law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners where he works.\nHours after the dawn arrests John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, confirmed a group of people had been arrested as part of an operation targeting those suspected of \"overthrowing\" the city's government.\nThe government will not tolerate \"subversive\" acts, he said, speaking at the city's Legislative Council.\nIf charged under the new national security law, the detainees could face life in prison. \nThe BBC's Danny Vincent in Hong Kong says the legislation has spread what activists call \"white terror\" across the city. It has all but silenced the street protest movement and led to a growing number of activists fleeing the territory.\nWhen authorities introduced the law, they claimed it would target only a small number of activists, but the wide-ranging nature of Wednesday's operation has led many to fear the authorities are now trying to eliminate the entire opposition camp, he says. \nIn July last year, an alliance of opposition parties ran independently organised primaries to see which of their candidates had the best chances in September's election for the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's parliament. \nMore than 600,000 people voted in the primaries. The election was later postponed, with officials citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the delay. \nThe opposition groups had hoped that winning more seats would give them enough power to block government proposals and increase pressure for democratic reforms. \nHong Kong's leader Carrie Lam had warned at the time the primaries could amount to subversion if the candidates intended to obstruct government policies through their election.\nSeveral of the opposition figures planning to stand in the LegCo election were later disqualified from running, including Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist who rose to prominence covering the 2019 protests. \nMost of the opposition lawmakers in the current LegCo resigned in November in protest at four of them being dismissed from parliament. \nThe crackdown has stunned people in Hong Kong.\n\"Seeing the news today I feel completely shocked. I feel very disappointed. It seems that such major things are happening in Hong Kong and there's nothing we can do about it. \n\"I feel very unhappy and it seems that even during the epidemic the government can still do so many things to terrorise people,\" Mannie Ng, a Hong Kong resident, told Reuters news agency.\nThe arrests have been widely condemned internationally. \nAntony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick as next US Secretary of State, said they were an \"assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights\".\n\"The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy.\"\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the arrests were a \"grievous attack\" on rights applied under the joint declaration signed with Britain when the territory was handed over in 1997.\nHe said it demonstrated the national security law was \"being used to crush dissent and opposing political views\".\nChris Patten, the territory's last British governor, said: \"The Chinese Communist Party has further turned the screw in Hong Kong. Liberal democracies around the world must continue to speak out against the brutal destruction of a free society.\"\nMaya Wang, China specialist at Human Rights Watch, said China was now \"removing the remaining veneer of democracy in the city\".\n\"Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government,\" she said.\nNathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist who fled the territory in July last year, said the widespread arrests had taken \"the suppression of political freedom and freedom of speech\" to \"another level\". \n\"Anyone who is still defending the National Security Law and making peace is the enemy of Hong Kong people.\"\nBy Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai\nBeijing sees \"vicious plans\" to topple Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government. Supporters of the dozens arrested see another crude crackdown on what's left of the territory's nascent democracy. \nDespite co-ordinated international criticism, with some targeted retaliation, led by the US and the UK, the authorities have enthusiastically embraced their powers under the new national security law passed last year. \nHow these latest arrests come under that jurisdiction is not yet clear. But it's worth remembering this law is ambiguous and sweeping in its definition, targeting anyone, anywhere in the world.\nThe street protests are now a distant memory. Some prominent figures have fled to friendly countries, almost certainly never to return. \nThe security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.\nIt has been widely criticised by rights groups and Western nations as effectively curtailing dissent.\nA former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It retained more civil and political freedoms than the mainland has.\nActivists say that in recent years, these freedoms have been eroded. Pro-democracy protests have often led to violent clashes with police. \nThe Chinese government has defended the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland.\nAfter the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety and several high profile court cases under the security law have started.\nMedia tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under it as well as several activists who tried to flee the territory by boat last August.

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Housing market",
      "text": "Planned reforms of the controversial leasehold system in England are set to clamp down on high costs when extending a lease.\nThe government's proposals should help those with shorter leases fearing bills of many thousands of pounds.\nFormer council tenants who bought their homes in the 1980s are likely to be among those who could benefit.\nCampaigners gave the complex proposals, which could affect up to four million homes, a guarded welcome.\nSome have dubbed the system as \"fleecehold\", owing to issues over escalating rents and high charges.\nWhile they welcome protections for leaseholders in the future, many believe they should be paid compensation for unjustified charges and rents in the past.\nSomeone who owns a property outright, including the land it is built on, is a freeholder.\nWith a leasehold, the person owns a lease, which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes.\nWhen a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years - but sometimes up to 999 years. People may extend their lease or buy the freehold, but this can be complicated and expensive and involve legal fees.\nLeasehold house owners are also often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell.\nWhen a homebuyer purchases a leasehold property, they do not possess it outright. Instead they gain the right to occupy it for a set number of years. \nThey can extend their lease by applying to their freeholder and negotiating a fee.\nPart of this fee is called the marriage value - representing the increase in the value of the property once the lease has been extended.\nUnder the government's plans, the marriage value will be abolished - following recommendations by the Law Commission.\nMinisters say this will make charges more transparent when it comes to extending a lease.\n\"Across the country people are struggling to realise the dream of owning their own home but find the reality of being a leaseholder far too bureaucratic, burdensome and expensive,\" said Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick.\nThe Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, which advises leaseholders, welcomed some of the moves but said it needed more details on how the new calculations would work, how much an extension would cost, and whether it would be cheaper for everyone.\nMr Jenrick claimed that there would be savings of between \u00a38,000 and \u00a39,000 for the average leaseholder buying their freehold.\nHe said the government was working with the housing sector to develop commonhold as a potential alternative to leasehold in flat purchases in the years ahead - where flat-owners held the freehold to their property, but blocks were jointly-owned and managed.\nHe said he was working towards a \"widespread take-up of commonhold over the course of this Parliament\", which would signal what the future should look like \"beyond leasehold\".\nPaediatric nurse Katie Kendrick was told she could buy the freehold on her Cheshire home for between \u00a32,000 and \u00a34,000 two years later, only for it to be sold on to an investment company which quoted her more than \u00a313,000.\nHer experience led her to become one of the founders of the National Leasehold Campaign, describing the system as a relic of a feudal age. She said the government's plans marked \"the start of the end for leasehold\".\nHowever, the campaign called for the changes to be made quickly to get many leaseholders out of the existing limbo.\nThe initial part of the plan will see leaseholders given the opportunity to extend their lease for 990 years - reducing risks of the property becoming more difficult to sell.\nUnder current rules, leaseholders\u202fof houses\u202fcan only extend their lease once for 50 years with a ground rent. \nThis compares to leaseholders of flats who can extend as often as they wish at a zero ground rent for 90 years.\u202f\nThe government wants legislation in the current session of Parliament to allow house and flat leaseholders to extend their lease to a new standard 990 years with the ground rent set at zero.\u202f\nAlthough developers say leasehold can work for many people, the government has already said that ground rents should be set to zero for new leases. Under its new proposals, these rules should also apply to retirement leasehold properties, for homes built specifically for older people.\nThat move was welcomed by Propertymark - the professional body for estate agency staff, which has campaigned on the issue.\n\"While we welcome the government's initiative to reduce ground rents to zero for all new retirement properties, we would argue this needs to be extended to all retirement properties to create a level playing field,\" said its chief policy adviser Mark Hayward."

      "text": "People who have had Covid vaccines are being warned to still take care.\nVaccination has been shown to prevent severe infection, so even if people do catch the virus, they would be protected from getting seriously ill.\nThe call comes as an NHS nurse working for the Hywel Dda University Health Board area said she contracted Covid-19 while waiting for her second dose.\nThe health board said while the vaccine \"reduces your chance of suffering\", \"no vaccine is 100% effective\".\nThe Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, which started being rolled out in the UK last month, offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 after a second dose.\nOn Friday, the First Minister advised people receiving the vaccine to \"continue to act in a precautionary way\".\nMark Drakeford said those people should \"recognise the new protection that they have\" but \"recognise as well that for many weeks, and for some months ahead, coronavirus is going to continue to be a feature of all our lives\".\nThe hospital nurse, who works in the Hywel Dda University Health Board area in west Wales, said she felt \"angry and heartbroken\" about catching Covid at this stage.\nThe nurse, who has asked not to be identified, said she was initially relieved to be offered the chance of a vaccine and despite difficulties getting an appointment, she said she received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine last month.  \n\"It gave me peace of mind. It made me feel safer and that I was doing the right thing for my family... but it gives a false sense of security,\" she said.\nThe nurse said she was told it would take 10 days for the vaccine to offer some protection and reduce the risk of transmission. \nHowever, three weeks after the jab, she said she began to feel unwell - with \"quite severe symptoms\" of a bad cough, high temperature and breathlessness - and said she was \"shocked\" when she tested positive for coronavirus.\nShe said her partner and one of her children also tested positive.\nThe British Medical Association Cymru Wales has previously expressed concern about the length of time between doses.\nDoctors' union, BMA Cymru Wales, said there was a lack of evidence to support waiting 12 weeks for a second vaccine dose.\nChair Dr David Bailey said: \"Our families don't choose to be exposed to a much higher dose of Covid, so we feel it's right that we should be protecting health workers and their families.\"  \nHywel Dda health board said it had already vaccinated more than 10,000 high-risk people, including frontline NHS staff.\nDeputy Chief Executive Dr Philip Kloer, said: \"It is always distressing to hear about staff contracting the virus. Whilst the vaccine reduces your chance of suffering from Covid-19, no vaccine is 100% effective.\n\"There is particular risk that you may have contracted Covid-19 immediately prior to having the vaccine without knowing it, or that you may contract it in the week or two following vaccination as your body builds up protection.\n\"We have communicated the UK policy and assurances on second doses to our staff and assured them they will receive their second dose within 12 weeks of the first.\"\nHe added: \"Working within the NHS at the moment is very challenging and we acknowledge how difficult this is.\n\"Staff have worked tirelessly and made many sacrifices on behalf of caring for our communities and we are extremely grateful. We have put in place additional support and counselling and psychological support services.\""

      "tags": "Georgia,Republican Party,Democratic Party,United States Senate",
      "text": "The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden has won control of the Senate - and of Congress overall - with two victories in the state of Georgia.\nRaphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeated Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue respectively.\nDemocrats will control the Senate, the House of Representatives and the White House for the first time since 2009. \nAn estimated four million Georgians turned out to vote in the run-off election.\nThe result is a severe blow for outgoing Republican President Donald Trump.\nThe Georgia election was rerun because none of the candidates in the November general election achieved the 50% needed for victory under state rules. \nMr Warnock, a Baptist pastor, becomes the first black senator for Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black member of the Senate in US history. \nMr Warnock paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. \n\"The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,\" he said. \nWith the result in Georgia, the Democrats and the Republicans will now each have 50 seats in the Senate, the upper house of Congress.\nHowever, the incoming Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, will preside over the Senate once she takes office and will have the tie-breaking vote.\nThis gives the Biden administration a greater chance of achieving its agenda on issues such as healthcare and climate change. \nThe Senate also has the power to approve or reject Mr Biden's nominees for cabinet and judicial posts.\nIt appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up at the polls in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Meanwhile, Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers.\nThe two Democrats at times ran as a team, and appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Mr Ossoff drew out suburban and educated voters around Atlanta.\nDonald Trump is set to receive considerable blame for the Republican defeat. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state.\nInstead, the two races remained close, as Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Georgia's Republican leaders.\nIt turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it will cost Republicans control of the Senate. \nBoth races were very tight. Mr Warnock defeated Senator Kelly Loeffler by a projected 50.7% to 49.3%, figures from the Associated Press indicate. \nMs Loeffler, who was appointed to the Senate last year to fill a vacancy, is a Trump loyalist. \nThe other contest was even closer. Jon Ossoff edged ahead of Senator David Perdue, 70, taking 50.28% to 49.72%.\nFinal results are expected later.\nPresident Trump continued to make unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud, doubting the integrity of the Georgia vote. \nOn Sunday, a recording emerged of Mr Trump putting pressure on Georgia's top election official, Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to \"find\" enough votes to overturn Mr Biden's win in the state.\nRaphael Warnock, 51, is a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta - the church where civil rights leader Martin Luther King once preached.\nMr Warnock was a youth pastor in New York City in the 1990s before moving to Baltimore, one of the poorest cities in the US.\nThere, he worked to educate his congregation about the risks of HIV/Aids. He also supports access to abortion, making him a rarity among faith leaders, and opposes the death penalty. In 2013, he gave the benediction at the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\nJon Ossoff, 33, is a documentary filmmaker, born in Atlanta. As a high school student, he interned for John Lewis, the civil rights campaigner and congressman who died in 2020.\nHe became an aide to a Democratic member of Congress, specialising in foreign policy and national security.\nIn 2012, Mr Ossoff joined an independent production company specialising in investigative journalism, Insight TWI, which is based in London. He is now the CEO. "

      "text": "The US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe Biden's election victory.\nLawmakers were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the White House. \nHere's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday.\nJust before midday local time (17:00 GMT) thousands of people gather at the Ellipse, near the White House, to hear the president speak at a \"Save America\" rally. \nHe tells them: \"We're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue... and we're going to the Capitol and we're going to try and give\u2026 our Republicans, the weak ones... the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.\"\nAs the speech ends, crowds start to drift towards the Congress building, about a mile and a half away, where they are met by police barriers.\nThe Capitol is home to the two chambers of the US government that make up Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate. \nChanting crowds start to gather on both sides of the building at around 13:10, grappling with police at the metal barricades. \nTear gas and pepper spray are used to try to keep the protesters at bay. \nPolice officers struggle to maintain control of the situation as protesters advance on the building on multiple fronts. \nOn the east side, the crowd force their way through barricades on the Capitol Plaza and move on the main entrance, quickly gaining access to the Great Rotunda. \nOnce inside, they head for the House and Senate chambers. \nIgor Bobic, a journalist for the Huffington Post, captures a group of men forcing a police officer to retreat up a set of stairs as they continue their advance. \nSenators are forced to abandon the process of confirming President-elect Biden's victory and the building goes into lockdown.\nThe doors of the House chamber are locked and a makeshift barricade is erected in front of them. Security officials guard the entrance, guns drawn.\nWithin an hour, protesters have also broken police lines on the west side of the Capitol, scaling walls to reach the building itself before smashing windows and forcing doors open. \nOther videos and images show rioters storming through the building's ornately-decorated corridors and chambers chanting \"USA!\" and \"Stop the steal\".\nShortly before 15:00, gunshots are reportedly heard inside the building. \nPhotos and video footage later show a female protester being shot as she tries to break through the barricaded doors of the Speakers' Lobby. \nDespite efforts by police and others at the scene to save her, she is later reported to have died.\nOn the other side of the building, protesters break into the Senate chamber, one taking seat in the Speaker's chair. \nAnother protester is photographed nearby sitting in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, with his foot on the table.\nAfter growing condemnation of the riots, President Trump eventually calls for calm, telling the protesters to leave peacefully: \"Go home. We love you, you're very special.\"\nBy 17:40, the building is cleared and made secure ahead of the 18:00 curfew ordered by DC Mayor Muriel Bowser. \nSeveral thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service are deployed to help.\nMore than six hours after the storming of the building, senators return and resume the day's business of certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.\nAt 03:41 on Thursday, Congress confirms President-elect Joe Biden will succeed President Trump on 20 January. \n."

It's invested heavily in boosting online capacity to keep up with the soaring demand.\nSupermarkets have struggled to make money from doing online deliveries, but Sainsbury's says its operation has become more efficient and profitability has improved. As volumes have increased, there are more orders in every van delivering to a smaller radius of customers.  \nClick-and-collect is a lot cheaper to do than home deliveries. And this accounted for about a quarter of online sales in the final week.\nArgos generated more than half its sales from online well before the pandemic. More than 300 Argos counters are now inside Sainsbury's supermarkets, making it easy for people to pick up goods and gifts. Its fast-track delivery service can deliver to customers' homes and collection points within hours and this has seen growth of 62%.\nThis is a business that's been well placed to benefit from the huge shift to digital this Christmas.\nChristmas and New Year celebrations were constrained by coronavirus restrictions, which limited the number of people and households allowed to meet up.\nSainsbury's said that while people had smaller gatherings, they still treated themselves, with sales of the supermarket's premium Taste the Difference range up 11%.\nPremium champagne sales were up 52%, it added, echoing similar findings by rival Morrisons.\n\"People did more home baking than usual, with mincemeat sales up 24%. Customers still wanted New Year's Eve at home to feel special and we sold a record number of steaks,\" Sainsbury's said.\nSales of groceries, general merchandise and clothing were stronger than expected throughout the quarter, particularly since the start of England's second national lockdown, it added.\nClothing benefited from better-than-anticipated full-price sales, driven by customers shopping earlier for Christmas and changes to the supermarket's Black Friday trading strategy.\nSeparate figures issued by discount retailer B&M indicated that it too had a good Christmas, with like-for-like revenues at its UK stores up 21.1% year-on-year in the 13 weeks to 26 December.\n\"With our combination of exceptional value and convenient out-of-town locations, we are confident that our business model will prove highly relevant to the needs of customers in 2021,\" said chief executive Simon Arora.

      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is being rolled out to hundreds of GP-run vaccination sites in England.\nAs part of the biggest vaccination programme in NHS history, the aim is to offer jabs to most care home residents by the end of January.\nBy mid-February, the target is to vaccinate 13 million people in the top four priority groups.\nBut one surgery visited by the health secretary to promote the initiative said its delivery had been delayed. \nAnd leaders in Birmingham have warned stocks of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are scheduled to run out in the city on Friday, and that it has not received any supplies of the Oxford-Astra Zeneca jab.\nA letter sent to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, signed by the Labour leader of Birmingham City Council, Ian Ward, Labour MP Liam Byrne and Conservative MP and former minister Andrew Mitchell, said there was \"currently no clarity on when further supplies will arrive\".\nThey also criticise a lack of clarity over the vaccination programme, and say \"it remains unclear who is responsible for overseeing the vaccination programme in Birmingham, and whom we should hold accountable for progress and delivery\".\nMore than 700 local vaccination sites will administer the Oxford jab.\nAnother 180 GP-led sites, 100 new hospital sites and a pilot scheme involving local pharmacies will open this week.\nSelected hospitals began administering the vaccine on Monday.\nMr Hancock said the jab was now being supplied to GP practices across the country as he visited the Bloomsbury Surgery in central London.\nThe health secretary said he was \"delighted\" care homes residents would begin receiving their first Oxford jabs this week.\n\"This will ensure the most vulnerable are protected and will save tens of thousands of lives,\" he said.\nBut GP Ammara Hughes, a partner at Bloomsbury Surgery, told broadcasters its first delivery of the jab had been pushed back 24 hours to Thursday.\nShe said: \"It's just more frustrating than a concern because we've got the capacity to vaccinate. And if we had a regular supply - we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week.\"\nStanding in front of Dr Hughes's surgery, Mr Hancock said: \"The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We're working with the companies - both Pfizer and AstraZeneca - to increase the supply.\"\nThe surgery said it was continuing to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and had so far received three deliveries of that jab.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said vaccination centres and GP surgeries needed better information about deliveries of the vaccine and how much to expect to arrive.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted that the scenes at the surgery were like something from political comedy The Thick of It, but added: \"Sadly it's no laughing matter.\"\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first to be approved by the UK's medicines regulator in early December, followed by the British-made Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine four weeks later.\nBecause it does not need to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it can be transported and stored more easily, making it simpler to vaccinate housebound people and those in care homes.\nAround half a million doses of both vaccines are ready to be used this week, with millions more in the pipeline in the coming weeks.\nNext week, seven major vaccination hubs across England are set to begin operating, including the Excel Centre in London and Millennium Point in Birmingham.\nBroadly, vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out in a list of nine high-priority groups, covering around 30 million people.\nThey are thought to represent 90-99% of those at risk of dying from Covid-19.\nPeople aged over 80 in hospital, frontline health staff and care home workers have been the first to get the Pfizer jab at designated hospitals hubs and community sites across the UK. \nMeanwhile, nearly 19,981 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab were administered between 29 December and 3 January, NHS England said.\nDr Nikki Kanani, a GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said the vaccination programme was \"off to a strong start with around one million people already vaccinated against coronavirus\".\nShe said GPs, nurses, pharmacists and countless other staff and volunteers had been working \"around the clock\" to be able to launch almost 200 more sites this week. \n\"We will now be able to protect many more vulnerable people against the virus and faster,\" Dr Kanani said.\nNearly a quarter of the over-80s in England have now been vaccinated in total, around 650,000 people, since Margaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to receive a Covid vaccine in December.\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK had received their first dose of a vaccine.\nOn Wednesday, another 1,041 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were recorded, the highest daily death toll since April.\nAnd 62,322 new cases were recorded on Wednesday, the highest daily rise since mass testing began.\nAll of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown, and vaccinations are progressing across the devolved nations.\nEngland is under a third national lockdown - in a bid to prevent the NHS from becoming overwhelmed by the surge in coronavirus cases.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a new lockdown on Monday - across mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha for the rest of January. Level three restrictions apply in remaining areas of the nation.\nWales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December, and schools and colleges in the nation will remain closed until at least 18 January.\nIn Northern Ireland - which entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December - \"stay at home\" restrictions will be brought back into law from Friday.\nAs of Monday, about 100,000 people in Scotland had already received a first dose of vaccine. The Scottish NHS hopes to vaccinate everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May, supplies allowing.\nMore than 35,000 people in Wales have had a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and the Welsh government has said 40,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be available within the first two weeks. \nAbout 40,000 people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose, and health officials in the nation have said everyone aged over 80 will be immunised within weeks."

      "tags": "Washington DC,US Capitol stormed,United States Capitol,Donald Trump,United States Senate",
      "text": "This is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang.\nFor weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands.\nOn Wednesday morning, the president and his warm-up speakers set the whirlwind in motion.\nRudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, said the election disputes should be resolved through \"trial by combat\".\nDonald Trump Jr, the president's oldest son, had a message to members of his party who would not \"fight\" for their president.\n\"This isn't their Republican Party anymore,\" he said. \"This is Donald Trump's Republican Party.\"\nThen the president himself encouraged the growing crowd, which had chanted \"stop the steal\" and \"bullshit\" at the president's prompting, to march the two miles from the White House to the Capitol.\n\"We will never give up. We will never concede,\" the president said. \"Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.\"\nAs the president was concluding his remarks, a different kind of drama was playing out within the Capitol itself, as a joint session of Congress prepared to tabulate the state-by-state results of the election.\nFirst, Pence - disregarding the president's urging to throw out the results from contested states - released a statement that he did not have such powers and his role was \"largely ceremonial\".\nThen Republicans issued their first challenge, to Arizona votes, and the House and Senate began their separate deliberations on whether to accept Joe Biden's victory there.\nThe House proceedings were raucous, with both sides cheering as their speakers made their remarks.\n\"The oath that I took this past Sunday to defend and support the Constitution makes it necessary for me to object to this travesty,\" said newly elected Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, who had recently made headlines for insisting that she would carry a handgun with her in Congress. \"I will not allow the people to be ignored.\"\nIn the Senate, the debate was taking on a different tone. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, dressed in the kind of dark suit and tie that befits a funeral, was coming to bury Donald Trump, not praise him.\n\"If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral,\" McConnell said. \"We'd never see the whole nation accept an election again. Every four years would be a scramble for power at any cost.\"\nThe Kentucky senator, who will become the Senate minority leader as a result of his party's two recent defeats in Georgia, said that the chamber was designed to \"stop short-term passions from boiling over and melting the foundations of our republic\".\nHis words were practically still hanging in the air when the passions outside the Capitol boiled over, and the Trump supporters, perhaps inspired by the earlier speeches, stormed the building. They swamped the insufficient security in place and brought the proceedings to a grinding halt, as lawmakers, staff and media rushed to find shelter from the rioters.\nThe drama unfolded in fits and starts. Television cameras broadcast images of protesters dancing and waving flags on the steps of the Capitol. Photos and snippets popped up on social media of rioters inside the building, attempting to break into the legislative chambers and posing in the offices of elected legislators; of security officers, guns drawn in the House of Representatives, behind barricaded doors.\nIn Wilmington, Delaware, President-elect Joe Biden scrapped a planned speech on the economy and condemned what he called an \"insurrection\" in Washington.\n\"At this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times,\" he said. \"An assault on the citadel of liberty, the Capitol itself.\"\nHe concluded his short remarks with a challenge to Trump: to go on national television to condemn the violence and \"demand an end to this siege\".\nMinutes later, Trump would offer his message to the nation - but it was not the one Biden suggested.\nInstead, sandwiched between his now familiar complaints about the election being \"stolen\", he told his supporters \"to go home, we love you, you're very special\".\nIt was the kind of kid gloves way the president has routinely responded to transgressions from his supporters - whether it was their violent treatment of protesters at his rallies, the \"very fine people on both sides\" statement after the clashes at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville or his \"stand back and stand by\" message to the far-right Proud Boys group during the first debate with Biden.\nTrump's tweet, and two subsequent ones which also praised his supporters, were flagged and then removed by Twitter, which took the unprecedented step of locking the president's account for 12 hours. Facebook followed suit, banning Trump for a full day.\nFor the first time in his presidency, for the first time in his long, intimate relationship with social media, Donald Trump had been silenced.\nIf this is the \"at long last, have you left no sense of decency\" moment for Donald Trump, it arrives as they're cleaning up blood and broken glass in the US Capitol.\nAs the afternoon stretched into the evening, and police finally secured the US Capitol, a growing chorus of voices - from the left and right - condemned the violence. It was not surprising that Democrats, like soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, laid the riots at the feet of the president.\n\"January 6 will go down as one of the darkest days in American history,\" he said. \"A final warning to our nation of the consequences of the demagogic president, the people who enable him, the captive media that parrot his lies and the people who follow him as he attempts to push America to the brink of ruin.\"\nMore noteworthy, however, were the Republicans who followed suit.\n\"We just had a violent mob assault the Capitol in an attempt to prevent those from carrying out our Constitutional duty,\" tweeted Congresswoman Lynne Cheney, a frequent Republican critic of the president's. \"There is no question that the president formed the mob, the president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob.\"\nThe condemnations were not limited to Trump's reliable intraparty critics, however. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who frequently sides with the president, also spoke out.\n\"It's past time for the president to accept the results of the election, quit misleading the American people, and repudiate mob violence,\" he said.\nFirst Lady Melania Trump's Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham and Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Matthews both resigned in protest, and there are reports that more administration officials will head for the exits in the next 24 hours. \nCBS has reported that Trump administration Cabinet officials are discussing the 25th amendment to the US constitution, which outlines how the vice-president and a majority of the Cabinet can temporarily remove a president from office.\nWhether Pence and the Cabinet act or not, Trump's presidency will be over in just two weeks. At that point, Republican Party leaders will have to grapple with a future where it has lost control of the Congress and the White House and has a former president whose reputation is badly tarnished but who still has strong sway over a sizeable segment of the party's base.\nWednesday's events could presage a pitched battle for the direction of the party, as conservatives within the party attempt to wrest control away from Trump and his loyalists. McConnell, given his remarks earlier in the day, appears willing to chart such a course. Others, like Utah Senator Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee, may also take a leading role.\nThey will be challenged by others within the party who may be more interested in laying claim to Trump's populist mantle. It was notable that Josh Hawley of Missouri, the first senator to announce he would object the results of the election in the Senate, did not step away from his challenge even after the Senate reconvened following the violence in the Capitol.\nCrisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage.\nMeanwhile, Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long. \nAnd once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters."

      "tags": "James Gallagher,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lockdowns have worked before, but can we expect the new one to do the same?\nIt feels like we are back in March or April last year, when the strict controls on all our lives led to a fairly quick decline in levels of coronavirus. \nBut one of the crucial differences this time is the new variant, which is thought to spread between 50 and 70% faster than previous forms of the virus. \nExperts warn there are now no guarantees that lockdown will be enough to bring the variant under control. \n\"It still would not have been easy, but it would have been a much easier situation if it had not been for the new variant,\" Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told Inside Health.\n\"That really pushes the bounds of our ability to control the spread of the virus, even with measures that were previously relatively quite effective.\"\nThe coronavirus spreads when we come into contact with each other so moving classrooms online, telling people to stay at home and closing shops breaks many of those opportunities for human contact. \nIf we consider the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - it was about 3.0 in the run up to the first lockdown and anything above 1.0 means cases are climbing.\nR fell to 0.6 during the first lockdown.\nThen every 1,000 infected people passed the virus on to 600 others, who passed it on to 360 others and so on. \nBut if the new variant is 50% more transmissible then the R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be about 0.9.\nThen 1,000 infected people would pass the virus onto 900 others, then 810 and so on. \nAs you can see this leads to far slower decline. \nAnd that assumes lockdown can get R down to 0.9 in areas where the new variant has become the most common form of the virus. \nIf, as some studies suggest, the variant is about 70% more transmissible then R may stay above 1.0 and cases may not fall at all.\n\"We'd at best flatten the curve, keep numbers at a roughly constant level, and that's frankly why there is so much emphasis on getting vaccine into people's arms as quickly as possible,\" said Prof Ferguson.  \nIt is hard to lock down even harder as there are some parts of society - hospitals, supermarkets - that need to be kept open. \nWhat happens to the number of cases over the coming weeks will be closely monitored. If this lockdown is less effective then we will have to live with it for longer.\nThere have been some encouraging signs over the Christmas break, which was a bit like a lockdown due to school holidays and other restrictions.\n\"We are in a very difficult situation here, but my initial assessment of the last few days is that the rate is slowing which is good news,\" Prof John Edmunds, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC.\nHe added: \"It looks likes those restrictions should be sufficient to stop the increase, whether they will be sufficient to bring cases down sufficiently we are yet to see.\"\nEventually the vaccine will give people immunity so we do not need the same controls on our lives.  \nNow more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Alaska,US politics",
      "text": "The Trump administration has held the first sale for rights to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - but it drew no interest from major companies.\nAn Alaskan state agency emerged as the primary bidder at the auction, which has been heavily criticised by environmental groups.\nThe sale raised less than $15m (\u00a311m) - far less than the government had hoped.\nThe tepid interest comes amid big changes in the energy industry.\nMajor companies, including oil giant Exxon, Shell and BP, have said they are focusing their spending on renewable energy, amid a huge slump in oil prices, in part triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.\nAdam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said the sale was an \"epic failure\" for the Trump administration and the Alaska Republicans, who had backed the move as a way to create jobs and reduce American dependence on foreign oil.\n\"After years of promising a revenue and jobs bonanza they ended up throwing a party for themselves, with the state being one of the only bidders,\" he said in a statement.  \n\"We have long known that the American people don't want drilling in the Arctic Refuge, the [Alaska native] Gwich'in people don't want it, and now we know the oil industry doesn't want it either.\"\nMr Kolton said his organisation would continue to fight in court to reverse the sale of the land, which is home to caribou, polar bears and millions of migratory birds.\nThe wildlife refuge is estimated to hold some 11 billion barrels of oil.\nOpening the wilderness for drilling and development has been a long-term priority for Alaska Republicans, but development was expected to be costly since the area has minimal roads and infrastructure.\nAfter decades of controversy, the sale was finally authorised by the US Congress in 2017 as part of a major package of tax cuts. The auction comes just weeks before Donald Trump is due to leave office on 20 January.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden had vowed to protect the refuge and environmental groups have also challenged the sale, which they say threatens land that provides a vital home to wildlife.\nA federal court rejected arguments by environmental groups seeking to block the auction on Tuesday.\nAt Wednesday's auction, the Bureau of Land Management said it had received bids for 12 of the 22 tracts of land offered, covering more than 600,000 acres.\nThe Alaska Industrial Development and Industrial Authority, a state agency, was the sole bidder on at least eight of the 12 tracts.\nSome bids submitted were \"incomplete\", the bureau said.\nThe state agency has said it plans to work with private companies on development of the refuge, which encompasses more than 19,000 million acres overall.\nOn social media platform Twitter, Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy called the sale \"historic for Alaska and tremendous for America\".\n\"Opening [Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge] for responsible resource development could put more oil in our pipeline, put Alaskans to work, bring billions of dollars of investment to our state, support American energy independence, and provide critical revenues to our state and local communities,\" he wrote. \n\"Alaskans have waited two generations for this moment; I stand with them in support of this day.\""

He also said \"We love you.\"\nA spokesperson for Twitter said: \"After the Tweets were removed and the subsequent 12-hour period expired, access to @realDonaldTrump was restored.\n\"Any future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account.\"\nEarlier in the day, the president was suspended from Facebook and Instagram. That suspension will be reviewed after the transition of power to Joe Biden on 20 January.  \nThe social network had originally imposed a 24-hour ban after the US Capitol attack.\nFacebook's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote that the risks of allowing Mr Trump to post \"are simply too great\".\nMr Zuckerberg said Facebook had removed the president's posts \"because we judged that their effect - and likely their intent - would be to provoke further violence\".\nHe said it was clear Mr Trump intended to undermine the transfer of power to President-elect Joe Biden.\n\"Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete,\" he wrote.\nMr Trump's favoured platform, Twitter, suspended the president for 12 hours on Wednesday.\nThe company said it required the removal of three tweets for \"severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy\".\nIt said the president's account would remain locked for good if the tweets were not removed. \nTwitter has now confirmed the offending tweets have been removed, and he is free to tweet again.\nSnapchat also stopped Mr Trump from creating new posts, but did not say if or when it would end the ban. YouTube also removed Wednesday's video. \nThe president's supporters stormed the seat of US government and clashed with police, leading to the death of one woman.\nThe violence brought to a halt congressional debate over Democrat Joe Biden's election win.\nIn the House and Senate chambers, Republicans were challenging the certification of November's election results.\nBefore the violence, President Trump had told supporters on the National Mall in Washington that the election had been stolen. \nHours later, as the violence mounted inside and outside the US Capitol, he appeared on video and repeated the false claim."

      "text": "Weeks after President-elect Joe Biden was declared winner of November's election, there remains a deep mistrust of the electoral process among many ardent supporters of Donald Trump. It reflects a broader sentiment among conservatives, one that has profound implications for the nation and its institutions.\nStanding on Main Street, Dillard Ungeheuer, 73, was scraping cow manure off his shoes, left over from a visit to a feed lot, and seemed testy. When it came to the ballots, he was emphatic - many were fake. \n\"I'm not going to argue with nobody about it,\" he says, voice rising. \"I believe what I'm saying is factual.\"\nHis indignation over the presidential election, and the government writ large, was palpable, and his feelings were shared by many in town. \n\"No, I don't have much faith in government at all,\" he says.\nUS President Donald Trump lost the election to his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, and his efforts to have that result overturned in the courts have failed. On 6 January, the electoral votes from each state will be counted by Congress. \nAlthough some Republicans have said they would challenge this final step in the process of certifying the winner of the election, it will only delay, rather than change, the outcome.  \nInterviews with some two dozen Republican voters in the Midwestern state of Kansas reveal a picture of how they see the world. Most felt they had been cheated out of a victory, and that democratic institutions, particularly the electoral process, were broken.\nMost Republican voters, in Kansas and elsewhere, either believe Trump won the election or they are not certain of the victor, polls like this one from Northeastern University suggest.\nJackie Taylor, 59, publisher of the Linn County News in Pleasanton, says the election was stolen: \"The whole thing is dirty. You've got a guy who got elected under dirty circumstances, and now he's president.\"\nWhen asked why they thought the election was rigged, many said they got their news from Newsmax, One America News and other outlets that have broadcast stories about alleged voter fraud. These media companies were relatively obscure until Trump took office.\nHe frequently mentions them and has raised their profile.\nOthers say they did not know anyone who supported Biden, and have seen only Trump yard signs. \nFor them, it was inconceivable that Biden could win. They hold an unshakeable belief, despite the lack of any evidence, that liberals stole the election. Their views are reflected in the programmes they watch, and are discussed in coffeehouses, at gas stations and other places in town.\nThey called for an overhaul of the system, saying stricter controls should be imposed on voters. They said they were afraid that Biden would demolish what remained of American democracy, turning the country into a socialist state.\nTyler Johnson, 35, spoke about election fraud while standing next to his Chevy, one outfitted with a feed box. \nEarlier, outside town, a pickup truck had kicked up dust plumes, rising as high as a barn, and a sign, just off route 69, said: \"Vote - remove every Democrat.\"\nJohnson does not think Democrats should be in charge: \"With there being questions in the election, it makes me question everything they stand for.\"\nHe raises calves like his father did - and the way he hopes his two-year-old son, Monroe, will someday - and fears Democrats will sabotage the cattle industry.\n\"With all the rules that the Biden presidency wants to enforce on us, it makes me wonder - is my lifestyle going to be a viable one for my son, as it was for my dad, and to me?\" he says. \nTheir wariness of the electoral process could lead to a deeper divide in the US, with some believing in the Biden White House and others rejecting it.\n\"America is in a very fragile position,\" says Edward Foley, an election law scholar at Ohio State University in Columbus. He describes mistrust of the electoral process as \"a real challenge to the very premise of the system\".\nFoley recalls another moment in history when a battle broke out over an election.  In 2000, the Republican candidate, George W Bush, won Florida, and its electoral votes, by a narrow 537 votes, clinching the election. Supporters of his Democratic rival, Al Gore, were distraught.\n\"There was this fear that officials would use political power to manipulate the ballots,\" he says, although there was no serious effort to undermine the process. The Democrats brought the matter before the Supreme Court, but the justices halted their efforts. It fizzled out.\nToday, however, Trump and his allies have cast serious doubt on Biden's victory. \nRoger Marshall, a newly elected US Senator from Kansas, is planning to raise objections about Biden's victory on Wednesday as members of Congress meet for a joint session to certify the election results. Marshall and about a dozen other conservative senators will challenge votes in some states - a doomed, last-ditch effort to stop Biden.\nWhen asked whether contesting the election erodes confidence in the process, Marshall says he is pressing the issue because \"I want to give people confidence in future elections, so I couldn't possibly undermine people's confidence any more than it is right now\".\nHis concerns are shared by many in the area, a deeply conservative region. Here, fears of socialism and dread about a Biden presidency are intense. \n\"I feel that we're going to see the first signs of socialism,\" says Mike Avery, 53, the owner of a lumberyard on Main Street, located in Linn County, where 80% of eligible voters cast ballots for Trump.\nUngeheuer, who makes corral fences, says of Biden's policies: \"You can't start giving everybody something, and have me work my butt off and run a business, and expect me to give it away. Venezuela didn't do very good, following a socialistic agenda.\"\nThere are now also calls in Kansas and elsewhere to tighten restrictions on voting. \n\"I think the election was rigged, with the mail-in ballots. I think there were just people who are no longer with us that voted,\" says Julia Smith, 65, who is retired. \n\"I think we're going to have to go back to voting in person, with ID.\" \nFor her, Trump's defeat was proof the Democrats had pulled a fast one, and she says their efforts should be stopped. Then she pulled her coat tight against an icy wind and headed up the road."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "With the country in lockdown and a new faster-spreading variant of coronavirus rampant, it's clear the UK is in a race to vaccinate. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson wants all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers to be offered a jab by mid-February, to allow the restrictions to be eased. \nThat requires about 13 million people to be given the opportunity to be vaccinated - but so far only one million have been.\nAnd ensuring a quick rollout to the rest is fraught with difficulties. \nThere is enough vaccine in the country, BBC News has learned, but getting it into people's arms could be hampered by:\nTwo Covid vaccines have now been approved - one produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and another made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.\nThe UK government has ordered 140 million doses - enough for the whole population. \nThe first hurdle is manufacture of the vaccine. \nThis involves two crucial stages - the production of the substance and then a process called fill and finish whereby the vaccine is put into vials and packaged up for use.\nAnd there is already a concern about the latter stage, with the availability of key ingredients and equipment including glass vials a key issue. \nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says fill and finish was a \"critically short resource across the globe\".\nThat is part of the reason why the amount of the two vaccines ready to go is more limited than ministers had hoped. \nUK plants have made somewhere around 15 million or so doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - that in itself is less than ministers said would be made at this stage (early in the pandemic they said there would be 30 million by the autumn).\nBut only four million have been through the fill-and-finish process. \nThe UK has used plants in Germany and the Netherlands to do some of this for the early batches.\nBut the government has also invested in a plant in Wrexham to ensure there is domestic capacity.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, meanwhile, is made outside of the UK - it comes from a plant in Belgium. \nWhen it arrives in the UK, it has already been placed into vials.\nBut so far, fewer than five million doses have been delivered - less than half the number that should have been - because of problems with manufacture, including the fill-and-finish process.\nHowever, the Department of Health and Social Care said it had been monitoring the supply chain for \"some time\" and was confident the arrangements in place for the supply and onward deployment of vaccines were sufficient.\nEven once a vaccine is in the vials though, there is still one more step before the NHS can start using it. \nEach batch has to be checked and certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products regulatory Agency.\nAnd it can be several weeks before the vaccine can be given to the NHS to put in people's arms.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has called this a \"rate-limiting factor\".\nAbout four million doses of the Oxford vaccine have been available for some weeks - they were put into vials last year - but as yet only just over 500,000 have been certified as safe to use.\nSources close to the NHS vaccination programme said this had been one of the key frustrations - saying it was taking up to 20 days for batches to be tested and released.\nThe MHRA said each batch had to be biologically tested for quality, while the manufacturer's documentation describing its production and quality-control testing process was reviewed.\nThose close to the process say it does take a couple of weeks - and with more vaccine being produced, there is increased demand on the labs that do the work.\n\"You have to remember this is being injected into people,\" they said. \"We cannot rush this.\"\nBoth vaccines have to go through this process.\nOnce batches have been certified, they are ready to be distributed to the NHS vaccination centres.\nEventually, there will be a network of more than 1,000 local centres across the UK.\nCurrently, just over 700 are up and running. \nThese are being run from a wide variety of venues, from hospitals and large GP centres to community venues, racecourses and, perhaps in the future, conference centres and sports stadiums.\nThe instability of the Pfizer-BioNTech has been well documented. \nIt has to be kept in ultra-cold storage and, once thawed, used within five days.\nThis has meant it is stored at major hospitals and gives the local vaccination centres just days to use up batches after they are delivered.\nThe Oxford vaccine, meanwhile, can be stored at fridge temperature, which makes it easier to distribute.\nBut even once they are at these vaccination centres, delivery of both vaccines is dependent on having the right numbers of staff available.\nCurrently, GPs, nurses, healthcare assistants and pharmacists are giving the vaccines. \nBut as the vaccination campaign ramps up, these will need to be supplemented by additional vaccinators.\nProvision has been made to train other health professionals, from physiotherapists and dentists to dieticians.\nBut there are reports an \"overload of bureaucracy\" - including mandatory courses in fire safety and preventing radicalisation - is slowing down this training.\nMinisters have said they will try to reduce the bureaucracy - amid warnings by the National Audit Office an army of nearly 50,000 vaccinators will be needed.\nAlthough at the moment, there are thought to be enough staff to cope with the limited amount of vaccines available.\nBritish Medical Association GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey said: \"We will need support eventually but not now. \n\"At the moment, the biggest issue is the NHS having enough supply of the vaccine to give.\"\nNearly a million doses have been given since people started to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, in early December, which puts the UK third globally in the most vaccinations done per head.\nAnd with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being used from this week, the NHS is hoping to double that number in the next seven days.\nGovernment sources said there would be disappointment if it did not reach two million doses a week by late January.\nThat - and a little bit more - will be needed to hit the mid-February target.\nBut even then, and assuming most people in these priority groups have come forward, the impact would not be immediate. \nIt takes a few weeks for the immune response to kick in.\nSo it would be early March before the full impact of the vaccination of these priority groups is felt.\nThen, however, it could have a significant effect.\nClose to nine in 10 Covid deaths have been in these priority groups.\nThey will have had only one dose, which, for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, is effective at preventing 70% of infections.\nBut the evidence suggests this will be enough to stop serious illness.\nSo if all goes to plan, the pathway to significantly easing restrictions comes into view.\nBut the complex nature of the supply chain coupled with the complexity of delivering vaccines to large numbers of people means it will take just one thing to go wrong to cause serious problems getting the UK out of this lockdown in the timeframe hoped."

      "text": "Donald Trump was \"completely wrong\" to cast doubt on the US election and encourage supporters to storm the Capitol, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe UK prime minister said he \"unreservedly condemns\" the US president's actions. \nFour people died after a pro-Trump mob stormed the building in a bid to overturn the election result.\nMr Trump had urged protesters to march on the Capitol after making false electoral fraud claims. \nHe later called on his supporters to \"go home\", while continuing to make false claims - Twitter and Facebook later froze his accounts.\nThe president has now said there will be an \"orderly transition\" to President-elect Joe Biden, whose November election victory has now been certified by US lawmakers. \nBut he added that he continued to \"totally disagree\" with the outcome of the vote, repeating his unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud.\nOn Wednesday night, Mr Johnson condemned the \"disgraceful scenes\" and called for a \"peaceful and orderly transfer of power\".\nBut asked by the BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth if President Trump was directly responsible, he said: \"All my life America has stood for some very important things. An idea of freedom, an idea of democracy.\n\"As you say, in so far as he encouraged people to storm the Capitol, and in so far as the president has consistently cast doubt on the outcome of a free and fair election, I believe that was completely wrong.\n\"I believe what President Trump has been saying about that has been completely wrong and I unreservedly condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way that they did in the Capitol.\"\nThe PM, speaking at a Downing Street briefing, then welcomed the confirmation of President-elect Biden, saying \"democracy has prevailed\".\nHundreds of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday - where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Mr Biden's election victory - and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC. \nBoth chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released.\nA woman died after being shot by police, and three others died as a result of \"medical emergencies\", local police said.\nUK politicians from different parties have all condemned Mr Trump's actions in encouraging the storming of the Capitol. \nEarlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the president's comments had \"directly led\" to the events and he \"didn't do anything to de-escalate that\".\nShe added: \"He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn't actually do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever... what we've seen is completely unacceptable.\"\nSpeaking on Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Trump should \"take responsibility\" for what happened, calling it the \"culmination of years of the politics of hate and division\".\nSir Keir added he welcomed the outgoing president's agreement to an orderly handover, but told reporters \"he should have said it a long time ago.\"\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Trump had been \"inciting insurrection in his own country,\" and called it a \"dark period\" in US history. \n\"What we witnessed last night is not that surprising. In some senses, Donald Trump's presidency has been moving towards this moment almost from the moment it started,\" she told ITV's Good Morning Britain.\nScotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the home secretary should \"give serious consideration\" to denying Mr Trump entry to the UK after he leaves office. \nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said certification of Mr Biden's victory was \"good to see\" after the \"shocking events\" on Wednesday, adding the UK condemned the violence \"unequivocally\". \nFormer Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, who shared time in office with Mr Trump, said there should be \"no place for the rule of the mob\". \nBut senior Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Davies has been criticised after comparing the rioting to politicians who supported a second referendum on Brexit.\nMr Davies, a member of the Welsh Parliament, later tweeted that \"violence must never be tolerated\".\nHis party colleague, the Conservative MP Simon Hoare, suggested Mr Trump could be sent to the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay:\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has written to express his \"solidarity\" with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose empty office was broken into by protesters. \n\"Seeing your office trashed in that way and its occupation by one of the rioters was particularly outrageous. I am just so relieved you were not hurt,\" he wrote. "

      "tags": "Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Hospitality industry,Restaurants,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Just when the hospitality sector thought things couldn't get any worse, it has been hit by another lockdown.\nLast year's rolling closures forced Martin Wolstencroft to borrow \u00a34m just to ensure the survival of Arc Inspirations, a bar chain with 17 venues across the north of England that he has spent the last two decades building into a successful business.\nAnd the latest lockdown has forced Mr Wolstencroft to ask his bank to lend him another \u00a31m.\nHe is far from alone. UK Hospitality says the closure of pubs, restaurants and hotels is costing business owners such as Mr Wolstencroft a total of \u00a3500m a month, even allowing for any government support. And that has led to a huge rise in debt.\n\"The money that we are borrowing is really just to stand still,\" Mr Wolstencroft said. \n\"We'll be coming out of this in a far worse position with far greater debt and it totally reduces our ability to grow our business for the future.\n\"And all of this has been brought about through no fault of our own.\"\nHe reckons the debt he has taken on so far will take the business six years to pay back, which leaves him facing some difficult decisions.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a package of grants worth up to \u00a33,000 a month per property to keep retail, hospitality and leisure businesses afloat until the spring.\nBut Mr Wolstencroft, who pays rents of more than \u00a316,000 a month on some of his bars, described the grants as a \"mere drop in the ocean\".\nThe effect of taking on huge debts with no prospect of reopening soon is a major threat to millions working in the hospitality sector.\nMore than 1,600 restaurants closed last year, costing 30,000 jobs, says property adviser Altus.\nWhen bars, hotels and other hospitality businesses are included, almost 300,000 jobs were lost last year as a result of the pandemic, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.\nAnd that figure is expected to more than double in the first three months of this year alone.\nKate Nicholls, the boss of UK Hospitality, predicts the total will hit 660,000 by the end of March.\n\"The longer that these restrictions are in place, the more rapidly businesses will simply run out of cash and be unable to to remain open,\" she said.\nA survey of the trade body's members revealed that 80% of businesses did not have enough cash to make it through to April. \"It's going to be unbelievably brutal in the first quarter,\" Ms Nicholls said.\nThe latest lockdown follows a bruising Christmas period for the hospitality sector, which typically depends on a busy December to tide it over during January, traditionally a quiet month for pubs and restaurants.\n\"It's obviously very worrying for our industry,\" says Tim Hughes, who runs the Plough pub at Sleapshyde in Hertfordshire.\n\"They have banned takeaway sales of alcohol from pubs, but off-licences and supermarkets can carry on selling it,\" he said.\nBetween them, Mr Hughes, his brother and his father run three pubs in the St Albans area. They have already borrowed \u00a3350,000 and Mr Hughes says the latest lockdown will force them to take on even more debt just to survive.\nMonthly fixed costs at each of the pubs run to \u00a39,500 and only one of their venues qualifies for the full \u00a33,000 grant, so Mr Hughes says the Treasury's support \"doesn't touch the sides\".\nIt's the fourth time Mr Hughes has been forced to close the doors to the Plough - and each time it has cost him about \u00a35,000. \nThis time, he also had to give away \u00a34,000 worth of jumbo pork, vegetarian and vegan Bavarian bratwursts, bought to give 2,000 customers a substantial meal in the pub's \"winter garden\" during the festive period. \nThat was before an unexpected decision to put St Albans into tier three forced him to close the pub. He cancelled those bookings and refunded customers their \u00a316,000.\nRalph Findlay, the boss of Marston's, which has 1,700 pubs across the country and employs 14,000 people, said some pubs that had been forced to close their doors because of the lockdown would never reopen.\nHalf of Marston's employees are under 25, he said. \"I really worry about the impact of this on their employment prospects in places where it's very difficult to find employment.\"\nHe has called for pubs to be given more time before they are required to pay business rates again, which will leave pubs facing an \u00a3800m bill as soon as the current rates holiday expires in March, according to the British Beer & Pub Association.\nThat would force landlords, including Mr Hughes, to foot a bill that works out at \u00a325,000 a pub.\n\"We are kidding ourselves if we think that more debt upon more debt is going to be sustainable,\" said Stephen Welton, executive chairman of the Business Growth Fund.\n\"Past recessions have shown very clearly that it's coming out of a recession - when companies are short of working capital - that they fall over.\"\nFor Mr Hughes at the Plough, he is looking for all the support he can get to avoid being put into a \"bigger black hole\".\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"\"We've taken swift action throughout the pandemic to protect lives and livelihoods.\"\nHe said the grant scheme would continue to support businesses and jobs through to the spring."

      "text": "Some hospitals in England are at risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services.\nThere are now 26,500 Covid patients in hospital, meaning nearly a third of all people in hospital have the virus.\nIn London, half of all patients being treated in hospital have Covid.\nIt has prompted many hospitals to cancel routine operations to make more space - and there are now signs this is starting to happen for cancer care too.\nDoctors warned the impact on the NHS could be \"catastrophic\".\nIt comes after a surge in patients in recent weeks.\nThe number of Covid patients has risen by more than 50% since Christmas - and is forecast to continue doing so.\nThere are now more than 3,000 new admissions a day on average, three times the normal winter rate for all respiratory conditions.\nChris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, said the rising number of Covid cases was \"very worrying\" and had reached a \"critical point\", which was significantly affecting other services.\nHe said that while the south east and east of England had borne the brunt of the rises, other parts of England were seeing rises too.\nIn the last week alone there had been enough new Covid patients to fill 10 hospitals, he added.\nDr Nick Scriven, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said medical units, respiratory wards and elderly care wards had effectively become intensive-care areas with very sick patients being given oxygen therapy.\nHe described the pressure on staff as \"intense\".\nMeanwhile, Prof Rupert Pearse, an intensive care consultant at the Royal London Hospital and member of the Intensive Care Society, said staffing levels in intensive care were being diluted to cope with one nurse to every three patients rather than the normal one-to-one.\n\"We are really very concerned now about the seriousness of the situation ... which is definitely worse than the first wave and proving much harder to deal with now as the resources we had in the first wave aren't available to us.\n\"So we're really struggling to provide the quality of patient care that we think patients deserve. And the impact of the pandemic is taking care away from other illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.\n\"In essence, the healthcare available to all of us is not as good as it should be right now.\"\nProf Pearse said that unless people took the lockdown seriously, the impact on healthcare across the country \"could be catastrophic\".\nThe surge in cases has prompted increasing amount of non-Covid care to be stopped.\nThis week, it emerged that potentially lifesaving cancer operations have been put on hold King's College Hospital in London because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients.\nThis included all \"priority two\" operations - those doctors judge need to be carried out within 28 days.\nProf Neil Mortensen, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said he had heard from members that \"hospitals across London are having to cancel cancer surgeries as a result of the huge number of Covid-19 patients being hospitalised\"."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "Medical staff are \"well over half way through\" vaccinating Scotland's care home residents with their first dose against Covid-19.\nThe first minister said this was \"extremely important\", as care homes accounted for more than a third of Covid-related deaths in the past week.\nBy Sunday more than 113,000 people in Scotland had been given their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nSome 1,100 vaccination centres are set to be operational within a week.\nThe government has set a target of giving a first dose to everyone over the age of 80 in Scotland within the next four weeks.\nScotland has about 30,000 residents living in care homes for older people.\nA further 78 deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 were announced on Thursday, the highest daily number during the second wave of the virus.\nMeanwhile, the National Records of Scotland said the virus had been mentioned on 183 death certificates in the week to Sunday - with 63 of these deaths occurring in care homes.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this underlined the importance of rolling out the vaccine in care homes, saying it would hopefully start to significantly reduce the risk of residents dying due to coronavirus.\nAnd she said the government would start issuing a daily update on how many people had been given the jab from next week.\nThe first minister said: \"Vaccination ultimately is what will provide us with the route out of this pandemic, so we are absolutely determined to make sure as many people as possible are vaccinated just as quickly as it is possible to do so.\"\nAs of Sunday, a total of 113,459 people had been given their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Scotland.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine began to be rolled out on Monday, and will be reflected in statistics from next week.\nA total of 36 people have had a second dose of the vaccine, with efforts now focused on giving a first jab to as many people as possible\nThis means that people will now not receive their second dose for up to 12 weeks rather than within 21 days - a move that has been criticised by some medics.\nBut Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said the first dose gave \"substantial\" protection against the virus.\nThe vaccine is being rolled out to health and social care workers in the first instance, then care home residents and other over-80s.\nEventually everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 - a total of 4.4m people - will be given a jab, although the government has refused to set targets beyond the initial phase due to uncertainty over supplies.\nThe UK government had already committed to publishing vaccination figures on a daily basis, and the Scottish Conservatives had been pushing for the Scottish government to follow suit.\nTory leader Douglas Ross said that \"publishing these numbers will increase transparency and give the public confidence that progress is being made in our fight against Covid-19\". \nThe MP told BBC Scotland that he had been getting inquiries from constituents about when they could expect to get a jab, saying people \"need to know roughly where they are on that list and when they can expect to receive that vaccine\".\nScottish Labour called on the government to backdate the statistics and to publish \"a detailed breakdown of how many people in each priority group has been vaccinated\".\nThe party's health spokeswoman, Monica Lennon, said: \"Quicker progress must be made on securing vaccinations sites and vaccinators, including the contribution that community pharmacy teams can make.\"\nAt her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said over-80s should not worry if they had not yet been contacted about a vaccine appointment.\nShe said these were being \"aligned with availability of supply\" in different local areas.\nThe first minister said there was \"no need to phone your GP\", and that people would be \"contacted with an appointment as soon as possible\".\nShe also said the government was considering \"as a matter of ongoing review\" whether tighter restrictions may still be needed.\nScotland has been in a new lockdown since Tuesday, and Ms Sturgeon said it was \"probably too early\" for this to be reflected in the number of new infections.\nHowever she warned that the number of interactions people are having needed to be \"radically\" cut in order to slow the spread of the virus.\nShe said shutting down construction, manufacturing and click-and-collect businesses was \"the kind of thing we need to look at if we have a concern that we are not sufficiently reducing the number of people who are out and about and interacting\"."

Yet he has loved using Twitter. \nHe's used it as a way, for more than 10 years, to bypass the media and speak directly to voters. \nThe 280 characters fits neatly with his style of political engagement - broad brushstrokes rather than details. \nAnd Twitter has undoubtedly benefited from President Trump too, the place to go to hear the latest musings from the most powerful person on the planet. \nThat decade-long symbiosis has been ended with a shuddering halt. \nImmediately after the deadly riots, Twitter locked the President's Twitter feed and asked Mr Trump to delete three tweets for violations around its Civic Integrity policy., which he promptly did.\nAfter the suspension he tweeted as a new man, the nonsense claims of mass voter fraud replaced with a more conciliatory tone. \nPrivately though Twitter was pondering whether it had gone far enough. Facebook had already acted, banning Donald Trump \"indefinitely\".  \nAfter more than 48 hours of consideration, Twitter acted. It made unquestionably the most important moderation decision in its history. It banned the president of the United States. \nSome have asked why he wasn't kicked off sooner. \nWell, Twitter has very specific rules about world leaders. \n\"We recognise that sometimes it may be in the public interest to allow people to view tweets that would otherwise be taken down,\" Twitter's rules say. \n\"At present, we limit exceptions to one critical type of public-interest content - tweets from elected and government officials.\" \nChief executive Jack Dorsey had felt it was in the public interest to keep the account active, albeit with warning messages.\n\"No one is turning a blind eye,\" a senior source told the BBC before the ban.\nIn short, Mr Trump had been allowed to remain on Twitter - despite numerous breaches of its rules - because he is the president. \nWith less than two weeks to go of Trump's presidency, many social media companies have now decided enough is enough. \nCritics say the outgoing president's words on social media, for years, helped to incite Wednesday's storming of Capitol Hill.\nAll the big social media companies have made it clear that - as a private citizen - if you continually look to peddle conspiracy theories and promote extremism, you should expect to be kicked out. With just a few days of his presidency left, Mr Trump is already being held to a different standard - his privileges stripped. \nWhat's driving this? To be cynical, social media companies are acutely aware that President-elect Joe Biden believes Big Tech hasn't done enough to quell fake news and hate speech on their platforms.\nThey are now desperate to show that they can, in fact, police their own platforms without the need for stringent legal reforms. \nWhat better way to show you're serious than to act on Mr Trump's misinformation? \nWhat will Mr Trump do next? Well he's already said he's looking into the possibility of building his own platform in the future. \nBut for now he's consigned to the fringes of the internet. Can Trumpism survive without Big Tech? We're about to find out. \nJames Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco. Follow him on Twitter @jamesclayton5."

      "text": "Woman's Hour host Emma Barnett has defended herself after a guest who was booked to appear on the BBC Radio 4 programme dropped out due to remarks the presenter made about her off-air.\nKelechi Okafor said she was treated in a \"degrading\" and \"vile\" manner.\nBarnett said she and her producers were discussing alleged anti-Semitic remarks Okafor had made in the past.\nThe host said she then raised these directly, adding: \"I stand by my questions to my team and to Kelechi.\"\nBarnett said Okafor \"denied the allegations and hung up\". \nOkafor, who is an actress, dance instructor and podcaster, had been booked for an item about the #MeToo movement.\nWednesday's programme marked a year since the trial of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, who was jailed for 23 years for rape and sexual assault.\nThe 15-minute discussion was intended to explore what the #MeToo movement has achieved. \nAfter Okafor pulled out of the programme, the item went ahead with the other guests, Rosanna Arquette and Caitlin Dulany - two of the actresses who accused Weinstein of sexual assault. \nWriting on Twitter, she said Barnett spoke about her in a disrespectful way, without realising she could be heard.\n\"The host didn't realise her mic was on as she was talking about me before the interview started,\" Okafor posted.\n\"You can have a genuine concern about something you've been told about me and address it in a manner that is kind. That wasn't what took place.\n\"The need for me on today's show was to offer balance to these wayward women thinking that the MeToo movement is no longer needed. The fact is that if you feel it's no longer needed for your white middle class sensibilities, marginalised voices still need it.\n\"We haven't heard from everybody regarding the violations they've faced. The originators of the MeToo movement were black women. From enslaved black women who were raped by slave owners to Tarana Burke yet their voices are yet to be honoured.\"\nWriting on Twitter, Barnett said: \"Just before I went on air this morning to present a special programme about Me Too... it came to my attention that one of our guests, Kelechi Okafor, had made alleged anti-Semitic remarks.\n\"I was also sent a press report of the transcript of what she had said on her podcast supporting Reggie Yates's comments about Jewish male managers and profits.\"\nYates apologised in 2017 after saying in a podcast interview: \"The thing that makes it great about this new generation of [music] artists is that they ain't signing to majors. They're independent, they're not managed by some random fat Jewish guy from north west London, they're managed by their brethren.\"\nLater that year, Okafor said Yates had been speaking \"the truth\" and said his comments were \"not problematic\".\nBarnett continued: \"As Weinstein is also Jewish and was referenced as part of this same podcast, I was discussing with my producers the role of this guest in light of her allegedly anti-Semitic comments. Kelechi overheard that chat on our open Zoom link - with two minutes to airtime.\n\"I then directly talked to Kelechi about the allegations, standing by my queries, and said she could put her response across in the programme. She denied the allegations and hung up, choosing to no longer be part of the programme.\n\"I stand by my questions to my team and to Kelechi. I would have happily hosted her on the programme with a question on this issue.\"\nShe added: \"I believe people can always answer for themselves - but equally it is my duty to ask people what qualifies them as a leading voice in a space.\"\nA BBC spokesman said: \"During an off-air conversation ahead of the programme, Emma Barnett and the production team talked about a guest's role in the discussion, and how to reflect some of the guest's alleged previous comments and the issue of anti-Semitism as part of the Woman's Hour discussion on the role of minority voices in the MeToo movement.\n\"This was also raised directly with the guest before going on air.\"\nThe BBC said the off-air conversation did not make reference to Okafor's race.\nThe alleged incident occurred on Barnett's third day as the new presenter of Woman's Hour. Dame Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey both left the programme last year.\nBarnett has previously spoken out against anti-Semitism on her BBC Radio 5 Live programme after controversial comments from the rapper Wiley.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

In this image, the oil paintings of political figures in the background emphasise this imagery of the past.\nThere have been renewed calls for the Confederate flag to be banned across the US following the anti-racism protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, a black man.\nHowever Mr Trump has defended use of the flag, calling it a matter of free speech.\nOne man in a Trump beanie here walks between the red guide ropes, as many visitors might do on a guided-tour to view the Crypt, the Statuary Hall and the Rotunda.\nBut this man is carrying a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, as he poses in front of a painting depicting the surrender of Gen Burgoyne in the war of independence. \nAnother man, identified as Jake Angeli, an ardent Trump supporter who has attended a number of the president's rallies, shouts as he makes his way to the Senate Chamber. \nHis incongruous garments set him apart from other protesters wearing black hoodies. These Trump activists stand by taking selfies, but he has clearly come here to be photographed by others.\nThe apparent lack of a security presence is in sharp contrast to other Washington protests where there is a highly visible presence of heavily armed security forces protecting US institutions.\nAnother Trump supporter, identified as Richard Barnett, sits with one boot disrespectfully on a desk that is at the very centre of power in Congress. It is in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \nIn the scene, unimaginable days earlier, Barnett in his baseball cap and checked shirt resembles a raconteur regaling friends with tales of his exploits. \nThe image went viral as did pictures of the notes he and others left on Ms Pelosi's desk.\nThis dramatic image shows how the formal proceedings came to a violent halt as Capitol police officers drew their guns on doors being attacked by protesters intent on entering the House Chamber.\nMany commentators asked if they were watching a coup unfold as doors were barricaded and firearms brandished.\nThe composition is reminiscent of a scene in a Hollywood Western, the lawmen bracing for the doors to be breached.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden made an impassioned TV address describing the scenes as \"an assault on democracy\" - this chilling picture encapsulates what he meant. \nAll images subject to copyright."

      "text": "Some hospitals in England are at risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services.\nThere are now 26,500 Covid patients in hospital, meaning nearly a third of all people in hospital have the virus.\nIn London, half of all patients being treated in hospital have Covid.\nIt has prompted many hospitals to cancel routine operations to make more space - and there are now signs this is starting to happen for cancer care too.\nDoctors warned the impact on the NHS could be \"catastrophic\".\nIt comes after a surge in patients in recent weeks.\nThe number of Covid patients has risen by more than 50% since Christmas - and is forecast to continue doing so.\nThere are now more than 3,000 new admissions a day on average, three times the normal winter rate for all respiratory conditions.\nChris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, said the rising number of Covid cases was \"very worrying\" and had reached a \"critical point\", which was significantly affecting other services.\nHe said that while the south east and east of England had borne the brunt of the rises, other parts of England were seeing rises too.\nIn the last week alone there had been enough new Covid patients to fill 10 hospitals, he added.\nDr Nick Scriven, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said medical units, respiratory wards and elderly care wards had effectively become intensive-care areas with very sick patients being given oxygen therapy.\nHe described the pressure on staff as \"intense\".\nMeanwhile, Prof Rupert Pearse, an intensive care consultant at the Royal London Hospital and member of the Intensive Care Society, said staffing levels in intensive care were being diluted to cope with one nurse to every three patients rather than the normal one-to-one.\n\"We are really very concerned now about the seriousness of the situation ... which is definitely worse than the first wave and proving much harder to deal with now as the resources we had in the first wave aren't available to us.\n\"So we're really struggling to provide the quality of patient care that we think patients deserve. And the impact of the pandemic is taking care away from other illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.\n\"In essence, the healthcare available to all of us is not as good as it should be right now.\"\nProf Pearse said that unless people took the lockdown seriously, the impact on healthcare across the country \"could be catastrophic\".\nThe surge in cases has prompted increasing amount of non-Covid care to be stopped.\nThis week, it emerged that potentially lifesaving cancer operations have been put on hold King's College Hospital in London because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients.\nThis included all \"priority two\" operations - those doctors judge need to be carried out within 28 days.\nProf Neil Mortensen, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said he had heard from members that \"hospitals across London are having to cancel cancer surgeries as a result of the huge number of Covid-19 patients being hospitalised\"."

      "text": "Elon Musk has become the world's richest person, as his net worth crossed $185bn (\u00a3136bn).\nThe Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur was pushed into the top slot after Tesla's share price increased on Thursday.\nHe takes the top spot from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who had held it since 2017.\nMr Musk's electric car company Tesla has surged in value this year, and hit a market value of $700bn (\u00a3516bn) for the first time on Wednesday.\nThat makes the car company worth more than Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai, GM and Ford combined.\nMr Musk reacted to the news in signature style, replying to a Twitter user sharing the news with the remark \"how strange\".\nAn older tweet pinned to the top of his feed offered further insight into his thoughts on personal wealth.\n\"About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth, and half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens and we destroy ourselves,\" it reads.\nThe tycoon's fortunes have been buoyed by politics in the US, where the Democrats will have control of the US Senate in the forthcoming session.\nDaniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities wrote: \"A Blue Senate is very bullish and a potential 'game changer' for Tesla and the overall electric vehicle sector, with a more green-driven agenda now certainly in the cards for the next few years.\"\nExpected electric vehicle tax credits would benefit Tesla, \"which continues to have an iron grip on the market today\", he added.\nMr Bezos has also seen his fortunes rise over the past year. The coronavirus pandemic has meant Amazon benefited from stronger demand for both its online store and cloud computing services.\nHowever, he gave a 4% stake in the business to his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott after they split, which helped Mr Musk overtake him.\nIn addition, the threat of regulation has meant Amazon's stock has not risen as high as it might otherwise have done.\nThe owner of a business which has only just made its first annual profit and is still a minnow compared to the likes of Toyota  - or Amazon - is now the world's richest person.\nIt is the fact that Tesla's share price has increased more than seven-fold in the past year that has sent Elon Musk's fortune rocketing past that of Jeff Bezos. \nTo believe the electric car-maker's worth could rise so rapidly in just 12 months is the ultimate example of irrational exuberance.\nIt means that Musk will have to show within the next five years that Tesla can make more profits than just about the whole of the rest of the motor industry combined to justify the valuation.\nMind you, his many fans will point out that the somewhat eccentric tycoon has constantly confounded the sceptics who bet that he would go bust. \nAnd of course 20 years ago another tech visionary was staring disaster in the face when the dot com bubble burst and big profits seemed a distant dream - but Jeff Bezos went on to make those who bet on Amazon very rich indeed."

      "tags": "Washington DC,US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump",
      "text": "With the country still reeling from Wednesday's violence in Washington, serious questions are being asked about how such a massive security breach was able to happen at the heart of US government.\nCrowds of pro-Trump supporters were able to force their way inside one of the country's most historically and politically significant buildings while elected lawmakers were inside moving to certify Joe Biden's election victory.\nThe world watched as a mob of rioters seemed to roam free around inside -  looting and vandalising symbols of US democracy as they went.\nPresident-Elect Joe Biden has been scathing of the \"unacceptable\" handling of the rioters and compared it to the heavy-handed militarised response to last year's Black Lives Matter protests.\nLindsey Graham, a Republican Senator, also railed against the security failures. \"They could have blown the building up. They could have killed us all. They could've destroyed the government,\" he said.\nCriticism centres on preparation by police and their failure to anticipate possible violence, despite evidence that radical pro-Trump supporters and other groups were openly discussing their plans online.\nThe Washington Post, citing sources close to the matter, says that Capitol Police charged with guarding the building and its grounds did not make early requests for help from the city's main police force or the National Guard nor set-up a multiagency command centre to coordinate response to any violence.\nAnd without an adequate security perimeter in place, their sparse police lines were quickly overwhelmed by thousands descending on the Capitol. \nDozens of officers were injured, and one later died, in the effort to retake control -  including some with armour, weapons and chemical spray agents.\nTo many, the optics were a sharp contrast to last year's protests following the death of George Floyd, when rows of National Guard Troops guarded and enforced order in the capital.\nEven hours into Wednesday's violence, protesters were filmed being escorted or guided out of the building without arrest - even appearing to be helped down the Capitol stairs and having doors held open for them to exit. Another viral clip appeared to show a police officer posing for a selfie with a man inside.\nMany rioters photographed and even live-streamed their crimes. One was pictured, his face uncovered, with his feet up on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk, and then showing off a letter he appeared to have stolen from her office. A Confederate flag was paraded by another unmasked man and a well-known conspiracy theorist - wearing horns, fur and facepaint - was seen posing by a Senate chair that had been occupied by Vice President Mike Pence just hours earlier. \nNick Ochs, a known member of the Proud Boys far-right group, tweeted a selfie of himself inside and later told CNN: \"There were thousands of people in there - [the police] had no control of the situation. I didn't get stopped or questioned.\" \nBut despite the severity and scale of the chaos, relatively few arrests had been made by nightfall Wednesday. \nSupporters of BLM and others on the left have voiced their outrage at the perceived double-standard of policing the events. The incoming vice-president, Kamala Harris, said the disconnect was \"unacceptable\".\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama also released a lengthy statement.\n\"I cannot think about moving on or turning the page until we reckon with the reality of what we saw yesterday,\" she wrote. \"True progress will be possible only once we acknowledge that this disconnect exists and take steps to repair it.\"\nTop congressional Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were damning in their criticism of security failures - helping to force the departures of top officials.\nThe chief of the US Capitol Police, Steven Sund, had initially defended his force in a statement on Thursday - describing the actions of law enforcement as \"heroic\" and their plan robust.\nBut within hours his resignation was announced, alongside the departures of the sergeant-at-arms for both the House and Senate. \nAside from the clear lack of preparation, confusion mounted during the violence about when and if other security forces were being deployed to help.\nAccording to the Washington Post, Pentagon officials had placed strict operational limits on the DC National Guard ahead of protests and remained concerned about the \"optics\" of armed military personnel at the Capitol.\nDefence officials on Thursday sought to defend the speed in which they authorised and mobilised Guardsmen to respond to the violence. \nMultiple US media outlets, citing senior sources, have suggested that President Donald Trump allegedly showed reluctance for the National Guard to be used to quell the unrest.\nIf true, this is a complete contrast to the highly visible show of force the president has repeatedly called for against left-wing and BLM protesters. Gordon Corera, the BBC's security correspondent, says this emphasises how security decisions appear to have become politicised under the Trump administration.\nProfessor Clifford Stott, a specialist in the policing of crowds who advises the UK government, has been analysing the police response to BLM protests in Seattle. He told the BBC there would be \"powerful and important\" questions to be asked about how officials failed to prepared for the escalation by Trump supporters. \n\"It was the failure to predict that that led them to be inadequately prepared when it did happen and led them to be reactive and have to mobilise more resources,\" he said.  \"It's not just about the complexities of the police response, it's also about what appears to be a poor level of risk assessments around how they understand whether resources might be necessary in the first place.\"  \nThe gathering of the president's supporters, while Congress was certifying the election result, was not spontaneous. The protest was pre-planned and followed months of escalating rhetoric from President Trump and some of his Republican allies seeking to undermine the result.\nIn the days (and indeed weeks and months) before the attack, people monitoring online platforms used by extreme pro-Trump supporters and far-right groups had warned of rhetoric encouraging violence at the Capitol, including toward lawmakers, over the election result. Some were even pictured wearing clothing that said \"MAGA: CIVIL WAR\" printed alongside the 6 January 2021 date.\nProf Stott, who researches the psychology of group violence and hooliganism, told the BBC he found the overarching mood of \"joy\" among rioters openly committing crimes particularly interesting. \n\"There was a very clear purpose to that crowd and that was driven by the idea their actions were legitimate, given their perception that their president - as their commander in chief - had sanctioned them to go and do this,\" he says. \"And that sense that Capitol Hill itself had been over taken by corruption.\" \nSome appeared confused and angry at why officers had used force against them. One Yahoo News video, viewed more than 25m times on TikTok, shows a woman visibly upset that she had been maced by police, despite declaring: \"We're storming the capitol - it's a revolution!\"\nSome radical supporters have responded with disbelief and frustration at the concession video shared by President Trump on Thursday following the violence.\nThe U-turn came only a day after he told supporters: \"We will never give up, we will never concede\" and openly pressured his vice-president to overturn the election result. \nVice-President Mike Pence is among those who have called for those involved in the breach to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and given the brazen behaviour of many involved, prosecutors surely have no shortage of evidence to draw from.\nAs Facebook moved to remove videos seen to incite or encourage the events, some open-source investigators called for people to archive evidence to help with crowdsourced identification.\nMeanwhile, many seen in viral images from inside are already known figures within far-right groups and QAnon and related conspiracy networks. \nDozens of people are already facing charges - including one man officials say had a semi-automatic rifle and 11 Molotov cocktails - and police have also appealed for help identifying offenders not yet in custody.\nMichael Sherwin, the acting US Attorney for DC, said on Thursday that prosecutors would bring \"the most maximum charges we can\", when asked if crimes such as seditious conspiracy and insurrection could be tabled.\nHe also refused to rule out investigating anyone deemed to have incited the violence, including President Trump.\n\"We're trying to deal with the closest alligators to the boat right now,\" he said. \n\"Those are the people who obviously breached the Capitol, created violence and mayhem there and then exited. But yes, we are looking at all actors here, not only the people that went into the building.\""

      "text": "The father of a 15-year-old boy who was one of 39 people to die in a lorry trailer said he learned of his son's death through social media.\nNguyen Huy Hung died in the sealed container en route from Belgium to Purfleet, Essex, in October 2019.\nHis father, Nguyen Huy Tung, said the family could not believe it until \"we saw his body by our own eyes\" at the hospital.\nEight men are being sentenced for their role in the people-smuggling operation.\nThe 39 Vietnamese migrants, aged 15 to 44, were sealed inside the container for at least 12 hours.\nThe Old Bailey heard how it became a \"tomb\" as temperatures reached an \"unbearable\" 38.5C (101F).\nThe people trapped inside had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof, but only managed to dent the interior.\nAt a sentencing hearing set to last three days in front of Mr Justice Sweeney, some of their final desperate phone messages were played in court.\nIn one message, a man spoke with ragged breaths as he apologised to his family.\n\"I can't breathe,\" he said. \"I want to come back to my family. Have a good life.\"\nIn the background, a voice could be heard pleading: \"Come on everyone. Open up, open up.\"\nProsecutor Jonathan Polnay read out statements from the victims' families, and the mother of another 15-year-old who died, Dinh Dinh Binh, said her family had \"not been able to get back to our normal life yet\".\n\"Our economic conditions and work are negatively affected,\" she said. \"We have had to sell some properties of the family to afford our life.\"\nTran Hai Loc and his wife Nguyen Thi Van, both 35, were found huddled together in the trailer, and left behind two children, aged six and four.\nThe children's grandfather, Tran Dinh Thanh, said: \"At the moment their children are very small - this incident will affect their future.\n\"Every day, when they come home from school they always look at the photos of their parents on the altar. The decease of both parents is a big loss to them.\"\nPhan Thi Thanh, 41, had sold the family home and left her son with his godmother before setting off on the journey.\nHer son, who is now being looked after by his father in the UK, said he felt \"very heartbroken with mum not around\".\nHaulier boss Ronan Hughes, 41, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, was described as a ringleader of the operation. He closed his eyes as the phone messages were played to the court. Other defendants hung their heads.\nHughes had previously admitted manslaughter, as had 26-year-old lorry driver Maurice Robinson, from County Armagh, who discovered the bodies in the trailer.\nEamonn Harrison, 24, of Newry, County Down, who dropped off the trailer at Zeebrugge port, and people-smuggler Gheorghe Nica, 43, were convicted of the same charge by a jury.\nThey will be sentenced alongside Christopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, Valentin Calota, 38, from Birmingham, Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, who were convicted for their role in the smuggling.\nMr Polnay said: \"These defendants were party to a sophisticated, long-running and profitable conspiracy to smuggle [mainly] Vietnamese migrants to the UK, in the back of lorries, in a deliberate and intentional breach of border control.\"\nThe fee was between \u00a310,000 and \u00a313,000 for each migrant, for the \"VIP route\", the court heard.\nMr Polnay said seven smuggling trips were identified between May 2018 and 23 October 2019, but there was \"an irresistible inference that there were more events than those that were fortuitously detected\".\nThe hearing continues.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Images of rioters storming the US Capitol in a bid to overturn the result of a democratic election have sent shockwaves around the world.\nFour people died during the attack, launched by supporters of President Trump after he addressed a rally in Washington.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden called it an \"insurrection\", while Vice-President Mike Pence said the violence had been a \"dark day in the history of the United States Capitol\".\nBut this is not the first time the building - regarded as the symbolic heart of US democracy - has been hit by violence.\nFrom bombs to foreign invasions, here are four other times the Capitol was attacked.\nPerhaps the most famous attack was by British forces during the War of 1812.\nBritish troops, led by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cockburn and Major General Robert Ross - set fire to the still-under-construction Capitol after invading Washington DC in August 1814 (though the building survived thanks to a downpour).\nIn retaliation for the Americans' burning of Upper Canada's capital at York a year earlier, the British troops also set fire to other parts of the city and key buildings, including the White House.\nThe 1814 attack marks the only time that a foreign power has captured and occupied Washington.\nIn 2014, the British embassy in Washington apologised after tweeting a picture of a White House cake surrounded by sparklers, \"commemorating\" the burning of the building 200 years before. \nA century on from the British attack, Erich Muenter, former professor of German at Harvard University, exploded three sticks of dynamite in the Senate reception room.\nThe explosion damaged the building, but nobody was killed. \nMuenter later said the attack was in response to American financiers aiding Britain against Germany in World War I. \nWriting under a pseudonym in the Washington Evening Star, Muenter said he hoped the attack would \"make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamour for war\", adding: \"This explosion is an exclamation point in my appeal for peace.\"\nA day after the attack, Muenter shot and injured financier JP Morgan Jr, before being subdued by Morgan's butler and arrested. He later took his own life. \nOn 1 March 1954, four Puerto Rican nationalists pulled out the island's flag and shouted \"Freedom for Puerto Rico\" as they opened fire from the visitors' gallery of the House of Representatives, injuring five congressmen.  \n\"I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!\" cried the leader, Lolita Lebron, during her arrest.\nLebron was sentenced to 50 years behind bars, while the three men were given 75 years. \nThe sentences were all later commuted by President Jimmy Carter. His administration said the release \"would be a significant humanitarian gesture and would be viewed as such by much of the international community\".\nThe group returned to cheering crowds in Puerto Rico. \nOn 7 November 1983, an explosion ripped through the second floor of the Senate. \nJust minutes before the explosion, someone claiming to be from a group named the Armed Resistance Unit called a Capitol switchboard warning of a pending attack, saying it was in retaliation for US military actions in Grenada and Lebanon.\nThere were no casualties but there was some costly damage.\nIn 1988, FBI agents arrested seven members of the radical-left Resistance Conspiracy group for the Capitol attack and separate blasts at Fort McNair and the Washington Navy Yard in 1983 and 1984.\nLinda Evans and Laura Whitehorn were jailed for conspiracy and malicious destruction of government property in 1991. Both are now free. "

I had no idea it was caused by coronavirus.\"\nDiarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal cramps in children can be a sign of coronavirus according to some researchers, but the officially recognised symptoms are a fever, cough and loss of smell or taste.\nMrs Rudlehoff, who lives in Basildon, noticed her son had a temperature on New Year's Eve but put it down to teething. \nGeorge began vomiting the following evening and on 2 January she called NHS 111, who told her to take him to hospital.\nShe said: \"I really did not want to go. I was so scared about him getting the virus there, I had no idea he had it. \n\"He got so poorly so quickly when we arrived and was really lethargic. They took a swab and, when they said he was positive, I burst into tears. It was such a shock.\"\nThe mother-of-two said she presumed it was not Covid-19 because he did not have a cough, though he did develop a mild one a few days later while in hospital.\nShe said the staff were \"amazing\" and she wanted to reassure parents \"not to be afraid to go to hospital\" if their children were ill.\nNurses told her they had treated several other children with the same mottled skin and sickness and asked her to share her story to raise awareness of these symptoms.\nMrs Rudelhoff's post on Facebook was shared nearly 7,000 times within three days. \nIn the post, she said she felt \"upset, angry and frustrated\" because she had taken the illness very seriously but George had still managed to catch it. He was the only member of the family who tested positive.\nGeorge was discharged from hospital and was making a good recovery at home, she said.\nDr Kilali Ominu-Evbota, paediatric consultant at Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"It's great to hear that George is now back home and on the road to recovery. \n\"George's family did the right thing and we encourage parents to seek medical advice with their GP or via the NHS 111 service in order to get the correct treatment for their child.\"\nBasildon has an infection rate of 1,265 cases per 100,000 people - compared to the average England rate of 606.9.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

This president should not hold office one day longer,\" Senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement.\nHe added that Mike Pence should invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows for a transfer of power from the president to the vice-president, either temporarily or permanently.\n\"If the vice-president and the cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,\" he said.\nDemocrats of the House Judiciary Committee have also written a letter to Vice-President Pence urging him to act to remove Donald Trump from office, saying he had stoked an act of insurrection and \"sought to undermine our democracy\". \nThe 25th Amendment allows the vice-president to become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness.\nThe part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties.\nThey would need to sign a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the presiding officer of the Senate declaring the president is unfit to govern or incapable \"of discharging the powers and duties of his office\".  At this point, Vice-President Mike Pence would automatically take over. \nThe president is given the chance to offer a written response, and if he contests the finding, then it falls on Congress to decide. Any vote in the Senate and House of Representatives ordering the president's removal requires a two-thirds majority.\nUntil the issue is resolved, the vice-president would act as president. \nDiscussions about invoking the 25th Amendment also arose after President Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis in October last year, amid concern he may be too sick to run the country. \nAround the same time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation based on the 25th Amendment that created a commission to review a president's fitness for office. \nThe 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967, four years after the assassination of John F Kennedy, and was intended to address questions of presidential succession if a president becomes incapacitated.\nAnd for this reason, a number of presidents have used the amendment - specifically section three - which allows them to temporarily hand over power to their vice-presidents.  \nIn 2002 and 2007, President George W Bush placed his vice-president in charge when he was sedated during routine colonoscopies. President Ronald Reagan did the same in 1985 when he was in hospital for cancer surgery. \nBut to date, no sitting president has ever been permanently removed using the 25th Amendment. \nThere have been calls for President Trump to be impeached for a second time. \nMinnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar announced she was drawing up articles of impeachment against him, with a growing number of fellow Democrats voicing their support. \nDonald Trump has already been impeached once - by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. \nHe faced two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress - but was later acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. \nHe is only the third US president in history to have been impeached. \nTo impeach means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial. \nThe US constitution states a president \"shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours\".\nIt is a political process, rather than a criminal one.\nIt happens in two stages - articles are brought to the House of Representatives where, if passed, they proceed to the Senate for a trial. \nBut here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history. \nIf President Trump were replaced through the impeachment process, Vice-President Mike Pence would move into the Oval Office. \nNo president has ever been impeached twice during his time in office. \nQuestions remain as to whether there would be enough time to impeach Donald Trump before his term ends on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated.

      "text": "Two more life-saving drugs have been found that can cut deaths by a quarter in patients who are sickest with Covid. \nThe anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, say researchers who have carried out a trial in NHS intensive care units. \nSupplies are already available across the UK so they can be used immediately to save hundreds of lives, say experts. \nThere are over 30,000 Covid patients in UK hospitals - 39% more than in April.\nThe UK government is working closely with the manufacturer, to ensure the drugs - tocilizumab and sarilumab - continue to be available to UK patients.\nAs well as saving more lives, the treatments speed up patients' recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to spend in intensive care by about a week. \nBoth appear to work equally well and add to the benefit already found with a cheap steroid drug called dexamethasone. \nAlthough the drugs are not cheap, costing around \u00a3500 per patient, on top of the \u00a35 course of dexamethasone, the advantage of using them is clear - and less than the cost per day of an intensive care bed of around \u00a32,000, say experts.\nLead researcher Prof Anthony Gordon, from Imperial College London, said: \"For every 12 patients you treat with these drugs you would expect to save a life. It's a big effect.\"\nIn the REMAP-CAP trial carried out in six different countries, including the UK, with around 800 intensive care patients:\nProf Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: \"The fact there is now another drug that can help to reduce mortality for patients with Covid-19 is hugely welcome news and another positive development in the continued fight against the virus.\"\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:  \"The UK has proven time and time again it is at the very forefront of identifying and providing the most promising, innovative treatments for its patients.  \n\"Today's results are yet another landmark development in finding a way out of this pandemic and, when added to the armoury of vaccines and treatments already being rolled out, will play a significant role in defeating this virus.\" \nThe drugs dampen down inflammation, which can go into overdrive in Covid patients and cause damage to the lungs and other organs. \nDoctors are being advised to give them to any Covid patient who, despite receiving dexamethasone, is deteriorating and needs intensive care.\nTocilizumab and sarilumab have already been added to the government's export restriction list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. \nThe research findings have not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,United States Capitol,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Jamie Stiehm is a US political columnist who was in the Capitol building in Washington DC  when it was stormed by pro-Trump rioters. Here's what she saw from the press gallery in the House of Representatives.\nI had told my sister earlier: \"Something bad is going to happen today. I don't know what, but something bad will happen.\"\nOutside the Capitol, I encountered a group of very boisterous supporters of President Donald Trump, all waving flags and pledging their allegiance to him. There was a sense that trouble was brewing. \nI went inside to the House of Representatives and up into the press gallery, where we were assigned seats, looking down at the rather sombre gathering. Speaker Nancy Pelosi was holding the gavel, and keeping people to their five-minute statements.\nAs we went into the second hour, all of a sudden we heard breaking glass. The air began getting fogged. An announcement from the Capitol Police said, \"An individual has breached the building\". So everyone looked around and then it was business as usual. But after that, the announcements kept coming. And they were getting more and more urgent. \nThey announced that the intruders had breached the rotunda, which is under the famed marble dome. The sacred house of democracy was under fire. \nMany of us are hardened journalists - I've seen my share of violence covering homicides in Baltimore - but this was very unpredictable. The police didn't seem to know what was happening. They weren't coordinated. They locked the chamber doors but at the same time, they told us we would have to evacuate. So there was a sense of panic. \nI was afraid. I'll tell you that. And I've spoken to other journalists who said they were a little ashamed of themselves for feeling afraid. \nThere was a sense of \"nobody's in charge here, the Capitol Police have lost control of the building, anything can happen\". \nIf you think back to the September 11 attacks in 2001, there was one plane that went down and didn't hit its target. That target was the Capitol. There were echoes of that. I made a call to my family, just to let them know that I was here and it was a dangerous situation. \nThere was a shot. We could see there was a standoff in our chamber. Five men were holding guns at the door. It was a frightening sight. Men were looking through a broken glass window and looked like they could shoot at any second. \nThankfully there was no gunfire inside the chamber. But for a while there, it felt like it would be a real possibility. Because things were going downhill very fast. \nWe had to crawl under railings to get out of the way. I was not dressed to do that. A lot of women were dressed up, wearing heels, because they had come for a formal ritual. \nI sheltered in the House cafeteria alongside others. I'm still shaking now. \nI have seen a lot as a journalist, but this was something more. This was the collective public sphere being undermined, assaulted, degraded. And I think this was why the Speaker wanted to return and hold the gavel again and go on. \nAfterwards I had to decide whether I was going to go back to the chamber too. I decided l probably would, because the message that is sending is: \"You can incite a mob, but we're going to go on\". I think that is a very important political message. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is being rolled out to hundreds of GP-run vaccination sites in England.\nAs part of the biggest vaccination programme in NHS history, the aim is to offer jabs to most care home residents by the end of January.\nBy mid-February, the target is to vaccinate 13 million people in the top four priority groups.\nBut one surgery visited by the health secretary to promote the initiative said its delivery had been delayed. \nAnd leaders in Birmingham have warned stocks of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are scheduled to run out in the city on Friday, and that it has not received any supplies of the Oxford-Astra Zeneca jab.\nA letter sent to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, signed by the Labour leader of Birmingham City Council, Ian Ward, Labour MP Liam Byrne and Conservative MP and former minister Andrew Mitchell, said there was \"currently no clarity on when further supplies will arrive\".\nThey also criticise a lack of clarity over the vaccination programme, and say \"it remains unclear who is responsible for overseeing the vaccination programme in Birmingham, and whom we should hold accountable for progress and delivery\".\nMore than 700 local vaccination sites will administer the Oxford jab.\nAnother 180 GP-led sites, 100 new hospital sites and a pilot scheme involving local pharmacies will open this week.\nSelected hospitals began administering the vaccine on Monday.\nMr Hancock said the jab was now being supplied to GP practices across the country as he visited the Bloomsbury Surgery in central London.\nThe health secretary said he was \"delighted\" care homes residents would begin receiving their first Oxford jabs this week.\n\"This will ensure the most vulnerable are protected and will save tens of thousands of lives,\" he said.\nBut GP Ammara Hughes, a partner at Bloomsbury Surgery, told broadcasters its first delivery of the jab had been pushed back 24 hours to Thursday.\nShe said: \"It's just more frustrating than a concern because we've got the capacity to vaccinate. And if we had a regular supply - we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week.\"\nStanding in front of Dr Hughes's surgery, Mr Hancock said: \"The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We're working with the companies - both Pfizer and AstraZeneca - to increase the supply.\"\nThe surgery said it was continuing to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and had so far received three deliveries of that jab.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said vaccination centres and GP surgeries needed better information about deliveries of the vaccine and how much to expect to arrive.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted that the scenes at the surgery were like something from political comedy The Thick of It, but added: \"Sadly it's no laughing matter.\"\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first to be approved by the UK's medicines regulator in early December, followed by the British-made Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine four weeks later.\nBecause it does not need to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it can be transported and stored more easily, making it simpler to vaccinate housebound people and those in care homes.\nAround half a million doses of both vaccines are ready to be used this week, with millions more in the pipeline in the coming weeks.\nNext week, seven major vaccination hubs across England are set to begin operating, including the Excel Centre in London and Millennium Point in Birmingham.\nBroadly, vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out in a list of nine high-priority groups, covering around 30 million people.\nThey are thought to represent 90-99% of those at risk of dying from Covid-19.\nPeople aged over 80 in hospital, frontline health staff and care home workers have been the first to get the Pfizer jab at designated hospitals hubs and community sites across the UK. \nMeanwhile, nearly 19,981 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab were administered between 29 December and 3 January, NHS England said.\nDr Nikki Kanani, a GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said the vaccination programme was \"off to a strong start with around one million people already vaccinated against coronavirus\".\nShe said GPs, nurses, pharmacists and countless other staff and volunteers had been working \"around the clock\" to be able to launch almost 200 more sites this week. \n\"We will now be able to protect many more vulnerable people against the virus and faster,\" Dr Kanani said.\nNearly a quarter of the over-80s in England have now been vaccinated in total, around 650,000 people, since Margaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to receive a Covid vaccine in December.\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK had received their first dose of a vaccine.\nOn Wednesday, another 1,041 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were recorded, the highest daily death toll since April.\nAnd 62,322 new cases were recorded on Wednesday, the highest daily rise since mass testing began.\nAll of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown, and vaccinations are progressing across the devolved nations.\nEngland is under a third national lockdown - in a bid to prevent the NHS from becoming overwhelmed by the surge in coronavirus cases.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a new lockdown on Monday - across mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha for the rest of January. Level three restrictions apply in remaining areas of the nation.\nWales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December, and schools and colleges in the nation will remain closed until at least 18 January.\nIn Northern Ireland - which entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December - \"stay at home\" restrictions will be brought back into law from Friday.\nAs of Monday, about 100,000 people in Scotland had already received a first dose of vaccine. The Scottish NHS hopes to vaccinate everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May, supplies allowing.\nMore than 35,000 people in Wales have had a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and the Welsh government has said 40,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be available within the first two weeks. \nAbout 40,000 people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose, and health officials in the nation have said everyone aged over 80 will be immunised within weeks."

      "text": "People with non-visible disabilities such as autism or Parkinson's disease face a \"shocking disparity\" when applying for a blue badge parking permit, a BBC investigation has found.\nScores of councils have lower approval rates for non-visible disabilities applications compared to those for physical impairments.\nNon-visible disability applications began in England in August 2019. \nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said it would review their impact.\nApplications for people with cognitive impairments were already considered in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC Shared Data Unit obtained Freedom of Information Act (FOI) responses from the 216 upper-tier councils across the UK.\nOf the 109 councils who gave full responses, eight out of 10 had higher approval rates for people with physical impairments.  For ten of those councils, the difference was greater than 50 percentage points.\nJames Taylor, from the disability charity Scope, said: \"This new data shows a shocking disparity between the allocations of blue badges to people with invisible and visible impairments. \n\"Councils need to understand the devastating impact their negative decision can have.\" \nThe National Autistic Society said the results showed how important it was for councils to improve training to ensure staff understood when people should be entitled to a \"lifeline\" blue badge.\nBlue badge permits help disabled people to access goods and services, by allowing them to park close to their destination.\nThe new rules, described as \"the biggest change to the scheme in nearly 50 years\" when introduced by the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, widened the eligibility criteria to ensure people with non-visible disabilities were not disadvantaged.  \nThe scheme was changed to include disabilities such as autism, dementia and anxiety.\nFormer magistrates' court manager Michelle Woodward, who has relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), had her application for a blue badge and an appeal refused by Oxfordshire County Council in February 2019 before non-visible disabilities applications were introduced.\n\"It was outrageous at first,\" she said.\n\"Someone must have said to me it would be straightforward, otherwise I wouldn't have put myself through that stress.\n\"When I originally applied the guidance said not to mention any toilet issues. \n\"This was impossible for me because MS has affected my bladder as well as my walking and endurance. \n\"So when I hit the send button of my online application I instantly received a refusal email.\"\nShe could not re-apply for six months but when she did, she successfully did so under the new guidance.\nShe said: \"I found it very difficult navigating the whole online application system.\n\"Unfortunately, MS affects your brain power. So I had trouble working my way round the form, trying to attach it. Sometimes I have to get my husband to do it.\n\"It's not friendly. \n\"How many disabled customers are the shops losing because we can't use them?\n\"I feel like I'm not being incorporated with the town. I've lived in Oxford for two years but I can't really familiarise myself with the city. \n\"There are people worse off than me, how do they cope?\"\nTim Nicholls, head of policy and public affairs at the National Autistic Society, said: \"These figures highlight the postcode lottery that has developed around blue badges.\n\"This must change. Getting a blue badge when you need one shouldn't depend on where you live.\"\nThe removal of accessible parking bays next to shops and amenities \"overnight, without any consultation\" to allow for social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic had also had a \"massive impact\" on disabled people, Scope said.\nThe DfT said its review of the new criteria would include considering feedback from users of the online application service.\nBut people who had applied online told the BBC of the \"trauma\" of having to produce evidence of their disabilities to be scrutinised, and the difficulty of completing the form. In addition, they spoke of their reluctance to send original personal identity documents such as birth certificates in the post.\nMr Nicholls said a blue badge could facilitate journeys with a carer for someone with autism who may not be able to understand or react to the dangers of the road. \nThe permit could also help someone with autism overcome their anxiety over not finding a parking space or things going wrong on a trip, which could stop them from leaving the house entirely, he said.\nPaul Edwards, director of clinical services at Dementia UK, said: \"These lower blue badge approval rates for people with non-visible disabilities show how some of the most vulnerable people continue to be left behind.\n\"For both family carers and people with dementia still able to drive, a blue badge permit could help to minimise any safety risks by allowing closer parking to entrances. It can also decrease feelings of anxiety around going out.\"\nCrohns and Colitis UK said access to toilets was an extremely important issue for people with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, but many callers to its helpline had been refused a blue badge permit by their local council.\nCouncils with the largest disparity between approval rates said they had followed government guidance and helped applicants provide supporting medical evidence.\nCouncillor David Renard, transport spokesperson for the Local Government Association, which represents councils' interests, said local authorities wanted to make sure services and communities were as accessible as possible.\nAbout 2.3 million disabled people in England have a blue badge, according to latest data.\nSome 28,000 blue badges were issued to people with non-visible disabilities in England in the first 12 months, our investigation found.\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nFor more information on methodology, click here.

The country has been able to contain such outbreaks by immediately taking tough action.\nThis has involved consistently using mass testing when new clusters of cases appear, even if they seem relatively small.\nHebei province, where Shijiazhuang is located, reported 120 new cases on Thursday and all but one of those infections was in the city.\u00a0Elsewhere in the country, 22 new cases were confirmed.\u00a0\nThe virus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 before spiralling into a global pandemic.\nThursday's lockdown comes just weeks ahead of Chinese New Year, a time when people in China travel en masse to spend the holiday with their families. \nBut residents in the Gaocheng district of Shijiazhuang, considered to be the epicentre of the outbreak, are now not allowed to leave their local area. Other residents are banned from leaving the city. \nIn terms of transport, bus travel has been halted and many flights have been cancelled. \nIn a sign of just how seriously the authorities see the situation, even the postal service in and out of Shijiazhuang has been suspended for three days. And the restrictions are being tightly enforced - police were photographed in protective hazmat suits guarding the entrance to an expressway.\nThree officials in Shijiazhuang's Gaocheng district have been punished for \"negligence\", according to the state-run China Daily newspaper.\n\"Villages should identify, report, isolate and treat cases as early as possible, so as to cut off the transmission,\" Wu Hao, a national health official, was quoted as saying.\nFive hospitals in Shijiazhuang have been cleared for Covid-19 patients, with three others standing by, the city's Vice-Mayor Meng Xianghong said. \nIt is not the first time China has locked down a city in response to a cluster of cases since the outbreak in Wuhan.\nIn October, all nine million residents of the Chinese city of Qingdao were tested in five days after a dozen cases were confirmed. The cases were linked to a hospital treating coronavirus patients arriving from abroad. \nThe same month, authorities in Kashgar, in Xinjiang, tested around 4.7m people after an outbreak there. "

      "text": "When news of the first arrests began trickling through, Joey Siu got straight onto the phone to her friends in Hong Kong. As they stopped responding, one by one, she realised the crackdown was growing - and fast.\nThe 21-year-old student activist, who fled to the US two months ago, watched the detentions mount on her screen: a social worker, an academic, a former journalist, an American lawyer. \n\"I panicked,\" said Ms Siu, as the scale of the operation became apparent, partly \"because of the fact that I can't go back and help.\"\nLess than 18 months ago, she was one of the young protesters whose huge rallies shook Hong Kong and, like several dozen of those activists in recent months, she made the difficult decision to leave in fear of the widening clampdown and a feeling she could do more from overseas.\nOn Wednesday, 53 people were arrested in Hong Kong, the biggest swoop on pro-democracy activists so far under a draconian security law imposed by Beijing just six months ago.\nIt confirmed the worst fears of many - including Ms Siu's - that the legislation would be used to target peaceful activism and stamp out what was left of democracy in the Chinese-ruled city.\nThe raids began early on Wednesday morning in an operation involving some 1,000 national security officers - a new special branch of Hong Kong police formed to enforce the national security law.\nIt wasn't the first application of the controversial legislation, which has already targeted prominent figures such as media mogul Jimmy Lai, but it was the largest. A record number were arrested over unofficial primaries last year organised by pro-democracy camps ahead of a local election, which was ultimately postponed by the government.\nMore than 600,000 Hong Kongers had turned out to vote and decide on candidates, a move that incensed Beijing and drew a warning from Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam that the act could amount to subversion.\nIt wasn't therefore a complete shock when the formal accusations materialised on Wednesday, but the wide spectrum of those detained marked a new shift in the policing of dissent.\n\"It's not illegal for people to organise and plan together for a winning strategy,\" said Victoria Hui, a politics professor at Notre Dame University, saying she was left speechless by the arrests.\nBut what would be viewed as routine opposition activities elsewhere has been deemed as subversion in Hong Kong, she added.\nThe city \"is rapidly becoming like the rest of China where any kind of organised dissent is not tolerated. Anyone, however minor, even a social worker, is vulnerable,\" Dr Hui told the BBC. \n\"People don't know when police are going to knock on their door.\"\nSeveral detainees have stood out in this latest wave of arrests.\nAmong those was John Clancey, the first US national detained under the new security law. \nFootage of the veteran lawyer, who has been practising in Hong Kong since 1997, was widely shared on social media. In it, Mr Clancey can be seen walking with a crutch as he is slowly led away by police. When a reporter asks if he has anything to say to Hong Kong people he replies, unfazed: \"Continue to work for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.\"\nAnother notable detainee is the city's first registered ethnic minority social worker. Jeffrey Andrews, a 33-year-old Hong Konger of Indian descent, was one of the few people to speak out against racial injustice in the territory and took part in last year's primary.\n\"Arresting peaceful, reasonable and moderate members of the community shows that the national security law has nothing to do with security - instead the government can't cope with democratic aspirations,\" said Mark Daly, a lawyer who has lived in Hong Kong for 25 years and has worked with Mr Clancey on human rights issues.\nThe impact of the new security law is palpable throughout Hong Kong. \nThe months-long protests that took over swathes of the city in 2019 - and at times turned violent - began to peter out early last year, due to the pandemic. But the legislation introduced in June has had the effect of ending virtually all public campaigning since.\nSeveral people approached for this article - many of whom had been willing to march through the streets openly in 2019 - worried about the consequences of sharing their views.\nAnd few think the crackdown will end here. Some analysts are pointing to the judiciary as a potential next target for authorities.\n\"I think they'll continue to search out people,\" said Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and writer based in Hong Kong. \n\"What you'll have is a city that may be docile on the surface but with a great deal of tension under the surface,\" he told the BBC, adding that the democracy movement could even, after some years of relative silence, \"bubble up again\". \nFor Winston Ho - a Hong Konger in his 20s who asked the BBC not to use his real name - the arrests are \"a strategy to exhaust the energy and resources\" of Hong Kong's civil society.\nLike many of the city's democracy supporters, he voted in the primaries and was left \"infuriated\" that democratic demands were being interpreted as a subversion of state power.\n\"This shows that democratic ballots are bullets in the CCP's [Chinese Communist Party's] eyes,\" he said.\nThere is a growing sense of an emboldened Beijing willing to do whatever it takes to stifle any opposition. \n\"The Chinese leadership has decided that there are very few repercussions for them when they act on Hong Kong,\" said Professor Ian Chong from the National University of Singapore.\nWhereas earlier there may have been concerns about foreign investors in China that might affect trade in Hong Kong, he explained, perhaps now they \"believe they can weather those kind of pressures\".\nIn this new climate, Mr Ho has watched his friends leave the city and knows several others who are making plans to follow suit.\n\"It's sadly a professional hazard\" for many, he told the BBC, particularly those like him who work on human rights issues. \nFor now though, Mr Ho is hoping he doesn't have to make that choice."

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned the \"disgraceful scenes\" in the US, after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed Congress and clashed with police.\nRioters breached the Capitol building where lawmakers met to confirm Joe Biden's presidential election victory.\nThe PM said it was \"vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power\".\nAnd Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was a \"direct attack on democracy\".\n\"The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,\" Mr Johnson tweeted.\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, meanwhile, called the events \"utterly horrifying\".\nFriend of President Trump and leader of Reform UK - formerly the Brexit Party - Nigel Farage tweeted: \"Storming Capitol Hill is wrong. The protesters must leave.\"\nThe US Congress has now reconvened after the violence - spurred on by Mr Trump's  unproven claims of electoral fraud - to certify Mr Biden's victory in the US election in November \nHundreds of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol, and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC. \nBoth chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released.\nFour people died on Capitol grounds during the violence, including a woman shot by police and three others, who died as a result of \"medical emergencies\", local police said.\nUK MPs from across the political spectrum have criticised the events in the US.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said there was \"no justification for these violent attempts to frustrate the lawful and proper transition of power\", while Home Secretary Priti Patel called the scenes \"unacceptable and undemocratic\".\nShe added: \"There is no justification for this violence and Donald Trump must condemn it.\"\nHer Conservative colleague, and former Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt directly addressed President Trump for telling the crowd to march on Congress, tweeting: \"He shames American democracy tonight and causes its friends anguish - but he is not America.\"\nLabour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner said: \"The violence that Donald Trump has unleashed is terrifying, and the Republicans who stood by him have blood on their hands.\"\nAnd shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the events were \"the legacy of a politics of hate that pits people against each other and threatens the foundations of democracy\".\nMeanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has defended the prime minister's response to the rioting.\nAsked on ITV's Peston programme why Mr Johnson hadn't criticised Mr Trump, she said: \"The prime minister has been clear tonight that we need a peaceful and orderly transition.\"\nMs Coffey added that events in the US were a \"reminder that democracy is something precious - and will only continue to thrive as long as we protect institutions that make this country important and not demean each other when the majority of what we want to achieve is similar outcomes\".\nMeanwhile, the SNP's leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said the end of Mr Trump's presidency \"cannot come quick enough\".\nHe tweeted: \"What a legacy the events of today are to his time in office. Shameful, shocking, an affront to democracy.\"\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, called the scenes \"absolutely horrendous\", while his party's foreign affairs spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said: \"The scenes coming out of Washington tonight are an attack on democracy.\""

      "title": "Joe Biden inauguration: When are he and Kamala Harris sworn in?",
      "tags": "Kamala Harris,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The inauguration of a new president is a day that usually follows decades of custom and precedent. A day that follows a routine set in stone. Well, you can forget all that this year.\nJoe Biden and Kamala Harris will still take the oath, of course, to make them officially US president and vice-president, but this will be a much scaled back affair, due to Covid and the recent riots.\nHere's everything you need to know about the big day. \nThe inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the start of a new presidency, and it takes place in Washington DC. \nThe only required feature is that the president-elect recite the presidential oath of office.\n\"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" \nOnce he utters these words, Mr Biden will then take his place as the 46th president and the inauguration will be complete (but that's not all - celebrations follow). \nKamala Harris will become vice-president once she takes the oath of office, which usually happens just before the president.\nOpening remarks are usually scheduled for around 11:30 EST (16:30 GMT) and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in around midday. By law, inauguration day is always 20 January.\nMr Biden will move into the White House later in the day - his home for the next four years. \nPresidential inaugurations typically involve detailed security plans, but even more so now, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol on 6 January. \nOfficials have ramped up security and closed off large sections of the city. The Secret Service has taken command of the security plans, backed up by some 25,000 National Guard troops, in addition to thousands of police officers. \nWashington DC is already under a state of emergency and will remain that way through inauguration. \nAgent Matt Miller, who is leading the security effort on behalf of the Secret Service, told reporters on Friday that planning for the event has been going on for over a year.\nAnd while Mr Biden has insisted on taking the oath of office outside, as is tradition, attendance to the event will be scaled back. \nIt's become customary for the outgoing president to watch the next in line being sworn in, which can sometimes make things awkward. This year, it will be a different type of awkward - the outgoing president will be a no-show. \n\"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,\" Mr Trump tweeted on 8 January. He is widely expected to be travelling to his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago.\nSome of his supporters say they are planning a virtual \"second inauguration\" for Mr Trump on the same day (and time) that Mr Biden takes office. More than 68,000 people said on Facebook they would attend an online event to show their support for Mr Trump.  Facebook said it removed this event the week before the inauguration, because it violated its policies.\nWhen Mr Trump was sworn in, Hillary Clinton joined her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at the inauguration - just two months after her election defeat and a bitter campaign against Mr Trump. \nOnly three presidents - John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Johnson - have actively chosen to sit out their successor's inaugurations, and none in the last century.\nVice-President Mike Pence, however, has said that he will attend. \nIn normal circumstances, Washington DC would see hundreds of thousands of people flock to the city, swarming the National Mall and selling out hotels - an estimated two million came when President Obama was sworn in for his first term in 2009. \nBut this year, the celebration's size will be \"extremely limited\", the Biden team has said, and it has urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital, a call that has been repeated by DC authorities following the storming of Congress.  Viewing stands that had been constructed along the parade route have been taken down. \nOne tradition that will be preserved is that Mr Biden and Ms Harris will still take their oaths in front of the US Capitol, overlooking the Mall (a tradition that started with President Ronald Reagan in 1981). About 200 people will sit, socially distanced, on the stage with them, the Washington Post reports.\nThere will be masks and everybody on the platform will have to be tested within a couple of days of the event itself, it added. As for the moment of the swearing in itself, Mr Biden said back in June that he would not wear one to take the presidential oath.\nIn the past, up to 200,000 tickets were up for grabs to attend the official ceremony, but with infections still surging across the US, only around 1,000 tickets will be available. \nThis year, there will still be a \"pass in review\" ceremony - a traditional part of the peaceful transfer of power, where the new commander in chief inspects the troops, but instead of the usual parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, organisers say they will host a \"virtual parade\" across the US.\nMr Biden, Ms Harris and their spouses will then be escorted to the White House by members of the military, including a band and drum corps. \nTickets are required for seated and standing areas near the stage and seats along the parade route in normal years, and traditionally, the rest of the National Mall remained open to the public. \nSo if you want to watch the inaugural ceremonies from up close, you'll need to talk to your local representatives first. \nInaugural balls and other related events around the city require separate tickets.\nSenators and members of Congress are the keepers of the keys. Each has an allotted number of free tickets that they can distribute. \nThis year's pandemic-restricted number amounts to each lawmaker plus a guest. Commemorative tickets will be available for constituents after inauguration day. \nIn recent years, incoming presidents have added some of the country's most beloved performers to the day's programme. Despite the pandemic, this year won't be any different. \nMr Biden and Ms Harris will be joined by Lady Gaga - an active supporter of the incoming president - who will sing the national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez will sing during the ceremony's musical performance. \nAfter Mr Biden is sworn in, actor Tom Hanks will host 90-minutes of primetime television - a Covid-friendly replacement of celebrations typically held in-person.\nIt will feature Garth Brooks, Jon Bon Jovi, Demi Lovato and Justin Timberlake and will be broadcast across all major US networks and streaming platforms - with the exception of Fox News, a conservative network that has primarily supported Mr Trump during his presidency. \nIn 2009, Aretha Franklin sang at Barack Obama's inauguration, performing My Country 'Tis of Thee. Beyonc\u00e9 was also present, singing At Last to the first couple at Mr Obama's inaugural ball. \nAt his second inauguration in 2013, President Obama called on Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson to do the honours. Beyonc\u00e9 was back again, this time to sing the national anthem. \nDonald Trump reportedly had more trouble booking performers. Elton John declined Mr Trump's offer to perform, and reports circulated that Celine Dion, Kiss and Garth Brooks did the same. In the end, the Rockettes, country artist Lee Greenwood, and the band 3 Doors Down turned out for Mr Trump's day. "

      "tags": "Washington DC,US Capitol stormed,US election 2020,Donald Trump,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US Congress has certified Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, hours after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the building in an attack that saw four people die. \nLawmakers resumed the session after police removed a mob that had been encouraged by President Trump as part of his attempt to overturn his defeat. \nThe certification clears the way for Mr Biden to be sworn in on 20 January.\nIn response, Mr Trump finally pledged an \"orderly transition\" of power.\nWednesday's chaotic scenes followed months of escalating rhetoric from Mr Trump and some Republican allies that sought to undermine the result of the 3 November election. The invasion of the Capitol by the president's supporters - some armed - was an event without precedent in modern American history.\nWashington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said one of the four who died - a woman named as Ashli Babbitt - was part of a group that forced entry into the chamber of the House of Representatives while it was still in session. They were confronted by plainclothes officers, and an officer pulled out a weapon and fired it.\nThe US Capitol Police said the employee involved had been put on administrative leave pending an investigation.\nLocal media said Ashli Babbitt was a San Diego-area US Air Force veteran and Trump supporter. She was proclaimed dead at hospital.\nOne woman and two men died as a result of \"medical emergencies\", officials said, without giving details. At least 14 members of the police were injured.\nThe FBI is now seeking to identify those involved in the rampage, which came after Mr Trump had told a rally he would never concede the election and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol.\nIt also came on the day two Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia, giving the party effective control of the whole of Congress. This major political victory will ease the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated.\nDemocrat Joe Biden's victory was confirmed at about 03:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Thursday in a joint session presided over by Republican Vice-President Mike Pence, who called the violence a \"dark day in the history of the United States Capitol\".\nMr Biden blasted the \"insurrection\" as Mr Trump, while telling the mob to \"go home\", continued to make false claims of electoral fraud. The outgoing president's Twitter and Facebook accounts were later frozen and remain blocked.\nObjections by some Republican lawmakers to overturn the result in Arizona and Pennsylvania were rejected. Congress formally certified the final electoral college vote, with Mr Biden receiving 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232.\nFor days Mr Trump had been piling pressure on his vice-president to block certification. But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said he had no \"unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted\".\nIn declaring the final vote totals, Mr Pence said this \"shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice-president of the United States\".\nShortly afterwards Mr Trump said in a statement: \"Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.\"\nOn Thursday the White House press office issued a statement saying it \"grieves the loss of life\" and will continue \"to pray for a speedy recovery for those who suffered injury\".\nThis is how the Trump presidency ends. Not with a whimper, but with a bang.\nFor weeks, Donald Trump had been pointing to 6 January as a day of reckoning. It was when he told his supporters to come to Washington DC, and challenge Congress - and Vice-President Mike Pence - to discard the results of November's election and keep the presidency in his hands.\nCrisis can bring political opportunity, and there are many politicians who will not hesitate to use it to gain advantage.\nDonald Trump - for now - is still in power. And while he may be chastened, he may be sitting in the White House residence watching television temporarily without his social media outlet, he will not be silent for long.\nAnd once he decamps for his new Florida home, he could begin making plans to settle scores and, perhaps, someday return to power and rebuild a legacy that, for the moment, lies in tatters.Biden win certified by Congress after chaotic day\nRead more from Anthony\nIn addition to Mr Pence, some Republicans who previously stood by the president have now spoken out. \nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor on Wednesday, saying: \"If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.\"\nAfter the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as \"rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists\", saying the president \"bears a great deal of the blame\".\nSenator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her bid for election in Georgia's vote on Tuesday, said she could no longer in good conscience vote against certification as she had originally planned, citing the \"abhorrent\" invasion of the Capitol.\nWith two weeks before Mr Trump leaves office, there are calls for him to be removed beforehand for instigating the attack on Congress. US media say some members of his cabinet have discussed invoking the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which deals with removing a president deemed unfit for office.\nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements.\nOn Wednesday afternoon protesters surged up the Capitol steps shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building. The mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington police. \nThey shouted and waved pro-Trump, US and Confederate flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned.\nMembers of Congress scrambled for cover under their seats as tear gas was fired. Several thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service personnel were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police.\nThe apparent ease with which Trump supporters were able to act has raised serious questions about security. Two pipe bombs were recovered, one from the Democratic National Committee offices, not far from the Capitol, and one from the nearby Republican National Committee headquarters.\nThe occupation of the Capitol lasted more than three hours before the building was secured by law enforcement. At least 52 people have been arrested, the vast majority of them for violating the 18:00 to 06:00 curfew.\nWashington is under an extended state of emergency until after Mr Biden's inauguration.\nResponding to the violence, Mr Biden said the mob's activity \"border[ed] on sedition\" and that democracy was \"under unprecedented assault\".\n\"To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices on the floor of the United States Senate, rummaging through desks, on the House of Representatives, threatening the safety of duly elected officials. It's not protest; it's insurrection.\"\nMr Trump posted a recorded video on Twitter saying: \"I know your pain. I know you're hurt... We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.\"\nFor the first time, Twitter froze Mr Trump's account, saying it would be locked for 12 hours. The social media giant demanded he delete three tweets that it said could stoke violence and threatening \"permanent suspension\". Facebook and Instagram followed suit.\nHours earlier, Mr Trump had addressed a \"Save America Rally\" outside the White House, where he encouraged supporters to keep contesting the election result: \"Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore.\"\nPolitical figures from around the world condemned the violence. In the US, former President Barack Obama said history would rightly remember the assault on the Capitol as \"as a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation\".\nFormer President George W Bush said: \"It is a sickening & heartbreaking sight. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic - not our democratic republic.\""

Obviously, I've only got one that I can donate. \n\"The renal teams don't push you [to make a decision], because you're putting yourself on the line to donate a kidney.\n\"You have to make that call yourself, but obviously as a mum when you've got two children who both need kidney transplants and you've expected to give your kidney to one, and suddenly the other one needs one as well, you feel this dilemma.\"\nProblems began in 2016 when Ariel started to feel constantly tired.\nHer fatigue was initially put down to exam stress, but tests at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary found she had the kidney condition. \nMrs Bingham was told she would be a suitable donor for Ariel when the time came.\nThen, in 2019, Noah became ill and was diagnosed with the same condition.\nHe is stable, but would need to put on weight to undergo a transplant.\nThe couple have another son Casper, 12, who is being tested to see if he also has the condition.\nProf John Sayer, a kidney specialist at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital who is treating Noah, said nephronophthisis affects about one in 100,000 people.\n\"There's clearly a dilemma because there's a shortage of donors for patients needing kidney transplants.\n\"But kidney failure itself is not rare. There are 4,500 people across the country waiting for a transplant.\"\nHe added patients often face a \"gruelling and terrifying\" wait of about three years for a donor organ.\nIn December, Mr Bingham completed the challenge of walking 12,000 steps every day for 12 days to raise money for Kidney Research UK, which has supported the family.\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "National Express has announced that it is suspending its entire national network of coach services from midnight on Sunday.\nThe firm said tighter Covid restrictions and falling passenger numbers had prompted the decision.\nIt added that it hoped to restart services in March.\nAll customers whose travel has been cancelled will be contacted and offered a free amendment or full refund, the company said.\nAll journeys before Monday 11 January will be completed to ensure any passengers making essential journeys are not stranded. \nChris Hardy, managing director of National Express UK Coach, said: \"We have been providing an important service for essential travel needs. However, with tighter restrictions and passenger numbers falling, it is no longer appropriate to do this.\nHe added that as the vaccination programme was rolled out and government guidance changed, the company would regularly review when services could restart. \n\"We plan to be back on the road as soon as the time is right and have put a provisional restart date of Monday 1 March in place,\" he said.\nNational Express first suspended coach services during the coronavirus crisis in April, then restarted in July.\nServices have been operating at half capacity, with strict cleaning and Covid protocols. As the tier structure came into operation, demand for services reduced.\nAs with the previous suspension, employees will be furloughed. \nFirms that transport passengers, including coach, rail and aviation businesses, have been under intense pressure during the coronavirus crisis.\nAvanti West Coast, the train operating company running services on the West Coast mainline, has confirmed it will cut its timetable from 18 January. \nAvanti says the new timetable will 'more closely reflect the current demand for our services whilst still allowing key workers, and those needing to make essential journeys, to travel with confidence'.\nDuring the first major lockdown in March, services on key intercity routes were reduced from three an hour to one. This included services from both Manchester and Birmingham to London.\nThe Department for Transport has been consulting with all train operators about service reductions during the latest lockdown. \nThe exact scale of reduction is still being worked on, but the DfT says service levels may fall to as low as 40% of the normal timetable by some operators. \nThe focus is to ensure essential workers can still make essential journeys. \nAn Avanti West Coast spokesperson said: \n\"Following discussions with the Department for Transport we will be introducing a new timetable on Monday 18 January. This will more closely reflect the current demand for our services whilst still allowing key workers, and those needing to make essential journeys, to travel with confidence.\"\nOn Thursday, Ryanair also announced that it would make big cuts to its flight schedule from 21 January, with few, if any flights to or from the UK or Ireland until \"draconian travel restrictions are removed\".\nTrain services are expected to be reduced in lockdown, with some in the industry anticipating reductions of between 50% and 60% compared with normal service.\nIn the first national lockdown in England, services were reduced to almost half."

      "text": "Two more life-saving drugs have been found that can cut deaths by a quarter in patients who are sickest with Covid. \nThe anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, say researchers who have carried out a trial in NHS intensive care units. \nSupplies are already available across the UK so they can be used immediately to save hundreds of lives, say experts. \nThere are over 30,000 Covid patients in UK hospitals - 39% more than in April.\nThe UK government is working closely with the manufacturer, to ensure the drugs - tocilizumab and sarilumab - continue to be available to UK patients.\nAs well as saving more lives, the treatments speed up patients' recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to spend in intensive care by about a week. \nBoth appear to work equally well and add to the benefit already found with a cheap steroid drug called dexamethasone. \nAlthough the drugs are not cheap, costing around \u00a3500 per patient, on top of the \u00a35 course of dexamethasone, the advantage of using them is clear - and less than the cost per day of an intensive care bed of around \u00a32,000, say experts.\nLead researcher Prof Anthony Gordon, from Imperial College London, said: \"For every 12 patients you treat with these drugs you would expect to save a life. It's a big effect.\"\nIn the REMAP-CAP trial carried out in six different countries, including the UK, with around 800 intensive care patients:\nProf Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: \"The fact there is now another drug that can help to reduce mortality for patients with Covid-19 is hugely welcome news and another positive development in the continued fight against the virus.\"\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:  \"The UK has proven time and time again it is at the very forefront of identifying and providing the most promising, innovative treatments for its patients.  \n\"Today's results are yet another landmark development in finding a way out of this pandemic and, when added to the armoury of vaccines and treatments already being rolled out, will play a significant role in defeating this virus.\" \nThe drugs dampen down inflammation, which can go into overdrive in Covid patients and cause damage to the lungs and other organs. \nDoctors are being advised to give them to any Covid patient who, despite receiving dexamethasone, is deteriorating and needs intensive care.\nTocilizumab and sarilumab have already been added to the government's export restriction list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. \nThe research findings have not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.

      "text": "The UK has reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus, the highest daily death toll since April.\nIt came as 62,322 new cases were recorded, the highest daily rise since mass testing began, and as MPs supported England's lockdown.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said doctors could be forced to ration treatment without the new curbs. \nThere are 30,074 Covid patients in UK hospitals, he said, as an ambulance trust told of severe pressure.\nCurrent patient numbers are 39% higher than the previous peak on 12 April last year, when 21,684 were in hospital.\nThe number of those who died within 28 days of a positive test in the past week is 37% higher than the previous seven days.\nAndrew Hayward, a professor of infectious diseases, said the number of deaths could continue to increase for the next few weeks.\nHe explained deaths \"lag two or three weeks behind the number of cases in the community, and those have been increasing\". \nProf Hayward, who is also a government science adviser, added: \"I think the lockdown measures will turn that number of deaths around but it is going to take a little while.\"\nMr Hancock told MPs the consequences of inaction could be similar to scenes elsewhere in the world - of overrun hospitals and doctors choosing \"who to treat and who to turn away\".\n\"If we don't act now, we know that eventually the NHS would not be able to cope,\" he said.\nWest Midlands Ambulance Service experienced its busiest-ever day on Monday, handling 5,383 emergency calls due to a combination of Covid-19 pressures and winter weather.\nSussex and Surrey have rolled out \"major incident\" plans, allowing the two counties to seek more central government support as pressure mounts on health services.\nAnd hospitals in Greater Manchester are in danger of \"falling over\" as cancer operations risk being cancelled, Manchester City Council's leader Sir Richard Leese said.\nAll of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown.\nWhile England's lockdown became law at midnight, MPs voted overwhelmingly - by 524 to 16 - in support of the tougher measures on Wednesday evening.\nLabour backed the restrictions but 12 Conservative MPs rebelled to vote against. \nSpeaking during the Commons debate, Health Minister Helen Whately said although the regulations allowed the lockdown to be in place until the end of March, the government did not expect it to continue until then. \nInstead, the plan was for a \"steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a local basis\" to exit lockdown. \nFew MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions.\nMost agree they are needed now, even if they do not like them.\nThe start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too.\nThis vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March.\nThe questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan.\nMPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention.\nMeanwhile, GCSEs, A-level and AS-level exams will be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.\nAll national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are also cancelled, he confirmed.\nHe said that during this lockdown, every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week.\nThe figures are stark. But sadly they were to be expected. Infection rates were climbing throughout December - they are now more than four times higher than they were at the start of last month.\nMore infections, mean more hospital admissions and more deaths.\nThe fact deaths have gone over 1,000 for the first time since April is alarming.\nBut one caveat to that is that the figures over the past week have been jumping around because of delays reporting deaths over the Christmas period.\nA better way to measure deaths is to look at the average number of deaths over the course of the week. This metric shows we are seeing just below 700 a day - although that is still up by 40% compared to the figure before Christmas.\nAnd these numbers are only going to continue rising. That's because this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions and some of those being admitted then will die maybe a week or so later.\nLockdown is expected to have an impact, but it will take some time - and even then it may have less affect than previous ones because of the more transmissible variant. \nThe rollout of the vaccines cannot come soon enough.\nAs MPs debated the new lockdown, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for the government to ramp-up its vaccination programme to six million doses a week.\nIt came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs England's new lockdown would not end with a \"big bang\" but a \"gradual unwrapping\".\nHe said that, unlike during the first lockdown from March 2020, vaccines now offered \"the means of our escape\". \nBut he said there was a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. \nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi earlier said he was \"confident\" the \"ambitious\" target would be met, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. \nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK had been vaccinated so far.\nThe locations for seven mass vaccination centres in England have been announced by the government.\nSites in Stevenage, London, Newcastle, Manchester, Surrey, Bristol and Birmingham will be staffed by NHS workers and volunteers from next week.\nHow have you been affected by Covid?

Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant from Wales, tweeted: \"No thanks. I'd rather you obey the rules, stay at home, wear masks and wash your hands.\"\nAnd palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke said: \"Please don't clap us. Just wear a mask, wash your hands and respect lockdown.\"\nIn a tweet posted hours before the weekly clap was due to return, Ms Plas, a Dutch national living in south London, said she had been targeted with personal abuse and threats against her and her family by \"a hateful few\" on social media.\n\"I have no political agenda, I am not employed by the government, I do not work in PR, I am just an average mum at home trying to cope with the lockdown situation,\" she said, in a statement.\nShe said the newly revived clap could and should still happen at 20:00 GMT.\n\"It's up to each person to decide how relevant or worthwhile they feel it is to participate,\" she said."

More than 700 local sites will administer the vaccine, with another 180 GP-led centres, 100 new hospital sites and a pilot scheme involving local pharmacies opening this week.\nWith the number of coronavirus patients in UK hospitals topping 30,000 - 39% higher than at last April's peak - our medical editor Fergus Walsh returns to University College Hospital, in central London.

Myer Rudelhoff's four-month-old son George spent three nights in Basildon hospital, Essex, with patchy skin, swelling on his lips, a high temperature and unable to keep down fluids. \"I thought it was a sickness bug. I had no idea it was caused by coronavirus,\" says Myer, whose son recovered well.\nWith the largest vaccination programme in NHS history under way, we report from a GP surgery where staff describe the operation.

Drive-through and delivery services across the fast food chain will remain open.\nUnder new lockdown restrictions which came into force in England and Scotland this week, hospitality firms are allowed to offer takeaways and deliveries.\nBut rules which previously allowed takeaways or click-and-collect services for alcoholic drinks have been scrapped.\nWales and Northern Ireland were already in lockdown, which meant that pubs, restaurants and cafes were restricted to takeaway-only too.\nAfter the first nationwide lockdown in March, many chains including McDonald's, Burger King and Pret closed their doors to hungry customers.\nThey gradually reopened with additional safety measures in place, such as plastic screens in front of the tills, hand sanitiser dispensers and restrictions on the number of customers allowed in at any one point. Some also pared back the number of dishes on offer.\nA Burger King spokesperson said that takeaway was still available in some branches and that it would continue to offer click-and-collect and delivery services \"in line with guidance issued\".\nSandwich chain Pret A Manger told the BBC that it is keeping some outlets open for both takeaways and delivery, but it would keep the number under review in the coming months.\n\"Last year we shifted our business to focus on delivery and expanded our delivery platform partnerships, to make Pret available to a wider customer base\", a spokesperson said.\n\"Since then, we have seen a significant increase in the use of delivery.\"\nSubway and KFC also confirmed that they remain open for in-store takeaways, deliveries and click-and-collect orders across the UK.\nFast food firm Leon, which has 65 outlets, said that 28 of their sites will remain open for takeaways and deliveries. \n\"We will continue to keep as many restaurants open as possible, as we did in the previous two lockdowns in line with government guidelines,\" a spokesperson said.\nDespite adapting their business models, many casual dining chains have been forced to make job cuts in the last year as lockdown restrictions hit sales. Pret, for example, announced 3,000 job cuts in August, while Greggs made 820 job cuts at the end of 2020."

We do recognise that this will be an additional burden on schools \nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said rather than a \"vague statement\" of how A-levels and GCSEs would be graded, ministers should already have a system ready in place - and it was a \"dereliction of duty\" that it was not already prepared.\nAnd he warned against repeating the \"shambles\" of last summer's cancelled exams.\nThe education secretary confirmed to MPs that GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown.\nThe exams watchdog Ofqual will draw up proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, for qualifications that could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places.\nSimon Lebus, the watchdog's interim head, said evidence for replacement grades could include tests, homework, mock exams and teachers' observations - and would take into account how much of the syllabus had been covered.\nA consultation is expected to begin next week, with plans to be decided by the end of February or possibly sooner.\nLast year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades.\nAnd without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' assessments, with some process of moderation between schools, will be used for this summer's candidates.\nOn vocational qualifications, Labour's Ms Green said the education secretary was \"failing to show leadership on exams in January\".\nVocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them - but college leaders had complained that there needed to be a national decision to avoid confusion.\nIf students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will still be awarded a grade, if they have \"enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression\", says the awarding body Pearson.\nAn Ofqual spokeswoman said they would consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, \"to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances\".\nThe exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades.\nMr Williamson's statement in the Commons came as all GCSE, AS and A-level exams in Northern Ireland were  cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday.\nScotland has already cancelled its Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers.\nGCSEs  and A-levels in Wales were scrapped in November."

Twitter has also frozen his account. \nThe president has now said there will be an \"orderly transition\" to Democrat Joe Biden, whose November election victory has now been certified by US lawmakers. \nBut he added that he continued to \"totally disagree\" with the outcome of the vote, repeating his unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud.\nHundreds of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol - where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Mr Biden's election victory - and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC. \nBoth chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released.\nMs Patel told BBC Breakfast the scenes were \"awful beyond words\". \nThe home secretary said: \"His comments directly led to the violence, and so far he has failed to condemn that violence and that is completely wrong.\"\nShe added: \"He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn't actually do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever... what we've seen is completely unacceptable.\"\nA woman died after being shot by police, and three others died as a result of \"medical emergencies\", local police said.\nPoliticians across the UK's political parties lined up to condemn the scenes in Washington. \nSpeaking on Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Trump should \"take responsibility\" for what happened, calling it the \"culmination of years of the politics of hate and division\".\nSir Keir added he welcomed the outgoing president's agreement to an orderly handover, but told reporters \"he should have said it a long time ago.\"\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Trump had been \"inciting insurrection in his own country,\" and called it a \"dark period\" in US history. \n\"What we witnessed last night is not that surprising. In some senses, Donald Trump's presidency has been moving towards this moment almost from the moment it started,\" she told ITV's Good Morning Britain.\nScotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the home secretary should \"give serious consideration\" to denying Mr Trump entry to the UK after he leaves office. \nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said certification of Mr Biden's victory was \"good to see\" after the \"shocking events\" on Wednesday, adding the UK condemned the violence \"unequivocally\". \nFormer Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, who shared time in office with Mr Trump, said there should be \"no place for the rule of the mob\". \nBut senior Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Davies has been criticised after comparing the rioting to politicians who supported a second referendum on Brexit.\nMr Davies, a member of the Welsh Parliament, later tweeted that \"violence must never be tolerated\".\nHis party colleague, the Conservative MP Simon Hoare, suggested Mr Trump could be sent to the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay:\nFriend of President Trump and leader of Reform UK - formerly the Brexit Party - Nigel Farage tweeted: \"Storming Capitol Hill is wrong. The protesters must leave.\"\nMeanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has defended the prime minister's response to the rioting.\nAsked on ITV's Peston programme why Mr Johnson hadn't criticised Mr Trump, she said: \"The prime minister has been clear tonight that we need a peaceful and orderly transition.\"\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has written to express his \"solidarity\" with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose empty office was broken into by protesters. \n\"Seeing your office trashed in that way and its occupation by one of the rioters was particularly outrageous. I am just so relieved you were not hurt,\" he wrote. \nIt is a truism of British diplomacy that every occupant of 10 Downing Street has to get on with every occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, regardless of their politics or character. \nPersonal consideration is pushed aside. What matters is the national interest and staying close to one of Britain's closest allies. \nThus even now, even after Donald Trump's incitement of the Capitol mob, even though there are less than two weeks until the inauguration, even as close Republican allies jump ship, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab were reluctant to criticise the president by name in their initial response overnight. \nYes, they condemned the violence. But of Mr Trump, not a word. This caution was matched by the Prime Ministers of fellow so-called Five Eyes intelligence allies, Australia and New Zealand, both of whom also both failed to mention Mr Trump in their condemnatory tweets. \nIn contrast, European leaders were quick to blame the president personally. \nIt was only this morning that a British minister, Home Secretary Priti Patel, felt able to follow suit in strong terms. \nSo was this natural and sensible diplomatic caution in the midst of a febrile crisis? \nOr was this, as some Labour figures are already claiming, a function of the closeness between the current UK government and the Trump administration? \nIt was only a few weeks ago that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told The Sun that he would miss Donald Trump because he was a good friend to Britain. \nWhatever one's views, it is certainly the case that the British government is seen on the international stage by some has having ideological proximity to Mr Trump. \nChanging that reputation is seen by many diplomats as a priority in the months ahead, a task made more urgent by events overnight.

      "text": "US President Donald Trump's opponents in the two houses of Congress have called for him to be removed from office after the violent invasion of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.\nDemocratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump should be removed immediately. If he is not, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says he could be impeached. \nRemoval would need Republican support and only a few have so far backed it.\nIn a video speech, Mr Trump said he was committed to an \"orderly\" transition.\nThe president said a new administration would be inaugurated on 20 January, and called for \"healing and reconciliation\". \nHe also said he was \"outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem\" on Wednesday and that \"tempers must be cooled and calm restored\". The video was shared on his Twitter account, which was reactivated on Thursday after being suspended following the Capitol riot.\nAt least four people died during the unrest, and 68 have now been arrested.\nThe actions of the police have come under scrutiny, with officers facing criticism for failing to stop the rioters breaking in.\nThe official responsible for security in the House of Representatives, the sergeant at arms, has resigned. Reports say US Capitol Police (USCP) chief Steven Sund is also resigning, effective 16 January, following calls from Ms Pelosi. \nMr Schumer has called for his counterpart in the Senate to be sacked.\nTransport Secretary Elaine Chao is the latest member of the Trump administration to quit in protest over the riots. Several lower-level officials have also resigned. \nPresident-elect Joe Biden said: \"Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol.\"\nA growing number have called for Mr Trump to be removed as president. Most of them are from Mr Biden's Democratic Party but a few Republicans have joined in.\n\"This president should not hold office one day longer,\" said Mr Schumer, who will lead the Democratic majority in the Senate when it begins its new session later this month. \nHe urged Mr Trump's cabinet to remove him from office using the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness.\nIt would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do.\nMs Pelosi described Mr Trump as \"a very dangerous person\" and said: \"This is an emergency of the highest magnitude.\"\nShe left open the option of impeachment if Mr Trump's colleagues did not start 25th Amendment proceedings. \nHowever, the Democrats would need to rely on the support of Republicans to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict Mr Trump under the articles of impeachment in the constitution, and would be unlikely to get those numbers.\nCongressman Adam Kinzinger from Illinois was one of the first Republicans to call for use of the 25th Amendment, saying: \"Fires stoked by the president finally leapt out of the pan.\"\nThe Republican governors of Maryland and Vermont have also called for Mr Trump to be removed from office. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements.\nSeparately, both the House and the Senate have adjourned until after Mr Biden is sworn in on 20 January. \nBoth houses would have to be recalled in order to start impeachment proceedings.\nSeveral Trump administration officials have now resigned over the riots - Elaine Chao is the most high-profile.\nMs Chao, who has served through the whole presidency and is married to the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, said the events had \"deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside\".\nOthers to quit include special envoy Mick Mulvaney, a senior national security official, and the chief of staff to First Lady Melania Trump. A State Department adviser was also sacked after calling Mr Trump \"unfit for office\" in a tweet.\nThe president is also facing new restrictions on his use of social media. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has suspended him from both platforms at least until he leaves office and possibly indefinitely.\nTwitter suspended his account for 12 hours. \nThe 25th Amendment, enacted in 1967, was designed to provide a more detailed process for the succession of presidential power. The writers envisioned national catastrophes or a medically incapacitated president as situations the amendment could address.\nIt was not contemplated, at least initially, as a means to drag a president who is viewed as a threat to the nation from office.\nThat, however, is exactly what many Democrats - including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - are suggesting should happen to Donald Trump. It's what one current Republican congressman, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, is calling for and what one of Trump's former White House chiefs of staff, John Kelly, said he supported.\nWith just 13 days left in the Trump presidency, the unprecedented step of stripping an unwilling president of power, which requires the consent of the vice-president and a majority of the 15-member presidential cabinet, seems unlikely. But the report that such steps are being contemplated underline the gravity of the current situation.\nDemocrats are also once again talking about impeachment and conviction by the Senate, a process that would take more time but would, as an additional benefit in their minds, prohibit Mr Trump from running for office in the future.\nPolice have been heavily criticised for their response to the violence. \nImages captured inside the Capitol building showed rioters strolling through some of the corridors unimpeded. One man occupied Ms Pelosi's office, putting his feet up on her desk, while another was photographed walking out carrying a lectern.\nWashington police say 68 people have so far been arrested, only one of them from the DC area. \nOne USCP officer has been placed on leave after a woman was shot dead on the floor of the House of Representatives. The woman, who has been named as air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, 35, was part of a group that forced its way into the chamber while it was still in session. \nPolice said three other people - 50-year-old Benjamin Philips from Pennsylvania; 55-year-old Kevin Greeson from Alabama; and 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland from Georgia - died of unspecified \"medical emergencies\". Mr Greeson's family said he died of a heart attack. \nThe FBI is seeking to identify those involved in the rampage. \nThe Department of Justice says those arrested could face charges of seditious conspiracy, as well as rioting and insurrection. \nOne of those detained at the Capitol had a \"military-style automatic weapon and 11 Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs)\", according to the federal attorney for Washington DC. \nOn Thursday, crews began installing a non-scalable 7ft (2m) fence around the Capitol. It will remain in place for at least 30 days. \nMichelle Obama, wife of Mr Trump's presidential predecessor, Barack Obama, released a statement calling attention to the racial disparity in the way different protests were policed.\nShe described Mr Trump as \"an infantile and unpatriotic president\", and said it would be impossible to move on until there was a reckoning with Wednesday's events.\n\"Yesterday made it painfully clear that certain Americans are, in fact, allowed to denigrate the flag and symbols of our nation. They've just got to look the right way,\" she wrote.\nThe New York Times reported, quoting unnamed sources, that Mr Trump was considering granting a pardon to himself in the final days of his presidency. \nThe legality of such a move is untested.

      "text": "Boeing has agreed to pay $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) to settle US criminal charges that it hid information from safety officials about the design of its 737 Max planes.\nThe US Justice Department said the firm chose \"profit over candour\", impeding oversight of the planes, which were involved in two deadly crashes.\nAbout $500m will go to families of the 346 people killed in the tragedies.\nBoeing said the agreement acknowledged how the firm \"fell short\".\nBoeing chief executive David Calhoun said: \"I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do - a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations. \n\"This resolution is a serious reminder to all of us of how critical our obligation of transparency to regulators is, and the consequences that our company can face if any one of us falls short of those expectations.\"\nThe Justice Department said Boeing officials had concealed information about changes to an automated flight control system, known as MCAS, which investigations have tied to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019.\nThe decision meant that pilot training manuals lacked information about the system, which overrode pilot commands based on faulty data, forcing the planes to nosedive shortly after take-off. \nBoeing did not co-operate with investigators for six months, the DOJ said.\n\"The tragic crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world's leading commercial airplane manufacturers,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General David Burns. \n\"Boeing's employees chose the path of profit over candour by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception.\"\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Boeing was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the US, which will be dismissed after three years if the firm continues to comply with the deal.\nOf the total settlement, the majority - $1.77bn, some of which has already been paid - is due to go the firm's airline customers, who were affected by the grounding of the planes following the crashes.\nThe firm also agreed to pay a penalty of $243.6m.\nBut attorneys for the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash said the deal on Thursday would not end their pending civil lawsuit against Boeing.\n\"The allegations in the deferred prosecution agreement are just the tip of the iceberg of Boeing's wrongdoing \u2014 a corporation that pays billions of dollars to avoid criminal liability while stonewalling and fighting the families in court,\" said a statement from the group of lawyers representing them.\nThey added that the FAA \"should not have allowed the 737 Max to return to service until all of the airplane's deficiencies are addressed and it has undergone transparent and independent safety reviews.\"\nBoeing says it has now addressed concerns about the Max, while the plane returned to service in the US in December.\nThe charge against Boeing was that its employees used \"misleading statements, half truths and omissions\" to dupe the regulator charged with maintaining the safety of US aviation.\nIn the circumstances, you could say the company got off relatively lightly.\nIt has avoided prosecution, and a large part of the settlement involves compensation to airlines - a fair amount of which it would probably have ended up paying anyway.\nThe company would doubtless like to use this moment to draw a line under one of the most traumatic episodes in its history. \nYet while the 737 Max is back in the air, the scrutiny of Boeing and the FAA is unlikely to stop here. \nCritics, including victims' families, lawyers and politicians, insist serious questions about the aircraft remain - and they're still pushing for answers."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus vaccine rollout is a national challenge requiring an unprecedented effort - involving the armed forces - Boris Johnson says.\nThe PM confirmed almost 1.5 million people in the UK have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine.\nMore than 1,000 GP-led sites in England will be able to offer a total of \"hundreds of thousands\" of jabs each day by 15 January, he said.\nThe Army will use \"battle preparation techniques\" to help achieve that goal.\nIt came as a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities - and 52,618 new cases.\nAnd as Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, warned 10,000 patients with Covid had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Day.\nSpeaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said there would likely be \"lumpiness and bumpiness\" in the rollout of vaccines.\nHe said: \"Let's be clear, this is a national challenge on a scale like nothing we've seen before and it will require an unprecedented national effort.\n\"Of course, there will be difficulties, appointments will be changed but... the Army is working hand in glove with the NHS and local councils to set up our vaccine network and using battle preparation techniques to help us keep up the pace.\" \nAlongside GPs, there will be 223 hospital sites and seven \"giant vaccination centres\" - as well as an initial 200 community pharmacies - offering jabs, Mr Johnson said.\nEveryone will have a vaccination centre within 10 miles of their home, he added, with a \"full vaccination deployment plan\" to be published on Monday.\nHe also said there would be a national booking system for vaccinations - but did not give any more details.\nBrigadier Phil Prosser, commander of military support to the vaccine delivery programme, told the news conference his team was \"embedded\" with the NHS.\nHe said his \"day job\" is to deliver combat supplies to UK forces in time of war, \"at speed in the most arduous and challenging conditions\".\nThe government has set a target to offer vaccination slots to 15 million in the top four priority groups - including all over-80s - by 15 February.\nAnd Mr Johnson said that, with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine available, he could pledge one of those groups - care home residents - would all receive their jab by the end of January.\nThe widespread rollout of the vaccine has begun in earnest with the first doses delivered during the day to family doctors for distribution.\nBut there were concerns from some GPs over supplies, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the levels of vaccine supply was the \"rate-limiting\" factor as jabs would be delivered as quickly as stock is available.\nIt comes as some hospitals in England are at risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services.\nThe latest NHS statistics also show that there were 30,370 patients with Covid in UK hospitals on Tuesday, a much higher figure than the first peak in the spring of 2020.\nHospital leaders have warned medics are becoming increasingly stretched with \"untrained staff\" used to fill gaps.\nAt 20:00 GMT, people in some streets stepped out onto doorsteps to clap for the heroes of the pandemic, following a weekly initiative which gained popularity during the UK's first lockdown.\nHowever, Thursday's clap for heroes was more muted than those seen last year, perhaps reflecting criticism the initiative had become politicised.\nLots of detail has been given about how the NHS - working hand-in-hand with the military - will be able to deliver the vaccines.\nThere will be more local vaccination centres, hospital hubs and even mass vaccination at sports stadiums.\nThousands of extra vaccinators have already been trained - and thousands more are waiting in the wings.\nBut the biggest hurdle the UK faces is vaccine supply.\nIf it is not available, it cannot be put in arms no matter how good the vaccination network is.\nIn the long-term, supply is not likely to be a problem - but in the coming weeks it could be tight.\nThere is enough vaccine in the country to offer all those at highest risk a jab by mid-February.\nBut it is not yet all ready for the NHS to use, either because the final safety checks have not been done or the vaccine has not been put into vials.\nThe former depends on lab work by the medicines regulator, while the latter is the job of a plant in Wrexham.\nEach stage takes some time. The target is achievable, but a lot has to go right.\nSir Simon Stevens said there were 50% more coronavirus patients in England's hospitals now compared to the peak last April, affecting every region across the country.\nHe said: \"That number is accelerating very, very rapidly... the pressures are real and they are growing.\"\nIn Northern Ireland, the Belfast Health Trust has said it has no other option but to cancel all of its urgent cancer surgery amid \"highly significant\" demand for bed space.\nThe cancelled operations will affect those patients for whom surgery could impact recovery and even survival, the trust said.\nIn one positive development for hospitals, two more life-saving drugs that can cut deaths by a quarter in patients who are sickest with Covid have been cleared for widespread use, with immediate effect.\nThe anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, save an extra life for every 12 treated, researchers said, following NHS trials.\nElsewhere, the UK has implemented restrictions on travellers to England from countries near South Africa to stop the spread of the South African Covid variant.\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson and Sir Simon were asked about persistent social media claims that coronavirus does not exist - and that reports of packed hospital wards of people being treated are just a myth. \nSir Simon said that such misinformation was an \"insult\" to hard-working critical care staff.\n\"There is nothing more demoralising than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it is most obviously untrue,\" he said."

      "text": "There are concerns some schools in lockdown could be inundated with pupils without laptops after a change to the vulnerable pupil list.\nPupils are learning remotely in England after schools were closed on Tuesday to all but children of key workers and those deemed vulnerable. \nBut those without laptops or space to study are now eligible to attend school, under government guidance.\nHeads' union, NAHT, said the move could reduce the effect of the shutdown.\nSchools were ordered to close to most pupils as a way of limiting the spread of the virus.\nNational Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said demand for key worker and vulnerable places in schools had risen substantially since the last school shutdown.\nNearly a third of the 2,000 head teachers who joined an online union meeting on Wednesday afternoon reported having between 20 and 30% of pupils in school, the NAHT said.\nMr Whiteman said: \"It is critical that key worker child school places are only used when absolutely necessary to truly reduce numbers and spread of the virus.\n\"We have concern that the government has not supplied enough laptops for all the children without them and so has made lack of internet access a vulnerable criteria - only adding to numbers still in school. \n\"It is important that all vulnerable pupils have access to a school place, but the government must provide laptops and internet access for every pupil that needs one, so that they can access home learning to take some of the strain off the demand for school places.\n\"Nearly half of head teachers who we polled during a webcast on Wednesday evening said that had received fewer than 10% of the laptops they'd requested. \n\"It is essential that this is rectified immediately, so that we can keep school attendance figures at a level which will have the desired impact on getting transmission rates under control.\"\nJane Girt, head teacher of Carlton Bolling College in Bradford, said the rule change could leave her having to accommodate an extra 200 pupils on top of those already on the key worker and vulnerable children list.\nShe told BBC News that having so many pupils in school would \"defeat the object\" of closing amid the England-wide lockdown.\nMrs Girt said her secondary, which has more than 1,500 students, had received 261 laptops from the government since March but about 50% of pupils were sharing a device with another family member.\nThe prime minister told MPs on Wednesday that 560,000 devices had been given out to schools in 2020 and a further 50,000 so far this week.\nAnd Gavin Williamson reiterated that those without access to remote learning via digital devices could attend school.\nHe said: \"Schools are much better prepared to deliver online learning, with the delivery of hundreds of thousands of devices at breakneck speed, data support and high quality video lessons.\"\nBut Ofcom estimates there are up to 1.5m pupils without digital devices in their homes, on which they can learn.\nAmanda Bailey, director of the child poverty commission in north-east England, said pupils without internet access tended to be concentrated in disadvantaged areas and this meant some schools would be \"largely fully open\", she said.\n\"And we know that the most deprived communities are the ones most vulnerable to the health impact of the pandemic,\" she added.\n\"Our main concerns are that we're now nine months into this situation and we're still talking about families not having sufficient access to digital devices or data or the internet.\"\nLabour Councillor Beverley Momenabadi, Wolverhampton's champion for digital innovation, said the guidance massively expands the number of children who are entitled to go into school.\nShe said although plans to support those needing access while self-isolating in her city are at an advanced stage, with rental schemes being accessed and donations sought, the new lockdown changes the game completely.\nShe called for a national plan for the transition to remote learning.\nCouncillor Momenabadi said: \"Even after Gavin Williamson's statement in the Commons, children across the country are still waiting for that national plan.\n\"And even on the devices they've said will arrive; how will these  be distributed, when will they arrive, will they arrive in time to ensure that no child misses out on their education?\"\nWill you have to send your child back to school because you are unable to supervise home learning?

Another headline in the paper calls him \"the insurrectional president\".\nIn\u00a0Turkey, the\u00a0pro-government Turkiye paper notes: \"Trump's stubbornness stirred the US\".\u00a0\n\"I expect Trump to be tried after this turmoil,\" said one pundit on Egypt's MBC Misr TV, adding that \"the US is no longer a superpower in the full sense of the word\".\nSeveral of America's adversaries\u00a0seized the opportunity to portray the incident as an example of\u00a0the country's\u00a0structural weaknesses and what they see as its hypocrisy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"@SpeakerPelosi once referred to the Hong Kong riots as 'a beautiful sight to behold'\u00a0\u2014 it remains yet to be seen whether she will say the same about the recent developments in Capitol Hill,\" tweeted China's daily Global Times.\n\"Capital vandals show fragility of US democracy,\" claimed a headline in the paper.\u00a0\nIn Iran, state TV and radio inaccurately reported that the mayor of Washington DC had imposed \"martial law\", instead of the 12-hour curfew on the capital, which is what actually happened.\u00a0\nAnd in Russia, where the first day of the Orthodox Christmas is currently being celebrated,\u00a0footage of Trump's supporters\u00a0ransacking\u00a0the Capitol dominates state TV. \nRolling\u00a0news channel Rossiya 24 has played\u00a0scenes of the violence at length, with no comment other than the caption\u00a0\"Attack on the Capitol\".\nSome channels have also shown sympathy for the pro-Trump supporters, suggesting that they had cause to feel \"cheated\" over November's presidential election, and talked up claims that the event represents a crisis for US and even Western democracy.\nRossiya 24 said they were \"dissatisfied with the most scandalous election in US history\", while Rossiya 1 said it was the US system of democracy that was \"to a large degree the cause of today's events\".\nEven for those not necessarily unfriendly to America, the incident shows serious rifts in society that Trump's departure won't address. \nIt is \"a spectacular demonstration of frustration that has been building in the USA for decades,\" says one commentator in Poland's conservative daily Rzeczpospolita. \n\"Behind the fa\u00e7ade of plastered smiles\u2026 and phrases about 'the best country in the world' lies the drama of a gigantic income gap, society in which more and more people struggle to make ends meet, while the few do not even know how many billions they own.\""

      "text": "World leaders have condemned violent scenes in Washington after supporters of US President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday.\nThe riot forced the suspension of a joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden's electoral victory.\nMany leaders called for peace and an orderly transition of power, describing what happened as \"horrifying\" and an \"attack on democracy\".\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the \"disgraceful scenes\".\n\"The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nOther UK politicians joined him in criticising the violence, with opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer calling it a \"direct attack on democracy\".\nHome Secretary Priti Patel told the BBC that Mr Trump's comments \"directly led\" to his supporters storming Congress and clashing with police. \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the scenes from the US Capitol were \"utterly horrifying\".\nIn Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said those who stormed the US legislature were \"attackers and rioters\" and that she felt \"angry and also sad\" after seeing pictures from the scene.\nShe told a meeting of German conservatives: \"I regret very much that President Trump has still not admitted defeat, but has kept raising doubts about the elections.\"\nChina meanwhile attempted to draw comparisons between the rioters who entered Congress to try and subvert the US election result and pro-democracy protesters who stormed Hong Kong's Legislative Council last year.\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying claimed events in Hong Kong were more \"severe\" than those in Washington but \"not one demonstrator died\". \nThe comparisons between the two incidents has caused outrage among Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists and their supporters. \nRussia blamed the \"archaic\" US electoral system and the politicisation of the media for Wednesday's unrest in Washington. \n\"The electoral system in the United States is archaic, it does not meet modern democratic standards, creating opportunities for numerous violations, and the American media have become an instrument of political struggle,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. \nElsewhere in Europe, a chorus of leaders condemned the scenes in Washington as an attack on democracy.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said: \"I have trust in the strength of US democracy. The new presidency of Joe Biden will overcome this tense stage, uniting the American people.\"\nIn a video on Twitter, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"When, in one of the world's oldest democracies, supporters of an outgoing president take up arms to challenge the legitimate results of an election, a universal idea - that of 'one person, one vote' - is undermined.\n\"What happened today in Washington DC is not American, definitely. We believe in the strength of our democracies. We believe in the strength of American democracy\" he added.  \nSwedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven described the incident as \"worrying\" and said it was \"an assault on democracy\". \nTop EU leaders have also made their views known. European Council President Charles Michel said he trusted the US \"to ensure a peaceful transfer of power\" to Mr Biden, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she looked forward to working with the Democrat, who \"won the election\".\nLike many other global figures, the Secretary-General of the Nato military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said that the outcome of the election \"must be respected\".\nFor his part, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres was \"saddened\" by the events at the US Capitol, his spokesman said. \nThe events also shocked America's close ally and neighbour to its north. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians were \"deeply disturbed and saddened by the attack on democracy\".\n\"Violence will never succeed in overruling the will of the people. Democracy in the US must be upheld - and it will be,\" he wrote on Twitter. \nFrom New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, tweeted that \"democracy - the right of people to exercise a vote, have their voice heard and then have that decision upheld peacefully - should never be undone by a mob\".\nMeanwhile Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia - another close US ally - condemned the \"distressing scenes\" and said he looked forward to a peaceful transfer of power.\nIn India, the world's largest democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who has enjoyed a good relationship with President Trump - said he was \"distressed to see news about rioting and violence\" in Washington.\n \"Orderly and peaceful transfer of power must continue,\" he tweeted.\nTurkey, an ally through Nato, said it invited \"all parties\" to show \"restraint and common sense\".\nThe Venezuelan government, which the US does not recognise as legitimate, said \"with this regrettable episode, the United States suffers the same thing that it has generated in other countries with its policies of aggression\".\nIn statements on Twitter, Argentina's President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and Chile's President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era also condemned the scenes in Washington. Mr Pi\u00f1era said Chile \"trusts in the solidity of US democracy to guarantee the rule of law\".\nIn Japan, one of America's closest allies and partners, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said the government hoped for a \"peaceful transfer of power\" in the United States. \nFrom Fiji, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who led a coup in 2006, also expressed outrage at the events that took place. \nAnd in Singapore, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said he had watched as the \"shocking\" scenes took place, adding: \"Its a sad day.\" "

      "text": "Protests in Washington DC led to crowds of Trump supporters breaking in and rioting throughout the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings.\nBut what is the area surrounding the Capitol building and why is it so important? \nIt's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. \nThis is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws.\nThe Hill also contains several other key sites - such as the US Supreme Court and the Library of Congress - as well as office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work.\nThe Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into.\nThis is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress.\nThe floor of the House is also where lawmakers gather for key political events, such as the annual state of the union address, when the sitting president lays out his accomplishments and priorities going forward.\nAt the heart of the US Capitol building is the Rotunda, a grand circular room.\nIts use is controlled by the House and Senate, and it has been the venue for presidential state funerals as well as for other prominent figures.\nConstruction of the US Capitol began on top of Jenkins' Hill, referred to as Capitol Hill, in 1793. It was first completed in 1800, although it's gone through several reconstructions.\nPresident George Washington selected the surrounding area - now Washington DC - to serve as the nation's capital.\nSince then, several other key buildings have been placed on the Hill to serve Congress and the Supreme Court.\nThe Capitol building had to be extended throughout the 1800s as the number of US states grew to accommodate the increasing numbers of senators and representatives.\nToday there are 100 senators (two for each state), and 435 voting members of the House of Representatives (divided up proportionally based roughly on the size of each state).\nOn top of the Capitol dome is the Statue of Freedom - a helmeted female figure on a cast-iron pedestal.\n\"The US Capitol is more than a building - it is the embodiment of American democracy and our way of life,\" the US Capitol Historical Society said in a statement following the latest siege.\nJoe Biden will be sworn in as the next US president on 20 January in front of the famous white domed Capitol building."

      "tags": "Companies,Sainsbury's,Supermarkets,Asda,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK meat industry has called for the early vaccination of workers to keep food supplies running smoothly during the coronavirus crisis.\nIt warned that absences during the pandemic, coupled with disruption at ports, could hit food supply chains.\nAn early vaccination call for supermarket staff was also made by the boss of Sainsbury's on Thursday.\nThe government said the food industry remains \"well-prepared\" to make sure people have the food they need.\nThe British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said coronavirus and disruption at ports due to new systems brought in after the Brexit transition period were \"a severe challenge to the industry and to the smooth running of the nation's food supply chain\".\nIt argued frontline workers in meat factories should get early vaccinations due to the risk of a rapid spread of the new strains of the virus among key workers.\nThe government has set out who will get vaccinated first, which starts with care home residents and the oldest and most vulnerable people.\nBut Nick Allen, chief executive of the BMPA, said it would be logical to also prioritise key workers in the food industry.\n\"As the new coronavirus variant takes hold across the whole of the UK, we are hearing widespread reports of rapidly rising absences in the food supply chain,\" he said.\nSome firms supplying supermarkets \"are seeing a tripling of staff having to take time off work through illness or enforced self-isolation\", he added.\nPressures on staff during the lockdown include illness, having to self-isolate, and childcare while some schools are closed under England's lockdown.\nDue to the specialised nature of meat production, if even a few key factory personnel such as the foreman or managers are absent, production can stop, Mr Allen said.\nEarly vaccinations should not be restricted to the meat industry, according to Mr Allen. All key workers in the food industry should get early vaccinations, he said.\nEven supermarkets themselves are having problems with absences, he suggested.\n\"The key food supply chains ought to be prioritised,\" he said. \"All food industry key workers should be prioritised [for vaccination]\".\nThe government is advised on vaccinations by a group of experts called the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nProfessor Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 Chair for the JCVI, said the committee's advice on vaccine prioritisation \"was developed with the aim of preventing as many deaths as possible.\"\n\"As the single greatest risk of death from Covid-19 is older age, prioritisation is primarily based on age,\" he said.\n\"It is estimated that vaccinating everyone in the priority groups would prevent 99% of deaths, including those associated with occupational exposure to infection,\" the professor added.\nSainsbury's boss Simon Roberts also called for early vaccinations for key workers on Thursday.\n\"My view is that priority has to be given to those that need it first,\" he said. \"Those on the frontline should be part of that as and when capacity becomes available.\"\nAbsence rates for Sainsbury's staff are lower than at the peak of the crisis, but are rising, and have stepped up in the last few days, he said.\nThe Sainsbury's absence rate is currently 8%. The business has 172,000 employees.\nAsda said that it had seen an increase in employees self-isolating and shielding in line with the rising UK infection rate.\nHowever, it said that absence rates were still lower than at the peak of the pandemic.\n\"We are taking proactive steps to manage colleague absences by retaining temporary colleagues hired over the Christmas period and are bringing in additional temporary colleagues in those stores that need them the most,\" and Asda spokesman said.\nTesco has asked clinically vulnerable staff to stay at home.\nMorrisons, meanwhile, is also seeing more absences, but the rate is still more than half that of the peak of the pandemic. It is also a bigger business having taken on 26,000 extra staff during the crisis.\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium said: \"While absence rates are currently rising, retailers are closely monitoring the situation in stores and distribution centres and supply chains continue to run smoothly.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs said: \"As we have seen in recent months, the UK has a large, diverse and highly resilient food supply chain.\n\"We continue to closely monitor the situation and are working closely with the food industry on the workforce and absence related challenges presented by the pandemic.\"\nThey added that the food industry remains \"well-prepared\" to make sure people across the country have the food they need.\nUK ports have seen disruption due to the effects of coronavirus on trade and new systems brought in after the Brexit transition period.\nMr Roberts of Sainsbury's said that, so far, the flow of goods from Europe is in decent shape, but there had been some problems in sending food to Northern Ireland.There is still some backlog in general merchandising, he added.\nHowever, Scottish seafood exporters warned on Thursday that they had been hit by the \"perfect storm of Brexit disruption\".\n\"Weakened by Covid-19, and the closure of the French border before Christmas, the end of the Brexit transition period has unleashed layer upon layer of administrative problems, resulting in queues, border refusals and utter confusion,\" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland.\nShe said IT problems in France meant consignments were diverted from Boulogne-sur-Mer to Dunkirk, \"which was unprepared as it wasn't supposed to be at the export frontline.\"\nThere have also been IT issues on the UK side with HMRC, she added.\n\"These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets,\" she said. \"They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition. If the window closes these consignments go to landfill.\"\nThe National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations also warned of delays to fish exports due to \"a brick wall of bureaucracy\"."

      "tags": "NI Health,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Belfast Health Trust has said it has no other option but to cancel urgent cancer surgery. \nThese are known as red flag cancer cases where an operation is expected to impact on a person's recovery and even surviving the disease. \nThe Department of Health has confirmed to the BBC that it's estimated that one in 60 people in NI have Covid-19.\nIt is understood the trust expects \"many 100s\" of new Covid patients in the next three weeks.\nThe demand for bed space is described as \"highly significant\", while a source added that all is being done to \"find beds and staff\". \nThey continued: \"People in here are moving heaven and earth to find beds in anticipation of what is coming and that's why some cancer patients even those who have been told their case is urgent are having their surgery cancelled.\" \nEffectively the move means that choices are already being made within the health service about who should receive critical treatment. \nThe daughter of a 66-year-old woman who was told her surgery has been cancelled has described the move as \"deeply worrying\". \n\"Mummy was diagnosed with cancer of the lining of the bladder in November, it's since spread to the muscle wall of her bladder. She was told in December her surgery was urgent - but now it's been cancelled.\n\"She is so frightened, it is just horrendous and I'm sure mum is not alone.\"   \nWhile a cancer patient might have been told their case is critical and that treatment is necessary within weeks,  some Covid patients are also being told that in order to survive they require treatment immediately.   \nWith the number of cases soaring this is worse than the first lockdown and according to health professionals there is worse to come. \nThe BBC understands that the health minister is expected to respond to the problem in the coming days.\nIt is hoped that he will announce a regional approach to tackling cancelled surgeries among the various health trusts. \nNorthern Ireland's other health trusts have also begun to cancel operations due to pressures created by coronavirus.\nThe Northern, Western, Southern and South-Eastern trusts have said they will be cancelling planned surgeries.\nHospitals have said they were facing a surge in coronavirus cases following Christmas.\nOn Thursday, 599 people were in hospital with Covid-19.\nThe Belfast Trust apologised for the \"distress\" caused by the cancellations. \n\"Belfast Trust has made the difficult decision to cancel all planned inpatient surgery this week due to rising numbers of Covid cases,\" a spokesperson said.\nThe trust said it was contacting those affected and \"will rearrange this surgery as soon as possible and we will do everything we can to ensure continuity of care throughout this challenging time\".\nThe Northern Trust said it had \"regrettably\" cancelled the majority of its planned or elective surgeries to \"both free up staff to support the significant COVID-19 surge experience in the Trust and to reduce the clinical risk to patients who are or may be exposed to the virus\".\nIt apologised and said it would contacting people.\nThe Western Trust said it is \"facing unprecedented pressures due to the escalating rate\" of Covid infections.\nDirector of Acute Hospitals, Geraldine McKay, said routine elective inpatient, outpatient and day case surgeries have now been postponed until further notice.\nShe said the decision was \"very regrettable, but necessary\".\n\"Red flag and some time critical procedures and clinics will continue, but will be reviewed daily,\" she said.\nShould the number of Covid patients further increase, she added, the trust will \"have no option but to move to perform emergency and trauma surgery only\".\nA spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust said it was still carrying out some planned surgery, but the majority would be cancelled by next week.\nThe Southern Trust said it had taken its decision in response to the \"very significant recent increase\" in the number of Covid-19 cases. \nIt said this had been compounded by an increase in trauma workload and recent icy weather. \nThe trust said it would continue to provide day surgery and endoscopy across its hospital sites. \nOf the 3,359 planned procedures scheduled across NI between 29 December 2020 and 4 January, 3,267 went ahead as planned, according to the Health and Social Care website.\nThere were 92 cancellations which amounted to about 3% of all surgeries."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday morning.\nThe vaccine rollout is a national challenge requiring an unprecedented effort involving the armed forces, Boris Johnson has said. At a Downing Street press briefing, the PM confirmed almost 1.5 million people in the UK have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. More than 1,000 GP-led sites in England will be able to offer a total of \"hundreds of thousands\" of jabs each day by 15 January, he said. The Army will use \"battle preparation techniques\" to help achieve that goal. It comes as GPs in England began receiving doses of the Oxford Covid jab.\nThere are currently about 26,500 Covid patients in hospitals across England, meaning almost a third of all people in hospital have the virus. In London, half of all hospital patients have Covid. It means some hospitals in England are at risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising virus admissions forcing trusts to cut back on other services such as routine operations and cancer care. It comes amid warnings from epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson that the coronavirus situation in the UK is, in some ways, bleaker than it was in March before the first lockdown. So how busy are England's hospitals? \nThere are concerns some schools in lockdown could be inundated with pupils without laptops after a change to the vulnerable pupil list. Pupils are learning remotely in England after schools were closed on Tuesday to all but children of key workers and those deemed vulnerable. But those without laptops or space to study at home are now eligible to attend school, under government guidance. It comes as some parents say they feel \"deserted\" having to home school-during lockdown with a lack of access to computers.\nIt's been an extremely challenging time for most businesses, but there was good news for Sainsbury's as it reported a bumper Christmas with sales up 9.3% for the festive trading period. However, the outlook is bleaker for others in the business sector, with the owner of pub chains Harvester and Toby Carvery saying it may need to raise more cash to survive lockdown. Meanwhile, National Express announced that it is suspending its entire national network of coach services from midnight on Sunday, while Ryanair is making big cuts to its flight schedule in response to the latest lockdowns. \nAs well as the rolling out of vaccines, there's been more good news in the fight against Covid with the discovery of two more life-saving drugs. The anti-inflammatory medications, given via a drip, can cut Covid deaths by a quarter in patients who are sickest, say researchers who have carried out a trial in NHS intensive care units. Supplies are already available across the UK so they can be used immediately to save hundreds of lives, say experts. The drugs - tocilizumab and sarilumab - also speed up patients' recovery and reduce the length of time that critically-ill patients need to spend in intensive care by about a week.\nGet a longer news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.    \nPlus, the rules about lockdown do vary across the UK.

      "text": "British Gas engineers have begun a five-day strike from Thursday in a dispute over new contracts.\nThousands of staff have walked out in response to an attempt by the firm to push through pay cuts by threatening to fire workers, union GMB said.\nIt accused Centrica owner British Gas of provoking the strike.\nCentrica said it had done everything it could to avoid a strike, adding it would prioritise vulnerable households and emergencies during the walkout.\nJustin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said: \"GMB members from Land's End to John O'Groats have stayed home, stayed safe and supported the first national gas strike in a decade.\n\"The months and months of fire and rehire pay cut threats from British Gas CEO Chris O'Shea have provoked thousands and thousands of GMB engineers and call centre staff to strike, the only option left to them by a business that made \u00a3901m operating profit yet still plans to sack them because they won't accept the scale of cuts it demands,\" he added.\nSome British Gas workers have taken to social media to voice their support for the strike.\nA Centrica spokeswoman said: \"We've done everything we can with the GMB to avoid industrial action.\n\"While we've made great progress with our other unions, sadly the GMB leadership seems intent on causing disruption to customers during the coldest weekend of the year, amid a global health crisis and in the middle of a national lockdown,\" she said.\n\"We have strong contingency plans in place to ensure we will still be there for customers who really need us.\"\nAlmost 90% of GMB members voted for industrial action in a ballot of 9,000 members last month in response to an attempt by Centrica to cut some salaries by up to 10%, the union said.\nIn total, more than 7,500 staff could walk out, although Centrica said GMB had committed to ensure emergency callouts were not affected, adding that it also had contractors that it could call upon.\nIn June, Centrica said it planned to to cut around 5,000 jobs to \"arrest the decline\" of the company.\nIt has been losing customers to rivals and, in February last year, blamed a big loss in 2019 on the energy price cap and falling gas prices. Centrica has since said the coronavirus crisis has shown how the company could be \"agile and responsive\".\nCommenting on the strike, Centrica said 83% of workers had already accepted its new terms and conditions, which it said protected base pay and pensions.\n\"This shows most of our people understand that our business needs to change because customer needs are changing,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\"GMB's mandate for strike action is weak; they are fighting against modernisation and changes which will help to protect well-paid jobs in the long-term and are doing so at a time that our country needs everyone to pull together.\""

      "tags": "Gavin Williamson,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.\nHe told MPs he would \"trust in teachers rather than algorithms\", a reference to the U-turn over last year's exams.\nFor primaries, he confirmed there would be no Year 6 Sats tests this year.\nMr Williamson promised parents it would be \"mandatory\" for schools to provide \"high-quality remote education\" of three to five hours per day.\nHe said this would be \"enforced\" by Ofsted, with inspections where there were \"serious concerns\" about what was provided for children now studying at home.\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary, Kate Green, accused Mr Williamson of \"chaos and confusion\" - and said he had failed to listen to the \"expertise of professionals on the front line\". \nShe said he had given a \"cast-iron commitment\" that exams would go ahead - and Ms Green said: \"At that moment, we should have known they were doomed to be cancelled.\"\nMr Williamson, in a statement to the House of Commons, said there would be \"training and support\" for teachers in estimating grades, \"to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently\".\nHe also told MPs there would be no Sats tests for those at the end of primary school.\n\"I can absolutely confirm that we won't be proceeding with Sats this year. We do recognise that this will be an additional burden on schools \nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said rather than a \"vague statement\" of how A-levels and GCSEs would be graded, ministers should already have a system ready in place - and it was a \"dereliction of duty\" that it was not already prepared.\nAnd he warned against repeating the \"shambles\" of last summer's cancelled exams.\nThe education secretary confirmed to MPs that GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown.\nThe exams watchdog Ofqual will draw up proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, for qualifications that could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places.\nSimon Lebus, the watchdog's interim head, said evidence for replacement grades could include tests, homework, mock exams and teachers' observations - and would take into account how much of the syllabus had been covered.\nA consultation is expected to begin next week, with plans to be decided by the end of February or possibly sooner.\nLast year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades.\nAnd without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' assessments, with some process of moderation between schools, will be used for this summer's candidates.\nOn vocational qualifications, Labour's Ms Green said the education secretary was \"failing to show leadership on exams in January\".\nVocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them - but college leaders had complained that there needed to be a national decision to avoid confusion.\nIf students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will still be awarded a grade, if they have \"enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression\", says the awarding body Pearson.\nAn Ofqual spokeswoman said they would consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, \"to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances\".\nThe exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades.\nMr Williamson's statement in the Commons came as all GCSE, AS and A-level exams in Northern Ireland were  cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday.\nScotland has already cancelled its Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers.\nGCSEs  and A-levels in Wales were scrapped in November."

      "text": "Violent supporters of President Donald Trump have breached the Capitol in Washington, as lawmakers met to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's poll win.\nIn dramatic scenes, demonstrators swarmed the building as Congress members were escorted out by police.\nMr Biden said it was an \"insurrection\", and Mr Trump released a video message asking supporters to go home.\nThe joint session of Congress certifying Mr Biden's win has been suspended and forced into recess.\nThere are reports of guns drawn in the building and at least one person shot. A woman was reported to be in a critical condition and several police were injured.\nThere has been an armed confrontation at the doors of the House of Representatives. Tear gas has also been used.\nRioters were seen marching through the building chanting \"We want Trump\" and one was photographed in the Senate president's chair.\nWashington police said it was clear the crowd was intent on using chemical irritants to force entry to the building.\nAfter an occupation lasting several hours, the sergeant-at-arms - the executive office of the Senate - announced that the building had been secured by law enforcement.\nBut there is little sign that the protesters are obeying Mr Trump's call to go home, despite a citywide curfew declared by the city mayor from 18:00 to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT).\nMr Trump recorded a video message on Twitter calling on supporters to leave the Capitol, but continuing to make unsubstantiated claims that Democrats had stolen the election.\n\"I know your pain, I know you're hurt,\" he said. \"You have to go home now, we have to have peace... we don't want anybody hurt.\"\nMr Biden said the demonstration \"borders on sedition and it must end now\".\n\"At this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault,\" he said.\nPolitical figures across the world expressed shock. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned \"disgraceful scenes\" and called for a \"peaceful and orderly transfer of power\".\nMr Trump's spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, tweeted that the National Guard was being deployed.\nTroops and police have also been mobilised in neighbouring states, and the FBI has been deployed to help Capitol police.\nThere are also reports of protests at state legislatures around the country.\nBy Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Washington\nOn the steps of Capitol Hill, hundreds of loyal Trump supporters are packed closely together, as nearby armed police officers keep a watchful eye.\nThe mood here is tense and defiant.\n\"We're not [expletive] Antifa!\" one man screams at the police, referring to the loose coalition of \"anti-fascist\" activists that oppose Mr Trump.\nTrump loyalists near him wave placards that say \"show us the ballots\".\n\"All we want is for the Capitol police to stand down, and surrender the building to us,\" says one man to news cameras, as he is filmed by other Trump supporters.\nThe conviction here is that the election was stolen from President Trump, and the lawmakers inside the building should do their duty and somehow award the election to him.\nNever mind that election officials have certified the results and the courts have thrown out Trump campaign lawsuits alleging fraud because there's no evidence.\nIt's a siege mentality here, as word spreads through the crowd that the National Guard is on its way to the Capitol.\nA joint session of Congress was being held to certify Mr Biden's election victory on 3 November.\nThe proceedings are usually brief and ceremonial but Republican lawmakers have been objecting to some results.\nFor days Mr Trump had also been putting pressure on Mr Pence, who is presiding over the session, to block certification of the result.\nBut in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said that he had no \"unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted\".\nThe protesters arrived at the Capitol from a \"Save America Rally\", where Mr Trump had urged them to support those legislators opposing Mr Biden's confirmation.\nMr Trump has refused to concede the 3 November election, repeatedly alleging fraud without providing any evidence.\nOn Wednesday, he said again: \"We will never give up. We will never concede.\"\nHe has also tried to throw doubt on the integrity of Tuesday's Senate run-off votes in the southern, traditionally Republican, state of Georgia. Projections by US TV networks suggest the Democrats have won one of the seats and are neck-and-neck for the second seat.\nIf the Democrats win both they will gain effective control of the Senate - something that will help Mr Biden push forward his agenda after he is inaugurated as president on 20 January."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Birmingham,Coronavirus testing,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "GPs in England are receiving doses of the Oxford Covid jab as medics warn about overstretched hospitals.\nThe rollout of the Oxford vaccine is part of the NHS's biggest-ever effort and aims to offer jabs to 13 million by mid-February - including all over-80s.\nBut Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted vaccine supply was a \"rate-limiting\" factor.\nBirmingham's NHS said there are enough supplies with more to come as politicians warned doses may run out.\nSome hospitals in England are at risk of becoming Covid-only sites, with rising admissions for the virus forcing trusts to cut back on other services.\nAnd hospital leaders have warned medics are becoming increasingly stretched with \"untrained staff\" used to fill gaps.\nIt came as a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities - and 52,618 new cases.\nThe latest NHS statistics also show that there were 30,370 patients with Covid in UK hospitals on Tuesday.\nThe rollout of the Oxford vaccine to GPs will help increase vaccinations among the top four priority groups who are first in line to receive doses.\nThe Department of Health said 1.3 million people in the UK, including almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England, have received at least one dose so far.\nWriting to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Birmingham political leaders criticised communication around the vaccination programme in the city.\n\"We acknowledge that the vaccination rollout is in its early days, but we have also learned today that Birmingham has not yet been supplied with any AstraZeneca stock, while current Pfizer stocks are scheduled to run out on Friday this week with currently no clarity on when further supplies will arrive.\"\nThey added \"it remains unclear who is responsible for overseeing the vaccination programme in Birmingham, and whom we should hold accountable for progress and delivery\".\nThe letter is signed by Labour leader of Birmingham City Council, Ian Ward; Liam Byrne MP, Labour's candidate for the West Midlands mayor, and by Conservative MP and ex-minister Andrew Mitchell.\nBut NHS Birmingham and Solihull told the BBC: \"Thousands of people in Birmingham and Solihull have already been vaccinated and this continues at pace. \n\"We have sufficient supplies and more will be coming.\"\nWest Midlands mayor Andy Street said he has been assured supplies of the Oxford vaccine will be delivered to Birmingham on Friday.\nElsewhere, Gillian McLauchlan, deputy director of public health at Salford Council, described \"teething\" issues with the vaccine rollout there.\nShe told councillors at a local scrutiny committee: \"We have no control over vaccine supplies. We are told literally two days in advance 'your next lot of vaccines are coming'.\"\nEngland's vaccination programme is described as the biggest in NHS history, with an aim to offer jabs to most care home residents by the end of January and the most vulnerable by mid-February.\nOfficials leading the vaccination programme are adamant rollout is going to plan - and are cautioning against judging performance too early.\nOf course, there will be teething problems, but the fact remains the UK has vaccinated more per head of population than any other country apart from Israel and Bahrain.\nWhile rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine started on Monday, it was actually only being used at the hospital hubs up to Thursday.\nDeliveries are now being made to hundreds of local vaccination centres. There are 17 in the Birmingham region so they should start to receive doses imminently.\nThat should mean there is a vaccine available if they do run out of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.\nAlthough disruption to the rollout of the programme in the city may still happen as local centres are warning they cannot book patients in until they know they have stock available.\nBut the fact the city's leaders felt compelled to write to the health secretary to warn about this is an illustration of the pressure in the system at the moment.\nGiven the high level of infections and current lockdown, there is a desperation in all quarters to get the most at-risk vaccinated as quickly as possible.\nAnd until the nation sees that translate into significant numbers of people getting vaccinated - 2 million a week is the goal - people will remain on edge.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for emergency use on 2 December but requires specialist storage unsuitable for most GP practices, with doses largely delivered in hospitals.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca jab was approved on 30 December and does not require specialist storage. It was first rolled out on Monday to hospitals and to GPs in England from Thursday.\nMr Hancock visited a GP surgery in London to promote the roll out earlier - but staff there said delivery of the Oxford vaccine had been delayed.\nThe health secretary said he was \"delighted\" care home residents would begin receiving their first Oxford jabs from GPs this week.\n\"This will ensure the most vulnerable are protected and will save tens of thousands of lives,\" he said.\nGP Ammara Hughes, a partner at Bloomsbury Surgery, told broadcasters its first delivery of the Oxford jab had been pushed back 24 hours to Thursday.\nShe said: \"It's just more frustrating than a concern because we've got the capacity to vaccinate. And if we had a regular supply - we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week.\"\nMr Hancock described supply of vaccine as a \"rate-limiting\" step.\nHe said: \"For the first three days with the Oxford vaccine we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well and it's working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed.\n\"The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We're working with the companies - both Pfizer and AstraZeneca - to increase the supply.\"\nMore than 700 local vaccination sites will administer jabs, with the government announcing a further seven mass vaccination sites across England.\nAnother 180 GP-led sites, 100 new hospital sites and a pilot scheme involving local pharmacies will open this week.\nMeanwhile, nearly 19,981 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab - which was the first to be approved for emergency use in the UK last month - were administered between 29 December and 3 January, NHS England said.\nIt came as Rupert Pearse, professor of intensive care medicine and a consultant at the Royal London, said his own intensive care staff are having to care for far more sick patients.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there would usually be a ratio of one fully-trained intensive care nurse for each patient in a unit but staff are becoming increasingly stretched.\n\"Right now we are diluting down to one [intensive care] nurse to three [patients] and filling those gaps with untrained staff and in some instances doctors helping nurses deliver their care... and we're even facing diluting that further to one in four,\" he said.\nAll of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown, and vaccinations are progressing across the devolved nations."

      "text": "Childcare organisations are demanding to see evidence that it is safe for them to remain open while schools and colleges have closed to most pupils.\nStaff have close contact with children and babies daily, when they change nappies and receive them by the hand from parents, for example.\nMinisters have insisted early years settings are safe as young children have very low rates of the virus. \nNurseries argue the evidence cited is based on data about old variant Covid.\nEngland's three main nursery organisations, the Early Years Alliance, the National Day Nurseries Association and childminders' group, Pacey, have joined together to mount a #ProtectEarlyYears campaign. \nThey want the government to provide clear scientific evidence on the risks to early years staff of staying open, particularly in light of the increased transmissibility of the new variant of Covid-19.\nSue Cardy, owner and manager of Ready Teddy Go Pre School, in Shoeburyness, Essex said: \"There isn't anyone who has asked: 'Is it 100% safe for us to remain fully open? No one can see the virus and staff may be asymptomatic, and so we all run an element of risk of catching or spreading it.\"\nShe added: \"Staff have families and are not all young... 50% of my staff are over 50 and some have underlying medical conditions.\"\nVicky, the manager of a church pre-school in Cheshire West and Chester said she could potentially have 30 children plus 10 staff in a church hall, with no PPE recommended, and limited social distancing.\n\"As an early years provider, I am increasingly worried about the safety of both staff and children, yet if we chose to partially close, we could be financially penalised.\"\nAnd Georgie Morrell from Brighton and Hove said: \"Since re-opening, I have had four households tell me. they are Covid positive. \n\"This is clearly very close to home and yet we have been given no choice or support but to remain open and carry on.\"\nNeil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: \"It is simply not acceptable that, at the height of a global pandemic, early years providers are being asked to work with no support, no protection and no clear evidence that is safe for them to do so. \n\"We know how vital access to early education and care is to many families, but it cannot be right to ask the early years workforce to put themselves at risk. That is why it is vital that the government takes the urgent steps needed to safeguard those working in the sector, particularly mass testing and priority access to vaccinations. \nNursery providers are calling for staff to be tested, priority for vaccination and for state funding lost due to lower numbers during the pandemic, to be replaced by government. \nPurnima Tanuku, chief Executive of National Day Nurseries Association, said nurseries were determined to support families during the current lockdown.\nBut, she added: \"Time and again, whether it's on PPE, cleaning costs, testing or staffing, early years providers have been overlooked by the Department for Education. \n\"Now, they are the only part of the education sector fully open to all children and must be given priority.\"\nOn Wednesday, vaccines minister Nadim Zahawi said there was very little risk to younger children.\n\"The nursery sector has taken tremendous care in making sure the premises are also Covid safe. It is the right thing to do.\"\nThe Department for Education is yet to comment on the #ProtectEarlyYears demands."

      "text": "US President-elect Joe Biden has blasted the \"insurrection\" of pro-Trump supporters who stormed the US Congress in a riot that saw a woman shot dead.\nThe Democrat demanded outgoing President Donald Trump \"step up\" and repudiate the violence.\nMr Trump, who had urged the demonstrators to march on the Capitol, later called on them to \"go home\".\nA joint session of Congress confirming Mr Biden's election win has resumed after it was suspended by the mayhem.\nUS Vice-President Mike Pence started the session on Wednesday evening, saying it had been a \"dark day in the history of the United States Capitol\".\nEarlier, the protesters fought their way past police into the complex, shouting and waving Trump and US flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned.\nIn stunning scenes beamed around the world, the invasion sent members of Congress scrambling for cover under their seats as a gunshot rang out and tear gas was fired in the Capitol Rotunda.\nA female civilian who was shot inside the US Capitol during the chaos has died, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department said. \nFederal law enforcement official said two suspected explosive devices were found and were both rendered safe by the FBI and Capitol Hill police.\nThe rampage came as two Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia, which shifted the balance of Congress to their party's effective political control, aiding the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated on 20 January.\nThe Democrat, who defeated the Republican president in November's White House election, said the protesters' activity \"borders on sedition\".\nSpeaking from Wilmington, Delaware, he also said democracy was \"under unprecedented assault\".\n\"I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfil his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege,\" he said.\n\"To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices on the floor of the United States Senate, rummaging through desks, on the House of Representatives, threatening the safety of duly elected officials.\n\"It's not protest; it's insurrection.\"\nMr Trump responded in a recorded video on Twitter, repeating his unproven claims of election fraud.\n\"I know your pain. I know you're hurt,\" said the president.\n\"We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. \n\"But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.\"\nFor the first time, Twitter froze Mr Trump's account. The social media company announced it would keep the account locked for 12 hours, demanding he delete three tweets that it said could stoke violence and threatening \"permanent suspension\". Facebook and Instagram followed suit.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump addressed a \"Save America Rally\" outside the White House.\nHe had urged supporters to head to the Capitol and said: \"Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore.\"\nLittle is known about the woman who died, but disturbing footage from the scene shows her slumped on the ground with blood on her face. Police have not yet released her identity and it is unclear who fired the shot. \nLocal US media have named her as a San Diego-area US Air Force veteran and Trump supporter, Ashli Babbitt. \nThe protesters surged up the Capitol steps at around 14:15 local time (19:15 GMT), shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building.\nThe mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee.\nThey marched through the building shouting \"Where are they?\" and chanting \"We want Trump\".\nOne climbed on to the Senate dais and shouted: \"Trump won that election.\" Another protester was photographed sitting in House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office with a foot on the table.\nPolice with guns drawn piled furniture against the doors of the House chamber to keep protesters out.\nMembers of Congress - including Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, who is a senator - were told to evacuate the building.\nSeveral thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police.\nAfter an occupation lasting several hours, the sergeant-at-arms - the executive office of the Senate - announced that the building had been secured by law enforcement. \nBut there was little sign the protesters were heeding Mr Trump's call to go home, despite a citywide curfew declared by the city mayor from 18:00 to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT).\nMeanwhile, a suspicious device was found outside the Republican National Committee's headquarters, near the Capitol complex, and it was detonated by a bomb squad.\nWashington DC Metropolitan Police said five guns were seized. At least 13 people were arrested.\nThere were also protests at state legislatures in Kansas, Georgia, Utah and on the other side of the country in Oregon and the north-western state of Washington.\nBy Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Washington\nOn the steps of Capitol Hill, hundreds of loyal Trump supporters were packed closely together, as nearby armed police officers kept a watchful eye.\nThe mood was tense and defiant.\n\"We're not [expletive] Antifa!\" one man screamed at the police, referring to the loose coalition of \"anti-fascist\" activists that oppose Mr Trump.\nTrump loyalists near him waved placards that said \"show us the ballots\".\n\"All we want is for the Capitol police to stand down, and surrender the building to us,\" said one man to news cameras, as he was filmed by other Trump supporters.\nThe conviction was that the election was stolen from President Trump, and the lawmakers inside the building should do their duty and somehow award the election to him.\nNever mind that election officials have certified the results and the courts have thrown out Trump campaign lawsuits alleging fraud because there's no evidence.\nA joint session of Congress was being held to certify Mr Biden's election victory on 3 November.\nThe proceedings are usually brief and ceremonial but Republican lawmakers have been objecting to some results.\nFor days Mr Trump had also been piling pressure on Mr Pence, who was presiding over the session, to block certification of the result. \"Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!\" the president tweeted on Wednesday.\nBut in a letter to Congress, Mr Pence said that he had no \"unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted\".\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor.\nThe Kentucky senator warned: \"If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.\"\nAfter the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as \"rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists\".\nHe said the president \"bears a great deal of the blame\". \nSenator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her bid for election in Georgia's vote on Tuesday, said she could no longer in good conscience vote against certification as she had originally planned, citing the \"abhorrent\" invasion of the Capitol.\nPolitical figures across the world expressed shock. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned \"disgraceful scenes\" and called for a \"peaceful and orderly transfer of power\".\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said: \"Trump and his supporters must accept the decision of American voters at last and stop trampling on democracy.\" \nAnd former US President George W Bush said in a statement: \"It is a sickening & heartbreaking sight. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic - not our democratic republic.\"\nFormer President Barack Obama said in a statement that history would rightly remember the assault on the Capitol as \"as a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation\"."
