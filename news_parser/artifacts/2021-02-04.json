      "text": "The UK government was told the suspect in the death of Harry Dunn was a \"spouse with no official role\", the prime minister's spokesman said.\nMr Dunn, 19, died near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire in 2019.\nAnne Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity, and a court has heard she was employed by an intelligence agency in the US at the time of the fatal crash.\nMrs Sacoolas was charged with causing death by dangerous driving, but the US denied an extradition request.\nOn Thursday, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman told reporters: \"We don't comment on intelligence matters.\"\nBut he added: \"She was notified to the UK Government by the US as a spouse with no official role.\"\nThe comments about Mrs Sacoolas' intelligence role were made at a court in Virginia, where an application to dismiss a civil claim for damages submitted by Mr Dunn's family is being heard.\nThe court heard her work was \"especially a factor\" in her leaving the UK and she feared she would \"not get a fair trial\" if she returned.\nWhen asked by the judge why Mrs Sacoolas had \"fled\" the UK, her barrister John McGavin said he could not respond \"completely candidly\".\n\"I know the answer but I cannot disclose it,\" he said.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Mr Dunn's family's spokesman Radd Seiger called on the UK government to \"urgently reinvestigate\" whether Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity.\nUnder the agreements at RAF Croughton dating back to 1995, anyone working at the base from the US as part of the \"administrative and technical staff\" would have their immunity pre-waived, meaning they would not be immune from criminal jurisdiction.\nCommenting on the latest developments, the prime minister's spokesman said: \"I would emphasise that our position on this case remains unchanged, we have consistently called for her diplomatic immunity to be waived and believe that the US refusal to extradite her amounts to a denial of justice.\"\nUS State Department spokesman Ned Price said the department had been \"closely engaged with the UK government, and we have been transparent about our positions on legal and diplomatic matters\" concerning the crash.\nHe added that Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity because she was \"the spouse of an accredited staff member of the US Embassy office\" at the time of crash.\nMeanwhile, Labour has urged Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to go before MPs on Friday to \"explain himself\".\nShadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"Dominic Raab told MPs that [Mrs Sacoolas] she was entitled to protection as the spouse of an employee, but new information provided by her lawyer clearly indicates that she wasn't.\n\"Did the foreign secretary simply accept the US Embassy's account without asking any of the right questions on behalf of a UK citizen, or has he misled the House?\"\nA spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: \"The UK High Court has found that Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity while in the country under the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Germany,Portugal,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The sight of a German military plane touching down in Lisbon on Wednesday, carrying intensive care specialists and ventilators to help save lives in Portugal's embattled hospitals, recalls the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe. \nLast spring, when Italy was overwhelmed by the first wave of infections, it was helped out by several other European countries taking in patients - even if many Italians felt it was too little, too late.\nNow, almost a year on, it is Portugal's turn. \nThe country's national health service is overwhelmed. There's a shortage of beds and specialist nurses, and in one hospital last week, potentially life-threatening problems in an overburdened oxygen system.\nPortugal got off relatively lightly in that first wave, although it later caught up in terms of confirmed cases relative to population. \nNow, though, the situation here is dramatically worse, with a giant third wave in January that has seen the country top global rankings for new cases and deaths associated with Covid-19. \nDaily new cases have recently been around 10 times their peak of last spring, and January accounted for 45% of all coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began.\nThe lockdown imposed in mainland Portugal on 15 January does now seem to be reducing the transmission rate, but there is still a huge number of active cases.\n\"However low the R [rate] is, if the number of cases is high it is very difficult to get them down,\" said Ricardo Mexia, president of the Portuguese Association of Public Health Doctors. \"That's the problem now.\"\nActive cases: 164,513\nHospital cases: 6,684; Intensive care: 877\nDeaths: 13,257\nTotal number of vaccine doses (1st and 2nd): 350,945\nPortuguese population: 10.3 million\nSource: DGS/Publico, 3 February 2021\nRicardo Mexia blamed the January surge mainly on the decision to ease coronavirus restrictions over Christmas, although he also noted the rapid spread of the UK variant that had brought significantly more younger patients into hospital with Covid-19.\nThe government, for its part, cited that more contagious variant, which now predominates among new cases, as its main reason for imposing a full lockdown.\nIn a sign of how fluid the situation is, just days after that announcement, it backtracked on its pledge to keep schools open, instead suspending face-to-face classes. With no date for schools to reopen, remote learning is to start up from 8 February.\nMeanwhile, the number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 continues to set new records and is currently more than five times the peak of last spring.\nWith barely half a dozen intensive care beds free in Portugal, the issue is not so much a lack of beds as shortages of specialist staff and equipment. \nThe medical staff, 50 ventilators and 150 beds flown in from Germany will help, but it merely highlights the tens of thousands of Portuguese nurses - including many specialists - who have emigrated in recent years.\nThe situation is most acute in the Lisbon region, which is seeing around half of new cases and where hospitals have been struggling.\nA hospital in Amadora, just north of the capital, last week had to hurriedly transfer dozens of patients to other units in the region because of its overloaded oxygen network. \nAcross the River Tagus, ambulances this past weekend queued for more than 12 hours outside the main hospital in Almada, as its emergency department struggled with the flood of patients. Civil defence forces have since set up triage tents to free up ambulances.\nPrime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa visited a Lisbon health centre on Wednesday to mark the start of vaccinations for people aged 80 and over who are not living in care homes. But that was later overshadowed by the resignation by the head of the vaccination taskforce.\nAlthough Mr Costa has insisted that lockdown is now paying off, the minister of health, Marta Temido, has warned the public that the crisis is far from over.\n\"This will be another week with a lot of pressure in terms of admissions and the next two weeks will probably be very difficult where intensive care is concerned,\" she said."

      "tags": "Robert Jenrick,Boris Johnson,COP26,Climate change,Whitehaven",
      "text": "Dozens of environmental groups have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for a public inquiry into plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria.  \nThey say it is \"mystifying\" that No 10 has not stopped the mine from going ahead, when the UK is hosting the COP26 climate summit later this year.\nA top climate scientist has warned the PM risks \"humiliation\" over the plans.\nNo 10 said the UK is a world leader in climate policy and it would not reverse the decision.\nThe letter, signed by groups including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Cumbria Wildlife Trust, criticises the decision not to intervene in the approval of the mine, when the UK's credibility - as summit host - is \"at stake\".\nThe letter to Mr Johnson describes the summit, which takes place in Glasgow in November, as \"the largest global climate talks since the signing of the Paris Agreement\".\nThe signatories acknowledge that whilst \"new jobs need to be created\", the government should \"lead the way with low-carbon technologies, rather than looking to the polluting industries of the past\".\nThe \u00a3165m West Cumbria Mining plan in Whitehaven was approved by Cumbria County Council in October. It would be the UK's first deep coal mine in 30 years.\nThe council said the government could have \"called in\" the plans for a public inquiry, but had chosen not to do so.\nIn an interview with the BBC, the local mayor welcomed the proposals.\nMike Starkie, the Conservative mayor of Copeland Borough Council, said: \"I think the project is absolutely fantastic, it'll bring huge amounts of jobs and prosperity into the area.  \n\"It's been broadly welcomed across Copeland. I've never known a project that has carried so much public support.\"\nBut the campaigners say \"time is of the essence\" for the government to act, before Cumbria County Council issues its final decision on the mine \"very soon\".\nIn the letter, they urge Robert Jenrick, the secretary of state for Housing, Communities and Local Government, to refer the plans to a public inquiry.\nThey write: \"Reversing this decision would help restore confidence in the UK government's climate leadership both internationally and at home.\"\nStanley Johnson, the prime minister's father, told the BBC it was a \"massive mistake in public relations terms\".\nHe said: \"How can we ask other countries to bring in their climate change reduction programmes when we are now reopening the whole coal argument here in Britain?\"\nIt comes as Dr James Hansen, formerly Nasa's leading global warming researcher, urged Mr Johnson in a letter to halt production of the mine - or risk being \"vilified\".\nDowning Street has previously defended the decision over the mine as a local planning matter and insisted the UK is cutting emissions faster than any major economy and would end the use of coal for electricity by 2025.\nJustin Rowlatt, the BBC's chief environment correspondent, says when it comes to decarbonisation, the UK is a world leader.\nOur correspondent says the UK's coal consumption has decreased by 90% in the last five years and just four power stations still burn coal.\nDr Hansen's letter follows earlier criticism from the government's advisory body on global warming, the Climate Change Committee (CCC).\nIt warned the mine would increase global emissions and compromise the UK's legally binding carbon budgets.\nThe CCC said: \"The decision to award planning permission [for the mine] to 2049 will commit the UK to emissions from coking coal.\" The body said coking coal will have to stop by 2035 if the country is to meet its climate change targets.\nCORRECTION 7 February 2021: An earlier version of this story wrongly stated that the Conservative Environment Network opposes the proposed mine. Stanley Johnson is an ambassador for the group but was not speaking on its behalf."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "Hundreds of teachers in London have been able to book Covid vaccine slots despite not being in the top priority groups, after they were forwarded messages intended for NHS workers.\nA booking link and passcode meant for staff at Barts Health NHS Trust were circulated via Whatsapp to staff at local schools, teachers told the BBC.\nSome have received a jab as a result.\nThe trust said it was investigating and will take steps to improve the security of its booking system.\nThe government told the BBC's Newscast podcast in a statement it was \"absolutely critical that vaccines are offered in the priority order\".\nTeachers at schools in north and east London - including in Hackney, Camden and Barnet - said the messages had been sent via school management and were spreading in WhatsApp groups with dozens of members.\nNewscast found that it was still possible to book an appointment using the information in the messages on Thursday evening.\nOne teacher who booked an appointment, and who asked to remain anonymous, said it was \"not a case of trying to jump the queue\".\n\"When the appointment was confirmed I was surprised, thinking that it would have been refused if teachers were not actually entitled to these vaccines,\" they said.\n\"The conflicting and changing guidance from the government made me feel like it was possible that this was a genuine offer for teachers that had just not been passed on.\"\nThey added: \"Obviously, teachers will only have the vaccine when it is made available to us.\"\nAnother teacher said they, too, were surprised to find they could book an appointment.\n\"I thought this must be a local ad hoc way of avoiding wasting vaccines that hadn't been taken up. But I did some research and concluded this wasn't right,\" the teacher said.\n\"I think the problem is that people think this is genuine and don't think it's a loophole, but a local policy. It's not malicious or about queue-jumping.\"\nBarts Health NHS Trust confirmed that a booking link for its own employees was forwarded to local school staff and that this should not have happened.\nIt said it was investigating the source of the messages and measures were being put in place to make the booking system more secure.\nIt said anyone attending an appointment who is ineligible to do so would be turned away and that members of the public should not book an appointment until they have been contacted directly by the NHS.\nIn a statement, the trust said that it was vaccinating frontline staff and their relatives - where relevant - in line with national guidance.\n\"To avoid waste, any unfilled vaccination slots are offered to other staff working within our hospitals,\" it said.\nIt comes after reports that Rochdale Borough Council in Greater Manchester wrote to head teachers accusing some school staff of trying to get jabs via an \"inappropriately shared\" email.\nVaccination centres in Rochdale will now require people to show proof of employment in order to prevent people from being able to circumnavigate the system.\nThe leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, warned that anyone who had received a vaccine under those circumstances would be investigated and appropriate action taken to ensure that vaccines are given to those in greatest need.\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, Sir Richard said some people were \"fiddling the system, using other people's links to get access\".\n\"People should not go before they are called to go as you are taking a slot away from someone in greater need,\" he said.\n\"If people are gaming the system, if they are using other people's names, and they are not in priority groups, they are denying somebody at greater risk a vaccine and given the primary objective of this first half of the first phase is to save lives and take the pressure off our hospitals, they are also undermining our efforts to do that.\"\nHe added: \"We will eventually be able to identify anyone who has had a vaccine ahead of their eligibility criteria.\"\nThe NHS is currently only offering vaccines to people within England's first four priority groups, in line with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidelines. \nThis does not include teachers, unless they also meet age or health-related criteria.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said: \"It is absolutely critical that vaccines are offered in the priority order, as determined by the JCVI, and we expect everyone involved in vaccinations to follow this guidance closely.\"\n \"Vaccinating these groups first will save the most lives and provide the quickest and safest route out of the pandemic.\"\n Almost 10.5 million people in the UK have now received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard, and more than 500,000 have received their second dose."

      "text": "I was out walking my dog last March when I received a text telling me I was clinically vulnerable and needed to start shielding immediately.\nBeing totally honest, I burst into tears when I saw it - knowing I wouldn't be able to go out for a walk or a run, or even go to the supermarket.\nI've had an auto-immune disease since the age of ten and take immunosuppressants, which have controlled it really well and let me lead a relatively normal life.\nBut one thing I've always struggled with is my weakened immune system. Before lockdown I'd get common colds that would knock me out for weeks and constantly need antibiotics for various infections I pick up.\nI'd certainly let myself wonder about what would happen to me if I did catch coronavirus and working as a journalist every day certainly didn't help that feeling of anxiety.\nSo when I got a text last week offering me the chance to book in my first vaccine, I was absolutely overjoyed.\nI immediately texted my parents, my sister and my friends - it felt like the biggest thing that had happened to me in a long time.\nAs I walked to the vaccine centre on Saturday morning (in my new trainers and a full face of make-up, because why not?), I allowed myself to dream.\nI thought about all the things I used to take for granted, but now miss so much.\nSpontaneously planning a night out three hours in advance. The excitement you get before going to a gig. The countdown and frantic packing days before a holiday. Not that we can do any of that just yet - but still, it's good to dream.\nA paramedic gave me the jab and handed me a card with my batch number on, which now felt like the most precious thing I owned.\nIt was my ticket to a return to normal life. \nI called some fellow twentysomethings who've also had to shield and have got the jab.\nEl Afzal is a 24-year-old from Manchester, whose severe asthma and skin condition have meant she's also had to shield.\n\"Everyone's struggled with lockdown but when you're clinically vulnerable there's a different stress level,\" she says.\n\"I was getting all the texts and letters from the government telling me I was more likely to get severe Covid and that's been really hard in terms of anxiety.\"\nEl found it very tough seeing her friends going out - even in a limited, socially-distanced way.\n\"It feels like a big kick in the face when you're sat at home and you can't even go to the shop.\"\nShe says her experience of trying to get the vaccine was tough at first because her health conditions meant she couldn't receive the Pfizer jab.\n\"I've had the Oxford one now and I'm really grateful that I've been able to have it at this point and at least get my first jab.\n\"There's a sense of relief and I can sleep through the night and actually know I've done everything that I possibly can to ensure I'm as safe as possible,\" she says.\n\"I remember sitting down with my family eating lunch and my mum looked at her phone and she'd got the text - I had my phone charging in the other room and I went to grab it.\n\"It was incredible to see that message - I was absolutely buzzing.\"\nGeorgie Hodges is a 20-year-old student from London who has been shielding since the start of the pandemic due to a genetic condition. She says lockdown's had a really bad impact on her education and social life.\n\"My attention span has completely dropped in the last year and I can't sit down and focus - I also have joint pain and mobility issues,\" she says.\nGeorgie, along with her key worker parents, has received the first dose of the vaccine  but doesn't expect her life to suddenly change, even when restrictions are relaxed.\n\"I won't be going out as normal until I get the second part but I'm actually quite overwhelmed with what to do,\" she says.\n\"I find going out for a walk quite overwhelming at the moment, so as much as I'd love to say I'll be going out with my friends, I don't know what I'll do.\"\nBut Georgie says she \"can't put into words\" how it feels to know that she's on her way back to a normal life.\n\"It's finally light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK is \"past the peak\" of the current wave of the pandemic but infection rates are still high, England's chief medical officer says.\nProf Chris Whitty said the number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths were on a \"downward slope\" but that did not mean there would not be another peak. \nBoris Johnson praised the \"colossal\" effort to vaccinate 10 million people, including 90% of those aged over 75.\nBut the NHS was still under \"huge pressure\", the prime minister said.\nSpeaking at a Downing Street briefing, Prof Whitty said while the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 had reduced \"quite noticeably\", it was still above that of the first peak in April 2020.\n\"So this is still a very major problem, but it is one that is heading the right way,\" he said.\nProf Whitty said infection rates were \"coming down but they are still incredibly high\".\nIf the rate was to increase again \"from the very high levels we are at the moment the NHS will get back into trouble extraordinarily fast\", he added.\nHis comments were echoed by the prime minister, who warned the level of infection was still \"forbiddingly high\" and that it was too soon to relax current restrictions.\nOn Wednesday the UK recorded a further 1,322 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, bringing the total number of people who have died by this measure to 109,335, while a further 19,202 new cases were recorded.\nMr Johnson told the briefing: \"Though today there are some signs of hope - the numbers of Covid patients in hospital are beginning to fall for the first time since the onset of this new wave - the level of infection is still alarmingly high.\"\nThere are also about 32,000 Covid patients in hospital, he added.\nThe prime minister said he hoped schools in England would be able to begin reopening from 8 March, as evidence showed the coronavirus vaccines reduced \"death and serious illness\" from the main strains of the disease.\nBut he insisted the government would not be opening schools any earlier than this date, despite First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying that schools in Scotland would begin a phased reopening from 22 February.\nElsewhere, the Welsh government is due to make a decision by the end of the week on whether to reopen its schools after the February half-term.\nProf Whitty said schools in England had been managing to \"hold the line\" and remain open up until the new, more transmissible variant of the virus hit.\nHe said it was up to ministers to decide the opening dates for schools but that he was confident the risk to children of getting Covid-19 was \"incredibly low\".\nMeanwhile, he warned that predictions that every adult could offered a first dose of a vaccine by May and a second by August were \"at the very optimistic end\" due to supply constraints.\nMr Johnson said at the news conference the government would be sticking with its \"cautious\" approach.\nHe said ministers would outline a \"route map\" out of lockdown on 22 February and that the country would be in \"a very different situation\" to last summer, when disease levels had been reduced but there was no vaccine.\nVaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first. A list of nine high-priority groups which covers about 32 million people - including 90-99% of those most at risk of dying - is being followed, with an aim to vaccinate the first four by 15 February.\nThere is a lot to be hopeful for. The vaccine rollout is going well. Infection levels and the numbers in hospital are coming down - and there are early signs the same is happening with deaths.\nProgress should continue in the coming weeks as the impact of vaccination starts to kick in - deaths could then start falling rapidly.\nBut the great unlocking will have to be slow. \nWhy? While the numbers in hospital are coming down, it's from an incredibly high base. There are still 50% more patients in hospital now than there were during the first peak.\nThe pressures are going to be severe for some time.\nWhat is more, come mid-February when all the over 70s will have been offered the jab, there will still be significant numbers at risk of hospitalisation if they are infected. \nMost deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be struck until the over-50s are protected.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the results of a study which showed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might reduce the spread of coronavirus as \"absolutely superb\".\nThe researchers behind the jab have also said that a vaccine to tackle variants of the virus could be ready to deploy by the autumn should they be needed.\nA \"small number\" of cases of the coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa have been found in Birmingham as well as three cases without any travel history in Wales. \nIt comes after door-to-door testing has been launched to detect the mutation, which is thought to be more infectious but not necessarily more deadly.\nThe prime minister also led a clap for fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore.\nThe 100-year-old, who raised almost \u00a333m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday."

      "tags": "Country music,Pop music",
      "text": "US country star Morgan Wallen has been dropped by his record label, after a video emerged of him using a racial slur.\nNashville's Big Loud Records said it had \"made the decision to suspend Morgan Wallen's recording contract indefinitely\" in light of the video.\nIn the footage, reportedly filmed by a neighbour last weekend, the 27-year-old is seen saying goodbye to some friends and calling one of them the N-word.\nHe has apologised for the incident.  \n\"I'm embarrassed and sorry,\" he told TMZ, which first published the footage. \n\"I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back. There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologise for using the word. I promise to do better.\"\nWallen, whose career began on the US version of TV talent show The Voice, is currently one of the biggest country stars in the US.\nHis latest record, Dangerous: The Double Album, has been number one on the Billboard chart for the last three weeks; and his last four singles have reached number one on the country airplay chart.\nHowever, the industry's response to his use of a racial slur has been swift and decisive.\nWithin 24 hours of TMZ publishing its video, Wallen's music was pulled from the airwaves by iHeartMedia, the largest radio station group in the US, which owns more than 850 stations, including 135 country music stations. \nOther major networks, including Cumulus Media and Entercom, have also removed his music from their playlists.\n\"In light of Morgan Wallen's recent actions involving the use of a racial slur, we have made the decision to remove his music and content from our stations effective immediately,\" said a spokesman for iHeart.\nBroadcaster Country Music Television also distanced itself from the star.\n\"After learning of Morgan Wallen's racial slur late last night, we are in the process of removing his appearances from all our platforms,\" said the company in a statement. \"We do not tolerate or condone words and actions that are in direct opposition to our core values that celebrate diversity, equity and inclusion.\"\nAnd the Academy of Country Music said it was revoking Wallen's \"potential involvement and eligibility\" for this year's ACM Awards. \n\"As a result of this unprecedented situation, the Academy will be reviewing our awards eligibility and submission process, ensuring our nominees consistently reflect the Academy's integrity,\" it said in a statement.\nWallen's songs also appear to have been removed from Spotify's Hot Country Songs playlist and Apple Music's equivalent, Today's Country. \nThose moves are particularly significant because, unusually for a country album, Dangerous has been a smash on streaming services. According to MRC Data, which compiles the US charts, 88% of its consumption has been online.\nBig Loud Records said its decision to drop the star had been supported by Republic Records, a division of Universal Music, with which it partners to release Wallen's records.\nThe singer is yet to comment on the situation.\nThis is not the first time Wallen has landed himself in trouble. Last May, he was arrested and charged with public intoxication after being kicked out of Kid Rock's bar in Nashville.\nIn October, he was dropped from an episode of Saturday Night Live after a video emerged of him breaking Covid-19 rules by partying with fans without wearing a mask or social distancing at an American football game.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. \nA range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. \nIt is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. \nThe restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. \nVaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are \"the\" exit strategy from the pandemic.\nThe three vaccine frontrunners are those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nPfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design.\nThey inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. \nThese have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. \nThe Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe.\nIt is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.\nAll three are supposed to be given as two doses.\nA single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now been approved for use in the UK.\nTwenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year.\nBecause only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year.\nAnother jab, Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators.\nIt uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. \nThere are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. \nThe Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.\nThe Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised.\nThe vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death.\nIt is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. \nHowever, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid.\nNonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. \nUnderstanding which method produces the best results will be explored in challenge trials where people are deliberately infected with the virus.\nNew versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. \nHowever, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first \"real-world\" data on the new variants.\nBoth showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.\nThe results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target.\nWe may need to change the vaccines we use in the future."

Those who flout the rules risk fines.\nPeople who live within easy reach of the hills have also been urged to adhere closely to guidance on how to enjoy the outdoors safely.\nFor further information:\nRecent years have seen Scotland's mountain snowsports centres invest heavily in artificial snow-making equipment because there was not enough of the natural white stuff.\nThis year there is more than enough snow, but few can enjoy it.\nLast year resorts also missed out on \"one of the best springs in years\" due to the pandemic, having to shutdown just as lots of snow and a spell of calm, cold weather arrived.\nIain Cameron, who researches snow in Scotland, said this winter had been unusual.\nHe said: \"The snow cover that is present, especially over the north east Highlands, is more extensive for the time of year than any since 2010. \n\"The Cairngorms have almost unbroken cover above 500m and lying snow has been present at a partially-frozen Loch Morlich for over a month. \n\"In the context of the last 20 years, this is very unusual.\""

There have been a small number of allergic reactions needing treatment. \nSafety checks will continue around the globe.\nAnd in the UK, people can report concerns to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's Yellow Card scheme.\nDr Anna Goodman, at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, in London, who has been running trials with other coronavirus vaccines, from Oxford-AstraZeneca and Novavax, said side effects may be unpleasant but are to be expected as the immune system responds to a vaccine. \nBut people still needed to follow social-distancing rules, because protection may not be 100%.\n\"Because you have more fever, that doesn't mean you are more immune,\" she said.\n\"You can't presume it to.\"\nAnd people could take paracetamol for mild after-effects, such as fever or headache, she said. \nLead Zoe app researcher Prof Tim Spector said: \"Generally, most people should be reassured by this data.\"\nHe said anyone who had a fever or other symptoms that could suggest coronavirus should get tested, even if they have been vaccinated.

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nThat's the latest prediction from the Bank of England. It says the economy is expected to shrink 4.2% in the first three months of 2021, amid tighter lockdown restrictions, but the UK's vaccine rollout will help it \"recover rapidly\" this year. It is thought that a rebound will come in the spring as people become more confident about spending.\nThe Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said lockdown restrictions should not be lifted too early. He asked the government \"not to repeat the mistakes of last time\" and to make sure that the current national lockdown in England is the last. Sir Keir also called for clarity over the government's quarantine plans,. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last month that UK arrivals from certain countries would have to quarantine in hotels, but hotel industry figures said no discussions had taken place. No 10 said an announcement would come next week. \nAbout one in three people recently given a Covid vaccine by the NHS report some side-effects, such as soreness around the injection site, according to a study by researchers from King's College London. None was serious, and experts said some side-effects are to be expected and are not a bad thing. The researchers asked for feedback, via an app, from about 40,000 people - mostly healthcare workers.\nA London restaurant that broke lockdown rules to host Rita Ora's 30th birthday in November will not have its licence revoked. The singer's team offered the manager at Casa Cruz, in Notting Hill, \u00a35,000 to allow guests to attend a party during the second virus lockdown, police said. Kensington and Chelsea Council said it will suspend the venue's licence for six weeks. The venue said it was \"grateful for the council's careful consideration\".\nA Scottish couple who had never been apart in more than 50 years of marriage have been reunited after being separated in hospital with coronavirus. Jim Tierney, 85, and his wife May, 83, from Falkirk, ended up in separate rooms on a Covid ward at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert.

      "text": "Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency which started off as a joke, has jumped in value by 50% after inventor Elon Musk dubbed it \"the people's crypto\".\nCryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin and Bitcoin are generated by computers. Their supposed value comes from the finite number that can be computed.\nDogecoin uses a Shiba Inu dog as its mascot and is based on a meme featuring the animal.\nThe currency has risen more than 800% in the year so far. \nAfter reaching a high of $0.058 (4.2 pence), each dogecoin is currently changing hands for about $0.046, suggesting a total value for all 128bn coins of about $5.89bn.\nIt was created in 2013 by a pair of software workers after one of them made a joke about the next big cryptocurrency, according to an interview with Vice. \nHowever, with no intrinsic value like gold or land, and no ability to generate an income like a company or bond, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and can crash as fast as they rise.\nThis makes them hard to value and makes their prices susceptible to tips from backers or sudden panics.\nCritics point out that while any given cryptocurrency may have a finite supply of units, the number of cryptocurrencies is ever-growing and potentially limitless.\nPeople have lost large amounts of money in steep drops in the value of cryptocurrencies and in hacks and corrupted or lost hard drives. \nBitcoin's value dropped by $5,000 on 4 January to about $29,000 before recovering the lost ground. On 11 Jan, it dropped $9,000 to $32,000. \nBecause the cryptocurrencies can pass international borders quickly and are not regulated like cash or regular investments, investigating thefts is hard.\nLast month, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a stark warning to investors in so-called cryptoassets.\nThe financial watchdog said investors should be \"prepared to lose all their money\" should their investment's value collapse."

      "text": "Canada has designated the far-right group Proud Boys as a terrorist entity.\nPublic Safety Minister Bill Blair said the decision was influenced by the group's \"pivotal role\" in the 6 January riots at the Capitol in Washington, DC.\nThe designation allows the Proud Boys' assets to be frozen, and members of the groups could be charged with terrorist offences if they commit violent acts.\nThe group is all-male and anti-immigrant, and has a history of violent political confrontations.\nIt was founded in 2016 by Gavin McInnes, the Canadian co-founder of Vice Media. Vice has since worked to distance itself from Mr McInnes and the Proud Boys\nThe Proud Boys' platform includes ideas espoused by former US President Donald Trump, libertarianism and traditional gender roles.\nThe group was mentioned by Mr Trump during the first US presidential debate last October. \nResponding to a question about white supremacist and militia groups, he said, \"Proud Boys - stand back and stand by\", which members of the group online took as a call to prepare for action. Mr Trump later distanced himself from them.\nThe announcement in Canada comes one week after the US Department of Homeland Security warned of a \"heightened threat\" of domestic terrorism from violent extremists unhappy with the outcome of the presidential election. \nAnd just hours after the announcement, the US Justice Department announced it had arrested and charged a top member of the group's Seattle chapter. Ethan Nordean, 30, who is also known as Rufio Panman, is at least the eighth group member to be charged in connection with the Capitol riots. \nIn Canada on Wednesday, Mr Blair described a \"growing threat of ideologically motivated violent extremism\". He did not specify how many Proud Boy chapters are currently in Canada.\nThe Canadian Proud Boy groups had previously been thought of as disparate and disorganised, but the new designation suggests their perceived threat has been elevated. \nThe decision was made based on \"a trove of new information\", Mr Blair said. \"Over the past several months, basically since 2018, we have seen an escalation towards violence for this group [the Proud Boys].\" \nThe escalation has continued since the US presidential election, he added. \nIn his announcement, Mr Blair referenced \"several different occasions\" of attacks in Canada from those with far-right and extremist ideologies. Last week, the country marked the four-year anniversary of a mass shooting in a Quebec mosque that killed six people and injured 19. \nDespite strict travel restrictions between the US and Canada, at least two Canadians later identified in media reports made it to Washington for last month's storming of the Capitol. And images and video of the 6 January riots show at least one Canadian flag held by someone in the crowd. \nCanada is the first country to give the Proud Boys a terrorist designation. \nTwo other far-right US groups - Atomwaffen Division and the Base - have also been designated by Canada as terrorist entities, along with several affiliates of the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda.\nA total of six white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups have been designated by terrorist entities in Canada. Prior to 2018, no such groups were listed as a terrorist threat. "

I'd rather be kept on my toes and be busy.\"\nPiers' story is one of how a student with additional educational needs is dealing with the uncertain challenges of a global health emergency.\n\"School for some of our children is the safety net, not only for the children but for the families,\" said Bethan Moore, acting head of Crownbridge Special School in Cwmbran.\n\"Sometimes it's just a bit of respite for the children to come to school.\"\nAbout 20 of Crownbridge's 116 pupils have been going into school during lockdown while the rest remain at home and have been offered remote learning.\n\"It was kind of annoying at first, with the mask and because of Covid you can't do things,\" added Piers' school friend Amy, 19, who is also studying for a GCSE in maths.\n\"But I haven't found it that bad as we've done some fun things.\"\nAmy's mum Caroline, from Monmouth, said her daughter, who has autism, \"thrived\" in school as it \"brings out the best in her\".\n\"Since lockdown it has been particularly difficult,\" she said.\n\"But the school has made great efforts to engage with Amy at home and in school which is really important because Amy needs that routine, the teachers have made it fun.\n\"The online learning experience is new but it has taught her some new skills so the blended-learning approach has been positive.\"\nCrownbridge, like all schools across the UK, has had to rapidly adapt to challenge of continuing education and mitigating the risks of Covid-19.\n\"Our teacher will send learning packs home each week with targets,\" said teaching assistant Megan Israel.\n\"The parents then send the work back and we put it in the children's folders to ensure the children are not missing out.\"\nThe \"blended learning approach\" is also applied to physio and exercise targets for pupils with more acute and physical needs.\nBut Ms Israel said it was important some pupils could attend school to use the specialist equipment \"to meet their needs\".\nTeachers have worked closely with physiotherapists and speech and language therapists to ensure support is provided to families at home.\n\"We are concerned about the dip in their progress,\" added Ms Moore.\n\"But as far as Crownbridge concerned, we've been really good at working as a tight team, providing support for pupils and families who are blended learning at home.\"\nWelsh Government guidance on Covid measures allows for \"a practical and flexible approach\" for children with special educational needs.\nThe school has established small contact groups and intensified cleaning on site and some facilities are shut, like their hydro pool or the hall where pupils would undergo physiotherapy.\nSocial distancing, masks and other coronavirus prevention measures can be more difficult to implement in schools like Crownbridge where many children have difficulty communicating and need physical interaction.\nStaff wear face coverings around the school but Ms Moore says it becomes more difficult when they interact with the children \"who rely on the mouth and the speech and language to communicate\". \nThe Welsh Government has pledged to vaccinate special school staff who provide intimate personal care for children - and Crownbridge's staff are waiting for their Covid jabs.\nWhile there are limited numbers of children coming into school, they also provide opportunities for their pupils to learn from home, whatever their needs.\nTeacher Bethan Stokes has teenagers Elliot and Shay in class doing some sensory maths by singing a song about numbers and asking them to use a fly swat to splat piles of cream with different amounts of cherries on the top.\nAfter the excitement of making a mess in the classroom, they go to the sensory room to let off some steam.\n\"We try to keep it as normal as possible,\" said Ms Stokes.\n\"It's really difficult because obviously the children know things aren't normal because of the circumstances. I'm so proud of how they're coping.\""

He noted how music had always been one of \"Britain's biggest exports\", pointing to the likes of Dua Lipa and Lewis Capaldi as well as leading ballets and operas.\nHe said he and Mr Dowden spoke for about 20 minutes and discussed ideas like the potential creation of a permanent site, backed by record labels, that could \"help them with the logistics of touring in Europe\".\nHe explained: \"If they can be helped through this it will take away a lot of their fears, and make life easier. I'm sure we can establish this, and we have to basically, otherwise they're going to have not much of a future, and that is a crying shame, as there's so many great artists out there.\"\nMr Dowden tweeted to say he had \"a v positive call\" with Sir Elton and husband David Furnish, and that there was \"lots of work going on in Govt on this\".\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "Society is unlikely to return to normal until \"well into next year\", one of the world's leading scientists has warned.\nProf Helen Rees said \"first generation\" vaccines may become less effective against new variants of coronavirus.\nAs a result, Prof Rees told BBC Wales Live high-volume rollout of the jabs may not happen until 2022.\nProf Rees, who is from South Africa but has family in Wales, sits on the World Health Organization's (WHO) committee for Covid-19.\nIt comes as Public Health Wales launches an investigation into the potential spread of the South African variant within communities in Wales.\n\"The worry we have is that like the UK variant, the [South African variant] is more transmissible,\" said Prof Rees, who is helping lead South Africa's pandemic response.\n\"At the moment we are not identifying that it's causing a more serious disease, but the real concern is what is the impact going to be on the vaccines.\"\nProf Rees said clinical trials into the efficacy of the Novavax and Janssen vaccines against the South African variant suggest there is \"reduced impact\".\nShe said scientists are \"concerned\" the AstraZeneca and Pfizer jabs could also see reduced efficacy because they use the \"original virus from China\", while increasing numbers of variants are in circulation.\n\"The question is: Is the way the vaccine is targeting the virus still going to work?,\" Prof Rees said.\n\"The problem is that many of these first generation vaccines target... the spike protein. That's where we are seeing more of these mutations.\"\n\"Not necessarily,\" said Prof Rees. \"In the UK, you have got your own variant there which is the predominant one.\n\"The South African variant is new and it is very, very small numbers.\n\"And it looks from all of the data that the AstraZeneca vaccine is going to be very effective in reducing individual illness, but also looks like it's going to have a population effect, which is very exciting.\"\n\"On the one hand, we want to stop this pandemic but on the other hand you have got small children who desperately want to get back to school and continue their emotional and social development and their learning,\" Prof Rees said.\n\"So, I think the message is that even with vaccines, if you are going to resume schooling, all of those social measures have to continue.\n\"You have got to have mask-wearing, you have got to have social distancing. And I know it's cold and wet in Wales, but you have got to open the windows and have ventilation.\"\n\"I'm afraid to say... I think we are going to be well into next year before we see a change - that change is likely to be caused by high coverage of the vaccines,\" she said.\n\"I think this new normal we all talk about is with us for a very long time.\n\"The mask-wearing, the distancing - all of the measures that we have put in place - will have to continue.\n\"This virus is nasty and this virus knows how to change. If we want to get rid of it, my advice to the politicians is to continue what you are doing - to have these measures.\""

The couple's first child Skye is two-and-a-half. \nThe 37-year-old, who runs a community music organisation, said Clouds Hill Avenue now has its own \"ready-made community.\" \n\"There are lots of young couples starting families in the street because it's an amazing location. \n\"I think it's maybe a massive coincidence [so many women are pregnant]. Or maybe I started a trend?\" \nAilie Tam, the expectant mothers' yoga teacher, is due to give birth to her second child in August. She and her husband Ben already have a daughter, Eni. \nThe 36-year-old said: \"We feel very lucky because we only moved here last March and we were really hoping that the community would [be friendly] but until you move in you don't know.\n\"The decibels will be increasing in the springtime and the summertime when hopefully restrictions are lifted a bit more. It's going to be really fun.\" \nCatherine Gilmore, 31, is expecting her first baby with her partner Michael Malay.\nShe said there was a \"slow dawning\" on Clouds Hill Avenue that women were expecting, with hers due in May. \n\"There were women popping up every day - or it felt like it - saying they were pregnant. \n\"It's really lovely, particularly as a first-time mum, not having any of the baby groups or anything that would normally be happening at the time. \n\"It's really good having these families on the street and the babies that will be hanging out at the park. It'll be like a little festival out there, it's going to be great.\" \nCaroline Hardman, a 33-year-old physiotherapist, has a one-and-a-half year-old daughter called Ruth. She is expecting her second child with her husband Matt. \n\"We have been running, we have been baking bread, and we have been making babies\", he said of their lockdown.\nMs Hardman added: \"It started with just a couple [of expectant mothers] and then we found out we were expecting, and then I told Jenni and she said, 'that's really exciting, there's four of us!'\n\"Every time I spoke to one the number increased. \n\"So it was funny that every time you said I'm expecting a baby, it was: 'oh yeah, this person down the road is.'\" \nVictoria Bromley said she thought there was \"something in the water\" and said the good news contrasted with the harsh realities of the pandemic. \nShe is due to give birth in July and she and her husband David Hume already have a two-year-old son called Freddie. \n\"I think everyone came into 2021 hoping that it would be different, that there would be more positivity. And it certainly feels like that for us\", the 36-year-old said. \n\"I really feel for people who have had babies over the course of the last year. \n\"I think every mum would say maternity leave, even in normal times, can be very isolating. So I just can't even imagine those people who have had to go through it during lockdown.\"\nEllie Shipman found out she was pregnant while living on the street.\nShe said: \"You can't go out, you can't really see people as much, so maybe it's a time to settle down?\" \nThe 31-year-old artist has since moved but is still part of the community and is expecting her first baby with husband Alex Blogg. \n\"I think it's just a message of life going on amongst the bleakness of the situation we are in\", she said. \n\"We'll be really excited to meet all the little ones as they arrive throughout the year.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Failing to extend a \u00a320 lockdown benefit boost will harm the health of millions of people for decades, leading health organisations have told Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a letter. \nIntroduced last year, the \u00a320-a-week uplift is due to end in April.\nClaimants say it has been a lifeline and dread losing it.  \nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has hinted the government could be moving closer to extending the rise but says there is no decision yet.\nNow, groups representing doctors, nurses and social workers, say health inequalities laid bare by Covid will worsen if the uplift to universal credit is scrapped. \nTheir comments echo those of campaigners and claimants - such as single mother Rebecca, from the east of England, who told BBC News withdrawing the extra cash would be \"cruel\".\nRebecca, who asked the BBC not to use her full name, has an eight-year-old daughter and relies on universal credit to supplement her earnings from working 14 hours a week for a charity.\nShe has been receiving the benefit for two years, the first of which, before the extra payment was introduced, she describes as \"brutal\".\nAnd by October 2019, \"we had no money for food\".\n\"I put a post on Facebook, asking where I could go safely with a kid for free food,\" she said.\nIn the end, it was gifts from friends and food parcels from a local church that saw them through. \nThe introduction of the \u00a320 boost had provided a buffer, said Rebecca.\n\"At least I had something coming in,\" she said. \n\"The \u00a320 is mostly food for her - I eat whatever I can.\n\"Obviously we will find a way to survive, because we have to, but it's a lot lot harder.\"\nThe letter calls on the prime minister to make the temporary increase to universal credit and working tax credit permanent from April and provide the same uplift to other key benefits. \n\"As organisations working across health and care, we see the irrefutable evidence that poverty has significant negative impacts on individuals, their families and society more widely,\" it says. \nThe signatories include:\nThe letter calls the extra \u00a320 \"an investment in our nation's health, ensuring many of those on the lowest incomes have access to essentials like food or heating\".\n\"In a year marked by worry and uncertainty, the uplift has been a preventative lifeline keeping many afloat, protecting them from financial instability, debt and worsening mental health,\" it says.\nAnd if it is discontinued, \"overnight 6.2 million families will face a \u00a31,040 cut to their incomes\".\n\"We cannot plan for the UK's economic recovery only to face another escalating health crisis for those on the lowest incomes,\" the letter says.\nOn Wednesday, Ms Coffey told MPs: \"We have the effects of this pandemic that are ongoing.\n\"And we recognise the need to continue to support people.\"\nShe rejected the idea the extra \u00a320 \"reduces work incentives\", telling the Work and Pensions Committee this \"steady stream of money would be more beneficial to claimants\" than an alternative option of a one-off payment. \nThe \u00a320 boost, which costs about \u00a36bn, came after years of cuts to benefits. \nChanges since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, initially in coalition, mean spending on working-age benefits  is about \u00a332bn lower this year than it would have been, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated.\nAnd even with the extra \u00a320, a single person with no children who loses their job in the UK this year will receive just 17% of average earnings in benefit payments, the lowest figure among high-income economies.   \nThe cuts to welfare have also been blamed by campaigners and charities for the increase in child poverty since 2010.  \nAnother think tank, the Resolution Foundation, has calculated even if the \u00a320 boost is made permanent, child poverty will continue to rise.\nAnd by 2024, one third of children will be living in poverty.  \nRebecca said she knew how to budget but still struggled to make ends meet, even with the extra \u00a320 a week.\nWithout it, \"every day is stress because you don't know how you're going to make it for the next month\".\n\"You're always living on your toes,\" she said.\n\"And you're always having to budget minute by minute and budget to the very penny.\"\n\"When already you are scraping for money, \u00a320 is masses.\" \nA government spokesman said: \"We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond to ensure that nobody is left behind.\" \nHe said support had been targeted at those most in need, including \"raising the living wage, spending hundreds of billions to safeguard jobs, boosting welfare support by billions and introducing the \u00a3170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme\"."

Going on holiday is not a valid reason.\"\nShe said the new rule would require people wishing to leave the UK to go abroad to first \"make a declaration for why they need to travel\", which would then be \"checked by carriers prior to departure\".\nMs Patel said: \"Anyone who doesn't have a valid reason for travel will be directed to return home or they will face a fine.\"\nUnder the national lockdown, people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. \nThese are the same as the \"reasonable excuses\" for domestic travel, including:\nShe said it was \"clear that there are still too many people coming in and out of our country each day\" and other border measures would be toughened up to \"reduce passenger flow\" and protect the UK's \"world-leading\" vaccination programme.\nPolice checks at home addresses will be increased to ensure arrivals are complying with self-isolation rules, and the UK will continue to refuse entry to non-UK citizens from \"red list\" countries which were already subject to the travel ban.\nThe list of travel exemptions would also be \"urgently\" reviewed, she added, to make sure \"only the most important and with exceptional reasons are included\".\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that UK nationals and residents returning from 30 high-risk countries would have to quarantine in government-provided hotels.\nThe measures will apply to people coming from most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal, amid concern over new variants of the virus. Most overseas visitors from those countries are already barred from entering the UK. \nBritish nationals and those with residency rights who arrive from high-risk countries will be required to quarantine in a hotel at their own expense for up to 10 days, in a bid to improve compliance with self-isolation rules. \nKeri McMenamin was returning to the country with her husband and two children after securing a job offer - leaving the UK in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic last year.\n\"It is literally luck of the draw,\" the 38-year-old said after securing her family's place in Australia's 14-day quarantine system. \"You didn't know what to expect.\" Having done some research, Keri discovered Facebook groups busy with people relaying their experiences of quarantine.\n\"A lot of people were saying, 'Look, just expect the worst and then whatever you get is a bonus.'\"\nIn the end, the family was given an interconnecting room. But the windows were sealed and their time outside limited to 20-minute stints every two to three days.\nMr Johnson told the House of Commons on Wednesday that arrivals who could not be refused entry would be required to isolate in government provided accommodation, such as hotels, \"without exception\".\nThese arrivals would be escorted from the airport and \"transported directly into quarantine\", with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) working to set up these facilities \"as quickly as possible\", he said.\nMs Patel said the DHSC would \"set out further details\" on the hotel quarantine policy next week.\nIan Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, told the Commons that the Scottish and Welsh governments wanted \"to go further\" than what the UK government was proposing on quarantine measures, and challenged the PM to \"stop his half measures\" and bring in \"stricter enforcement on international travel\".\nA spokesman for the Welsh government said \"the need for a joint approach\" to border measures had been agreed between the UK's four nations and the Republic of Ireland, but it did not believe the approach outlined by the UK government went \"far enough\".\n\"Further discussions on the details of the proposals will take place as soon as possible,\" he added.\nIn response to the government's announcement, Airport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee welcomed the news that the new hotel quarantine policy would only apply to a limited number of countries, but questioned what \"additional public health benefit\" it would have, given strict travel rules were recently introduced.\nShe called on the government to set out \"when and how we can ease all these measures safely and provide people with reassurance that travel will be possible again in the future\".\nAt the moment, incoming travellers have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test on departure, taken in the previous 72 hours. Then they still have to quarantine for up to 10 days, although this can be done at home.\nThose who do not comply will face a fine of \u00a3500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks. \nIn England, the self-isolation period can be cut short with a second negative test after five days. \nQuarantine rules are set separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but have tended to differ only slightly.\nHotel quarantine is already in use in countries including New Zealand and Australia. \nAre you a UK national in one of the countries affected?

      "tags": "Companies,Royal Dutch Shell,Energy industry,Oil & Gas industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell sank to a net loss of $21.7bn (\u00a316bn) last year after the coronavirus pandemic caused demand to slump.\nThe announcement comes after two of its rivals, BP and Exxon, posted similar big losses.\nLooking ahead, Shell said \"significant uncertainty\" would continue to have a negative impact on demand for oil and gas products.\nAs a result, it said it might need to take measures to cut production.\nIn September last year, Shell announced that up to 9,000 jobs would go worldwide as the company responded to the effects of the pandemic.\nLast month, it said it was cutting 330 jobs from its operations in the North Sea.\nEven before the virus struck, the oil industry was already having to rethink its future plans as part of the transition away from fossil fuels.\nThe Covid impact means companies such as Shell are accelerating that transition.\nSome doom-mongers were anticipating Royal Dutch Shell might unveil the largest-ever UK corporate loss, but in the end, the Anglo-Dutch oil group managed to get only halfway there. The \u00a316bn deficit is dwarfed by the \u00a330bn loss posted by Royal Bank of Scotland at the height of the 2008 banking crisis. \nThe Shell results will also quickly be forgotten. They are largely accounting rather than cash losses, the result of a giant write-down in the future value of the company's oil fields and prospects. Already investors are turning their attention to next week, when chief executive Ben van Beurden will present the company's long-awaited plans to shift the company towards greener forms of energy. \nPension funds and other big investors are pushing hard to get Shell to do more. The same pension funds, however, are reliant on the big stream of dividends that flows from the oil business. They will be hoping that Mr van Beurden will be able to pull off the trick of using that income to fund the investments in green energy that will - hopefully - yield a similar juicy dividend income in the future.\nOther big oil companies are also feeling the strain. On Tuesday, BP reported that it lost $18.1bn in 2020, marking its first annual loss in a decade.\nOn the same day, US giant Exxon Mobil posted annual losses of $22.4bn.\nTwo other big US firms, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, reported big losses as well.\nThere are also indications of a potential shake-up in the sector, after media reports emerged this week that Exxon and Chevron held preliminary talks last year on a possible merger.\nThe two firms declined to comment, but sources told Reuters that the discussions involved Exxon chief executive Darren Woods and his counterpart at Chevron, Mike Wirth.\n\"This week's huge losses by Shell, BP and Exxon reflect the challenges oil and gas companies face,\" said David Elmes, professor of practice and head of the Global Energy Research Network at Warwick Business School.\n\"They are skating on ever-thinning ice as the effects of climate change combine with other events like the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\nProf Elmes said the slump in demand for oil and gas due to the pandemic had become more prolonged than initially hoped.\n\"There will be some ongoing need for oil and gas as a fuel for a while yet. There will also be demand for the petrochemicals and other products made from them. But that can't sustain the industry we've seen in the past as we look to address climate change.\""

      "text": "The leading climate scientist James Hansen has warned Boris Johnson that he risks \u201chumiliation\u201c over plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria.\nThe UK government, which hosts a climate summit this year, has allowed the mine at Whitehaven to go ahead.\nDr Hansen, formerly Nasa's leading global warming researcher, urged the PM to halt production - or be \"vilified\".\nNo 10 said the UK was a world leader on climate change, but would not reverse the local council decision on the mine.\nIn his letter, Dr Hansen - whose testimony before the US Senate helped raise wider awareness of global warming back in 1988 - writes: \"In leading the [climate conference], you have a chance to change the course of our climate trajectory, earning the UK and yourself historic accolades.\n\"Or you can stick with business-almost-as-usual and be vilified around the world. \n\u201cIt would be easy to achieve this latter ignominy and humiliation - just continue with the plan to open a new coal mine in Cumbria in contemptuous disregard of the future of young people and nature. \n\u201cThe contrary path is not so easy, but, with your leadership, it is realistic.\u201d\nDowning Street said the UK is cutting emissions faster than any major economy and would end the use of coal for electricity by 2025.\nMinisters have defended the decision over the coal mine as a local planning matter, but have stressed that industries such as steel production require coking coal - which would have to be imported if it was not produced in the UK.\nA No 10 spokesperson said the prime minister would continue to urge countries to pursue \"clean economic recoveries\" as the UK hosts the COP26 summit in Glasgow this November - the climate meeting to which Mr Hansen refers.\nKeeping the global temperature rise to below 1.5C is considered crucial for avoiding the worst effects of global warming.\nLast week, US climate envoy John Kerry told the BBC that Glasgow will be the \u201clast best chance\u201c the world has for tackling the climate crisis.\nDr Hansen's letter may prove uncomfortable for Mr Johnson, as it has been copied to Mr Kerry.\nThe letter continues: \u201cPrime Minister Johnson, young people are fed up \u2013 and for good reason. They demand that political leaders follow the science and take the actions needed to preserve and restore a healthy climate.\n\u201cIf this [conference] is like the prior ones \u2013 with soothing words and worthless ambitions \u2013 they will be justifiably outraged.\u201d\nThe new coal mine was agreed by Cumbria County Council. \nThe government said approval was a matter for the council, defending the decision by the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick not to exercise his powers to overrule the local authority.\nThe mine will produce coking coal - a grade that is used in steel-making. Although 85% of it is destined for export to Europe, government sources hinted that a need for continuing domestic steel production was another reason for not opposing the mine.\nDr Hansen does acknowledge the UK\u2019s previous climate leadership and its success in reducing emissions.\n\u201cYour progress reflects well on your parliamentary democracy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy wife and I were fortunate to witness the efforts of UK citizens and political leaders during the past two decades as that progress was achieved.\n\"It is our fervent hope that the UK will continue to provide leadership and affect the entire planet.\u201d\nThe letter amplifies criticism at the weekend from the government\u2019s advisory body on global warming, the Climate Change Committee (CCC).\nIt says the Cumbrian mine will increase global emissions and compromise the UK\u2019s legally binding carbon budgets.\nThe CCC said: \u201cThe decision to award planning permission [for the mine] to 2049 will commit the UK to emissions from coking coal.\u201c The body said coking coal will have to stop by 2035 if the country is to meet its climate change targets.\nIn response to the CCC\u2019s letter, a government statement said the decision to allow the coal mine would not be reversed.\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

Let's secure our borders.\"\nDemands to introduce tougher border restrictions in the UK have been growing since the emergence of new coronavirus variants from other countries, such as South Africa. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps introduced the requirement for travellers to have a negative test result before arriving in the UK last month, but critics continued to call for mandatory quarantine in hotels for all arrivals - echoing similar moves in Australia and New Zealand. \nAt the end of January, Mr Johnson confirmed this rule would be introduced, but only for UK nationals and residents returning from 30 \"red list\" Covid hotspots.\nHowever, hotel industry leaders said on Thursday they are \"yet to hear details\" of government plans.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the boss of Best Western, which has 250 hotels in the UK, said beyond \"very broad information\" about timings, hoteliers had not had \"any discussions at all\" with government.\nRob Paterson added: \"In any normal company, if you went out and announced a programme nationally and you hadn't thought about how you were going to plan that, and you hadn't spoken to the people involved\u2026 I'm not sure I'd have a job if I did that in my company.\"\nHe said his industry \"needed some assurance of what demand levels are going to be\", as well as clarification on \"security protocols\".\nChief Executive of industry body UK Hospitality, Kate Nicholls, said: \"Hotels have offered their help to the government, but we are yet to hear any details on the scheme. \n\"We are ready to provide assistance as and when hotels will be needed.\"\nThe Immigration Services Union - which represents workers for the UK Border Force - also claimed \"nothing has been communicated\" to them or staff. \nHave you recently entered the UK from a hotspot such as South Africa?

The film gained a cult following after its release and has spawned a handful of sequels and remakes.\nUS media reports suggest the fake warning message was sent out three times via email. \nThe Amber Alert system was first developed in the US in 1996 - seeking to send vital information out fast so that the public can help assist and identify children in immediate danger. \nThe warnings are sent out to local media outlets as well as directly to the public through social media and messaging systems.\nYou may also be interested in:"

      "text": "Society is unlikely to return to normal until \"well into next year\", one of the world's leading scientists has warned.\nProf Helen Rees said \"first generation\" vaccines may become less effective against new variants of coronavirus.\nAs a result, Prof Rees told BBC Wales Live high-volume rollout of the jabs may not happen until 2022.\nProf Rees, who is from South Africa but has family in Wales, sits on the World Health Organization's (WHO) committee for Covid-19.\nIt comes as Public Health Wales launches an investigation into the potential spread of the South African variant within communities in Wales.\n\"The worry we have is that like the UK variant, the [South African variant] is more transmissible,\" said Prof Rees, who is helping lead South Africa's pandemic response.\n\"At the moment we are not identifying that it's causing a more serious disease, but the real concern is what is the impact going to be on the vaccines.\"\nProf Rees said clinical trials into the efficacy of the Novavax and Janssen vaccines against the South African variant suggest there is \"reduced impact\".\nShe said scientists are \"concerned\" the AstraZeneca and Pfizer jabs could also see reduced efficacy because they use the \"original virus from China\", while increasing numbers of variants are in circulation.\n\"The question is: Is the way the vaccine is targeting the virus still going to work?,\" Prof Rees said.\n\"The problem is that many of these first generation vaccines target... the spike protein. That's where we are seeing more of these mutations.\"\n\"Not necessarily,\" said Prof Rees. \"In the UK, you have got your own variant there which is the predominant one.\n\"The South African variant is new and it is very, very small numbers.\n\"And it looks from all of the data that the AstraZeneca vaccine is going to be very effective in reducing individual illness, but also looks like it's going to have a population effect, which is very exciting.\"\n\"On the one hand, we want to stop this pandemic but on the other hand you have got small children who desperately want to get back to school and continue their emotional and social development and their learning,\" Prof Rees said.\n\"So, I think the message is that even with vaccines, if you are going to resume schooling, all of those social measures have to continue.\n\"You have got to have mask-wearing, you have got to have social distancing. And I know it's cold and wet in Wales, but you have got to open the windows and have ventilation.\"\n\"I'm afraid to say... I think we are going to be well into next year before we see a change - that change is likely to be caused by high coverage of the vaccines,\" she said.\n\"I think this new normal we all talk about is with us for a very long time.\n\"The mask-wearing, the distancing - all of the measures that we have put in place - will have to continue.\n\"This virus is nasty and this virus knows how to change. If we want to get rid of it, my advice to the politicians is to continue what you are doing - to have these measures.\""

      "text": "Myanmar's military rulers have blocked access to Facebook, days after they overthrew the democratic government.\nOfficials said the social media platform - for many in Myanmar the main source of online information - would be blocked for the sake of \"stability\". \nFacebook has become a key rallying point for opposition to Monday's coup.\nIn further civil disobedience, lawmakers are refusing to leave their compound in the capital, and more pot-banging was seen in Yangon.\nThe coup, led by armed forces chief Min Aung Hlaing, installed an 11-member junta, ending a short period of majority civilian rule. \nThe military said an election in November had been fraudulent - though the country's election commission said there was no evidence to back up such claims. \nThe elected civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, along with President Win Myint, were detained and on Wednesday police filed charges against them. \nThe charges against her include possession of unlawful communication devices - walkie-talkies used by her security staff.  \nPresident Myint is accused of breaching Covid rules while campaigning for last November's election, which was won decisively by Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). \nThe Ministry of Communications and Information said access to Facebook would be blocked until 7 February. However, it was still reported to be accessible sporadically.\nAnthony Aung, who runs a tour agency in Yangon, the main city, told the BBC at one point he still had access to the site through wifi but not cellular data. \nHe said \"people around me are all rushing to download alternative apps and VPN\" - virtual private networks, which allow users to get round internet restrictions. \nHours later, Mr Aung said Facebook had stopped working completely.  \nYangon student Min Htet said her education had already been suspended due to the Covid pandemic. \"Blocking Facebook today means that the freedom of young people is restricted from now on,\" she told Reuters. \nHalf of Myanmar's 54 million people use Facebook and activists have set up a page to co-ordinate opposition to the coup.\nFacebook became popular in Myanmar - also known as Burma - as the company initially allowed its app to be used without data costs so that consumers could avoid paying expensive telecoms charges. \nThe social media giant acknowledged the disruption, saying \"we urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with their families and friends and access important information\".\nTelecoms company Telenor Myanmar, which is part of the Norwegian Telenor Group, said it would comply with the order to block Facebook, but suggested in a statement that this breached human rights law. \nA small protest has taken place in front of a university in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay, with reports of four arrests. \nIn Yangon, residents banged cooking pots for a second night running. \nA woman in the city told the BBC: \"We bang drums as we want the military government and the world to know that we don't agree with this military coup... I want our leader Aung San Suu Kyi back.\" \nAt least 70 lawmakers with the NLD are refusing to leave a government guest house in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, and have declared what they are calling a new parliamentary session, BBC Burmese reports. \nThe lawmakers are among hundreds who were confined by the military to guest houses before being told they were free to leave. \nThe streets are for the most part calm with no sign of major protest and a night-time curfew in force. \nHowever, hospitals have seen protests. Many medics have either stopped work, or continued while wearing symbols of defiance. \nBut a rally by thousands in support of the military, known as the Tatmadaw, took place in Nay Pyi Taw. Some waved banners saying \"Tatmadaw that loves people\". \nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has meanwhile called for constitutional order to be re-established in Myanmar.\n\"It's absolutely unacceptable to reverse the result of the elections and the will of the people,\" he said. \nThe Security Council adopted a resolution expressing \"deep concern\" and calling for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi. \n\"The members of the Security Council emphasized the need for the continued support of the democratic transition in Myanmar,\" the 15-member council said in a statement agreed by consensus.\nOn Wednesday, the council failed to agree on a statement condemning the coup, after it was blocked by China, which - as one of five permanent members - has a veto. \nBeijing has long played a role of protecting Myanmar from international scrutiny, and has warned since the coup that sanctions or international pressure would only make things worse. \nAlongside Russia, it has repeatedly shielded Myanmar from criticism at the UN over the military crackdown on the Muslim minority Rohingya population.\nMyanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos.\nIt was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, leading to international condemnation and sanctions.\nAung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence.\nA government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community.\nShe has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the November 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.\nHave you been affected by recent events in Myanmar?

      "tags": "Sergio Mattarella,Giuseppe Conte,European Central Bank (ECB),Italy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Italy's president has asked the former head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, to form a new government after the previous coalition collapsed.\nPresident Sergio Mattarella said Italy needed a \"high-profile government\" to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic and the worst economic crisis in decades.\nPoliticians failed to agree a coalition following the resignation of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte last week.\nMr Draghi will now have to put forward an administration that leaders support.\nHe was summoned to Rome's historic Quirinale Palace on Wednesday by President Mattarella, who gave Mr Draghi a mandate and said he hoped he would break the parliamentary stalemate.\nIn a brief statement after accepting the challenge, Mr Draghi said Italy was facing a \"difficult moment\" and that it was time for unity. \"I am confident that in talks with parliamentary and other groups, we will find unity and the ability to find a responsible solution.\"\nItaly's financial markets welcomed the news that the country's star technocrat had been brought in, with the Milan stock market up almost 3%. On paper, Mr Draghi has impeccable credentials, BBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen reports.\nPolitical parties have been divided over how to spend \u20ac222bn (\u00a3195bn; $267bn) of EU Covid recovery funds, amid a pandemic in which nearly 90,000 Italians have died - the sixth highest death toll in the world.\nHowever, Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), which has been in government since 2018, has already said that it will not back a government led by Mr Draghi. \nSometimes referred to as \"Super Mario\" - after the hero Italian character in a Nintendo video game - Mr Draghi steered the eurozone through the financial crisis during his eight years as president of the European Central Bank (ECB).\nSome analysts and commentators credit him with saving both the eurozone and the euro currency. \nThe eurozone financial crisis was already a serious problem when Mr Draghi took office at the ECB in November 2011. At its height, the crisis raised concerns that the eurozone could break up altogether.\nMr Draghi responded by promising to do \"whatever it takes to preserve the euro\", calling for \"urgent action\" to implement a substantial bailout fund.\nHis call for governments to come together and play their role in tackling the debt crisis collectively was initially met with resistance from Germany, but it eventually paid off.\nEconomies began to grow and subsequently no country left the eurozone. \nIn his statement on Wednesday he said the challenges Italy now faced were \"beating the pandemic, completing the vaccination campaign, offering answers to everyday challenges and getting the country back on track\".\n\"Mario Draghi was the Italian who saved Europe, and I think now he is the European who can save Italy,\" former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told the BBC's Newshour programme.\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a technocrat like Mr Draghi, resigned last week after losing his Senate majority - which restricted his ability to perform government business - and failing to form a new coalition. \nThe political turmoil came about when former PM Matteo Renzi pulled his small, liberal Italia Viva party out of the centrist coalition government over Mr Conte's plans for spending EU recovery funds on the coronavirus crisis. He said he would only return if Mr Conte accepted a list of demands.\nMr Conte then won a vote of confidence in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, but he then scraped through a Senate vote without an absolute majority. He said he hoped his resignation would result in the creation of a stronger coalition government.\nHe had previously led two very different, successive coalition governments from 2018. For 15 months he headed a coalition between M5S and the far-right League, until its leader Matteo Salvini pulled out in a failed bid to force elections. Mr Conte then led a four-party, centre-left coalition dominated by M5S and the Democratic Party (PD).\nMr Renzi said there was now a good opportunity for Italy to find a new direction. \"In a time of difficulty, that is the period in which we are to risk change, to invest in the future - if we're not now able to change strategy, we risk also destroying [Italy] post-pandemic.\" "

      "tags": "GDP,UK economy,Bank of England,Andrew Bailey",
      "text": "The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccination programme will help the economy bounce back strongly this year, according to the Bank of England.\nThe economy is expected to shrink 4.2% in the first three months of 2021, amid tighter lockdown restrictions to slow the spread of the virus.\nBut policymakers expect a rebound this spring as consumer confidence returns.\nThe Bank also told High Street lenders to prepare for negative interest rates, even as it ruled out an imminent move.\nThe UK economy is expected to \"recover rapidly\" in 2021, with a successful vaccination programme supporting a \"material recovery in household spending\".\nAndrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, described the vaccine rollout as \"excellent news\" that would speed up a return to normal life.\n\"We do think that that is going to support a sustained recovery throughout the rest of the year,\" he said.\nIts latest Monetary Policy Report said the positive vaccine news had driven an increase in UK holiday bookings later this year, although overseas bookings remained muted.\nWhile government support schemes are expected to limit any immediate increase in unemployment, the jobless rate is still projected to rise to 7.8% later this year as the furlough scheme winds down.  \nThe most recent unemployment rate - for September to November - was 5.0%, \nHowever, policymakers said the outlook for the economy remained \"unusually uncertain\".\nThe Bank said the rebound in economic activity would depend on controlling any new strains of the virus, as well as households' willingness to spend.\nIt said most people now expect \"life to return to normal\" within a year.\nBut some voluntary social distancing was likely to persist, as it has done in economies where restrictions have already been eased substantially.\nIn New Zealand, for example, spending on restaurants and hotels has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\nThe Bank said: \"The Covid vaccination programme would be expected to lead to an easing of social distancing restrictions, reduced economic uncertainty and higher activity, although the timing of those effects is hard to predict.\"\nMillions of workers remain on the government's furlough scheme, while redundancies increased sharply at the end of last year.\nHowever, many high earners working from home have saved more during the pandemic.\nThe Bank said \u00a3125bn more was squirrelled away in UK savings accounts last year.\n\"That figure is likely to rise substantially further over the first half of 2021,\" the Bank said.\nPolicymakers believe retired households, which have received vaccines sooner, will start spending first.\nGreater job security is also expected to lead to higher spending.\nHowever, the Bank noted that 70% of the people it surveyed planned to keep their extra money in savings instead of spending it.\nSales of new cars are also expected to remain subdued, though concerns about using public transport have pushed up sales of second-hand vehicles.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held interest rates at a record low of 0.1% on Thursday.\nFollowing a review, it has also asked High Street banks to get ready for the possibility that they could fall below zero in the future.\nThe term \"interest rates\" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate.\nDescribed as the \"single most important interest rate in the UK\", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow.\nHigh Street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage.\nThe Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less.\nIn theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated.\nAfter all, why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money, when they can keep the cash at home for free?\nThe Bank stressed that commercial lenders needed at least six months to prepare and this did not mean that negative rates were \"imminent, or indeed in prospect at any time\". \nMr Bailey added: \"My message to the markets is you really should not try to read the future behaviour of the MPC from these decisions and these actions we're taking on the toolbox.\n\"Nobody should take any signal from this.\"\nThe Bank of England is not just counting jobs and prices, but vaccinations too. \nOn this basis, despite the current three months seeing a lockdown-inflicted fall in the economy, policymakers are more confident about the timing of recovery, in the middle of this year. \nIndeed, that recovery will be mathematically sharper than previously predicted, because of the further drop right now. As the Bank concludes in its forecast \"GDP picks up strongly\" as restrictions are assumed to ease between April and September.\nIn terms of its decisions, that means the Bank has held fire, leaving interest rates at historic lows. Not one of the nine panel members deciding rates voted for the much-hyped \"negative rates\" seen in Europe. \nCommercial banks will be asked to prepare in the next months, so the lever is an option, but the Bank of England was at pains to say this was not a signal of intentions. \nThe Bank was also clear that the post-Brexit trading rules will hit the economy, and that there are new \"barriers\" likely to lower trade between the UK and EU, some which are yet to emerge. This goes beyond the government's repeated claims that such changes are \"teething problems\".\nThe big message, though, is a more confident assertion that the economy, as well as the people, will be inoculated by the summer."

      "text": "Police should be given kits to test for corrosive substances during street searches to help tackle acid attack crimes, according to a study.\nThere should also be greater controls on the sale of corrosive substances, say researchers. \nThe findings come in a Home Office report looking into the motives of criminals who carry and use acid.\nIt found the substances are used in attacks because they are easy to obtain and can be concealed from police.\nResearchers from Leicester University interviewed 25 prisoners in England and Wales and looked at 600 crimes involving corrosive substances for the report.\nIt is the first study looking at the motives of those who carry out acid attacks and was commissioned by the Home Office following a spate of incidents - mainly in London - in 2017.\nSpeaking to serving prisoners, researchers found that, unlike guns, \"most corrosives were considered easy to obtain. Indeed, many forms of corrosives that were used (such as low concentrate ammonia) were available online or from high street retailers\".\nOffenders, who tended to be young men, described acid as an adaptable weapon that can be used in many crimes. \nThey also told researchers they didn't fear detection by the police because it was much easier to conceal acid than a knife or a gun.\nThe report found that over half of the corrosive crimes analysed occurred in areas that are in the top 20% most deprived locations. \nHousehold products such as bleach were the most commonly used corrosive substance to commit crimes such as domestic violence, but ammonia often featured in robberies.\n\"It was noted that often using stop and search powers in such cases was problematic, and also there were particular issues with being able to accurately identify when a liquid in a bottle was a corrosive, given it was often a clear liquid,\" the study said. \nIt also found one of the big issues was the \"ease with which one can legitimately buy and carry corrosives\".\nThe report's authors also suggested there should be mandatory reporting to the police of corrosive attacks and better education around the dangers of acid."

      "text": "The company behind the controversial free school meals that sparked an outcry in January has apologised again.\n\"The quality and quantity of some food parcels fell short of our usual high standards,\" said Compass, which owns Chartwells, the school meal supplier.\nThe meals led to a row when one mum posted a picture of them on Twitter.\nCompass investigated the meals and said it had now \"taken several corrective measures\".\nThey include improved supply chain processes, additional guidance and resources for workers, and stronger quality assurance checks.\nChartwells has also been providing breakfasts to all children currently receiving a lunch parcel from it since 25 January. \n\"We will also provide those same children with lunch and breakfast parcels through the February half term break,\" Compass said, with the firm promising to cover the costs of doing so.\nFood parcels are currently being sent to school children in England who would normally get free school meals.\nIn January, one mother calling herself Roadside Mum posted a photo on Twitter of the free school meal that had been supplied to her and was supposedly worth \u00a330.\nIt consisted of two carrots, two potatoes and a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items: she calculated the cost to be only about \u00a35.\nThe outcry led to an urgent investigation by the government after footballer Marcus Rashford said the food parcels were \"just not good enough\" and food poverty campaigner Jack Monroe accused the company of providing a \"poverty picnic\".\nChartwells acknowledged the food was insufficient.\nIn a statement at the time it said: \"In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.\"\nIn its latest trading update, Compass said: \"We have apologised to everyone who has been affected.\"\nCompass reported improved figures for the last three months with its operating margin climbing to 2.7% to the end of December compared to 0.6% in the previous three months.\nIt put that down to \"a series of actions we have taken over the last year to adapt our operations and to manage our cost base more flexibly, including contract renegotiations and resizing of the business\".\nHowever, it said the group's organic revenue for the three months to 31 December 2020 was down 33.7%, which was \"in line with our expectations, given the protracted lockdown measures to contain the virus during the winter months\".\nIt warned that \"although the news around vaccinations is encouraging, the pace of volume recovery remains uncertain\".\nBut looking ahead it said it expected \"a return to organic revenue growth, continued margin improvement and returns to shareholders over time\".\nSophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"From an investment perspective, this [school meals] chapter has been an unwelcome addition to what is a torrid time for Compass, and won't have done the company's reputation any favours.\"\nContract catering is an incredibly tough place to be when the world shuts down, she pointed out.\nVolumes are barely edging forwards, meaning the bottom line is being protected through cost cutting.\n\"That's prudent business sense, but isn't a long-term solution. If it takes too long for stadiums and schools to fill back up, Compass will struggle to pump margins up any time soon.\""

He was released in 2016.\nThe MoJ imposed new conditions on Latif's licence after Usman Khan's murderous London Bridge attack while on licence following his early release.\nLatif claimed the MoJ acted unlawfully.\nThe MoJ is defending itself against Latif's claim and argues the additional licence conditions imposed on him are lawful.\nThe nine men jailed in 2012, which included Khan, had also tried to raise funds to build a terrorist training camp in Pakistan and recruit British people to attend.\nLatif, now 36, was 28 when he was jailed for 10 years and four months for attending meetings with the intention of assisting others to prepare or commit acts of terrorism.\nLatif was automatically released from prison halfway through his sentence in February 2016, but was recalled to prison the following September over allegations he tampered with his electronic monitoring tag.\nLatif, who said the damage to his tag most likely occurred when he was playing football, was again released on licence in May 2018 on terms set by the Parole Board.\nOn 29 November 2019, Khan fatally stabbed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, during a prisoner rehabilitation event at Fishmongers' Hall, near London Bridge, in central London while out on licence.\nKhan had been released from jail on licence in 2018, halfway through a 16-year sentence for terrorism offences.\nFive days later, Latif, who maintains he had \"no contact\" with Khan since they were in the same prison in 2016, was told that \"senior officials\" at the MoJ had imposed new conditions on his licence.\nHis lawyers say the additional conditions, which prevent him from attending \"any meetings or gatherings of more than 50 people\", or entering the City of London without prior permission, are unlawful.\nAt a High Court hearing on Wednesday, Dan Squires QC said Justice Secretary Robert Buckland appeared to have \"personally\" requested additional licence conditions for all terrorist offenders following the London Bridge attack.\nMr Squires argued the MoJ \"has no power unilaterally to add to or vary conditions on [Latif's] licence without the approval of the Parole Board,\" meaning the new conditions were unlawful.\nLatif \"had no involvement in, or prior knowledge of, the London Bridge attack\" and was \"horrified to hear of the attack and the role of Khan in it\", Mr Squires said.\nThe hearing before the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Swift is expected to conclude on Thursday morning."

      "tags": "Leicester",
      "text": "A university is facing growing anger over its plans to drop English language and medieval literature modules and introduce a \"decolonised curriculum\".\nThe University of Leicester said it was considering cutting subjects after a \"drop in demand\", and instead focusing on ethnicity, sexuality and diversity.\nBut the idea has been met with dismay by a number of academics and students.\nSince the plans were announced, some university staff have also received abusive messages online.\nAmong those opposed to the changes is Professor Isobel Armstrong, a fellow of the British Academy, who has returned her honorary doctorate from the university in protest.\nThe Leicester branch of the University and College Union (UCU) said Prof Armstrong made her decision \"in protest at the egregious attack on the integrity of English at Leicester and the attempt to eradicate 1,000+ years of language and literature from the curriculum\".\nAn examiner for the university's English Studies MA, Professor Catherine Clarke, has also resigned.\nProf Clarke said: \"This [is] either a cynical exploitation of the language of 'decolonisation', or genuine (and appalling) ignorance of the work medieval and early modern subjects can contribute to this endeavour.\"\nShe urged the university to \"reconsider these proposals\" as they \"will diminish the experience of students at Leicester and limit their future opportunities\". \nIn January, the University of Leicester announced a consultation over proposals across a number of departments. It also plans to cut 60 posts, putting 145 staff at risk of redundancy.\nUnder the restructuring, the English department would no longer teach medieval literature due to \"a drop in demand from undergraduate and postgraduate students in recent years\".\nIf adopted, the changes would also mean the university discontinuing BA English with English language, and MA English Language and Linguistics.\nThe university said it planned to introduce \"a range of modules which are excitingly innovative\", focusing on subjects such as race, ethnicity, sexuality and diversity.\nIts spokeswoman said \"decolonising the curriculum\" meant \"reconsidering how the subject is taught \"to make it more inclusive and reflect emerging developments\". \n\"For example, many reading lists are dominated by white authors,\" she said.\n\"This ignores many great BAME scholars and also means that BAME students do not see themselves reflected in what they are being taught.\" \nBut she said the work was unconnected to the proposed redundancies and removal of courses.\nA total of 56% of last year's undergraduate students at the university classed themselves as BAME, the university added.\nDr Shazia Jagot, who studied at the University of Leicester, said the changes could directly impact the education of students from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds.\nIn an article for Times Higher Education Dr Jagot, who describes herself as working class and \"of South Asian heritage\", wrote: \"What happens when you remove the opportunity for students, particularly black and ethnic minority students, to read Beowulf, Chaucer and Milton? \n\"They are robbed of the chance to read texts foundational to the history of English literature and to engage in the rich, energetic work that is tackling racism, white supremacy and sexism in the discipline.\"\nFinal year English student Rhiannon Jenkins said: \"We want decolonisation, the student body does want decolonisation. \n\"But we disagree that decolonisation is synonymous with redundancies, and we disagree that it's synonymous with getting rid of medievalism and early modern English literature.\"\nThe 21-year-old, who is the course representative for final year English students, said: \"We think that [the university has] used this rhetoric of decolonisation to suggest that the English department haven't done any work towards it, and suggest that medievalism and early modern literature has no place for decolonisation in it.\"\nMs Jenkins also said the university would not allow the English department to poll first year students to find out what modules they were interested in. \nA University of Leicester spokesperson said: \"This is not the case - the university's module selection process for next year's English course has not yet commenced.\"\nThe English Association, an organisation devoted to studying and teaching the English language, is based at the university. It said it was \"shocked to hear of the proposed closure of English Language and Medieval Studies at the university\". \nLeicester academic David Clark, who shared an extract of the proposals on Twitter said he was \"bemused by the implication none of us already teaches/writes about... decolonising the curriculum.\"\nA university spokeswoman stressed English would still be offered as a course subject, and said: \"We will continue to offer a wide chronological range, covering hundreds of years of English literature - enabling students to experience the scope of literature they tell us they want to see in an English curriculum today.\"\nBut she said the university could not \"continue to offer modules that consistently attract small and ever-declining numbers\".\n\"We are now in an extensive, 90-day consultation period and are engaging closely with unions, staff, students and external stakeholders,\" she said.\nSince the plans were announced, the university said several staff had been harassed online.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"Some staff have received abusive messages following some inaccurate reports in the media and we are providing the necessary support for them.\n\"We also had some staff receiving abuse for doing research in related areas.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

      "tags": "Television,Film,Golden Globes",
      "text": "Three women have been nominated for best director at the Golden Globe awards - the first time more than one has been shortlisted in a single year.\nRegina King, Chloe Zhao and Emerald Fennell are up for the prize, which had only previously nominated five women in the Golden Globes' 77-year history.\nMank leads the overall film awards race with six nominations, while The Crown leads the TV categories, also with six.\nSacha Baron Cohen and Olivia Colman are among the Britons up for acting awards.\nThe nominations belatedly fired the starting gun for this year's Hollywood awards season, which has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nAaron Sorkin's film drama The Trial of the Chicago 7 and TV comedy Schitt's Creek also performed well, with five nominations each.\nBaron Cohen, Colman and Anya Taylor-Joy all scooped two acting nominations each.\nBaron Cohen said he felt \"overwhelmed and humbled\" to be recognised for the films Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and The Trial of the Chicago 7.\n\"These two films are different, but they share a common theme,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Sometimes we have to protest injustice with our own farce.\"\nHe went on to joke that he had already hired Rudy Giuliani, former President Trump's lawyer, to contest the results. The star also has a third nomination, as a producer of the Borat sequel.\nTaylor-Joy, meanwhile, was shortlisted for Netflix's chess drama The Queen's Gambit and for the Jane Austen film adaptation Emma.\nColman, who won best actress in a TV drama for playing the Queen in Netflix's The Crown last year, could repeat that this year, and is also shortlisted for her forthcoming film The Father.\nFour of Colman's The Crown co-stars were also nominated - Emma Corrin (Princess Diana), Josh O'Connor (Prince Charles), Gillian Anderson (Margaret Thatcher) and Helena Bonham Carter (Princess Margaret).\nBookmakers have made the show's fourth season the favourite to win best TV drama ahead of Lovecraft Country, The Mandalorian, Ozark and Ratched. That's all despite a row over how the show portrays the Royal Family.\nSeries creator Peter Morgan said everyone involved in the Netflix series was \"thrilled to be recognised in this way\".\n\"This season really seems to have resonated with audiences of all generations all around the world,\" he said. \"We could not be more grateful or more proud.\"\nBritish stars Riz Ahmed, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman will compete for best actor in a film drama for Sound of Metal, The Father and Mank.\nThey are joined by the late Chadwick Boseman, recognised posthumously for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, and French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim, nominated for The Mauritanian.\nVanessa Kirby and Carey Mulligan are both in the running for best actress in a film drama for Pieces of a Woman and Promising Young Woman respectively.\nSmall Axe, the landmark series of BBC films that director Steve McQueen has billed as \"love letters to black resilience and triumph in London's West Indian community\", received a nomination for best limited series or TV movie. And John Boyega, who played a pioneering police officer in one instalment, was nominated for best supporting TV actor.\nMcQueen told Entertainment Weekly the nominations were \"incredible\", adding: \"I think what's wonderful about it is that something so modest in what we tried to do has gotten recognised in this way.\"\nOther British stars on the shortlists include Rosamund Pike, Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya, Jodie Comer, Matthew Rhys and Nicholas Hoult.\nHugh Grant was nominated for best actor in a TV limited series for The Undoing, the same award he won in 2019 for A Very English Scandal. His co-star Nicole Kidman is up against Daisy Edgar-Jones, star of the BBC's Normal People, for the female equivalent.\nLily Collins was nominated for Netflix hit Emily In Paris - but there was no space for Michaela Coel or her acclaimed BBC drama I May Destroy You.\nEmerald Fennell will be familiar to The Crown viewers for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles. The Brit wasn't nominated for her acting - but was nominated for Promising Young Woman, her first feature film as director.\nShe was also nominated for best screenplay for writing the dark comic thriller, and was previously chief writer on the second series of Killing Eve.\nFilm and TV fans will also know Regina King, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for acting in 2018's If Beale Street Could Talk, and has now moved behind the camera with One Night in Miami.\nAnd Chinese director Chloe Zhao has become the first woman of Asian descent to be up for the Golden Globes' best director prize, for Nomadland.\nThe last female director to be nominated for best director was Ava DuVernay for Selma in 2014, and the only woman ever to have won is Barbra Streisand for Yentl in 1984.\nNomadland and Promising Young Woman are also nominated for best film drama alongside Mank, The Trial of the Chicago 7 and The Father.\nThe Globes split most awards between dramas and musicals/comedies, and the nominees for best musical/comedy film include Music, the directorial debut of pop star Sia.\nBut her film has attracted controversy for its casting of dancer Maddie Ziegler as a young girl on the autism spectrum.\nActress Ruth Madeley, who has spina bifida, expressed solidarity with \"every #ActuallyAutistic person who is rightly devastated to see #Sia\"s Music nominated\".\n\"Disabled people are needed in the industry now more than ever to help change the narrative we're all so sick of,\" she wrote on Twitter.\nMusic is up against the Borat sequel, the Disney+ recording of Broadway hit Hamilton, time loop comedy Palm Springs and Netflix film The Prom.\nJames Corden was a surprise nominee for best actor in a musical or comedy for The Prom, after he was criticised for taking on a character who is, by his own admission, \"as a gay as a bucket of wigs\".\nWith the cinema shutdown and delays to many films, streaming has gained the upper hand over the past year. As a result, Netflix leads the Golden Globes field with 22 out of the 70 film nominations and 20 out of 54 film nominations - giving the streaming giant one third of all nominations in total.\nYet there was no room for its period drama Bridgerton, despite the show becoming the service's \"biggest series ever\".\nPresented annually by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the Golden Globes are the most prestigious movie awards behind the Oscars.\nThis year's winners will be announced at the end of this month in a bi-coastal ceremony hosted by Tina Fey in New York and Amy Poehler in Los Angeles.\nIn a normal year, many of the nominees would be expected to be among the Academy Award nominations. But this is not a normal year. The Oscars will take place two months later than normal, having been put back from the date - 28 February - that the Globes ceremony now occupies.\nThe eligibility period for this year's Oscars has been extended by two months, meaning films released in cinemas or online before the end of February could be in contention.\nThis may not end up making much of a difference - although it could mean that the Globes' traditional role as an awards season indicator may not be as reliable as it sometimes has been.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It's time, get out,\" one user tweeted, while another urged athletes to boycott the Games if Mr Mori kept his job.\nMr Mori told Japan's Mainichi newspaper that female family members had also lambasted him.\n\"Last night, my wife gave me a thorough scolding. She said: 'You've said something bad again, haven't you? I'm going to have to suffer again because you've antagonised women,'\" he said.\n\"This morning, my daughter and granddaughter scolded me as well,\" the paper quoted him as saying.\nAt a press conference on Thursday, he was asked on what basis he said women board members were too long-winded.\n\"I don't talk to women that much lately, so I don't know,\" Mr Mori replied.\nResponding to questions in parliament, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the remarks should not have been made.\nThe Tokyo Olympics organising committee - which has 36 executive board members - is tasked with \"ensuring the successful delivery of the Olympic and Paralympic Games\", which have been delayed by a year because of the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe committee takes its members from various organisations including the Japanese Olympic and Paralympic Committees, the Tokyo metropolitan government, and Japan's national government."

      "tags": "Unemployment,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Employment,Unemployment in the UK,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Businesses are reopening and more people are going back to their place of work, as lockdown is lifted.\nMeasures like the furlough scheme have helped to protect jobs during the pandemic, but the number of people out of work is still expected to grow.\nThe most recent unemployment rate - for January to March, when most of the restrictions were still in place - was 4.8%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). \nThe that means about one in 20 people who want a job can't find one.\nThat's more than at the start of the pandemic. \nHowever, despite lockdown, the unemployment rate has fallen slightly since the autumn.\nThis has surprised most economists, who were expecting unemployment to be much higher. \nIt is partly because businesses have become better at coping with lockdowns, as well as the government spending billions of pounds supporting jobs.\nMost economists expect the unemployment rate to rise a little later this year even though it is hoped more restrictions can be lifted.\nThat is because many government support schemes - such as furlough - are due to end after September.\nThe Bank of England expects the unemployment rate to reach around 5.5% in the autumn. \nHowever, the number of unemployed is expected to fall next year as the economy continues to recover. \nYoung people have been particularly badly hit by the pandemic. \nShops, pubs, restaurants and entertainment were unable to fully open and these are areas where lots of young people work. \nOver the past year the number of under-25s on company payrolls fell by 289,000.\nRecord numbers of young people are also choosing to stay in education, and are not looking for work.\nThe ONS said that the latest figures show \"early signs\" of a recovery in the jobs market.\nThere was a rise in the number of vacancies, to the highest level since the pandemic began. \nSome businesses, like restaurants and bars, now say they are struggling to find the workers they need to reopen. \nThe number of people being made redundant has also been falling, though it is still higher than it was before the pandemic began.\nWithout the billions spent on schemes to protect jobs, and the rapid roll-out of vaccines, the unemployment rate would have been much higher. Last year it was feared that up to four million people would be unemployed.\nUnder the furlough scheme, the government has helped many businesses keep their staff on by helping to pay their wages.\nThe furlough scheme has protected more than 11 million jobs since the pandemic began, and four million workers were on furlough at the end of March. The scheme will continue until the end of September.\nThe start of the pandemic saw a big increase in the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits - far more than the rise in the number of people counted as unemployed. \nIn April 2021 there were 2.6 million seeking either Jobseeker's Allowance or universal credit because they were \"searching for work\". This compares with 1.4 million in March 2020, before the pandemic began to take effect. \nHowever, some of these people are working, but with either low wages or short hours. \nThe ONS says it cannot tell how many claimants are out of work, or whether they are now able to get universal credit because the rules for claiming it have changed.

      "text": "Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell sank to a net loss of $21.7bn (\u00a316bn) last year after the coronavirus pandemic caused demand to slump.\nThe announcement comes after two of its rivals, BP and Exxon, posted similar big losses.\nLooking ahead, Shell said \"significant uncertainty\" would continue to have a negative impact on demand for oil and gas products.\nAs a result, it said it might need to take measures to cut production.\nIn September last year, Shell announced that up to 9,000 jobs would go worldwide as the company responded to the effects of the pandemic.\nLast month, it said it was cutting 330 jobs from its operations in the North Sea.\nEven before the virus struck, the oil industry was already having to rethink its future plans as part of the transition away from fossil fuels.\nThe Covid impact means companies such as Shell are accelerating that transition.\nSome doom-mongers were anticipating Royal Dutch Shell might unveil the largest-ever UK corporate loss, but in the end, the Anglo-Dutch oil group managed to get only halfway there. The \u00a316bn deficit is dwarfed by the \u00a330bn loss posted by Royal Bank of Scotland at the height of the 2008 banking crisis. \nThe Shell results will also quickly be forgotten. They are largely accounting rather than cash losses, the result of a giant write-down in the future value of the company's oil fields and prospects. Already investors are turning their attention to next week, when chief executive Ben van Beurden will present the company's long-awaited plans to shift the company towards greener forms of energy. \nPension funds and other big investors are pushing hard to get Shell to do more. The same pension funds, however, are reliant on the big stream of dividends that flows from the oil business. They will be hoping that Mr van Beurden will be able to pull off the trick of using that income to fund the investments in green energy that will - hopefully - yield a similar juicy dividend income in the future.\nOther big oil companies are also feeling the strain. On Tuesday, BP reported that it lost $18.1bn in 2020, marking its first annual loss in a decade.\nOn the same day, US giant Exxon Mobil posted annual losses of $22.4bn.\nTwo other big US firms, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, reported big losses as well.\nThere are also indications of a potential shake-up in the sector, after media reports emerged this week that Exxon and Chevron held preliminary talks last year on a possible merger.\nThe two firms declined to comment, but sources told Reuters that the discussions involved Exxon chief executive Darren Woods and his counterpart at Chevron, Mike Wirth.\n\"This week's huge losses by Shell, BP and Exxon reflect the challenges oil and gas companies face,\" said David Elmes, professor of practice and head of the Global Energy Research Network at Warwick Business School.\n\"They are skating on ever-thinning ice as the effects of climate change combine with other events like the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\nProf Elmes said the slump in demand for oil and gas due to the pandemic had become more prolonged than initially hoped.\n\"There will be some ongoing need for oil and gas as a fuel for a while yet. There will also be demand for the petrochemicals and other products made from them. But that can't sustain the industry we've seen in the past as we look to address climate change.\""

      "text": "An Iranian diplomat has been convicted of a plot to bomb a big French rally held by an exiled opposition group.\nAssadollah Assadi, 49, who worked at the Iranian embassy in Vienna, was given a 20-year jail term by the court in Antwerp in Belgium.\nIt was the first time an Iranian official had faced such charges in the EU since the 1979 revolution.\nThree others were also convicted. They were arrested during a joint operation by German, French and Belgian police.\nTehran insists the plot was a fabrication.\nTens of thousands of people attended the June 2018 rally outside Paris, including Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\nThe verdict comes weeks after US President Joe Biden took office, with Iran hoping he will reverse some of the sanctions introduced by his predecessor.\nFrance blamed Iran's intelligence ministry for the planned attack and responded by freezing the assets of two senior Iranian officials. \nProsecution lawyer Georges-Henri Beauthier told reporters the ruling showed two things: \"A diplomat cannot just do anything. He has immunity related to his position, he does not have immunity for criminal and terrorist acts he committed.\"\nIn a statement, an Iranian foreign ministry official strongly objected to Assadi's arrest, trial and sentencing, condemning the process as \"illegal and a clear violation of international law, especially the 1961 Vienna Convention (on diplomatic relations)\". \nMaryam Rajavi, the leader of the group targeted by the plot, described the conviction as \"a brilliant victory for the people and resistance of Iran and a heavy political and diplomatic defeat for the regime\".\nIn a statement she claimed the plot had been authorised at the highest levels in Iran, by the president and supreme leader and that the intelligence ministry had been given the task of carrying it out.\nAssadi was arrested in Germany in June 2018, days after he met a Belgian couple of Iranian origin at a Pizza Hut in Luxembourg. They were being watched during their stay in Luxembourg by local intelligence.\nNasimeh Naami and Amir Saadouni were arrested in Brussels with half a kilogram (1.1lb) of explosives and a detonator, which prosecutors said was to be used against an Iranian opposition meeting in France. Belgium's Dovo bomb disposal unit released a report detailing how the TATP explosive was carried along with batteries, an antenna and a remote-control finger-operated button transmitter, or RFT (below).\nThe couple admitted receiving the package from Assadi, but denied knowing what was inside. \nA fourth man, Belgian-Iranian poet Merhad Arefani, was arrested in Paris and accused of being an accomplice. All three were convicted of taking part in the plot and given jail terms of 15 to 18 years.\nThe plot centred around a rally held by the exiled National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) outside Paris in June 2018. \nThe event was attended by thousands of Iranians living in Europe, as well as international political figures.\nThe NCRI is considered to be the political arm of Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK), a dissident group that backs the overthrow of the Islamic Republic. \nThe group, which Iran has designated as a terrorist organisation, assassinated a number of high-profile Iranians during the 1980s, but has since become a powerful lobbying group abroad.\nThere were cheers inside the Antwerp court and then singing and chanting outside, as Iranian opposition activists celebrated the verdict. \nA few dozen waved the opposition flag of Iran as armed police looked on. \nRaha Heshmatikhah, a 24-year-old student who had travelled from the Netherlands, told me she was happy but also scared that there may be retaliation from authorities in Tehran. \nShe was at the Paris rally in 2018 that was the intended target of the bombing.

      "text": "The US government has said it is \"deeply disturbed\" by a BBC report detailing allegations of systematic rape of Uighur women in Chinese camps.\n\"These atrocities shock the conscience and must be met with serious consequences,\" a spokesperson said.\nA UK government minister, Nigel Adams, said in parliament on Thursday that the report showed \"clearly evil acts\".\nAccording to estimates, more than a million Uighurs and other minorities have been detained in camps in China. \nAn investigation published by the BBC on Wednesday contained first-hand testimony of systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture of women detainees by police and guards.\nChina's foreign ministry has denied the allegations, accusing the BBC of making a \"false report\".\nSpokesman Wang Wenbin said there was \"no systemic sexual assault and abuse against women\" and China operated all of its facilities within guidelines on human rights. \n\"China is a country [ruled] by law, our constitution guarantees and protects human rights, and it is embodied in our legal system under which governments work,\" he said. \nThe testimony given to the BBC detailed allegations of rape and sexual abuse of Uighur women detained in China's internment camps in the Xinjiang region. \nOne woman told the BBC that women were removed from their cells \"every night\" and raped by one or more masked Chinese men. Tursunay Ziawudun, who fled the region after her release and is now in the US, said she was tortured and later gang-raped on three occasions, each time by two or three men.\nA Kazakh woman from Xinjiang who was detained for 18 months in the camp system said she was forced to strip Uighur women naked and handcuff them, before leaving them alone with Chinese men. \nThe Chinese men \"would pay money to have their pick of the prettiest young inmates\", said Gulzira Auelkhan. \"They forced me to take off those women's clothes and to restrain their hands and leave the room,\" she said.\nA former guard at one of the camps, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described torture and food deprivation of inmates.\nAdrian Zenz, a leading expert on China's policies in Xinjiang, said the testimony gathered by the BBC was \"some of the most horrendous evidence I have seen since the atrocity began.\n\"It provides authoritative and detailed evidence of sexual abuse and torture at a level clearly greater than what we had assumed,\" he said.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, a US state department spokesman said: \"We are deeply disturbed by reports, including first-hand testimony, of systematic rape and sexual abuse against women in internment camps for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang\".\n\"These atrocities shock the conscience and must be met with serious consequences.\"\nIn an urgent question to the UK parliament on Friday, MP Nus Ghani said: \"These horrifying stories add to the huge and growing body of evidence detailing atrocities perpetrated by the Chinese authorities in Xinjiang - atrocities which may even be genocidal.\"\nMs Ghani called on UK Minister of State for Asia Nigel Adams to \"make a promise today that no further deepening of any ties of any kind will take place with China until a full judicial inquiry has investigated these crimes\".\nMr Adams said the government was \"leading international efforts to hold China to account\".\n\"Anybody who has seen the BBC report cannot help but be moved and distressed by what are clearly evil acts,\" he said. The UK would continue to work with European nations and the new US administration to pressure China, he added.\nAustralia's Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne also commented on the report, saying the United Nations should be given \"immediate\" access to the region. \n\"We consider transparency to be of utmost importance and continue to urge China to allow international observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, to be given immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang at the earliest opportunity,\" she said.\nHuman rights groups say the Chinese government has gradually stripped away the religious and other freedoms of the Uighurs, culminating in an oppressive system of mass surveillance, detention, indoctrination, and even forced sterilisation. \nIn December, the International Criminal Court rejected an application from Uighurs in exile to investigate China for alleged genocide and crimes against humanity, saying it was unable to act because China was outside its jurisdiction.\nIn January, the outgoing Trump administration declared that China had committed genocide in its repression of the Uighurs - a declaration later endorsed by the new Biden administration.\nChina has consistently denied allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and said the camps were not detention camps, but \"vocational educational and training centres\".

      "tags": "Livingston,Coronavirus vaccines,Ian Blackford,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has said he was not aware of a Covid outbreak at a vaccine factory ahead of his visit last week.\nThe prime minister toured the Valneva vaccine factory in Livingston as part of a trip to Scotland. \nThe company has now said that a number of coronavirus cases had been reported among staff at the site earlier in January. \nBut Valneva has insisted that Mr Johnson's tour of the factory last Thursday was \"Covid secure\". \nMr Johnson told the House of Commons that \"nobody raised that issue with me before or since\".\nBut Downing Street later admitted it had been told in advance of the visit. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"Valneva made us aware that some Covid cases had been reported and they had brought in some Covid secure procedures. \n\"The site director has said if there had been any risk they would not have allowed the visit to go ahead.\"\nMr Johnson said it was his job to visit every part of the country and \"nothing or no one is going to stop me\". \nAnd he said there are \"few things more important\" than the vaccination programme and recognising the work of the scientists involved.\nHis visit to Scotland had already proved controversial, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon questioning at the time whether it was genuinely \"essential\" for the prime minister to travel during the current lockdown restrictions.\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the visit was \"utterly, utterly reckless\" and an \"absolutely shocking error of judgment\".\nHe also accused Mr Johnson of putting \"politics before public health\".\nMr Blackford added: \"What an absolute shambles, that he's gone to a plant where there was a Covid outbreak.\n\"The Daily Record story is very clear, the PM and his advisers knew there was a serious Covid outbreak at this plant, they knew the visit posed a risk but he made a deliberate choice, they made the irresponsible choice.\"\nMr Johnson replied: \"I think what the people of Scotland want to see is the whole country pulling together and working to develop the vaccine as that fantastic plant in Scotland is doing.\n\"One of the advantages of the Valneva vaccine is that it may be able to combat all sorts of variants in a very comprehensive way. It's amazing, wonderful to see Scottish scientists working to do that. I had a fantastic time.\n\"Nobody, by the way, raised that issue with me before or since and it is my job to visit every part of this country, nothing and no-one is going to stop me and I am very, very proud of the record of the government in rolling out the vaccine.\"\nIn a statement, Valneva said \"a number of coronavirus cases were reported among staff\" at the Livingston site last month.\nIt said staff who may have been affected had been self-isolating and that the prime minister's visit was Covid-compliant. \nThe Daily Record quoted Valneva's chief financial officer, David Lawrence, as saying that Downing Street was informed of the outbreak ahead of the trip.\nMr Johnson also visited the Lighthouse Laboratory at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus in Glasgow, where coronavirus tests are processed, and met troops setting up a vaccination centre in Castlemilk.\nI was not aware of Covid cases among workers at Valneva when I visited the site to interview the prime minister on behalf of UK broadcasters last week. \nBoris Johnson made no reference to a Covid outbreak. Neither did anyone from his Downing Street team or from the company. It was simply not mentioned. \nHowever, Valneva appeared to be a highly Covid conscious company on the occasion of the prime minister's visit. \nI was required to fill out a form to confirm details of my health and travel history. I had to wear personal protective equipment including a lab coat, plastic shoe coverings and an industrial grade face covering. As did the PM. \nDowning Street has now confirmed it had been made aware of the cases before Mr Johnson's visit. \nRemarkably, it does not appear to have told the prime minister, having been advised by Valneva it had Covid-secure procedures in place. \nWith the Scottish government facing questions about the progress of the vaccine rollout north of the border, Mr Johnson has repeated the UK government's offer to \"help Scotland with the rollout of vaccines\".\nThe British Army is to start administering the coronavirus vaccine in Scotland for the first time, with 57 personnel deploying on Thursday to help health boards with the vaccine rollout.\nThe medics and management staff will make up a \"vaccine quick reaction force\" which will see five teams of 10 able to deploy across Scotland at short notice.\nThey will be in addition to the 98 members of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards who are already supporting the vaccine effort.\nScotland has been lagging behind the other three UK nations in the overall percentage of people it has vaccinated, with Scotland's health secretary and national clinical director admitting on Tuesday that it needed to speed up the rollout. \nBut at Holyrood, Nicola Sturgeon said more than 38,000 people had received their first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday - the highest daily total so far. \nShe said the Scottish government had focused on getting the most vulnerable vaccinated first, and that the programme was now accelerating. \nThe Scottish Conservatives' Ruth Davidson called for the Scottish government to publish daily breakdowns of vaccination figures for each health board area. \nAnd Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie raised concern that there was a \"growing postcode lottery in vaccine rollout\", which Ms Sturgeon denied. \nAfter outlining cases brought to her attention of people not being told when they will receive their first dose, she told the first minister: \"These examples aren't a one-off but they are part of a growing postcode lottery in vaccine rollout, and it's slowing Scotland's recovery from Covid-19.\n\"The weekly Public Health Scotland figures show a huge variation across the country in the proportion of the population receiving the vaccine.\"\nMs Sturgeon insisted: \"People are not being penalised because of where they live.\n\"There will be differences in speed because of geographies, because of how different health boards are organising this to take account of the differences between urban areas and rural areas, the different sizes of communities, but all health boards are making progress.\""

      "text": "It is \"not practical\" to completely close the UK's borders given the amount of medicines and food imported into the country, the prime minister has said. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions to prevent new coronavirus variants entering the UK.\nBoris Johnson said the government had already tightened travel restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus.\nHe said it would be going ahead with its plan for quarantine hotels for people arriving from Covid hotspots.\nIt is not yet clear when the scheme - announced a week ago - will start or when there will be further details.\nSpeaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said government scientists had recommended \"a complete pre-emptive closure of borders\".\nIn response, Mr Johnson said: \"Actually, Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies) did not recommend a complete ban and they say travel bans should not be relied upon to stop the importation of new variants.\n\"But we do have one of the toughest regimes in the world.\"\nRules around international travel were tightened last month, meaning all travellers must self-isolate for 10 days when they return to the UK.\nThe government also announced plans to make people quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels when arriving in the UK from certain \"high risk\" countries, where new coronavirus variants have been identified.\nThe prime minister said at Wednesday evening's Downing Street briefing that Health Secretary Matt Hancock would make a statement on Thursday to give further details, although No 10 later clarified to say this was not happening.\nLabour chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee Yvette Cooper tweeted in response: \"Oh for heaven's sake. Who is in charge of this borders policy? When will we get details? Does anyone have a grip?\"\nThe UK has placed 33 high-risk countries on a so-called \"red list\", including most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal.\nScotland has announced it will extend the measures to all travellers.\nSir Keir said the government's new border arrangements were \"still weeks away\" from being introduced and would only affect direct flights from some countries.\nHe asked whether the prime minister was saying that \"quarantining all arrivals would make no difference to fighting new variants of the virus\", or that it was \"too difficult to do it\". \nMr Johnson responded by saying that 75% of the UK's medicines come into the country from the European mainland, 45% of food, while 250,000 businesses rely on imports. \n\"It is not practical to completely close off this country as he seems to be suggesting,\" he said.\nIntroducing quarantine hotels is a logistical challenge. \nThe government needs to make sure hotels are ready. That doesn't just mean securing enough rooms and making sure all the guests can have meals delivered, but also coming up with policies around things like security if a guest tries to leave early. \nThe government could use existing guidelines written up by countries such as New Zealand as a template. \nAirlines and airports also have questions about how this will work and some areas are complicated. For instance, the policy currently only applies to arrivals from 33 countries - all of whom will arrive on indirect flights.\nShould airlines separate passengers from low and high-risk countries onboard? \nBut the policy also requires compliance from passengers. If passengers split their tickets and don't declare they've been in one of the 33 high-risk countries, how will the government keep track? \nThere are plenty of questions from all quarters about how to make this policy effective. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps also defended the government's decision not to extend the hotel quarantine policy to arrivals from all countries. \nHe told the Commons Transport Committee: \"The idea that the UK could completely batten down its hatches and remain battened down for a year is mistaken. But also the evidence that that is the only thing you need to do, or primary thing you need to do, is pretty shaky.\"\nMr Shapps also said the hotel quarantine scheme would not affect many people. \n\"The 33 countries on the so-called red list do not have direct flights\u2026 so the numbers we would expect to see returning would be quite low,\" he said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "text": "The leading climate scientist James Hansen has warned Boris Johnson that he risks \u201chumiliation\u201c over plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria.\nThe UK government, which hosts a climate summit this year, has allowed the mine at Whitehaven to go ahead.\nDr Hansen, formerly Nasa's leading global warming researcher, urged the PM to halt production - or be \"vilified\".\nNo 10 said the UK was a world leader on climate change, but would not reverse the local council decision on the mine.\nIn his letter, Dr Hansen - whose testimony before the US Senate helped raise wider awareness of global warming back in 1988 - writes: \"In leading the [climate conference], you have a chance to change the course of our climate trajectory, earning the UK and yourself historic accolades.\n\"Or you can stick with business-almost-as-usual and be vilified around the world. \n\u201cIt would be easy to achieve this latter ignominy and humiliation - just continue with the plan to open a new coal mine in Cumbria in contemptuous disregard of the future of young people and nature. \n\u201cThe contrary path is not so easy, but, with your leadership, it is realistic.\u201d\nDowning Street said the UK is cutting emissions faster than any major economy and would end the use of coal for electricity by 2025.\nMinisters have defended the decision over the coal mine as a local planning matter, but have stressed that industries such as steel production require coking coal - which would have to be imported if it was not produced in the UK.\nA No 10 spokesperson said the prime minister would continue to urge countries to pursue \"clean economic recoveries\" as the UK hosts the COP26 summit in Glasgow this November - the climate meeting to which Mr Hansen refers.\nKeeping the global temperature rise to below 1.5C is considered crucial for avoiding the worst effects of global warming.\nLast week, US climate envoy John Kerry told the BBC that Glasgow will be the \u201clast best chance\u201c the world has for tackling the climate crisis.\nDr Hansen's letter may prove uncomfortable for Mr Johnson, as it has been copied to Mr Kerry.\nThe letter continues: \u201cPrime Minister Johnson, young people are fed up \u2013 and for good reason. They demand that political leaders follow the science and take the actions needed to preserve and restore a healthy climate.\n\u201cIf this [conference] is like the prior ones \u2013 with soothing words and worthless ambitions \u2013 they will be justifiably outraged.\u201d\nThe new coal mine was agreed by Cumbria County Council. \nThe government said approval was a matter for the council, defending the decision by the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick not to exercise his powers to overrule the local authority.\nThe mine will produce coking coal - a grade that is used in steel-making. Although 85% of it is destined for export to Europe, government sources hinted that a need for continuing domestic steel production was another reason for not opposing the mine.\nDr Hansen does acknowledge the UK\u2019s previous climate leadership and its success in reducing emissions.\n\u201cYour progress reflects well on your parliamentary democracy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy wife and I were fortunate to witness the efforts of UK citizens and political leaders during the past two decades as that progress was achieved.\n\"It is our fervent hope that the UK will continue to provide leadership and affect the entire planet.\u201d\nThe letter amplifies criticism at the weekend from the government\u2019s advisory body on global warming, the Climate Change Committee (CCC).\nIt says the Cumbrian mine will increase global emissions and compromise the UK\u2019s legally binding carbon budgets.\nThe CCC said: \u201cThe decision to award planning permission [for the mine] to 2049 will commit the UK to emissions from coking coal.\u201c The body said coking coal will have to stop by 2035 if the country is to meet its climate change targets.\nIn response to the CCC\u2019s letter, a government statement said the decision to allow the coal mine would not be reversed.\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "text": "The government and the EU have vowed to \"work intensively\" to quell tensions over post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports.\nIn a joint statement, both sides said talks on Wednesday with Northern Ireland leaders were \"constructive\".\nThe talks were arranged after checks at some ports were suspended following \"sinister\" threats made to staff.\nUK and EU leaders say they condemn \"unreservedly\" any threats or intimidation.\nVirtual talks between the Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, his EU counterpart, Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Northern Ireland's leaders were held on Wednesday amid an escalating row over applying new trade rules for Northern Ireland. \nThe dispute has arisen because, under the Brexit agreement with the EU, some products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain must be checked on entry.\nThat is because unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has remained in the single market for goods.\nAs a result, some food supplies and online shopping deliveries from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have been subject to delays and staff carrying out inspections have reported threats. \nTensions were also heightened when the EU threatened emergency controls of Covid vaccine exports on the Irish border - a move the bloc later withdrew.\nIn a joint statement, Mr Gove and Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said they would \"work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues\".\nThe UK government and EU Commission reiterated their full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and to the \"proper implementation\" of the Northern Ireland protocol.\nBoth leaders said they condemned unreservedly any threats or intimidation, and stressed that \"the safety and welfare of the people of Northern Ireland\" would always be the \"utmost priority.\"      \nThe BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, says sources told her \"there wasn't much progress\" but both sides have agreed to keep talking.\nThe source added that the EU wasn't in \"sackcloth and ashes\" after it temporarily suspended agreements made as part of the Brexit deal last Friday.\nThe UK government has called for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023.\nHowever writing in the Daily Telegraph, Northern Ireland's First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster warned that simply extending grace periods for businesses would not solve the problem.\nShe said the Northern Ireland Protocol - the arrangements for the Irish border - \"cannot work\" and must be replaced.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, from Sinn Fein, called for calm heads and welcomed Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d's intended visit to the UK next week for further talks, saying it was a \"very pragmatic and very constructive way\" to move forward.\nPart of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, the NI protocol guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products.\nIt was introduced to avoid creating a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nInstead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThis is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left.\nHowever, Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nThe EU announced it would trigger the clause to control exports of vaccines to Northern Ireland, but later reversed the decision.\nUnionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "text": "A company backed by David Beckham, which uses compounds found in cannabis to make skincare and athletic products, plans to sell shares on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).\nCellular Goods has sold a stake to DB Ventures, the former footballer's investment firm, Sky News reported.\nThe company makes its products in labs, rather than from plants.\nIt is part of a growing market for products which use chemicals found in cannabis for skin regimes.\nThe BBC has approached Mr Beckham and DB Ventures for comment. \nTwo of the main active chemicals found in cannabis plans are cannabidiol (CBD) - often used in skincare products - and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).\nWhile THC is a controlled substance, cannabidiol is not.\nCellular Goods aims to sell products from September 2021, according to its website, which will make it the first firm of its kind to debut on the LSE. \nCannabis companies can list on the LSE so long as they are medicinal, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) watchdog decided last year. \nWhile many recreational drug companies have sprung up in the US, where states in including California have legalised it, those companies can't raise money in London, as it is illegal in the UK. \n\"The last few years have seen massive growth and awareness of the importance of wellness and self-care and we believe cannabinoids will prove to be the king of wellness ingredients,\" said Cellular Goods chief executive Alexis Abraham.\n\"The appetite for cannabinoid products is huge and the biosynthetic cannabinoids we will be exclusively using are cleaner, greener, purer, and frankly the future.\"\nSome tests show that stronger forms of CBD can help reduce the number of epileptic seizures in some patients, by more than 40%.\nBut the CBD products you will find on sale right now in the UK all contain CBD at much lower doses.\nUK companies must be careful about what they say about the ability of CBD oils. Not much is known for sure about how effective they are."

      "text": "Children aged three to seven will return to school after the February half-term, the Welsh Government is expected to confirm on Friday.\nMost pupils have been learning from home after a surge in Covid cases led to a Welsh lockdown.\nThe decision would mean the foundation phase of primary schools returning from 22 February.\nBut the head of one teaching union said they would not support the move without assurances about teacher safety. \nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams is expected to make the announcement at a lunchtime press conference on Friday.\nIt follows a fall in the number of infections, and negotiations with teaching trade unions, who have called for teachers to be in the priority list for vaccinations.\nThe Welsh Government had been under pressure to set out plans for a return to face-to-face teaching after weeks of lockdown.\nIt comes as other parts of the UK consider when children can return to face-to-face teaching.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said 8 March was the earliest date schools in England could reopen and that \"depends on lots of things going right\".\nIn Northern Ireland pupils will not return to school until 8 March at the earliest while Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools start a phased reopening.\nThe Covid case rate in Wales is currently the lowest of the UK nations.\nIt now stands at 126 per 100,000 people over seven days - a fall from about 700 before Christmas.\nEarlier, teachers' union NASUWT said a joint group of unions had given the Welsh Government a list of \"mitigations\" they wanted to see put in place.\nThey include strict social distancing, medical grade masks for teachers in the foundation phase and a \"further consideration of a flexible and phased return\".\nNeil Butler, its national officer in Wales, said on Friday the union would not support the return to school unless a number of those mitigations were taken on board. \nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"We've got no indication of what's going to be changed in the operational guidance which fits into those mitigations that we want to see.\n\"If the operational guidance has taken nothing on board in terms of the joint union mitigation list then we're not going to be able to support this return on the 22nd.\"\nUcac general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said there needed to be \"local flexibility to stagger the return of foundation phase children\".\n\"We'll also need clear guidelines about social distancing, the use of face-coverings, sufficient ventilation, and which staff are exempt from return and can continue to work from home.\n\"Above all, school staff need to hear that they figure in the government's priority list for vaccination, particularly those in the foundation phase where it is almost impossible to ensure social distancing.\"\nAll schools and colleges in Wales were told to move to online learning before the start of this term in an effort to \"suppress the virus\", Ms Williams said at the start of January.\nSome schools had been due to open in the new year but unions called for the return to be delayed amid concerns about a variant of coronavirus blamed for a rise in cases before Christmas.\nSchools and colleges have remained open for children of critical workers and vulnerable pupils, as well as for children who needed to complete essential exams or assessments.\nVictoria Rosser, a mother of four from Cwmbran, is on the shielding list and is yet to receive her first dose of the Covid vaccine. \nShe said she wants to be able to make the decision over whether it is safe for her children to return to the classroom. \n\"I have mixed emotions towards the decision being announced today,\" she said. \n\"I do not feel it's safe for parents and guardians, who've been placed on the shielding list like me, to send their children until phase one of the priority list are post-three weeks of receiving their vaccine. \n\"Parents are being crippled with having to balance their children's education, work and running a home. This is not home schooling, it's trying to accommodate three jobs at the same time, which is impossible in the long-term.\"\nMeanwhile, Chris Lawrence, who lives in Cardiff and has three children, said it was \"really important\" children get back to school as soon as possible. \nHe said: \"From my perspective what we've been doing in terms of shutting schools, we were always told it would be the last resort, but at the moment it's been adopted as the thing that we do. If your kids are at home then pretty much all parents have to be at home as well.\"\nSamantha Pearce from Blaenau Gwent, who's daughter Hazel is 10, said she didn't want to see year groups rushed back.\nBut she added: \"The prolonged closure of the schools is having a huge detrimental effect. Schools for us here in Blaenau Gwent have been already been closed for two months now - and children are bored an unengaged with the work.\"\nRachel Antoniazzi, who is deputy head at Thornhill Primary School in Cardiff, said getting children back into school would be a \"relief\" for parents and teachers, but there were also some concerns for staff. \nShe said: \"I do really honestly believe that the type of learning that foundation phase children are expected to do doesn't work very well from home. It puts a lot of pressure on parents, it's not conducive to the way foundation phase learners are expected to learn.\"\nMs Antoniazzi's school has been operating as a hub for children of key workers during the lockdown, and will continue to do so for the children in the upper years of the school, alongside reopening for the youngest pupils. \n\"In an ideal world we would love to welcome the whole school back but we have to be really careful,\" she said. \n\"I think the biggest fear, and the government have to be really clear on this, is that it's a necessity to reopen schools, but it doesn't mean we're back to normal. \n\"It's better than being at home but I do want parents to get the message that doesn't mean you can go to playdates.\"\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Si\u00e2n Gwenllian called for school staff and other key workers to be moved to the top of the list in each vaccination priority group.\n\"Parents, learners and staff need reassurance that the school environment is safe, and there are certainly things that can be done to give them confidence, such as more extensive use of ventilation, school workers moved to the top of their vaccine priority group, and schools must be given all options to enable adequate social distancing in classrooms. \n\"With a year of hindsight, it pains me to think how much more face-to-face education our children and young people could have had, if Welsh Government had used all the tools in their gift earlier.\"\nEducation spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives Suzy Davies welcomed the return but questioned the staggered approach.\nShe added: \"It's been a tough period for children, parents and teachers, and it makes sense for primaries to go back to catch up with each other; these youngest pupils have lost most in terms of learning and vital early-years socialisation.\n\"We need a can-do, will-do approach from ministers as teachers on the front line want to return to the classroom so long as it's safe to do so. \n\"They must now put plans in place for those critical secondary years, and to get in the maximum amount of learning to prepare our older learners for college and university with an even more dynamic, innovative, flexible and ultimately safe approach to secondary schools.\"\nThe first minister said the youngest pupils would be back in school if virus rates carried on falling.\nA week later, the indicators are going in the right direction, suggesting three to seven-year-olds will be back in classes on or soon after 22 February.\nBut this process feels different to the return after the summer or after the first lockdown.\nThe virus variants have added another layer of anxiety, and the approach is even more cautious.\nOlder primary pupils may have to learn from home for a while longer, and a return for secondary and college pupils, apart from those doing practical qualifications, still seems to be some way off.\nThe first easing of the strictest lockdown rules was last Saturday, when people were able to meet one other person from another household to exercise outside.\nBut people in Wales have been warned they are unlikely to see a \"radical and significant\" easing of the restrictions this month.\nThe health minister said there would need to \"continued\" reductions before the rules can be eased.\nVaughan Gething added any \"available headroom\" would be used to help children go back to school.\nThe next Welsh lockdown review is scheduled for 19 February."

      "tags": "Television,Golden Globes",
      "text": "Fans of British TV drama I May Destroy You on both sides of the Atlantic have expressed \"rage\" over the show's snub in the Golden Globe award nominations.\nWritten by, starring and co-directed by Michaela Coel, the BBC drama was one of the most acclaimed series of last year.\nDeborah Copaken, a writer for Netflix's Emily in Paris, said her excitement at her own show's two nominations was \"tempered by my rage over Coel's snub\".\nCoel got some consolation in the Screen Actors Guild nominations on Thursday.\nShe was nominated for best female actor in a TV movie or limited series in the guild's awards, where she will go up against Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy and Kerry Washington.\n\"I May Destroy You was my whole jam,\" said Hamilton star Daveed Diggs after reading out Coel's SAG nomination.\nI May Destroy You charts the fallout from a sexual assault after protagonist Arabella's drink is spiked. Writing after the Golden Globe shortlists were announced on Wednesday, Copaken praised the series as \"sheer genius\".\nShe wrote in The Guardian: \"'That show,' I told everyone who would listen, 'deserves to win all the awards.' When it didn't, I was stunned. I May Destroy You was not only my favourite show of 2020. It's my favourite show ever.\n\"It takes the complicated issue of a rape - I'm a sexual assault survivor myself - and infuses it with heart, humour, pathos and a story constructed so well, I had to watch it twice, just to understand how Coel did it.\"\nOthers showing their support included actress and director Alice Lowe, who said I May Destroy You \"dwarfed\" the other programmes on the Golden Globes shortlist.  \nWriter Akilah Green, whose shows include A Black Lady Sketch Show and Black Monday, admitted the drama \"sent almost every writer I've talked to about it back to the lab\", while Coronation Street and Beautiful Thing writer Jonathan Harvey said: \"I May Destroy You was the standout TV drama of the year. Hopefully Bafta will appreciate how lucky we are to have this home-grown talent.\"\nShameless and The Phantom of the Opera star Emmy Rossum added: \"I May Destroy You is the best show of the year. It's not even debatable.\"\nUS actress Rachel Zegler, who will star in the forthcoming West Side Story film, also voiced her support, saying the drama was \"one of the greatest series I have ever seen and you all should go watch it immediately\".\nUS comic Kathy Griffin said the \"upside\" to the show being snubbed was that \"more people will discover Michaela Coel's masterpiece\", adding: \"Such a riveting series\". \nI May Destroy You was also among former US President Barack Obama's favourite TV series of last year.\nIn the series, Coel's character goes through a range of emotions, including humour, to process what has happened to her, which the writer and actress said mirrors the experiences she went through herself.\nShe previously told the BBC she wanted to reflect this in the drama, saying: \"We respond to trauma and triggering situations in many different ways, it's not always a pity party.\"\nThe Golden Globes are voted for by 90 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, all international journalists based in California. \nNetflix's The Crown led this year's Golden Globe TV nominations with six, while Steve McQueen's landmark Small Axe series and Normal People were among other BBC programmes that received nominations.\nOther British nominees for the Screen Actors Guild awards included Hugh Grant for The Undoing; The Crown stars Olivia Colman, Emma Corrin and Josh O'Connor; and Bridgerton actor Rege-Jean Page. \nRiz Ahmed, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Gary Oldman, Vanessa Kirby and Carey Mulligan were recognised in the film categories.\nDaniel Kaluuya was recognised for Judas and the Black Messiah, while Sacha Baron Cohen was nominated for The Trial Of The Chicago 7.\nDespite being nominated by the Golden Globes for playing Borat, Baron Cohen won't be nominated for an acting award for portraying the Kazakh character at Britain's Bafta Awards, and his comedy sequel won't be in the running for the Bafta for best film.\nThey did not feature on the Baftas longlists, which were also revealed on Thursday. However, Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova, who plays Borat's teenage daughter and who appeared in an infamous scene with US lawyer Rudy Giuliani, was on the longlist for best supporting actress.\nBaron Cohen was only longlisted for his role in film drama The Trial of the Chicago 7.\nDa 5 Bloods director Spike Lee was among the other big names missing from the longlists, which will be whittled down to the final shortlists when the Bafta nominations are announced on 9 March.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Yemen,Houthis ,Saudi Arabia,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US is to end its support for offensive operations by its allies in Yemen, which has been devastated by a six-year war in which more than 110,000 people are believed to have died. \n\"The war in Yemen must end,\" President Joe Biden said in his first major foreign policy speech.\nUnder Mr Biden's two predecessors, the US backed a coalition led by Saudi Arabia against Houthi rebels in Yemen. \nThe conflict has left millions of Yemenis on the brink of starvation. \nFighting began in 2014 between a weak Yemeni government and the Houthi rebel movement. It escalated a year later, when Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states - backed by the US, the UK and France - began air strikes against the Houthis.\nMr Biden announced other changes to US foreign policy, such as a significant increase in the number of refugees accepted by the US.\nHis speech marks a sharp break with the policies of former President Donald Trump, who left office last month. \nOn Russia, for instance, the new US leader said: \"I made it clear to President [Vladimir] Putin, in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions\u2026 are over.\"\nThe comments drew fierce criticism from the Kremlin. \"This is very aggressive, unconstructive rhetoric, to our regret,\" Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.\nThe US has been backing the Yemeni government and its Saudi-led allies in their war against the Houthis. As a result of Thursday's announcement, the US will stop supporting offensive operations, including the sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). \nThis will not affect operations against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. \nThe Biden administration had already put a temporary halt on arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. \nMr Biden is expected to name his new Yemen envoy as Tim Lenderking, an experienced diplomat and Middle East specialist.\nThis marks a change of tack from Mr Trump's administration, which increased support for the Saudi-led coalition. Last month Mr Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, announced that the Houthis were being designated a \"terrorist organisation\". \nHe said the aim was to hold the Houthis accountable for cross-border attacks and deter \"malign activity\" by their backer Iran.\nAid organisations criticised the move, warning that it could prevent them from operating in areas where millions are in urgent need of food aid. \nLast week, the Biden administration said it would exempt certain transactions involving the Houthis from sanctions. That exemption will expire on 26 February.\nThe United Nations says Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population in need of aid or protection.\nThese announcements confirm President Biden's pledge to end Yemen's destructive war. Halting US support to the Saudi-led coalition's offensive operations won't close this bloody chapter, but it sends a strong signal to leaders in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi - they've also been trying to find ways to extricate themselves from this quagmire. \nAchieving peace among Yemen's bitter enemies will be a monumental challenge. Tim Lenderking is set to be the first US envoy for Yemen since this war was unleashed nearly six years ago. He's worked on this file for years and is known to everyone who matters. \nWestern diplomats, as well as Yemenis, have welcomed this new US engagement. In 2015, President Obama gave a green light to the Saudi-led campaign, partly to ease the Kingdom's anger over the Iran nuclear deal. Now new US envoys on Yemen, and Iran, are tasked with ending this war, and the regional rivalries which still fuel it.  \nThe US will raise the cap on refugee admissions from 15,000 to 125,000 for the fiscal year. \nThe withdrawal of US troops from Germany will be frozen and forces will remain at their current level of about 36,000. Under Mr Trump, the US was going to reduce its presence by 12,000, with about 5,600 to be deployed elsewhere in Europe. \nMr Biden called on Myanmar's military rulers to release civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restore democracy. \nHe also promised to engage diplomatically with Russia but to be tougher on Moscow than Mr Trump, saying the US would not \"roll over\".

      "text": "At least one person is reported to have been stabbed during three \"serious incidents\" in East Ayrshire.\nUniversity Hospital Crosshouse in Kilmarnock was placed in lockdown on Thursday evening, with ambulances diverted to University Hospital Ayr as police dealt with the unfolding events.\nThe three-hour lockdown was lifted shortly before 23:00. \nThe PA news agency said it understood at least one person was stabbed.\nThere was no official confirmation from Police Scotland. \nOfficers were called to the first incident at the Crosshouse site at about 19:45 on Thursday. \nThey believe another in the centre of Kilmarnock about 20 minutes later and a serious crash on the A76 may be linked. \nThe incidents are not being treated as terror-related. \nIn a statement on Twitter Police Scotland said there was no cause for concern for the wider community.\nIt added that inquiries were at an early stage and that the areas involved have been cordoned off. \nThe second incident was on Portland Street, which is about two miles from the hospital, at about 20:05. \nOfficers were called to the crash on the A76, on the outskirts of the town, at about 20:30. \nLocal residents reported hearing sirens and a helicopter overhead shortly before 20:30.\nOn Friday morning, the hospital's A&E department and main entrance were open and running as normal while two police vans full of officers remained outside with police tape around part of the car park.\nDr Crawford McGuffie, the medical director of NHS Ayrshire and Arran, said police had confirmed the risk to patients, staff and visitors to the hospital was minimal. \nHe added: \"There remains a large police presence on the grounds of the hospital.\n\"We would like to reassure anyone coming to the hospital, in particular to any patients or staff coming on shift, that Police Scotland have confirmed it is safe to do so. \n\"However, if you are worried, please speak to the onsite Police Scotland officers.\"\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the incidents as very serious. \nShe added: \"My thoughts are with those involved in these very serious incidents... Please help police do their job by following the advice to stay away from the areas affected.\"\nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman, who is also an Ayrshire MSP, commented on BBC's Good Morning Scotland about the events of Thursday night.\nShe said: \"They are very worrying and as I said last night my thoughts are with the family and friends of all those affected and with our colleagues in the NHS and Police Scotland and I want to thank them again for responding to these incidents in the professional, swift and caring manner that I know they will have done.\""

      "title": "Angela Wrightson: Teenage torture killers keep anonymity",
      "tags": "High Court ,Hartlepool",
      "text": "Two teenagers who tortured and murdered a vulnerable woman in her own home have been granted lifelong anonymity.\nThe girls were 13 and 14 when they subjected Angela Wrightson, 39, to a vicious attack in Hartlepool.\nBoth were jailed for a minimum of 15 years in April 2016.\nThey were not named then because of their age and an interim injunction extended that anonymity after they turned 18. On Thursday, the High Court upheld the ban on naming the pair.\nAt a hearing in London last year, their barrister argued both teenagers suffer from \"recognisable mental conditions\" and were \"extremely psychologically vulnerable\", adding they would be at \"a very significant risk\" of being attacked if their identities were revealed.\nIn her ruling, Mrs Justice Tipples was unconvinced by arguments based on the threat of attack by others, but upheld the anonymity orders on mental health grounds and the risk of self-harm.\nMiss Wrightson died after being subjected to an attack lasting seven hours.\nShe was hit with a shovel, a TV, a coffee table and a stick studded with screws after she let the pair into her Stephen Street home in December 2014.\nThe girls posted a photograph on Snapchat showing them smiling with Miss Wrightson pictured in the background shortly before her death.\nIn her judgement, in which the teenagers were referred to as D and F, Mrs Justice Tipples said the killing had \"resulted in public outrage and revulsion, together with public concern about how these two young girls could commit such a brutal murder\".\nHowever, she went on to describe it as \"an exceptional case in which the balance is tipped very firmly in favour\" of protecting the pair's right to remain anonymous.\n\"The trial took place in public and was fully reported at the time it took place. All matters relating to this offence are in the public domain, except for the identities of D and F.\n\"I am clear on the evidence before me that revealing the claimants' identities is likely to cause each of them very serious harm.\n\"It is both necessary and proportionate to grant the injunctions sought so that both their identities are protected and not revealed.\"\nLifelong anonymity is so rare there are only nine convicted criminals who have this protection in England and Wales, plus a number of their descendants. \nThe individuals given this exceptional protection include the killers of James Bulger - the case that set the test for future orders - and, more recently, Britain's once-youngest teenager to be convicted of a terrorism plot. \nUnder the law, the state must take reasonable steps to protect everyone's right to life. In other words, the long-term personal safety of the offender outweighs the legal rights of the media and the public to identify them. \nIn the Wrightson case, there was another very important consideration. A member of court staff saved Child F from killing herself during the trial. \nThe compelling medical evidence for her anonymity application showed she would become suicidal again if she were named now she is an adult. \nAnd so, under the law, it's that right to life - and perhaps a chance for rehabilitation - that means the two young women will never be named. \nThe court was told D's mental health had \"deteriorated\" as she approached being moved to an adult prison, while F had an \"extensive history of mental health problems\".\nMrs Justice Tipples concluded: \"I will give judgment in favour of the claimants and grant permanent injunctions preventing them from being identified.\"\nThe ruling contains provision for a review \"in the event there is a material change of circumstances\"."

      "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene: US House votes to strip Republican of key posts",
      "tags": "Donald Trump,QAnon,United States",
      "text": "The US House of Representatives has voted to expel a Republican congresswoman from two committees over incendiary remarks she made before being elected last November. \nMarjorie Taylor Greene had promoted baseless QAnon conspiracy theories and endorsed violence against Democrats. \nBefore the vote, she said she regretted her views, which included claims that school shootings and 9/11 were staged.\nEleven Republicans joined the Democrats to pass the motion by 230-199. \nIt means the representative - who was elected in November, representing a district in the southern state of Georgia - cannot take up her place on the education and budget committees. \nThis would limit her ability to shape policy as most legislation goes through a committee before reaching the House floor. Committee positions can determine the influence of individual lawmakers in their party.\nIt is highly unusual for one party to intervene in another party's House committee assignments.   \nOn Friday, Mrs Greene said that she woke up \"laughing\" at the situation.\n\"I woke up early this morning literally laughing thinking about what a bunch of morons the Democrats (+11) are for giving some one like me free time,\" she tweeted, referencing the 11 Republicans who also voted to remove her.\nAt a news conference in Washington hours later, Mrs Greene said that Democrats had \"stripped my district of their voice\" by removing her from the committees.\nShe described the Democratic-run government as \"tyrannically controlled\" and denounced the upcoming Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump - over his role in the 6 January riot - as a \"circus\". \nThe lawmaker also criticised the media for \"addicting people to hate\". \nAccording to The Hill, a political news outlet, Mrs Greene received a standing ovation at a closed-doors meeting with members of her party on Wednesday after she apologised for her past remarks, and on Thursday before the vote, she expressed regret for her past comments.\nOn the floor of the House, she said her controversial remarks had been made before she ran for office last year. \n\"These were words of the past. These things do not represent me,\" she said. \nMrs Greene said she had been \"upset about things\" happening in the US and did not trust the government when she came upon conspiracy theories online in 2018. \nThe 46-year-old also sought to pin blame on the media, saying they were \"just as guilty as QAnon for promoting lies\". \nBut she did not address a series of past inflammatory remarks:\nAsked by a reporter on Friday whether or not she was \"sorry\" for some of these additional remarks, Mrs Greene said she was \"sorry for saying all those things that are wrong and offensive\". \nShe added that she was \"not sorry\" for speaking to Mr Hogg about gun rights, saying that \"he was an adult when I spoke to him\". \nAfter an afternoon of procedural manoeuvres and debate, a majority of the House of Representatives took the unprecedented step of voting to strip one of its members of her committee assignments because of what it deemed dangerous and toxic speech she made before she was elected.\nRepublicans warned that sanctioning Marjorie Taylor Greene set a dangerous precedent, where the majority party in the chamber could tell the minority how to allocate its committee seats. \nDemocrats countered that the real precedent would be if a member of the chamber made threats against her future colleagues - and the House did nothing. Because the Republicans refused to punish one of their own, the majority said they had to step in.\nThe House has sanctioned the conspiracy-minded Mrs Greene, but it may have started a new cycle of political retribution.\nAhead of the vote, Mrs Pelosi said she was \"profoundly concerned\" by Republicans accepting \"an extreme conspiracy theorist\".\nChuy Garcia, of Illinois, said Mrs Greene's floor speech had come across as \"premeditated\".\n\"I did not hear remorse and I didn't hear an apology,\" Mr Garcia said. \"It's all about spin and I think she'll probably try to raise a lot of money from it. I think it's disgraceful.\"\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said before the vote: \"I have never encountered a situation like the one before us now, where a member has made such vile and hurtful statements, engaged in the harassment of colleagues and expressed support for political violence.\"\nJimmy Gomez, of California, vowed to press ahead with a resolution to expel Mrs Greene from Congress altogether. \nUnder section five of the US Constitution, a house can expel a member with a two-thirds majority, meaning that there would have to be significant support from Republicans in the narrowly divided House of Representatives. \nAnalysis by Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring\nMarjorie Taylor Greene has said that she stopped believing in the QAnon conspiracy in 2018\nHowever, she continued to allude to ideas pushed by QAnon believers.\nIn a 2019 video she claimed that then-Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg was being played by a body double.\nThe idea stemmed from the macabre conspiracy theory that Ginsburg's death - which actually did occur, later, in September 2020 - was somehow being covered up. \nOdd as it sounds, in feverish QAnon groups where the rumour was born, whispers about imposters and political \"body doubles\" are fairly common.\nIn December 2020, she insisted in a now-deleted social media post that the QAnon community was \"exposing truth\".\nAnd somewhat prophetically, in a February 2019 video post she called for people to flood the US Capitol building to demonstrate against Democrats. The month before, she \"liked\" a post saying that it would be quicker to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"with a bullet to the head\".\nShe refused to address these issues when questioned Friday. Mrs Greene may have left overt support for QAnon behind, but it appears she's still paying attention to what's being said in conspiracy-minded groups.\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy vowed retribution whenever his party next controls the lower chamber of Congress.\nAccusing Democrats of a double standard, he referred to the 2019 anti-Semitism furore when Minnesota lawmaker Ilhan Omar implied US politicians only supported Israel because of lobby money, and Mrs Pelosi appeared with her that same month on a magazine cover.\nOn Wednesday, Mr McCarthy condemned Mrs Greene's past remarks, but refused to punish her.\nJim Jordan of Ohio told the floor: \"So who's next? Who will the cancel culture attack next?\"\nHe assailed Democrats for stoking unsubstantiated claims that Mr Trump secretly plotted with Russia to win the 2016 election.\n\"I've heard several times today from the Democrats: conspiracy theory. The Democrats peddled the biggest conspiracy theory of all time - the Russia hoax!\""

      "text": "Sales of Australian wine to the UK have surged almost 30% in the last year as producers try to overcome crippling taxes on exports to China.\nWine producers have ramped up exports to Europe to a 10-year high, with the UK now the number one destination.\nChina increased taxes by a massive 212% in November following a trade spat with Australia which has also affected goods including lobsters and coal.\nWine Australia said the UK sales surge was helped by lockdowns and Brexit.\nThe value of wine exports to Europe climbed 22% last year, while \"standout performer\" the UK saw shipments jump 29% according to government figures.\nWine Australia, a government organisation set up to promote and regulate the wine industry, said demand increased at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and was boosted in the months leading up to Brexit.\nThe sharp rise in sales to Europe helped offset a big slump in exports to China in the last two months of 2020.\nWine exports to China fell just 1% in value last year, given that the high tariffs imposed by Beijing were only imposed in November. \nFor the first nine months of last year, China was the biggest destination for Australia's wine exports, accounting for 39%.\nThe UK is now the biggest destination for Australian wine exports by volume, with Brits buying up 266 million litres (29.6 million cases) in 2020.\nThe most popular varieties were shiraz/syrah which accounted for 29% of UK sales last year, followed by chardonnay (25%) and cabernet sauvignon (10%).\n\"Due to the Covid lockdown they are not drinking wines in restaurants and cafes\u2026 but instead buying retail.  Australian wines have sold extremely well in UK retail for decades,\" a Wine Australia spokesman told the BBC.\nChina's tensions with Australia started out as a political spat that spilled over into trade.\nOfficials in China have argued that some Australian wine is being sold cheaper there (dumped) than in its home market through the use of subsidies. Australia has rejected this claim.\nChina's commerce ministry said the tariffs, ranging from 107% to 212%, were temporary anti-dumping measures while it carried out a year-long investigation.\n\"The Australian government categorically rejects any allegation that our wine producers are dumping product into China,\" Australia's agriculture minister David Littleproud said in November.\n\"Australian wine is hugely popular both in China and across the globe due to its high quality and we are confident that a full and thorough investigation will confirm this.\"\nWine merchants in the UK have warned that drinkers could pay more per bottle on many European wines while choosing from a reduced range as the burden of post-Brexit paperwork takes effect."

      "tags": "Republican Party,Donald Trump,US Congress",
      "text": "Democrats in the US House of Representatives will force a vote on the fate of a newly-elected Republican congresswoman over incendiary rhetoric. \nMarjorie Taylor Greene has promoted unfounded conspiracy theories and shown support for violence against Democrats.\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy condemned the remarks, but refused to punish Ms Greene, saying the remarks were made before she was elected. \nThe vote is set to take place on Thursday afternoon. \nDemocrats, who control the chamber, say they will vote to expel her from the education and budget committees.\nMost legislation goes through a committee before reaching the House floor. Committee positions can determine the sway of individual lawmakers in their party.  \nShe was elected in November, representing a district in the southern state of Georgia. She is widely known for expressing support for QAnon, a bizarre conspiracy theory that former President Donald Trump was waging a clandestine war on a cabal of child-abusers.\nBefore taking office, she liked posts calling for violence against Democratic lawmakers, claimed that school shootings and the 9/11 terror attack were staged events, and suggested Muslims should not serve in government, among other comments online.\nHer harangue of a teenage survivor of a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, was recently unearthed. \nLast month, Mrs Greene introduced a measure attempting to impeach US President Joe Biden, accusing him of corruption and abuse of power, which made her a heroine of the party's pro-Trump wing. \nTop Republican lawmakers have been outspoken in their criticism of Mrs Greene's past comments.\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida called her \"either deranged or a sadist\". Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said she had embraced \"loony lies\" that were a \"cancer\" to the party. Senator Todd Young of Indiana called her \"nutty\" and \"an embarrassment\".\nMr McCarthy, a California representative, said Mrs Greene's comments had caused \"deep wounds to many\".\n\"Past comments from and endorsed by Marjorie Taylor Greene on school shootings, political violence and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories do not represent the values or beliefs of the House Republican Conference,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\"I condemn those comments unequivocally. I condemned them in the past and continue to condemn them today.\"\nHe added: \"I made this clear to Marjorie when we met [on Tuesday]. I also made clear that as a member of Congress we have a responsibility to hold ourselves to a higher standard than how she presented herself as a private citizen.\"\nBut Mr McCarthy accused Democrats of a double standard and of failing to hold their own lawmakers to account.\nThe Republican party has previously stripped lawmakers of committee assignments. In January 2019, Steve King of Iowa was expelled from three panels after he questioned why white supremacy is considered offensive. \nAccording to the Hill, a political news outlet, Mrs Greene received a standing ovation at a closed-doors meeting with members of her party on Wednesday after she apologised for her past remarks.\nShe reportedly told fellow Republicans that she had erred in being curious about QAnon.\nShe also told her children that she had learned a lesson about sharing posts on social media, two sources in the room told the Hill.\nMrs Greene meanwhile said on Twitter on Wednesday that she had raised $160,000 over just the last two days for her political campaigning, adding: \"Let's keep sending the message to the Democrat mob.\"\nThe House of Representatives is heading toward a showdown on Thursday over the fate of Marjorie Taylor Greene, the freshman congresswoman with a penchant for trafficking in bizarre right-wing conspiracy theories.\nEvery attempt at reaching some sort of resolution to avoid a floor vote by the whole chamber - an apology by Mrs Greene, sanctions imposed by the Republican leadership or some compromise acceptable to Democrats - has been in vain.\nThe stand-off reflects the conflicting currents within the Republican Party. Some, like Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, view Mrs Greene as a symptom of the corrosive effects of Donald Trump's politics. A clear renunciation, then, would be a welcome step away from the ex-president.\nOthers consider the move to punish Mrs Greene only the latest attempt to persecute and silence an outspoken conservative voice. \nDemocrats, sensing an advantage, are pushing for a very public confrontation, even if some are uneasy about the precedent it might set.\nMeanwhile, Mrs Greene continues to raise her profile - as a hero to some on the right and, perhaps, a martyr.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the chamber's most powerful Democrat, said they would proceed with a vote on Thursday to expel Mrs Greene from the education and budget committees.\nThe measure requires a simple majority to pass. \nThe California congresswoman said in a statement: \"McCarthy's failure to lead his party effectively hands the keys over to Greene - an anti-Semite, QAnon adherent and 9/11 Truther.\"\nRepublicans are seeking to retaliate by trying to have a Democratic lawmaker, Ilhan Omar, expelled from her committees over an anti-Semitism furore.\nIn February 2019, the Minnesota congresswoman suggested US lawmakers only support Israel because of lobby money. She apologised, and no action was taken against her. House Democrats voted to condemn anti-Semitism, though their resolution did not name Ms Omar.\nOn Wednesday, the Somali-born Muslim issued a statement accusing Republicans of a \"desperate smear rooted in racism, misogyny, and Islamophobia\" to try to \"distract\" from the Greene controversy.\nOn Wednesday night, Liz Cheney, the third-highest ranking Republican, survived a vote to oust her from her leadership position after she enraged Trump supporters by joining 10 Republicans in breaking ranks last month to impeach the former president. \nShe rode out the secret ballot by 145-61.\n\"I won't apologise for the [impeachment] vote,\" the Wyoming lawmaker, who is a daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, told the closed-doors House Republican meeting earlier in the evening. \nDuring a pause in that private meeting, Mr McCarthy told reporters he had defended Ms Cheney.\n\"People can have differences of opinion,\" he said. \"That's what you can have a discussion about. Liz has a right to vote her conscience.\""

      "text": "The barriers facing British musicians who want to tour in the EU are \"absurd and self-defeating\", UK culture secretary Oliver Dowden has said.\nSince Brexit, British musicians face costly bills to obtain visas if they wish to play in some EU countries.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Mr Dowden said the situation \"could have been solved\" before 1 January, and laid the blame with the European Union.\nSeveral MPs urged the government to return to the negotiating table. \n\"I know that the EU walked away from our offer, but it must be brought back to the table,\" said Conservative MP Giles Watling. \n\"Touring performers will be left with a double whammy of an industry devastated by Covid and the loss of an entire continent as a venue. Will he please bang the table and get the EU back to talk on this?\"\nCulture minister Nigel Huddleston replied that the \"door always remains open\" for further talks.\n\"A working group has been set up by the secretary of state to look at any obstacles which might face British performers seeking to tour,\" he said.\nThe EU has previously said the UK government turned down its standard proposal of a visa waiver for musicians during Brexit negotiations. \nThe UK has insisted this offer \"would not have worked for musicians\" and was incompatible with the government's \"commitment to take back control of our borders\".\nThe EU also rejected a counter-proposal from the UK, the details of which have not been revealed. \nA petition on the issue is also due to be debated in Parliament on Monday. \nBacked by musicians including Dua Lipa, Biffy Clyro and Laura Marling, it calls for the government to \"negotiate a free cultural work permit\" that would allow bands and their crews to travel freely in the EU's 27 member states.\nOn Thursday, in preparation for the debate, the House of Commons petitions committee heard evidence from artists and touring professionals about the impact of Brexit on their livelihoods.\nOpera singer Anna Patalong said that, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, working in other European countries accounted for \"50% of my income\" - earnings which are now at risk.\nShe said the lack of a visa waiver meant \"all the artists in the UK are now in a worse position than musicians in the Congo and Columbia\".\nDance musician Yousef said it was \"pretty standard\" for DJs like himself to play in two or three European countries in one weekend. Having to arrange permits for each gig would make his career \"near impossible and unbelievably expensive\", he said.\nHe felt musicians were \"just not taken seriously\" by the government, adding: \"We're treated as if we're children playing in the toy room, but that's not the case at all. \n\"It's a very serious business run by hard-working music enthusiasts who don't ask for any support under normal circumstances.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "UK scientists are planning trials to see if giving people two different types of Covid vaccine, one after the other, might give better protection than two doses of one jab. \nThis mix-and-match approach can go ahead only if another jab is approved by regulators, as has already happened with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. \nThe head of the UK's vaccine task force said trial designs were being prepared. \nThe news comes as the NHS starts its Covid mass vaccination programme. \nA 90-year-old woman, Margaret Keenan, has become the first person to be given the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as part of the rollout across the UK. \nMs Keenan, who is originally from Enniskillen, said: \"I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19. It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year.\"\nThat vaccine, given as two doses a few weeks apart, offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, according to data. \nAlthough that is a very impressive figure, experts want to explore whether the immune response can be strengthened further and made more durable with a mix-and-match \"heterologous boost\" approach. \nKate Bingham, who chairs the vaccine task force, said: \"It's an established process. \n\"It's not being done because of supplies.\"\nThere is another Covid jab that could soon be approved by regulators - the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThis works in a slightly different way to the Pfizer jab which could make it a good companion for pairing, say scientists. \nThe Pfizer vaccine uses a small amount of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight off an infection, while the Oxford one is a genetically modified virus that has been altered so it won't cause infection but does carry information on how to beat Covid. \nThe idea is to give people a shot of the Pfizer vaccine followed by a dose of the Oxford one a few weeks later or vice versa, rather than two doses of the same vaccine. \nThe hope is that it will make the immune system produce two responses strongly - antibodies and T-cells - to combat Covid."

      "text": "The government is to update the law so that the attorney general can take six months' maternity leave.\nSuella Braverman, the government's chief law officer, announced in November she was expecting her second child \"early next year\".\nShe would be one of the most senior government ministers to give birth in office.\nUnder current laws, she would have to resign if she wanted to take time off following the birth.\nThe government has announced a new law to formalise the process for ministerial maternity leave, which until now has been at the discretion of the prime minister.\nThe Ministerial and other Maternity Allowances Bill will allow cabinet ministers to receive up to six months' leave on full pay. \nAt the moment, legislation from the 1970s means the prime minister does not normally have the flexibility to pay a cabinet minister maternity leave alongside paying a salary to their temporary replacement. \nThe bill would allow Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers to take six months' leave on full pay - similar to more junior government roles and the civil service. \nSeveral female politicians serving as junior ministers have taken maternity leave in the past, including Conservative MPs Tracey Crouch and Kemi Badenoch.  \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would back the bill, adding the change \"should have been brought in a long time ago\".\nThe party's shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the measures were a \"small but significant step forward\" but the government needed to go further and make provision for paternity, adoption and shared parental leave. \nIntroducing the new measures in a written statement, the prime minister said: \"The choice between taking leave to recover from childbirth and care for a new-born child or resigning from office is not acceptable in modern times.\"\nBoris Johnson acknowledged that provisions needed to be made for leave for adoption, sickness and other circumstances.\nMinisters aren't subject to normal employee rights because they're appointed, and fired, by the prime minister. \nMany will be surprised to learn that Suella Braverman will become the first cabinet minister to take paid maternity leave. \nIt's a generous scheme which will grant six months of full pay - under current rules, she would have had to resign or be demoted to qualify. \nThe bill is being rushed through Parliament because she's due to give birth soon, but Labour wants to revisit the issue later to include paternity leave.  \nThe years of muddling through on an informal basis will end next Thursday.                      \nMs Braverman, the Conservative MP for Fareham, became the second-ever woman to be appointed attorney general for England and Wales in February 2020. \nShe had previously served as a junior Brexit minister under Theresa May, before resigning in November 2018 in protest at the former PM's Brexit plans. \nShe went on to take maternity leave whilst serving as a backbench MP after the birth of her first child in July 2019, with a \"proxy MP\" taking part in parliamentary debates and votes on her behalf. \nAll MPs are paid in full while on maternity, paternity or adoption leave. But not all their duties in Parliament are covered during their absence:\nResponding to the change, Ms Creasy said: \"In no other workplace would guaranteed paid maternity leave and cover be only the preserve of the management.\n\"The introduction of cover for ministers is long overdue, and this legislation reveals the lie I was told when I asked for maternity cover that MPs employment status made it impossible.\"\nMs Creasy added: \"What message does it send to the thousands of pregnant women facing redundancy and job insecurity in the pandemic or any of those considering entering public life at any level, if parliament treats maternity leave as a bonus like a company car to be given only to those at the top?\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nCould mixing different Covid vaccines provide as good - or even better - protection than two shots of the same jab? A UK trial aims to find out, with more than 800 volunteers over the age of 50 in England to be given the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab followed by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - or vice versa - four or 12 weeks apart. The aim is to provide more flexibility with the vaccine rollout and help deal with any potential disruption to supplies. \nComedian Rufus Hound has withdrawn from Dancing On Ice after testing positive for coronavirus. Having been forced to sit out last week's show after coming into contact with someone with Covid-19, he's announced on YouTube he'll have to bow out, saying: \"Unfortunately, the rules on Dancing on Ice are completely cut and dry - very strict - because they need to keep everybody on that production as safe as possible.\"\nMany parents are concerned about their children being unable to mix with classmates, with most pupils unable to attend school during lockdown. But for children with special educational needs, losing the familiarity and routine of the classroom has been especially difficult, as Bethan Lewis and Peter Shuttleworth report.\nSome of Scotland's mountain ski centres are having their best winter conditions in years, following weeks of frequent snowfalls and freezing temperatures. Susan Smith, of Cairngorm Mountain, says it's \"hugely frustrating\" her team can't welcome visitors, with lockdown forcing the vast majority of businesses to shut. Glencoe Mountain's Andy Meldrum says staff remain \"ever hopeful that we will be able to open soon, even if it's only for locals\".\nCrystal Palace fans might be deprived of their fortnightly pilgrimage to watch home matches but those in line for vaccination can at least visit Selhurst Park. The Premier League stadium's Glaziers Lounge - normally used for pre-match drinks and private functions - is among 39 large vaccination sites - including theatres and a fire station - opened by NHS England this week. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nIf you're worried about whether the coronavirus vaccines are safe, here's what we know.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Australian wines have sold extremely well in UK retail for decades,\" a Wine Australia spokesman told the BBC.\nChina's tensions with Australia started out as a political spat that spilled over into trade.\nOfficials in China have argued that some Australian wine is being sold cheaper there (dumped) than in its home market through the use of subsidies. Australia has rejected this claim.\nChina's commerce ministry said the tariffs, ranging from 107% to 212%, were temporary anti-dumping measures while it carried out a year-long investigation.\n\"The Australian government categorically rejects any allegation that our wine producers are dumping product into China,\" Australia's agriculture minister David Littleproud said in November.\n\"Australian wine is hugely popular both in China and across the globe due to its high quality and we are confident that a full and thorough investigation will confirm this.\"\nWine merchants in the UK have warned that drinkers could pay more per bottle on many European wines while choosing from a reduced range as the burden of post-Brexit paperwork takes effect."

      "tags": "Travel,Air travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Airport bosses say they have \"no idea\" how the Scottish government's tougher quarantine restrictions on travellers will work.\nNicola Sturgeon announced on Monday that Scotland's rules would go further than the other UK countries.\nUnder UK plans, people arriving from high-risk countries on a \"red list\" will have to quarantine in hotels.\nThe first minister said that would be extended to all travellers \"regardless of which country they have come from\".\nThe chief executive of Glasgow and Aberdeen airports criticised the Scottish government for not involving the industry in its discussions.\nDerek Provan insisted there had been \"no engagement\" over policies which have now \"completely shut down our airports\".\nThe Scottish government said work was ongoing on the details, and it \"will obviously talk to the aviation sector\" before announcing its final plans.\nMr Provan, of the AGS Airports group, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the industry must be consulted if it is to help implement the measures.\nHe said: \"There is no engagement with the Scottish government. We are finding out the next restrictions as the first minister makes those announcements.\n\"There has been an announcement of the third set of further restrictions in the same number of weeks. But, as of this time, we have no idea how that will work.\n\"We don't know how people will be able to travel from the aircraft to the hotel.\n\"And we certainly don't understand what monitoring and measuring will take place between the Scottish and English borders.\"\nMr Provan said the new restrictions would mean airports having to go through a second summer period without any business.\nHe said the aviation business was now in a \"survival situation\" and must be involved in government talks on a recovery plan for the industry and the economy.\n\"We can help, but we need meaningful support,\" he added.\nA spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: \"We still don't know how this is expected to work, when it is being enacted and what it means for airports and our industry, so yet again we ask the Scottish government to talk to us.\n\"Business-changing policy with no detail is damaging because we can't plan our response or our recovery, which will feed into Scotland's recovery. We understand restrictions are required but we're now coming up for a year of little to no passengers without direct industry support. \n\"We urgently need to agree a road map to recovery.\"\nThe first minister said on Tuesday the stricter rules were to \"guard against\" the importation of new variants.\"\nShe said the approach agreed across the UK only included countries where new variants had already been identified. \nMs Sturgeon said this was \"too reactive\" because a new variant will often have spread across borders by the time it has been identified through genomic sequencing.\nWhile the Scottish government cannot \"unilaterally\" implement managed quarantine for people arriving in other parts of the UK before travelling to Scotland, it will urge the UK government to adopt the stricter approach.\nDeputy first minister John Swinney told Good Morning Scotland the Scottish government was \"very committed to ongoing dialogue with all sectors affected\" by the quarantine changes.\nHe said: \"We have to use every device available to us to interrupt the circulation of the virus, and the approaches that we're taking on quarantine arrangements are designed to do exactly that.\n\"There is work going on to develop the thinking that the government wants to put in place and we will obviously talk to the aviation sector as part of that process.\"\nCabinet minister Michael Gove said the UK government's position was \"constantly under review\".\nHe said: \"It is already the case that before you come to any part of the United Kingdom you need to have had a negative Covid test.\n\"And it is also the case that before you get into the United Kingdom you have to acknowledge that you will isolate for a period, and there are strict penalties if you break that isolation. \n\"Managed isolation is an additional measure and we review all of the countries that people are coming from in order to make sure that we are vigilant against any new strain of the virus.\"\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "text": "Unprecedented changes in lifestyle in the coronavirus pandemic led to an acceleration in shifts in criminal behaviour in Wales, a crime expert has said.\nLevels of reported crime fell across Wales from October 2019-2020, including in the first few months of the pandemic.\nBut figures show reports of cyber crime, stalking and harassment spiked.\nProfessor Martin Innes said challenges were \"unprecedented\" in modern times.\nThe Cardiff University professor said while it was hard to predict the future, an increase in digital crime during the pandemic, teamed with the economic impact and increases in social tension mixed for a \"worrying cocktail\" for post-lockdown crime.\nPolice forces across Wales have repeatedly warned of being under immense pressure during the pandemic as they try to enforce Covid laws while dealing with serious and violent crime.\nRecent figures, released by the Office of National Statistics, show 245,591 crimes were reported to Welsh police forces between October 2019 and September 2020, a 7% fall on the year before, although this does not include fraud figures.\nThe number of fraud offences increased by 8% to 14,845 during the same period.\nWhile the number of burglaries (-18%), thefts (-22%) and shoplifting offences fell between September 2019-2020, stalking and harassment reports increased by 11% in Wales, with 36,770 reports.\nDomestic abuse charities also reported marked increases in calls for help when schools returned in September after abuse was not reported during lockdown.\nProf Innes, director of the Crime and Security Research Institute at Cardiff University, said crime had been shifting for years, but lockdown had seemed to accelerated rates of personal and digital crime, as people were stuck at home and spending more time online.\nDyfed-Powys Police saw the largest increase in reports of stalking and harassment offences, with 5,229 reports a 34% increase compared to the year before.\nIn North Wales police reported an increase in stalking and harassment crimes, as well as a rise in disability and transphobic hate crime.\nWhile the coronavirus pandemic has seen many acts of kindness, police have warned some criminals have used Covid-19 to scam people out of their life savings.\nFigures, published by Action Fraud, show victims of cyber crime and fraud in Wales have reportedly lost \u00a335.4m, with almost 13,000 crimes reported since the start of lockdown on 23 March.\nHealth officials and police have warned scammers claiming to work for the NHS are targeting vulnerable people online offering fake Covid vaccines in return for cash or personal details.\nDyfed-Powys Police also reported a significant increase in romance fraud, with victims in west Wales losing \u00a31.3m between January and November last year, with officers saying criminals are targeting the lonely in lockdown.\nProf Innes said the shift to cyber, such as online hate crime, drug dealing over apps, and smear campaigns, was a huge challenge for forces and they would need to invest in expertise and technology to be able to recover evidence.\nHe said the impact of the pandemic on drug trade, and gang operations like County Lines, was concerning, as criminal operations would have changed.\n\"Just like everybody else has changed their behaviour in the pandemic, those involved in drug behaviour have probably done the same... and probably some of those innovations they've made will stick.\"\nAt a recent North Wales Police and Crime panel Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said that officers were predicting an increase in \"digital cyber criminality\" and it would be a \"complex and challenging\" area for the future.\nSouth Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael warned \"increased levels of serious violence and domestic abuse were likely to continue\" following the pandemic.\nIn a report to the South Wales Police and Crime Panel, Mr Michael said: \"The scale of the economic downturn and subsequent rate of recovery will fundamentally shape the post pandemic crime and disorder landscape in the medium to long term.\"\nHe added: \"People are spending more time online - increasing the risk of phishing, grooming, cyber attacks and sextortion. \n\"Payment preferences are also shifting to increasingly be online which again opens up opportunities for online fraud.\"\nMeanwhile reports of public order offences also increased across all four forces by 8%, with Dyfed-Powys Police recording an increase of 29% during the year to September 2020.\nIn Dyfed-Powys and Gwent Police areas, documents show the forces said crime had increased after lockdown measures were first eased in summer 2020.\nIn Gwent reports of sexual offences increased by 29% (from 128 to 126), but remained significantly lower than normal with the force saying less people were reporting the crime, while bike thefts increased by 25%, due to \"cycling being encouraged...during lockdown\".\nIn the Dyfed-Powys area drug offences increased during the first lockdown in March, before decreasing significantly later in 2020.\nThe force warned that public tensions remained high due to Covid restrictions, and this had led to the number of reports of public order offences remaining high.\nThere had been \"exponential\" increases in anti-social behaviour reports due to breaches of lockdown rules, it said.\nIn July and August, when restrictions began to ease, there was a sharp rise in violent attacks, but the force said this was down to an \"increase in alcohol related\" incidents.\nIn North Wales, by the start of December, officers had issued 582 fines for Covid-19 restriction breaches, with two \u00a310k fines issued for illegal music events.\nProf Innes said when lockdown measures were eased again, anti-social behaviour and low level public disorder could spike in communities, and with people struggling due to losing their jobs, crime levels would return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\"People have been cooped up and there won't be an awful lot of things for people to do as the weather gets nicer,\" he said.\n\"We can already see some of the social tensions kind of bubbling away when you look across Europe.\n\"Longer term we are going to see a lot of empty shops and town centres are going to be very different than they have been... what we know is when you've got empty stores they act as a magnet for trouble.\""

      "text": "Doctors in New York have performed the world's first successful face and double hand transplant. \nJoe DiMeo, 22, underwent the 23-hour surgery, performed by a team of more than 140 healthcare workers last August. \nA car crash in 2018 left Mr DiMeo with third-degree burns over 80% of his body. His fingertips were amputated and he lost his lips and eyelids. \nHe said the operation had given him a \"second chance at life\".\nMr DiMeo was on his way home from a night shift when he fell asleep at the wheel. His car crashed, bursting into flames. \nHe spent four months in a burns unit, which included time in an induced coma. Mr DiMeo then had more than 20 reconstructive surgeries but only regained limited use of his hands and face. \nIn 2019, he was referred to an academic medical centre in New York, NYU Langone, where he underwent transplant surgery last August. \nEduardo Rodriguez, director of the Face Transplant Program, said: \"We wanted to give him not only an operation that made him look better, but it ultimately had to work ideally, especially with the hands.\"\nMr DiMeo spent 45 days in intensive care after the surgery and a further two months in hospital, where he had to learn how to open his eyelids and use his new hands. \nTwo face and double hand transplants have taken place before but both were unsuccessful. One patient died from complications and the other had their hands removed after they failed to thrive, the hospital said. \nDoctors at the hospital waited to make sure the transplants were not rejected before labelling it as a success. \nMr Rodriguez says Mr DiMeo, who does up to five hours of rehab a day, is the \"most highly motivated patient\" he has ever met. \n\"He wants to work on sports, he loves to play golf, and he wants to get back to the course. I'm always impressed by the amount of weight that he can lift and the quality of his grip strength,\" he added. \nMr DiMeo says he can now workout by himself and make breakfast. \n\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime gift, and I hope the family can take some comfort knowing that part of the donor lives on with me,\" he said. \"My parents and I are very grateful that I've been given this second chance.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you in the morning.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson says coronavirus infection rates remain \"alarmingly high\" in the UK, although there are \"some signs of hope\", with the number of Covid patients in hospital beginning to fall. Latest figures show some 32,000 Covid patients are currently in hospital and there have been another 19,202 cases in the past 24 hour-period - although the figure is below 20,000 for a third successive day. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson also said the UK has passed the \"milestone\" of vaccinating more than 10 million people thanks to the \"colossal\" effort of everyone involved in the vaccination programme. \nPeople across the country have joined in a national clap in memory of Captain Sir Tom Moore. The 100-year-old, who raised almost \u00a333m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus on Tuesday. Boris Johnson, who led the tribute, said it was \"for the spirit of optimism that he stood for\" but also \"all those he campaigned for\". Capt Sir Tom's family said they were \"incredibly touched\".\nThe team behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has said that new jabs to tackle coronavirus variants should be ready by the autumn. Prof Andy Pollard, from Oxford University, said tweaking a vaccine was a relatively quick process and would only need small trials before being rolled out. There is still strong evidence existing vaccines work well against the mutations that have emerged, although their overall effectiveness may be weakened a little. Here we take a closer look at the South African variant - and the risk it poses.\nDays before the Australian Open is due to start, a number of tennis players have been told to isolate after a worker at their hotel in Melbourne tested positive for Covid-19. In all, more than 500 people - including officials and support staff - are affected. Meanwhile, officials running this summer's Tokyo Olympics have set out how they to plan to keep the games safe during the pandemic.

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Travel,Boris Johnson,Travel & leisure industry,Grant Shapps,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is \"not practical\" to completely close the UK's borders given the amount of medicines and food imported into the country, the prime minister has said. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions to prevent new coronavirus variants entering the UK.\nBoris Johnson said the government had already tightened travel restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus.\nHe said it would be going ahead with its plan for quarantine hotels for people arriving from Covid hotspots.\nIt is not yet clear when the scheme - announced a week ago - will start or when there will be further details.\nSpeaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said government scientists had recommended \"a complete pre-emptive closure of borders\".\nIn response, Mr Johnson said: \"Actually, Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies) did not recommend a complete ban and they say travel bans should not be relied upon to stop the importation of new variants.\n\"But we do have one of the toughest regimes in the world.\"\nRules around international travel were tightened last month, meaning all travellers must self-isolate for 10 days when they return to the UK.\nThe government also announced plans to make people quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels when arriving in the UK from certain \"high risk\" countries, where new coronavirus variants have been identified.\nThe prime minister said at Wednesday evening's Downing Street briefing that Health Secretary Matt Hancock would make a statement on Thursday to give further details, although No 10 later clarified to say this was not happening.\nLabour chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee Yvette Cooper tweeted in response: \"Oh for heaven's sake. Who is in charge of this borders policy? When will we get details? Does anyone have a grip?\"\nThe UK has placed 33 high-risk countries on a so-called \"red list\", including most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal.\nScotland has announced it will extend the measures to all travellers.\nSir Keir said the government's new border arrangements were \"still weeks away\" from being introduced and would only affect direct flights from some countries.\nHe asked whether the prime minister was saying that \"quarantining all arrivals would make no difference to fighting new variants of the virus\", or that it was \"too difficult to do it\". \nMr Johnson responded by saying that 75% of the UK's medicines come into the country from the European mainland, 45% of food, while 250,000 businesses rely on imports. \n\"It is not practical to completely close off this country as he seems to be suggesting,\" he said.\nIntroducing quarantine hotels is a logistical challenge. \nThe government needs to make sure hotels are ready. That doesn't just mean securing enough rooms and making sure all the guests can have meals delivered, but also coming up with policies around things like security if a guest tries to leave early. \nThe government could use existing guidelines written up by countries such as New Zealand as a template. \nAirlines and airports also have questions about how this will work and some areas are complicated. For instance, the policy currently only applies to arrivals from 33 countries - all of whom will arrive on indirect flights.\nShould airlines separate passengers from low and high-risk countries onboard? \nBut the policy also requires compliance from passengers. If passengers split their tickets and don't declare they've been in one of the 33 high-risk countries, how will the government keep track? \nThere are plenty of questions from all quarters about how to make this policy effective. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps also defended the government's decision not to extend the hotel quarantine policy to arrivals from all countries. \nHe told the Commons Transport Committee: \"The idea that the UK could completely batten down its hatches and remain battened down for a year is mistaken. But also the evidence that that is the only thing you need to do, or primary thing you need to do, is pretty shaky.\"\nMr Shapps also said the hotel quarantine scheme would not affect many people. \n\"The 33 countries on the so-called red list do not have direct flights\u2026 so the numbers we would expect to see returning would be quite low,\" he said."

      "text": "Business leaders have called on the government to work with them on a roadmap out of lockdown to unlock investment for a post-Covid recovery.\nIn a letter to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, the Confederation of British Industry says the time to plan for re-opening the economy in England is now.\nFirms are \"in the dark\" about planning for the months ahead, the employers' group said.\nA government spokesperson said lockdown would be lifted as soon as possible.\nBut the CBI, which speaks on behalf of about 190,000 businesses, said there is an opportunity to \"use time wisely\" to prepare for a safe re-opening of the economy.\nIn a letter to Mr Kwarteng, CBI director-general Tony Danker, writes: \"With health teams rightly in crisis management mode, we in business along with the economic ministries can use this time to plan for a successful re-opening of the economy when the moment is right to do so.\n\"Businesses are currently completely in the dark when planning for the weeks and months ahead and this is hindering investment. We can provide more clarity and do the prep work now to enable them to plan for reopening and growth.\"\nMr Danker will also be writing to the devolved nations' governments next week.\nThe CBI calls for clarification on what will be considered low, medium or high-risk economic activity, so that businesses can understand what will open sooner or later.\nMr Danker also wants to know whether or not there will be a return to tiering, as part of a gradual re-opening. \nHe also wants the creation of bespoke, detailed plans for the harder-to-open sectors of the economy, such as testing regimes for international travel, or the conditions for activities such as hospitality and live events to return.\nMr Danker says in the letter: \"The Prime Minister has set out the initial parameters for reopening as a country, which was a big help for businesses. Clearly, the precise dates will be determined by data, so let's use this time wisely to get the roadmap right together for when lockdown ends.\n\"A common framework with devolved administrations must also be possible and help to minimise differences in approach.\"\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is working on a recovery plan, expected to be published ahead of next month's Budget. That plan will, according to reports, focus on jobs and investment.\nA government spokesperson said: \"As the prime minister has made clear, we will lift restrictions as soon as we can, but by lifting them too soon we run the risk of placing our NHS under even greater pressure and having to re-impose restrictions at a later date.\"\nThe spokesperson pointed out that the government had invested more than \u00a3280bn during the pandemic to protect jobs and businesses, adding: \"By mid-February we will be in a better position to lay out the next steps for the economy without risking renewed pressure on our NHS.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A UK trial has been launched to see if giving people different Covid vaccines for their first and second doses works as well as the current approach of using the same type of vaccine twice.\nThe idea is to provide more flexibility with vaccine rollout and help deal with any potential disruption to supplies. \nScientists say mixing jabs could also possibly give even better protection. \nThe vaccines minister said no changes would be made to the UK's current approach until at least the summer.\nCurrently, official guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says anyone already given the Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca jab as part of the UK's approved immunisation programme should get the same vaccine for both doses.\nThere is no suggestion this will change, although in very rare circumstances a different vaccine can be used - if only one vaccine is available, or it's not known which was given for the first dose.\nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government's taskforce had given about \u00a37m to fund the study, but that findings would not be available until the summer and therefore \"at the moment, we're not changing anything at all\".\nPrevious experience suggests mixing vaccines could be a beneficial approach - some Ebola immunisation programmes involve mixing different jabs to improve protection, for example. \nAnd Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast that this has been done with other vaccines such as jabs for hepatitis, polio and measles, mumps and rubella.\nThe Com-Cov study, run by the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium, will involve more than 800 volunteers.  \nThe study will be recruiting people aged 50 or older, who have not yet received a Covid vaccine, in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Nottingham, Bristol, Oxford and Southampton.\nSome will receive the Oxford jab followed by the Pfizer vaccine or vice versa, four or 12 weeks apart.\nOther vaccines may be added as they are approved by regulators.\nThe chief investigator, Prof Matthew Snape from the University of Oxford, said the \"tremendously exciting study\" would provide information vital for vaccine rollouts in the UK and globally. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that animal studies have shown \"a better antibody response with a mixed schedule rather than the straight schedule\" of vaccine doses.\n\"It will be really interesting to see if the different delivery methods actually could lead to an enhanced immune response [in humans],\" he said, \"or at least a response that's as good as giving the straight schedule of the same doses\".\nWhile this study was initially designed to provide greater flexibility for vaccine rollouts, there is the tantalising possibility that mixing vaccines could provide even better, longer-lasting protection.\nThe Oxford vaccine, for example, uses a harmless virus - almost like a viral postman - to deliver the key part of the vaccine (the bit with coronavirus's genetic code) into the body.\nThis bit of code helps train the body's immune system to recognise coronavirus and prepare defences to fight it off in the future. \nWhen a second dose of the same vaccine is given, there is some evidence to suggest that our immune systems can shift a bit of their focus onto the viral postman - rather than coronavirus itself.\nThe hope is that by mixing up jabs, this will allow our immune systems to focus more fully on building up protection against coronavirus.\nApproaching the challenge using various vaccine combinations may strengthen results. \nOther countries are conducting similar studies to monitor the impact of mixing vaccines.\nScientists will monitor volunteers for side-effects and carry out blood tests to see how well their immune systems respond.\nThe full study will continue for 13 months but scientists hope they will be able to announce some initial findings by June.\nThe study will also provide data on:\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there were \"definitive advantages\" to learning whether or not vaccine doses could be mixed, given the \"challenges\" of the vast number of people needing a jab and potential global supply constraints.\nHe said combining vaccines could lead to better protection, \"giving even higher antibody levels that last longer\". \nAny changes to the UK's current strategy would need approval from the JCVI. \nMore than 10 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\nThe government aims to offer first doses to 15 million people in the top four priority groups, including everyone over 70 years old, by 15 February.\nMr Zahawi said after that target has been met, a detailed timeline will be set out for the next set of priority groups, including people aged 50 to 69.\nWhat impact has Covid had on you and your family?

      "text": "UK residents returning from coronavirus hotspots abroad will have to quarantine in hotels from 15 February, the government has confirmed.\nHotel owners will be asked to provide rooms for more than 1,000 new people every day, documents suggest.\nPassengers will have to stay in their rooms for 10 nights, with security guards accompanying if they go outside.\nLabour called the measures \"too little, too late\" to deal properly with new overseas strains of Covid.\n\"It is beyond comprehension that these measures won't even start until 15 February,\" said shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds.\nQuarantine hotels are expected to be set up near airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. \nThe rules will apply to UK nationals and residents returning to the country from 33 \"red list\" Covid-19 hotspots - including several South American and African countries where new Covid variants have been detected in large numbers of people - and passengers will be expected to pay for the cost of the accommodation.\nMost foreign nationals from high-risk countries already face UK travel bans.\nMinisters are also likely to increase the fines for people who break the rules. Home Office sources have said they expect fines will have a deterrent effect so traveller numbers are likely to fall from 1000 a day swiftly.\nAccording to documents seen by the BBC, the government wants quarantine hotels to be made available \"on an exclusive basis\".\nGuests will have three meals a day in their rooms, with tea, coffee, fruit and water being available.\nSecurity will \"accompany any of the arrived individuals to access outside space should they need to smoke or get fresh air\", one document says.\nOne hospitality industry source said the government estimated the cost at about \u00a380 per night per person.\n\"If they are taking rooms for 1,425 passengers per night until 31 March, that is a bill of \u00a355m,\" they added.\nA Department of Health spokesperson said it was working \"at pace\" to roll out managed quarantine facilities in the run-up to 15 February.\n\"In the face of new variants, it is important that the government continues to take the necessary steps to protect people and save lives,\" they said. \nThe department says it sent commercial specifications on Thursday evening to hotels near air and sea ports asking for proposals on delivering quarantine facilities ahead of formal contracts being awarded.\nThe government is expected to set out further details next week on how passengers will be able to book into the designated hotels.\nIt has also been announced that Mr Hancock will chair a new Cabinet sub-committee to oversee efforts to implement mandatory quarantine and enhanced testing aimed at preventing the spread of new Covid variants. \nMr Thomas-Symonds said: \"We are in a race against time to protect our borders against new Covid strains. Yet hotel quarantine will come in to force more than 50 days after the South African strain was discovered.\"\nLabour has called on the government to extend hotel quarantining to those returning to the UK from all countries, not just the areas on the \"red list\".\nBut the Conservatives described the plan as \"implausible\", arguing it would mean putting around 20,000 people in hotels every day.\nA further 915 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to the government's daily figures.\nThis brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 110,250.\nHave you recently entered the UK from a hotspot such as South Africa?

      "text": "The company behind the controversial free school meals that sparked an outcry in January has apologised again.\n\"The quality and quantity of some food parcels fell short of our usual high standards,\" said Compass, which owns Chartwells, the school meal supplier.\nThe meals led to a row when one mum posted a picture of them on Twitter.\nCompass investigated the meals and said it had now \"taken several corrective measures\".\nThey include improved supply chain processes, additional guidance and resources for workers, and stronger quality assurance checks.\nChartwells has also been providing breakfasts to all children currently receiving a lunch parcel from it since 25 January. \n\"We will also provide those same children with lunch and breakfast parcels through the February half term break,\" Compass said, with the firm promising to cover the costs of doing so.\nFood parcels are currently being sent to school children in England who would normally get free school meals.\nIn January, one mother calling herself Roadside Mum posted a photo on Twitter of the free school meal that had been supplied to her and was supposedly worth \u00a330.\nIt consisted of two carrots, two potatoes and a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items: she calculated the cost to be only about \u00a35.\nThe outcry led to an urgent investigation by the government after footballer Marcus Rashford said the food parcels were \"just not good enough\" and food poverty campaigner Jack Monroe accused the company of providing a \"poverty picnic\".\nChartwells acknowledged the food was insufficient.\nIn a statement at the time it said: \"In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.\"\nIn its latest trading update, Compass said: \"We have apologised to everyone who has been affected.\"\nCompass reported improved figures for the last three months with its operating margin climbing to 2.7% to the end of December compared to 0.6% in the previous three months.\nIt put that down to \"a series of actions we have taken over the last year to adapt our operations and to manage our cost base more flexibly, including contract renegotiations and resizing of the business\".\nHowever, it said the group's organic revenue for the three months to 31 December 2020 was down 33.7%, which was \"in line with our expectations, given the protracted lockdown measures to contain the virus during the winter months\".\nIt warned that \"although the news around vaccinations is encouraging, the pace of volume recovery remains uncertain\".\nBut looking ahead it said it expected \"a return to organic revenue growth, continued margin improvement and returns to shareholders over time\".\nSophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"From an investment perspective, this [school meals] chapter has been an unwelcome addition to what is a torrid time for Compass, and won't have done the company's reputation any favours.\"\nContract catering is an incredibly tough place to be when the world shuts down, she pointed out.\nVolumes are barely edging forwards, meaning the bottom line is being protected through cost cutting.\n\"That's prudent business sense, but isn't a long-term solution. If it takes too long for stadiums and schools to fill back up, Compass will struggle to pump margins up any time soon.\""

      "tags": "Ofcom,Television,China",
      "text": "China's state-owned broadcaster has had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked by media watchdog Ofcom.\nOfcom said the company that owns the UK licence for China Global Television Network (CGTN) doesn't have day-to-day control over the channel, which is against its rules.\nStar China Media Limited (SCML), which owns the licence, \"did not have editorial responsibility\" over the English-language satellite news channel, Ofcom said.\n\"As such, SCML does not meet the legal requirement of having control over the licensed service, and so is not a lawful broadcast licensee.\"\nIn the UK, broadcasting laws say licensees must have control over their service and its editorial policies.\nOfcom said an entity called China Global Television Network Corporation is \"the ultimate decision maker\" over programmes.\nBut the regulator said it was unable to transfer the licence to that company because it is \"ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, which is not permitted under UK broadcasting law\".\nSuch a transfer was also not possible because \"crucial information was missing from the application\", while CGTN had \"repeatedly failed to respond to important questions\" and had not carried out a restructure, according to Ofcom.\nThe regulator said it had given the satellite news channel \"significant time to come into compliance with the statutory rules\". It added: \"Those efforts have now been exhausted.\"\nThe action to revoke the licence comes seven months after Ofcom found CGTN in breach of broadcasting regulations for airing a UK citizen's allegedly forced confession.\nIn July, Ofcom ruled that CGTN had been \"unjust\" to show footage of investigator Peter Humphrey \"appearing to confess to a criminal offence\". The channel was named CCTV News at the time of the broadcasts in 2013 and 2014.\nAnd last May, CGTN was found to have breached the UK's broadcasting code by failing to preserve due impartiality in its coverage of the Hong Kong protests.\nBarely half an hour after the Ofcom announcement, China's foreign ministry repeated its demand for a public apology from the BBC over its coverage of the pandemic in China. Some well-informed souls say that the timing may well have been genuinely coincidental - rather than a retaliatory gesture.\nChina has separately complained about the BBC's coverage of the mass detention of Uighur Muslims - which has prompted an international outcry - and the BBC's coverage of Covid-19. I'm told the BBC is standing by its reporting.\nThe context to all this is that in recent years, state broadcasters have become central to the international media ecosystem, seen as tools of soft power and propaganda. \nAnd there is a broader tech Cold War between China and the West, and particularly the US, over how open the internet should be.\nOnce upon a time global conflicts were mostly about land and natural resources. Today, they're increasingly about information.\nShortly after the Ofcom decision was announced, China said it had lodged \"stern representations\" to the BBC over what it called \"fake news\" in its coverage of Covid-19 and urged the broadcaster to apologise.\nThe corporation should \"stop harbouring ideological bias, stop smearing China, uphold professional ethics, and do objective, fair reporting on China\", China's foreign ministry said.\nThe BBC said it stood by its \"accurate and fair reporting of events in China and totally rejects these unfounded accusations of fake news or ideological bias\"."

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has said he was \"wrong\" to describe Boris Johnson's claims he backed the European Medicines Agency as \"complete nonsense\". \nMr Johnson accused the Labour leader of wanting to stay in the agency, at Prime Minister's Questions.\nThis was angrily denied by Sir Keir. Reports the two men continued the row afterwards were played down by Labour.\nBut the party has now issued a statement to say Sir Keir had \"misheard\" the prime minister.\nSir Keir thought the PM had \"falsely\" accused him of wanting the UK to be part of the EU's vaccine scheme, which the party said was not the case.\nBut it acknowledged that the Labour leader had previously expressed support for the European Medicines Agency.\nThe EMA is an EU body which evaluates new medicines and authorises the use of vaccines. However, individual countries within the EU can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market without EMA approval.\nThe exchange between the pair followed concerns from Sir Keir that the restrictions at the border are not strong enough to prevent new variants of Covid coming into the UK.\nMr Johnson defended the policy and said it had allowed the UK to get on with the vaccination programme.\n\"If we had listened to [Sir Keir] we would still be at the starting blocks,\" he said suggesting that membership of the EMA would have slowed down the UK's vaccine programme. \nBy Reality Check\nIn an exchange over coronavirus, Boris Johnson said that, when it came to vaccinations, Sir Keir Starmer \"wanted to stay in the European Medicines Agency [EMA] and said so four times from that dispatch box\".\nThe EMA has been slower to approve Covid vaccines for the EU than UK regulators.\nThe Labour leader denied this: \"The prime minister knows I've never said that from this dispatch box or anywhere else, but the truth escapes him.\"\nWe've found two occasions when he did speak up in favour of the EMA. They were from 2017 and made in the context of the ongoing Brexit debate back then.\nFor example in January 2017, Sir Keir he said in a parliamentary speech: \"Why would we want to be outside the European Medicines Agency, which ensures that all medicines in the EU market are safe and effective?\"\nAfter Prime Minister's Questions, a Labour spokesperson said: \"On a number of occasions the prime minister has wrongly claimed that Labour wanted to join the EU's vaccine programme. \nThat is inaccurate and the claim has been found to be untrue.\"\nSir Keir had \"assumed\" the prime minister was \"making the same false accusation again,\" the statement added.\n\"Keir accepts that, on this occasion, the prime minister was referring to old comments about the European Medicines Agency and Keir admits he was wrong and made a mistake in his response.\"\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth praised his leader for acknowledging the error, saying: \"I think it's a good thing that if a politician makes a mistake he holds his hand up... I think it's refreshing, I wish more politicians would do that.\"\nThere have been reports that Sir Keir and Mr Johnson got involved in an altercation on the subject after leaving the Commons chamber but Labour MP Chris Matheson, who was with his party leader, said \"there was a brief chat... nothing more to it than that.\"\nAnd a Labour source told the BBC: \"They had a perfectly reasonable conversation as they often do after PMQs.\"\nAsked about the alleged incident, Mr Johnson's press secretary Allegra Stratton said: \"I have seen the reports but I haven't seen the prime minister since he went to the Chamber so I can't confirm or deny that.\" "

      "text": "The Bank of England has taken another step towards adding negative interest rates to its crisis-fighting toolbox.\nIt's given High Street banks six months to be operationally ready for them.\nPolicymakers stressed that this did not mean that sub-zero borrowing costs were \"imminent, or indeed in prospect\".\nBut what exactly are negative interest rates? And could a world where savers are penalised and borrowers rewarded end up doing more harm than good?\nThe term \"interest rates\" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate.\nDescribed as the \"single most important interest rate in the UK\", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow.\nHigh street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage. \nThe Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less.\nIt cut them to a fresh low of 0.1% in March 2020 to try to stimulate the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated.\nAfter all, why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money, when they can keep the cash at home for free?\nThe Bank of England's number one job is to keep prices across the economy rising steadily every year.\nThis is known as the Bank's inflation target, which is set at 2% by the government.\nInflation measures how quickly the cost of living is rising.\nAnd, measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), it stood at 0.6% in December, up from 0.3% in November 2020.\nWhile low inflation means prices aren't rising quickly, if it remains low for too long, bosses start factoring that into pay reviews. \nThis can then dampen consumer confidence and spending.\nCentral banks have been cutting interest rates to spur inflation for years. But as rates approached zero across the developed world, a handful went a step further.\nSweden, Switzerland, Japan and the 19 nations of the eurozone all took interest rates below zero.\nIn Switzerland, negative interest rates have also helped to discourage investors from pouring money into the country during times of uncertainty.\nBritish savers have already seen their returns dwindle in recent years.\nThe average UK instant access account pays just 0.12%, according to the Bank of England, while accounts that require you to lock your money away currently offer an average return of 0.51%.\nIn countries with sub-zero interest rates, commercial banks have passed them on to big companies.\nHowever, the evidence suggests there is a very high bar to pass the pain on to ordinary savers.\nChristina Nyman, chief economist at Swedish lender Handelsbanken, says charging savers to put money in their own accounts is seen as \"taboo\" in Sweden.\nShe says: \"Competition is fierce, and households are ready to move their money to another bank, so nobody wants to lose business.\"\nSwiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse only impose negative rates on deposits of more than 2 million Swiss francs. \nIn Germany, where some banks impose charges on deposits of more than \u20ac100,000 (\u00a390,000), some people have started stashing their money in vaults.\nAccording to Germany's central bank, physical cash holdings by families and businesses there have almost trebled to \u20ac43.4bn since the European Central Bank (ECB) introduced a negative deposit rate in 2014.\nBut David Oxley at Capital Economics says there hasn't been a wider shift towards cash because most people still prefer the security and convenience of keeping it in the bank.\nPutting it in a vault \"runs the risk of the money either being lost, stolen, or damaged,\" he says. \"Bank deposits cannot catch fire, but banknotes can.\"\nNegative rate mortgages already exist. In 2019, Danish bank Jyske announced that it would effectively pay borrowers 0.5% a year to take out a 10-year loan. \nJames Pomeroy, an economist at HSBC, says this was only possible because of the nature of the mortgage market.\nWhen someone in Denmark applies for a home loan, Danish banks act as a middleman between potential borrowers and investors.\n\"In Denmark the banks don't take the hit, investors do,\" says Mr Pomeroy. \"Banks are then charging higher product fees, so have actually made money off of this.\"\nBut negative rate mortgages are unlikely to be offered in the UK any time soon.\nWhen UK interest rates were slashed to 0.5% in March 2009, some borrowers thought they could be in line for a payment.\nAround 1,500 Cheltenham and Gloucester customers had a mortgage that tracked 1.01 percentage points below the Bank of England base rate.\nBut any prospect of a windfall was quickly dashed when financial regulators described interest payments as \"a one-way obligation on the borrower\".\nIn a letter to UK bank bosses, Sam Woods, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), said some lenders would need up to 18 months to make permanent changes needed to deal with negative rates.\nWhile \"short-term fixes\" could be implemented within six months, upgrading systems not built to deal with a negative Bank of England base rate would take longer, especially for some mortgage customers.\nBanks said they would find it easier to explain and implement changes to big corporate clients, because many already had international experience with negative rates.\nWhat are the side effects of negative interest rates?\nNegative interest rates hit bank earnings by squeezing the gap between the money they make on loans and what they pay to savers.\n\"If not passed on to customers, negative rates would hurt bank profitability, especially at a time when they are expected to be hit by crisis-related loan losses,\" says Danae Kyriakopoulou, chief economist at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF).\nNegative interest rates pose a particular challenge to building societies, which hold around \u00a31 of every \u00a35 in British savings accounts.\nWhile commercial banks can access cheaper borrowing by tapping financial markets, building societies must raise at least half their funding from individual savers."

      "tags": "Harry Dunn crash,Croughton",
      "text": " The woman accused of killing Harry Dunn was \"employed by an intelligence agency in the US\" at the time of the crash, a court has heard.\nMr Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike was in a crash with a car near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire in 2019.\nSuspect Anne Sacoolas returned to the US, claiming diplomatic immunity, and an extradition request was blocked.\nA court in Virginia has heard her work was \"especially a factor\" in her leaving the UK.\nHer barrister told the court she fled the UK for \"security issues\" and feared she would \"not get a fair trial\" if she returned.\nThe comments about her role were made at a court in the state, where an application to dismiss a civil claim for damages submitted by Mr Dunn's family is being heard.\nWhen asked by the judge why Mrs Sacoolas had \"fled\" the UK, her barrister John McGavin said he could not respond \"completely candidly\".\n\"I know the answer but I cannot disclose it,\" he said.\nThe statement in a US court that Anne Sacoolas was a US intelligence official is a potentially enormous and important twist in the family's fight for justice - and it raises further questions about what the Foreign Office knew about her status in the UK. \nThe US long ago signed an agreement that its staff at RAF Croughton could not claim diplomatic immunity for actions beyond their duties. In other words, they could be potentially prosecuted for a crime. \nBut the High Court ruled last year that Ms Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity because that deal - known as a waiver - did not include the dependants of US staff. \nIt was an extraordinary and unintended loophole that has now been closed under a revised agreement between the countries. \nIf Ms Sacoolas did indeed work for US intelligence, that could mean the US had no right to claim in 2019 that she had immunity in the first place. Her actions may have been covered under the Croughton waiver, or another US-UK agreement that we don't know about. \nAnd that's why the family now want the Foreign Office to clarify what her status was.\nSpeaking after the hearing, family spokesman Radd Seiger called on the UK government to \"urgently reinvestigate\" whether Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity, given \"the admission in open court by Mrs Sacoolas's counsel that she was employed by US intelligence services at the time of the crash\".\nUnder the agreements at RAF Croughton dating back to 1995, anyone working at the base from the US as part of the \"administrative and technical staff\" would have their immunity pre-waived, meaning they would not be immune from criminal jurisdiction.\nThe Dunn's barrister Agnieszka Fryszman had earlier told the court the British government had endorsed the civil claim and called on the judge not to dismiss it.\nMrs Sacoolas, whose husband was based at RAF Croughton, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving after the crash.\nA Home Office extradition request was refused by Donald Trump's secretary of state Mike Pompeo in January 2020 and last week the new Biden administration said the decision was final.\nThe judge said he would decide on the application ahead of a further hearing at the same court on 17 February.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "The editor of the British Medical Journal has asked the New York Times to correct an article that says UK guidelines allow two Covid-19 vaccines to be mixed.\nThe US publication reported that UK health officials would allow patients to be given a second dose that is a different vaccine to their first.\nFiona Godlee pointed out in her letter to the NYT that it was not a recommendation.\nShe said the NYT's headline claiming UK guidelines say such substitutions \"may happen\" was \"seriously misleading\".\nThe UK has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - but both require two doses which are now to be administered 12 weeks apart\nMs Godlee said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) does not make any recommendation to mix and match - in other words, having a shot of one vaccine and then a different one 12 weeks later.\nDr Mary Ramsay, Public Health England's head of immunisations, said: \"We do not recommend mixing the Covid-19 vaccines - if your first dose is the Pfizer vaccine you should not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine for your second dose and vice versa.\"\nDr Ramsay added that on the \"extremely rare occasions\" where the same vaccine is unavailable or it is unknown which jab the patient received, it is \"better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all\".\nMs Godlee urged the New York Times to print a \"highly visible correction\" as soon as possible.\nMeanwhile, health staff have criticised the paperwork needed to gain NHS approval to give the coronavirus vaccine, with some medics being asked for proof they are trained in areas such as preventing radicalisation.\nThe first doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine are due to be given on Monday after the jab was approved for use in the UK last week.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first vaccine approved in the UK, and 944,539 people have had their first jab."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."
