      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

The condition of the injured person is not known.\nOne lane was shut in both directions on Wednesday morning due to emergency repairs to the crash barriers but work finished about 11:30.\nBut work is ongoing on the M4 at Swansea on a day that the RAC has warned could be the busiest travel day of the day with people going on their staycation break.\nThe queues in Swansea could affect tourists heading on holiday to west Wales or to ferry ports for sailings to the Republic of Ireland."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Simon Stevens,NHS England,Pay",
      "text": "A health minister has defended the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England, saying \"nurses are well-paid for the job\".\nLord Bethell praised the \"heroics\" of health workers during the pandemic, but said they had secure jobs that many people would \"envy\".\nHe was responding to opposition calls for the government to rethink its \"miserly\" 1% pay offer.\nLabour peer Lord McNicol said it was a \"kick in the teeth\" for NHS workers.\nLib Dem peer Lord Willis said it amounted to a pay cut - and the government should instead give staff a \"substantial bonus\" before negotiating a \"fair\" pay deal. \nLord Bethell insisted it was not a pay cut, but added: \"There are millions of people out of work out of the back of this pandemic. \n\"There are lots of people who have had an extremely tough time and who face a period of unemployment. Nurses are well-paid for the job. They have a secure job and they have other benefits. \n\"There are many people in this country who look upon professional jobs within the NHS with some envy and we shouldn't forget the fact that some public sector jobs are, in fact, extremely well-paid.\"\nWhat are key workers paid? \nMinisters will make their final decision on NHS pay for 2021/22 in May, after an independent panel makes it final recommendation.\nLord Bethell rejected calls for the government to change the evidence it had given to the panel and recommend a higher pay settlement, saying \"affordability\" remained the \"key challenge\".\nHe also rejected claims the pay proposal would harm recruitment, saying \"there is a long queue of people\" who want to train for nursing and other NHS jobs, because \"they are rewarding in many different ways\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has also defended the 1% rise, saying it was as much as the government could afford \"at the present time\" and NHS staff had been exempted from a public sector pay freeze.\nNurses have described the offer as \"insulting\", with unions threatening strike action and warning that the \"pitiful\" rise may lead staff to quit their jobs - worsening staffing issues in the health service.\nEarlier, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens confirmed that he had budgeted for a 2.1% pay rise for this year, but that had changed in light of the pandemic.\nHe added: \"You would expect the head of the health service to want to see properly rewarded NHS staff, particularly given everything that the service has been through over the course of the last year.\n\"And so I think the right way to resolve this is the path the government has actually set out, which is to ask the independent pay review bodies to look at all of the evidence.\" \nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \"The head of the NHS has confirmed what we already knew: the Conservatives have broken their promise to the NHS and are cutting nurses' pay.\"\nHe told an audience at the IPPR think tank that the 1% pay award was \"morally obnoxious\" and was \"only going to exacerbate the under-staffing issues we have in the NHS\".\nSome Conservative MPs are calling for a one-off bonus, of the kind offered to NHS staff in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as a \"thank you\" for their efforts during the pandemic. \nAsked about this idea, Sir Simon said: \"That's a discussion to be had in the round, whether that or whether underlying other action is the right approach, obviously we can see the attractions of that but that might not be the only answer.\"\nThe NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations.\nThe Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will be delayed until the summer - staff have been given an \"interim\" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement.\nNHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised a one-off \u00a3500 \"special recognition\" payment in January; and the Welsh government has said it will not set a \"ceiling\" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22."

      "text": "Billionaire Jeff Bezos has made a short journey to space, in the first crewed flight of his rocket ship, New Shepard.\nHe was accompanied by Mark Bezos, his brother, Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pioneer of the space race, and an 18-year-old student.\nThey travelled in a capsule with the biggest windows flown in space, offering stunning views of the Earth.\nWhen the capsule touched back down after the 10-minute, 10-second flight, Jeff Bezos exclaimed: \"Best day ever!\"\nNew Shepard, built by Bezos' company Blue Origin, is designed to serve the burgeoning market for space tourism.\nAmazon founder Mr Bezos - and other participants in the \"billionaire space race\" - have been criticised for offering what some see as joy rides for the super-wealthy. Critics say the money could be spent on pay rises for employees or fighting climate change.\nHowever, Mr Bezos insists he has an environmental vision: \"We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry and move it into space, and keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is,\" he told MSNBC.\n\"It's going to take decades and decades to achieve, but you have to start, and big things start with small steps... that's what this sub-orbital tourism mission allows us to do, it allows us to practice over and over.\"\nOn this flight was the oldest person who has been to space - Ms Funk - and the youngest, student Oliver Daemen.\nThe spacecraft lifted off at 14:12 BST (09:12 EDT) from a private launch site near Van Horn, Texas. \nAt a post-launch news briefing, Jeff Bezos said: \"My expectations were high and they were dramatically exceeded.\"\nTwo minutes into the flight, the capsule separated from its rocket and continued upwards towards the Karman Line - the most widely recognised boundary of space, that lies 100km up. The newly minted-astronauts shouted \"wow!\" and cheered.\nThe post-flight briefing was shown video of the occupants performing somersaults and tumbles during four minutes of weightlessness. Stunning views of the Earth could be seen outside.\nJeff Bezos said he was surprised by the sensation of microgravity: \"It felt so normal,\" he explained.\nMs Funk added: \"It was great, I loved it, I can hardly wait to go again.\"\nIn the 1960s, Ms Funk was one member of a group of women called the Mercury 13. They underwent the same screening tests as male astronauts, but never got to fly under the US national space programme.\nMr Bezos told CBS News on Monday: \"Wally can outrun all of us. During the Mercury 13, she was better than all the men and I can guarantee that's still true today.\"\nBezos' brother Mark, 53, is a senior vice president at Robin Hood, a New York-based charity.\nOliver Daemen is the son of a Dutch financier. He had originally secured a seat on the second flight, but was drafted in to replaced the anonymous winner of a public auction who had to pull out from the trip with Bezos.\nThe capsule reached a maximum altitude of around 107km (351,210ft) before starting its descent, parachuting down to a soft landing in the West Texas desert.\nOn the way down, Jeff Bezos told mission control: \"You have a very happy crew up here.\"\nMark revealed that iconic items from aviation history were brought along on the flight. These included a piece of canvas used on the Wright brothers' first plane, a medallion made from the vehicle that performed the first hot air balloon flight in 1783 and a pair of goggles used by pilot Amelia Earhart.\nJeff Bezos recently resigned as chief executive of Amazon, the e-commerce giant he founded, in order to concentrate on his other ventures, including Blue Origin.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "tags": "France,Home Office,English Channel,Europe migrant crisis,Migration",
      "text": "France will double the number of police patrolling its beaches as part of a deal with the UK to stem the number of migrants crossing the English Channel.\nIt comes as the number of people crossing the Channel this year has now overtaken 2020's total.\nThe UK will pay more than \u00a354m as part of the deal, which will also improve intelligence sharing.\nBut Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont suggested it would not have an impact as the French coastline is too big.\nHe told the Today programme: \"The fact is, we've seen it before. Having more money, having more police officers, having more controls, will not prevent people to succeed in these crossing attempts.\n\"We have too many kilometres of shore to monitor.\"\nThe funding will also be used for better technology to target those who organise the crossings, the Home Office said. \nA group of migrants was seen arriving at Dover on Wednesday morning, bringing the total number this year to more than the 8,461 who made the crossing in 2020. \nOn Monday at least 430 migrants crossed the Channel - a record for one day. The previous daily high of 416 was set in September last year. \nThe Home Office said on Tuesday 287 people had landed in the UK.\nUK Home Secretary Priti Patel and French interior minister Gerald Darmanin have agreed to \"strengthen co-operation\" over the crossings.\nThe Home Office said UK support last year helped France double the number of officers deployed daily on the beaches of its northern coast.\nIt said this resulted in France preventing twice as many crossings so far this year compared with the same period in 2020.\nHowever, it said the people who facilitated the crossings had now changed their tactics and had moved further up the French coast, \"forcing migrants to take even longer, riskier journeys\".\nMr Dumont added that the French are not supposed to intervene at sea - yet former Border Force chief Tony Smith has called for joint patrols. \nMr Smith said: \"That seems to be a step too far for the French at the moment. The French position is they are not prepared to intervene on the high seas, only on land.\"\nThe new support announced by the UK would enable France \"to respond by posting more security forces further up the coast, installing and utilising the latest surveillance equipment throughout northern France\", the Home Office said.\nHome Office minister Victoria Atkins insisted that a \u00a328m deal between the UK and France last November, to double police patrols on French beaches, had made a difference, saying it had prevented some 7,500 people crossing the Channel.\nMs Atkins told Today it was an \"incredibly complicated\" situation and that the UK was trying to work with other countries to make sure \"when people arrive in a safe country, they remain there and do not try to make that hazardous journey\". She said the government wanted \"safe routes for legal migrants\" and to crack down on the gangs bringing people over.  \nAnalysis by Simon Jones, BBC reporter, in Dover\nFrom the famous White Cliffs of Dover, we watched this morning as another group of migrants was brought to shore by the Border Force, having been picked up in the Channel. \nConditions at sea are once again incredibly calm and the sun is shining, so these are unlikely to be the only arrivals today. \nAlmost 1,000 people have reached the UK by boat in the past three days, putting pressure on the home secretary to act. \nPriti Patel is now pledging more money to the French authorities to try to prevent the crossings. But the deal struck last night is very similar to one agreed between Britain and France last November - which has failed to stem the numbers arriving, though the Home Office points out the number of crossings being prevented by the French authorities has doubled.\nThe government here accepts there is no quick and easy fix to problems with the asylum system, but there's no doubt the home secretary will want to see swift results in return for the increased investment in northern France.\nMs Patel has previously pledged to make Channel crossings \"unviable\", with new legislation that will make it a crime to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission.\nThe Nationality and Borders Bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, will mean migrants entering without permission could face up to four years in prison.\nThe government hopes the overhaul of asylum rules will deter migrants from making the crossing.\nBut the plans have been criticised by charities including Refugee Action, which has called them \"extreme and nasty\". \nDan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander for the Home Office, said: \"There is an unacceptable rise in dangerous small boat crossings across the Channel because of a surge in illegal migration across Europe.\n\"People should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach and not risk their lives making these dangerous crossings. We are continuing to pursue the criminals behind these illegal crossings.\"\nHe added that the Nationality and Borders Bill would \"protect lives and break this cycle of illegal crossings\" and the government was continuing to return those with no legal right to remain in the UK. \nBut Amnesty International's Steve Valdez-Symonds told the BBC the new legislation was an \"extremely reckless and dangerous response\" to the issue and would not tackle the problem of people smugglers. \nInstead, he said it was likely to drive desperate people to avoid the authorities, leaving them vulnerable to further exploitation and slavery. \nLabour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Home Office announcement was \"yet more empty words from the Conservatives about agreeing a deal with France to address trafficking gangs\".\nHe said ministers promised a plan with France in August 2020, \"yet almost a year later they are still making empty promises, letting down victims, and allowing criminals to continue their evil trade\"."

      "text": "Temperatures reached some of the highest this year on the sixth day of the heatwave, with forecasters expecting even hotter weather to come.\nThe Met Office, whose extreme heat weather warning covers large parts of Wales, said temperatures hit 30C in south Wales on Wednesday.\nIt comes as millions of holidaymakers are set to hit the roads after swapping foreign holidays for staycations. \nTuesday was the UK's hottest day so far with temperatures hitting 32.2C (90C).\nLondon's Heathrow Airport was the hottest place in the country - beating Sunday's 31.6C (88F) best - while in Wales the mercury has peaked at 30.9C (88F) in Usk on Tuesday and Cardiff on Monday.\nEmergency services are under pressure due to the heat with the Welsh Ambulance Service declaring an \"incident\" due to \"extreme pressure\" on Monday evening with demand overtaking capacity as they are dealing with 2,000 999 calls per day.\nAn extra 160 spaces are being made available at Pontypridd's National Lido of Wales, Lido Ponty, for Friday's sessions.\nMore than 5,000 spaces were not enough for those seeking to cool off in the water, with demand for spaces being extremely high all season.\nAs some cooled off, others reached boiling point, as volunteer coastguards at West Shore, Llandudno, reported being verbally abused by people as they were trying to rescue them from the incoming tide.\u00a0\nThe Llandudno coastguard posted on Facebook: \"Most people were unaware the danger they were in and were happy to take our advice, however we also received some abuse from a small number of people. \u00a0\n\"We don't do it for fun, we are there to keep you safe.\"\nWelsh Water urged customers to use water \"sensibly\" after a billion litres of water was used in one day instead of the usual 800 million litres.\nThe not-for-profit company said water demand had increased in tourist hotspots - such as Pembrokeshire - by up to 20%.\nChief executive Peter Perry said: \"We just ask people to use water sensibly.\n\"We've been planning for some time because we knew there was going to be a big staycation influx into Wales this year.\"\nOne top doctor has warned that most hospitals across Wales are \"under extreme strain\" and were at capacity most of the time.\n\"We see in the hot weather a lot of conditions deteriorate, certainly respiratory conditions, and heart conditions, they are the two most that we see presenting,\" Dr Mark Poulden, Morriston Hospital's clinical director of emergency medicine told BBC Radio Wales.\nDoctors have also advised parents to encourage children to play in the shade as much as possible, wear hats and long sleeves, and apply regular applications of sun cream to the skin.\nBut Saturday and Sunday will see a change with a yellow weather warning in place for much of Wales with \"heavy, thundery showers likely\".\nIt comes as the RAC has warned Wednesday could be be the busiest day on the UK roads with 2.6 million leisure trips, followed by 2.3 million on Friday.\nTraffic data expert Inrix has warned delays on the roads could be up to a third longer than normal July traffic as people holiday in the UK due to foreign holiday travel restrictions during the pandemic.\nWales is also expected to be one of the UK's most popular destinations with an RAC survey suggesting 11% of people heading to Welsh destinations - with the West Country and Scotland ahead of Wales as the most popular places to go.\nAlthough temperatures did not set records on Wednesday - the highest temperature ever recorded in Wales was 35.2C at Hawarden Bridge in Flintshire on 2 August 1990 - the Met Office said Thursday could be hotter again.\nForecasters had predicted temperatures of 30C (86F) across southern and western England and 25C (77F) in Belfast.\nThe Met Office's extreme amber heat warning remains in place for much of Wales, central and southern England and Northern Ireland until Thursday, although scattered thunderstorms and flood warnings are in place in parts of eastern England.\nThe Environment Agency has some flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - in place throughout parts of London, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.\nWe're into heatwave conditions for most of Wales. The Met Office's new warning for extreme heat means we need to be wary of impacts such as heatstroke and sunburn as well as the effect on infrastructure and public transport. \nA ridge of high pressure has been building over the UK over the past days, which is why it's been getting increasingly warmer.\nOn Wednesday we'll see a mild start with a little morning mist and patchy cloud but that will soon burn away leading to temperatures in the high 20s and low 30s.\nThursday and Friday will continue sunny and dry too, with just some patchy high cloud possible - and very warm again.\nBut could it all be over by the weekend? It does look like we could see the hot spell breaking down, with thundery showers pushing up from the south west on Friday.\nWatch this space - that beer garden booked for the weekend may need a rethink.\n* Source: The Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Saturday and Sunday but this time for rain, covering 19 of the 22 local authority areas in Wales.\nConwy, Denbighshire and the Isle of Anglesey are the only areas not included.\nHeavy, thundery showers are likely, particularly on Sunday when these could be widespread and locally torrential, according to the Met Office.\nLightning and hail are also expected and there could be rainfall of up to 100mm (4in) in some areas, with a chance of flooding.\nTraffic data analysts said the worst days for traffic could be Wednesday and Friday, with typical congestion pinch points being up to a third busier than normal.\nInrix said roads to watch for jams included parts of the M25 around London, the A303 in Wiltshire, the M1 in the East Midlands and the M4 around the Brynglas Tunnels at Newport.\nExperts also said to look out for hotspots including the M5 through Somerset and Devon and roads leading to other places such as the Lake District and the south coast.\nThe RAC predicted an \"unprecedented summer\" on the UK roads, saying more than 29 million staycations were planned, 16 million of these in the school holidays alone.\n\"We seem to have all the elements of a perfect storm on the UK's roads this summer,\" RAC spokesman Simon Williams said.\n\"With millions of drivers having already planned their staycation trips, plus the very real prospect of huge numbers more booking last minute if their foreign travel plans end in tatters because of Covid travel restrictions.\n\"After the hot weather last weekend, the scene is really set for an incredibly busy few weeks on the country's roads, whether that's on motorways or on smaller, minor routes that take people to popular tourist destinations by the coast or in the countryside.\"\nThe heat has led to reports of melting tar on the roads, including on the A478 between Kilgetty and Narberth in Pembrokeshire.\nCommuters and passengers have been warned of possible delays on the trains due to reduced speeds on some services because the hot weather can cause tracks to warp and buckle.\n\"There are some train speeds that have to be reduced just to make sure we're travelling safely in case there are buckles on the infrastructure, and that does have a knock-on effect on the timetable,\" said Transport for Wales safety and sustainability director Leyton Powell.\n\"That does mean that we do have some cancellations so we make sure [the trains are] safe to continue.\"\nIn terms of passenger comfort, Transport for Wales said they were ensuring air conditioning systems were working, asking people to open windows where possible and providing water and fluids as well as asking people to come prepared.\n\"What we will ask people....is to plan that journey,\" added Mr Powell.\n\"Not just to where you're going but that essential travel back home - don't wait like everyone else until those last journeys where it is likely to be more crowded.\"\nFor Sian Richardson, founder of the Bluetits Chill open water swimming group, the heatwave makes her usual swim in St David's in Pembrokeshire seem like it is happening in the Mediterranean.\n\"It's around 17 degrees at the moment. It's just incredible for us because it can go down to 6C in the winter and we swim all the year round,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We love the winter, we love the cold water but it's much more about quick dips, screaming and getting in, getting out, wrapping up, drinking coffee.\n\"This is all calmer. It's about really wanting to get in because the water is so delightful. Particularly at the moment because it's so hot we're all rushing to get in, then we're lounging about on the beach, drinking coffee and saying isn't it amazing?\n\"It's so hot here that it is cooling off, and we're all saying, gosh it's like the Mediterranean it's got that lovely holiday feel to it when you go on holiday and the sea is flat.\""

      "text": "Ariel Henry has been sworn in as Haiti's new prime minister, nearly two weeks after the assassination of the country's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse.\nThe late president asked Mr Henry to take the job, days before he was gunned down in the capital, Port-au-Prince.\nBut Mr Henry was in a political tussle with Claude Joseph, Haiti's interim PM at the time of the attack.\nMr Joseph stepped down on Monday and said Mr Henry's appointment would pave the way for elections in September.\nSpeaking at a ceremony in Port-au-Prince, the new prime minister called for unity.\n\"One of my priority tasks will be to reassure the people that we will do everything to restore order and security,\" said Mr Henry, according to AFP news agency.\nMr Joseph, who has returned to his former role as foreign minister, joined him at the ceremony and warned of a tough task ahead.\nThe inauguration took place as an official memorial began for Mo\u00efse, who was killed at his private residence on 7 July.\nHis wife Martine was also shot, and she arrived back in Haiti last week after receiving medical treatment in the US.\nMo\u00efse, 53, had ruled by decree in Haiti since 2018. Before his death, the country was already mired in political and security crises, with no working parliament, frequent anti-government protests, and a surge in gang violence.\nMany of the details of the president's assassination attack remain a mystery.\nHaitian police have blamed a group of mainly foreign mercenaries - 26 Colombians and two Haitian Americans.\nAt least 20 have been detained, while three were killed by police and five are still on the run. Christian Emmanuel Sanon, a Florida-based Haitian doctor, has been accused by police of masterminding the plot.\n\"All the culprits, perpetrators and sponsors must be identified and brought before Haitian justice,\" said Mr Henry.\n\"I hope that exemplary and dissuasive sentences will be pronounced. The nation expects no less from its leaders,\" he added. \"Never again will we have to relive such a tragedy.\""

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Companies,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,UK economy,Marks & Spencer",
      "text": "Marks & Spencer has warned it is already cutting Christmas products in Northern Ireland due to concerns over forthcoming post-Brexit customs checks.\nChairman Archie Norman told Radio Four's Today Programme the changes could mean higher prices and less choice for Northern Ireland customers.\nMr Norman said current \"pointless\" checks with the Republic of Ireland were \"threatening\" to its business.\nHe called for a \"common sense approach to enforcement.\"\nThe UK is expected later to warn the EU it is prepared to unilaterally override the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland if a simplified agreement cannot be reached.\nRight now, supermarkets who send products there from Great Britain face only light-touch checks, under a so-called \"grace period\" which delayed some of the new processes. That runs out at the end of September. \nThe Northern Ireland Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the island of Ireland's internal border.\nBut in the first warning from a major retailer on the scale of the potential problems, former Conservative party MP Mr Norman said once light-touch export checks end, there will be \"gaps on the shelves\".\n\"This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,\" he said.\n\"We've already made that decision. We're waiting to see how serious it's going to be but if it's anything like southern Ireland (the Republic of Ireland), and at the moment it's set to be, then it's going to be very, very serious for customers.\"\nMarks and Spencer is a major employer in Ireland, with more than 4,000 staff.\nIn a letter to Brexit minister Lord Frost, Mr Norman said the current EU customs arrangements were \"totally unsuited and were never designed for a modern fresh food supply chain between closely intertwined trading partners\".\n\"There is no other outcome for consumers in Northern Ireland in the end other than higher prices, given the inflationary pressures being put on to retailers by the regulatory regime,\" Mr Norman wrote.\n\"Being able to keep the show on the road, let alone growing, is going to be very challenging,\" he added.\nMr Norman told the BBC that \"pettifogging enforcement\" of the rules required M&S to employ 14 full-time vets, \"simply ticking boxes and filling out forms\", in order to certify its products.\n\"Sandwiches typically require three veterinary certificates to get through,\" he said.\nBecause of the way the system worked, M&S had had to give up exporting half its sandwich range to Ireland, he said.\nIf forms were filled in incorrectly, that meant delays, with everything on paper and nothing digital, Mr Norman said.\n\"If one page is blue instead of black typeface, the entire wagon is turned away,\" he added.\nMr Norman said that if the same regime was replicated in Northern Ireland at the end of September, it would be \"incendiary\" for the public there.\nMr Norman said M&S was one of the largest UK-based retailers operating in Ireland as a whole and played \"a disproportionate role\" in Northern Ireland. \n\"Our market share in Northern Ireland is almost double our share on the UK mainland. In part, this reflects our history as the only major UK retailer that committed to trade and invest continuously through the Troubles,\" he said.\n\"Our commitment and involvement with the people and communities of Northern Ireland remains strong. We are also a major employer and investor with over 4,000 people employed directly by M&S and many more in our supply chain.\"\nHe added that last year, M&S invested more than \u00a310m in the business in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, the issues raised by the current customs arrangements, in which Northern Ireland remains part of the EU Single Market while the rest of the UK has left, were \"very threatening to our business\", he said.\nIreland's European affairs minister Thomas Byrne said it was willing to discuss \"any creative solutions\".\n\"But we have to recognise as well that Britain decided itself to leave the single market of the European Union, to apply trade rules, to apply red tape to its goods that are leaving Britain, to goods that are coming into Britain,\" he added.\nThe EU has said a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement for Northern Ireland, in which the UK continues to follow EU agri-food rules, could be a solution, but it has been rejected by the UK.\nIn his letter, Mr Norman said he understood why the UK government was \"not favourably disposed\" to this solution, although he added that it was \"by far the best way of delivering a smooth trade flow\".\nRegardless of this, he added, many problems could be solved by a willingness to overlook \"trivial\" errors in paperwork and efforts to set up a \"trusted trader\" scheme.\n\"Any scheme should start on the basis that we are prepared to follow EU standards for products going to Northern Ireland,\" he said.\n\"The debate is not about meeting standards, this is about what we are required to do to show we are compliant.\"\nNumber 10 said Mr Norman's letter was a \"stark warning\" of \"the fundamental problems with the Protocol\".\n\"That is why we need to urgently tackle these issues, to ensure there is minimal disruption to people's lives in Northern Ireland, as the Protocol itself intended,\" it added.\nIt plans to set out details later on its approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe sort of products M&S is considering taking off the list for Northern Ireland this Christmas are ones containing a lot of different ingredients. For example, special occasion food like pies or pates, which people might order for a celebration. \nToday, the company's chairman wants to send a message that the way post-Brexit rules on trade with EU countries have been implemented is making it extremely difficult to get products over to the Republic of Ireland, forcing the retailer to cut back the range it sells there. \nAnd he fears Northern Ireland is heading the same way.\nIt won't be a co-incidence that Archie Norman's intervention comes just before we expect to hear more on the government's proposals. He presents an argument for introducing less disruptive trade processes after the grace periods expire.  \nWhether the EU will accept that is a whole other question."

      "tags": "Floods,Asia,China,Severe weather",
      "text": "As floodwater crashed through a busy subway station in China on Tuesday, desperate passengers tried to flee while others were swept helplessly off platforms.\nIn one train carriage, water seeped in and rose from ankle, to waist, to neck-height. Panicked commuters stretched upwards to breathe, while others lifted shorter people into the shrinking air pocket above.\nIn terrifying videos shared on social media, some passengers can be seen standing on chairs and clinging to the ceiling as the floodwater creeps upwards. One tried to smash a window, before realising that there was even more water outside the carriage.\nSome filmed the unfolding tragedy, while others called loved ones or posted pleas for help. \"I can't speak any more,\" one woman wrote on the social media site Weibo. \"If no rescue comes in 20 minutes, hundreds of us will lose our lives.\"\n\"We were all standing on the seats, and the water was already on our knees,\" a woman who gave her name as Ms Li told Elephant News. \n\"Some shorter passengers had water up to their necks,\" she said, adding that as time went on the air supply began to diminish.\nAfter about an hour, the train carriage was plunged into darkness and the oxygen level waned further. \"I was really scared, but the most terrifying thing was not the water, but the diminishing air supply,\" one person told Reuters news agency.\nAfter several hours of fear and uncertainty, rescuers were able to gain access through the roof of the carriage and pulled people out. \"We knocked on the glass a bit [on the ceiling]. Then suddenly there was air,\" an unnamed woman told state broadcaster CCTV.\nHundreds of people were eventually saved from the flooded subway tunnel in Zhengzhou, a city of 12 million people that sits on the banks of the Yellow River in central Henan province. \nBut at least 12 are known to have died and five were injured in the subway disaster, which came after the region saw more rainfall in three days than it usually would in a year. \nThis is a rainy time of year in China and floods happen annually. However, Chinese scientists say global warming has made the situation more dangerous and warn that extreme weather could become more frequent in the future.\nIn Henan, at least 33 people have died and more than 200,000 have been evacuated. Major roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris being swept along by fast moving currents.\nAt Shakoulu metro station the shutters are down, a small group of police stand watching at one entrance. \n\"Is this a crime scene?\" I asked one of them. \"I can't talk to you,\" he replied. \nThis is the place where graphic pictures, shared on social media, showed passengers lying lifeless on the platform below. You can't get down there now. Zhengzhou's metro network is completely closed. \nAbove ground, though, you can see the evidence and the aftermath: there's mud and silt on the edge of the road, on the other side from where I'm writing workers are fixing a part of the surface that was ripped up by the force of the water. \nBut to my right is the clearest evidence of what happened here; a four lane underpass vanishes after a few metres under an impromptu lake. \nThe water stretches out, covering the road, as far as I can see. It comes up almost over the railings on the walkway at the side.\nHarrowing accounts of the subway tragedy, and of the dramatic flooding around the province, are continuing to emerge, with witnesses describing scenes of fear and chaos.\n\"At the start there wasn't much water, then it was like it all started coming at once,\" one woman who was on the flooded subway train told the news outlet Pear Video.\n\"Within about 30 minutes it was up to my shoulders,\" she said. \"It was hard to breathe. A lot of people fainted.\"  \nThe woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she was trapped for more than four hours and cried when she was finally rescued.\n\"There was so much water on the platform, and there was water streaming out of the cracks in the subway doors,\" another passenger told Jiupai News.\n\"I'm quite tall, but after about five minutes, the water was already at my chest,\" he said. \"Tall people helped short people and children up onto the seats. I was holding someone's child.\" \nIn one post on Weibo, a woman described the panic in the carriage. \"Many people started to suffer breathing difficulties,\" she wrote. \"I heard a nearby passenger on her phone, giving her bank account details to her family, and thought I should do the same.\"\n\"Water was leaking from the cracks in the door, more and more of it, all of us who could, stood on the subway seats,\" another post read.\nDramatic images have also been shared of rescues above ground. Emergency workers have used long ropes to pull people to safety as they were dragged along by gushing currents.\n\"I was lucky that I stayed at home, but we [still] felt like we were going to be washed away,\" Wang Qian told BBC OS from Zhengzhou.\n\"I've contacted all of my family and luckily they're all safe. \"There's a lot of damage around us. I can see the floods everywhere, lots of cars and water everywhere,\" she said.\nRescue efforts are continuing around the province, while further downpours have been forecast for the rest of the week. \n\"We're all waiting to see if everything will be OK soon,\" Ms Wang said. \"We're very scared.\"\nAdditional reporting by Kerry Allen and Gareth Evans"

      "tags": "Fossils,Earth science,Marine life,Geology,Natural History Museum,Long Reads",
      "text": "\"If they could squeal, I'm sure they would have done.\"\nPalaeontologist Tim Ewin is standing in a quarry, recalling the calamity that's written in the rocks under his mud-caked boots.\n\"They tried to protect themselves, adopting the stress position of pulling their arms in,\" he continues. \"But it was all in vain; you can see where their arms got snagged open, right up to the crown. They were pushed into the sediment and buried alive.\"\nThere's a little smile creeping across Tim's face, and he's got reason to be happy.\nThe misfortune that struck this place 167 million years ago has delivered to him an extraordinary collection of fossil animals in what is unquestionably one of the most important Jurassic dig sites ever discovered in the UK.\nWe can't be precise about the location of the excavation for security reasons, but you'll recognise from the gorgeous, honey-coloured limestone that we're somewhere in Cotswold country.\nThings have changed a bit since Jurassic times, though.\nNo quaint villages and dry-stone walls back then; these parts were covered by a shallow sea, maybe 20-40m deep. And it was a damn sight warmer than your traditional English summer. The movement of tectonic plates means Britain was roughly where North Africa is today. \nSo you can imagine the types of creatures that would have been living on this ancient, near-tropical seafloor.\nStalked animals called sea lilies were tethered to the bed in great \"meadows\". Their free-floating cousins, the feather stars, were ambling by, looking to grab the same particles of food. And down in the sediment, starfish and brittle stars were feeling their way across the bottom with their fives arms, no doubt bumping into the occasional passing sea urchin or sea cucumber.\nIt's exactly this scene that's preserved in the rocks of our mystery quarry.\nThe quantities involved are astonishing. Not hundreds, not thousands, but perhaps tens of thousands of these animals that scientists collectively call \"the echinoderms\". It's a great name, derived from the Greek for \"hedgehog\", or \"spiny\", \"skin\". What is a sea urchin, if not an \"underwater hedgehog\"?\nMost of what we know about the deep history of echinoderms from British fossils comes from the few specimens that emerged from railway cuttings and quarrying in the Victorian age. \nTim Ewin's institution, the Natural History Museum in London, has these items tucked away in a small space that will now be utterly inadequate to accommodate the truckload of new examples that is coming.\n\"In this age of rock from the Middle Jurassic, only two species of starfish were known, represented by five specimens,\" he says. \"In just a few days of collecting here, we've got 12 starfish specimens, and expect to find many more. \n\"And it's the same for the comatulids, or stemless crinoids (feather stars) - 200 years' worth of collecting is represented at the museum by about 25 specimens. Here, we've probably got 25 specimens just under our feet, and we've collected over 1,000.\"\nBut it's also the quality of the preservation that's jaw-dropping.\nLean in close to a slab of rock that's just been cleaned up and you'll observe what, at first sight, reminds you of a plate of noodles. It is in fact a great mass of fossil arms from who knows how many sea lilies.\nYou can clearly discern the individual calcite plates, or ossicles, that made up the skeletal frames of these animals when they were alive. What's more, the specimens are fully articulated. That's to say, all parts are still intact. Everything is captured in three dimensions.\n\"We talk about the fives (radial symmetry) in echinoderms. They're all there; you can see them,\" says NHM senior fossil preparator Mark Graham.\nSpecialists in fossil echinoderms believe the Cotswold quarry will help them better categorise the species' different life stages, their ecology and their proper position in evolutionary history.\nTo paraphrase that old cliche: the textbooks might not need to be rewritten but some extensive notes will almost certainly have to be added to the margins.\nAnd the new learning will go wider still, says echinoderm specialist Jeff Thompson.\n\"We live in a changing world today, and if we want to understand how climate change might affect not only the future of humanity but of all life on Earth's surface, then the echinoderms are one of the best groups to study,\" he tells me.\n\"We know quite well what happened to them through a variety of mass extinctions, so their experience can be really helpful as we try to understand the major changes in biodiversity across geological time.\"\nSally Hollingworth is half-standing, half-sitting at the edge of a pool of muddy water. She's busy trying to ease yet more feather stars from the clay layers that intersperse the quarry's limestone units.\nShe's gently prodding with a spatula, attempting to get under the specimens to lift them without breaking them.\n\"I call them 'squiggly wigglies',\" she laughs. \"The stalked crinoids, I call those 'stalkie walkies'.\"\nIt's Sally and her husband, Neville, that the NHM have to thank for finding this marvellous site.\nThe pair are keen amateur palaeontologists. They spend their weekends investigating the Cotswold hills and their surrounds, looking for interesting rocks. The most promising items they take home to \"his and hers\" studios (a shed and a garage) where they use air abrasion tools to lift off any obscuring sediment.\nIt was while cooped up during lockdown that Sally and Neville first identified the potential of the quarry.\nAfter examining the location on Google Earth and comparing it with geological maps of the area, they sought permission from the landowner for a recce, which Sally says seemed somewhat underwhelming at the time.\n\"We were finding only tiny fragments of Jurassic sea creatures and we said, 'well, OK, let's take a slab home and see what we can reveal if we can clean it up',\" she recalls.\n\"I remember Nev shouting from the garage, 'Sal, Sal! You've got to come and have a look at this!' It was this beautiful sea lily emerging, coming to life, from the slab.\"\nWhen Tim Ewin was notified, he immediately recognised the quarry's importance and arranged for an expert team to come in and conduct a systematic search.\nSally and Neville, far from being pushed aside by the professionals, are integral members of the group. Their local knowledge and homemade elderflower cordial are greatly appreciated.\nWorking the site is a mucky business. Recent rains have turned the floor of the quarry into a mud bath, and the precise and careful process of fossil excavation means the researchers have no choice but to get down on their hands and knees in the sticky mess.\n\"Some nice things are being protected by overturned food trays. It might not look like it in all this mud but there are actually some places where we're not supposed to put our feet,\" says NHM curator Zoe Hughes. \"But there's such an abundance, it's maybe not such a concern,\" quips colleague Katie Collins. \"There's such a bonanza of stuff.\"\nThe focus is those clay layers. These hold the mass of echinoderms.\nThe context appears to be a busy swathe of sea-bottom where nutrients were constantly being delivered to the site. \nYou see this in the occasional chunk of Jurassic wood that pokes out from the goo. Maybe there was a delta not far away that was directing food-laden waters to this scene. \nThis can explain the abundance of fossil animals but it doesn't explain their supreme preservation. For that, we have to return to the idea of a calamity. The clue to the drama is recorded in the harder, more sand-rich bands of clay - a signal of a sudden shift towards a more energetic environment.  \n\"What we have is something very suggestive of a dramatic mudflow,\" explains Zoe. \"We have this happy little ecosystem and then, boom! - something catastrophic happens. \n\"Perhaps there was an earthquake that caused the mudslide and this came in and covered everything up. This is why the preservation is so amazing, because the scavengers couldn't then get to all those animals to pick them apart.\"\nAs Neville Hollingworth likes to put it: \"What we've got here is a sort of Jurassic Pompeii.\"\nYou might also like:"

      "tags": "Tokyo,Japan,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Tokyo Olympic Games are under way, with thousands of athletes set to compete.\nOrganisers say the event can be held safely, despite calls for it to be cancelled because of Covid.\nThe 2020 Summer Olympic Games take place between 23 July and 8 August. \nThe Paralympic Games are due to run between 24 August and 5 September. \nThe Games were postponed last year because of Covid. \nThe Olympics will feature 33 sports at 339 events across 42 venues. The Paralympics will feature 22 sports at 539 events across 21 venues.\nMost events are in the Greater Tokyo area, although some football games and the marathon will take place in the northern city of Sapporo.\nJapan has had relatively low case numbers, but a new wave of infections began in April.\nAs of 21 July, there were 848,222 confirmed cases and 15,062 deaths (compared with 5.5 million cases and 128,800 deaths in the UK).\nJapan only began vaccinating in February and only 22% of its population of about 126 million is fully vaccinated.\nIn Tokyo and Osaka, the two cities hit hardest by the recent surge, authorities hope over-65s will be fully vaccinated by the end of July. \nEntry to Japan by foreigners from 159 countries - including the UK - is currently banned. \nInternational athletes and support staff are being tested every day.\nAthletes don't have to be vaccinated, though International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials expect around 80% will be.\nMore than 90 people associated with the Games have tested positive so far, including British athlete Amber Hill who has withdrawn from the women's skeet competition.\nAll spectators were banned after a state of emergency was declared in Tokyo on 8 July. It will stay in place until 22 August.\nA decision about whether Japanese spectators will be able to attend the Paralympics has not yet been made.\nTokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said she was \"sorry to those who purchased tickets\".\nThe contract between the IOC and the host city Tokyo suggests only the IOC can cancel the event.\nThe IOC is thought to make around 70% of its money from broadcast rights, and 18% from sponsorship.\nIOC president Thomas Bach said the thought of rescheduling the competition \"caused sleepless nights\". He insisted the Games must go ahead \"to give hope\" for the future.\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also backed the competition, arguing it could show what can be done with the correct Covid safeguards.\nBut the head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee Toshiro Muto has not ruled out cancelling the Olympic Games even at this late stage.  He said he would keep an eye on infection numbers and hold \"discussions\" if necessary.\nIf the Tokyo organisers were to cancel the contract, the risks and losses would probably fall on the Japanese side. \nThe budget for Tokyo 2020 was set at $12.6bn (\u00a38.9bn), although it's been reported the actual cost may be double that. \nSeveral towns set to host athletes reportedly pulled out earlier in the year because of fears about Covid and extra pressure on the healthcare system.\nIn May, a Japanese doctors' union said it was \"impossible\" to hold the Games given the pandemic. \nA poll in May in the leading Asahi Shimbun newspaper suggested more than 80% of the population want them cancelled or postponed.\nA number of bodies have expressed concern. \nThe World Players Association, representing 85,000 athletes in over 60 countries, said the IOC must do more to ensure athletes' safety - with stricter physical distancing and more rigorous testing. \nJapanese athletes have largely kept a low profile, but the country's biggest sports star, tennis champion Naomi Osaka, previously said there should be a debate about whether the Games should go ahead.

      "text": "A breakdown of the numbers of people who died with Covid-19 for each care home in England has been published for the first time. \nOverall, more than 39,000 care home residents died with the virus between 10 April 2020 and 31 March 2021. \nThe numbers, released by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), show how the virus spread across the country.\n\"Every number represents a life lost,\" said Kate Terroni, CQC chief inspector for adult social care.\nThe highest number of deaths in a single care home was 44, while 21 homes had more than 30 Covid-related deaths. \nIf you can't see the look-up click here\nCare homes in the North West had the most Covid-related deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, while those in the South East were hardest hit in the second. \nFamilies who have been campaigning to get the data released say it is vital to have transparency about what happened. \nThe CQC says it has not found a link between standards of care in a home and the number of deaths. \nThe regulator adds that many factors are involved, including the levels of Covid in the local community and the age and health of the residents. \nAlmost half of the deaths - 18,261 - occurred between April and June 2020, with another peak between January and March 2021, the report says.\nCare home managers have a duty to inform the regulator when one of their residents dies. \nFrom 10 April 2020, they also had to say whether Covid was believed to be a factor in the person's death.\nThe CQC data is based on these notifications. \nIt also includes the deaths of residents outside care homes, for instance in hospitals. \nAmanda Henry had been unable to see her father Robert, 78, for nearly four weeks - and when she was at last allowed into his care home in Poplar, east London, it was because he was gravely ill. \nCare homes were struggling to get personal protective equipment and the official guidance they needed. \nAt the time Amanda just wanted to give him some comfort, but even then - in April 2020 - she says she noticed shortcomings with personal protective equipment (PPE).\nThere was not enough of it, it was flimsy and staff were not using it properly, she claims. \nStaff were going from room to room, not changing their PPE, not washing their hands between rooms, and some had no PPE at all, she says. \n\"What I was witnessing was the virus being spread amongst the residents of the care home in real time...\n\"I feel it tells us that these vulnerable elderly people were disposable to this government...\n\"I'm angry, I'm angry that my dad had to suffer like that.\"\nHC-One, which runs the home, says it is deeply saddened by the impact of the virus in its homes and across the country. \nIn April 2020, it says \"we were already working closely with the local public health team to try to keep residents safe and to help them recover, despite the limited information and understanding the country had about this virus at that time.\n\"Our colleagues were wholly focused on doing the best job they could in exceptionally difficult circumstances, and we are incredibly proud of their bravery and commitment to our residents.\" \nSandra Joyce, proprietor of Linden House nursing home in Somerset, managed to keep the virus at bay until  December 2020.\n\"And then it just hit us and just went around the home like wildfire. It was horrific.\"\nBy that stage there was plenty of PPE and staff at Linden were well schooled in its use, changing it every time they entered or left a resident's room. \nEven so, nearly half of the home's residents died and at one point 80% of the staff were sick or having to isolate.\nSomerset County Council provided some emergency cover but Sandra still had to stay on until the small hours of the morning, after a full day at work, for days on end. \nStaff shortages meant tough choices, she says.\n\"There comes a point in people's lives when you know there is a point of no return and we always like to have a member of staff sitting with them... \n\"Instead we had to pop in, pop out.\" \nAt one point she decided the home was so unsafe it should close, but was told there was nowhere else for her Covid-positive residents to go. \n\"So literally, I had no choice.\" \nShe fears another wave of the virus would find care homes just as vulnerable.\n\"It was a living hell, I can't make it sound anything better than that.\"\nThe CQC says it conducted 5,577 inspections of adult care providers between 10 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, and that complaints, whistle-blowers and the absence of a registered manager were more likely to indicate poor care than death notifications.\nMs Terroni said the CQC only published the data \"once we felt able to do so as accurately and safely as possible\", given its complexity and sensitivity.\n\"As we publish this data, we ask for consideration and respect to be shown to people living in care homes, to families who have been affected and to the staff who have done everything they could, in incredibly difficult circumstances, to look after those in their care\".   \nCare England, which represents independent providers of social care, expressed deepest sympathies to the relatives of all care home residents and staff who have died of Covid-19. \nChief Executive Prof Martin Green said care homes had been \"right at the frontline of this dreadful pandemic\".\n\"It would be hugely disrespectful if lessons were not learned at every level,\" he added.

Surveys suggest there is widespread vaccine hesitancy in France.\nMr Macron's plans have proved controversial. Protests against new coronavirus rules in France saw demonstrators vandalising two vaccination centres this week.\n\"Health Dictatorship\" is what protesters here are calling it.\nIf the government has its way, in a few short weeks, you won't be able to sit down for a coffee at a Paris caf\u00e9 - or board a train - without proof that you're Covid-free, vaccinated or immune.\nThis so-called Health Pass is the government's answer to infection rates that are rising faster than France has ever seen in this pandemic.\nAlready, from today, there'll be no routine access to cinemas, theatres, museums - no trips to Disneyland Paris - without it.\nBut it's the plan to extend that restriction to everyday public places - cafes, shopping centres and public transport - that's causing the biggest backlash.\nSome MPs have reported receiving death threats ahead of the debate today.\nAnd some protesters sparked fury last week by comparing these government restrictions to the singling out of Jews during France's war-time Nazi occupation.\nA majority of French people appear to support the plan, with many believing it's the only way to avoid yet another lockdown."

      "text": "A national strategy is needed to tackle poor health and lower life expectancy in seaside towns, a report from England's chief medical officer says.\nChris Whitty says these places might have natural beauty but suffer from high rates of serious illnesses.\nCoastal towns have been \"overlooked by governments\" and had their \"ill-health hidden\", said Prof Whitty.\nThe report calls for cross-government action to address overlapping issues such as bad housing and poor health. \nCoastal towns need their own dedicated health improvement policy, says the report, because the challenges facing towns such as Blackpool, Skegness and Hastings have more in common with each other than their inland neighbouring towns.\nSeaside and coastal towns often have older populations with more complex health needs - but at the same time local NHS services can suffer from recruitment problems, leaving gaps in health services where they are needed most.\nThere are deep-rooted social problems interwoven with poor health in coastal areas, the report highlights - such as low-paid seasonal jobs, underachievement in education, poor transport and overcrowded \"houses of multiple occupation,\" which might be converted from former guest houses.\nUsing the example of Blackpool, the report shows how the areas of the town with the lowest male life expectancy are the same areas with the greatest concentrations of houses of multiple occupation.\nDr Arif Rajpura, Blackpool's director of public health, said the town's health problems required tackling the \"failed\" areas of private sector housing.\nSeaside accommodation is also converted to house vulnerable people from bigger cities, adding to the pressure on local health and mental health services.\n\"Coastal towns are forgotten about,\" says Jodie Smith, who lives in Eastfield, beside the North Yorkshire seaside resort of Scarborough.\nRecruitment problems for health staff is a \"common issue\" in coastal areas, says the report. In Eastfield there are no dentists at all, since the last practice closed, and Jodie describes a long list of complications and costs for families trying to get treatment.\nWhen her six-year-old son needed a dentist, Jodie and husband Andy were first directed to take a 100-mile round trip for an appointment. That was resolved with a trip only 20 miles away, but she says the lack of such basic services is \"ridiculous\".\nAnother friend went to accident and emergency, but ended up having to pay \u00a3180 for private treatment.\n\"They want people to go private. But you shouldn't have to choose between putting food on the table and going to the dentist,\" she says.\nThere are plans for an emergency dental service, but Jodie says people should be seeing a dentist regularly and not have to wait until a crisis.\n\"It's the same story across too many of our seaside towns, with practices struggling to fill vacancies and patients unable to secure care,\" says British Dental Association chairman Eddie Crouch.\nLocal councillor Tony Randerson says phone calls about finding a dentist have become a regular occurrence.\nHe says it's \"absolutely diabolical\" that 6,000 people, in one of the poorest wards in North Yorkshire, should be without a local dentist.\nCllr Randerson also reports an increase in mental health problems during the pandemic, reflecting people becoming isolated and lonely.\nFor problems of bad diet and obesity, he blames the spread of fast food shops. \n\"Whenever a shop becomes vacant - there's another fast food outlet. We're at saturation point.\"\nHeart disease, strokes, mental health problems, diabetes and higher rates of smoking are all more prevalent in seaside populations, the report warns, associated in turn with higher levels of coastal deprivation.\nAsthma was one of the few health problems less common on the coast - and Prof Whitty pointed to the \"paradox\" of ill health in seaside towns when there were so many natural advantages - such as lower pollution and better access to healthy outside spaces.\n\"Coastal areas are some the most beautiful, vibrant and historic places in the country. They also have some of the worst health outcomes with low life expectancy and high rates of many major diseases,\" said the chief medical officer.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the new Office for Health Promotion could make a positive difference.\n\"Those living in coastal areas clearly face different sets of challenges to those inland but everybody, no matter where they live, should have similar opportunities in education, housing, employment and health,\" he said."

      "text": "Marks & Spencer has warned it is already cutting Christmas products in Northern Ireland due to concerns over forthcoming post-Brexit customs checks.\nChairman Archie Norman told Radio Four's Today Programme the changes could mean higher prices and less choice for Northern Ireland customers.\nMr Norman said current \"pointless\" checks with the Republic of Ireland were \"threatening\" to its business.\nHe called for a \"common sense approach to enforcement.\"\nThe UK is expected later to warn the EU it is prepared to unilaterally override the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland if a simplified agreement cannot be reached.\nRight now, supermarkets who send products there from Great Britain face only light-touch checks, under a so-called \"grace period\" which delayed some of the new processes. That runs out at the end of September. \nThe Northern Ireland Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the island of Ireland's internal border.\nBut in the first warning from a major retailer on the scale of the potential problems, former Conservative party MP Mr Norman said once light-touch export checks end, there will be \"gaps on the shelves\".\n\"This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,\" he said.\n\"We've already made that decision. We're waiting to see how serious it's going to be but if it's anything like southern Ireland (the Republic of Ireland), and at the moment it's set to be, then it's going to be very, very serious for customers.\"\nMarks and Spencer is a major employer in Ireland, with more than 4,000 staff.\nIn a letter to Brexit minister Lord Frost, Mr Norman said the current EU customs arrangements were \"totally unsuited and were never designed for a modern fresh food supply chain between closely intertwined trading partners\".\n\"There is no other outcome for consumers in Northern Ireland in the end other than higher prices, given the inflationary pressures being put on to retailers by the regulatory regime,\" Mr Norman wrote.\n\"Being able to keep the show on the road, let alone growing, is going to be very challenging,\" he added.\nMr Norman told the BBC that \"pettifogging enforcement\" of the rules required M&S to employ 14 full-time vets, \"simply ticking boxes and filling out forms\", in order to certify its products.\n\"Sandwiches typically require three veterinary certificates to get through,\" he said.\nBecause of the way the system worked, M&S had had to give up exporting half its sandwich range to Ireland, he said.\nIf forms were filled in incorrectly, that meant delays, with everything on paper and nothing digital, Mr Norman said.\n\"If one page is blue instead of black typeface, the entire wagon is turned away,\" he added.\nMr Norman said that if the same regime was replicated in Northern Ireland at the end of September, it would be \"incendiary\" for the public there.\nMr Norman said M&S was one of the largest UK-based retailers operating in Ireland as a whole and played \"a disproportionate role\" in Northern Ireland. \n\"Our market share in Northern Ireland is almost double our share on the UK mainland. In part, this reflects our history as the only major UK retailer that committed to trade and invest continuously through the Troubles,\" he said.\n\"Our commitment and involvement with the people and communities of Northern Ireland remains strong. We are also a major employer and investor with over 4,000 people employed directly by M&S and many more in our supply chain.\"\nHe added that last year, M&S invested more than \u00a310m in the business in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, the issues raised by the current customs arrangements, in which Northern Ireland remains part of the EU Single Market while the rest of the UK has left, were \"very threatening to our business\", he said.\nIreland's European affairs minister Thomas Byrne said it was willing to discuss \"any creative solutions\".\n\"But we have to recognise as well that Britain decided itself to leave the single market of the European Union, to apply trade rules, to apply red tape to its goods that are leaving Britain, to goods that are coming into Britain,\" he added.\nThe EU has said a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement for Northern Ireland, in which the UK continues to follow EU agri-food rules, could be a solution, but it has been rejected by the UK.\nIn his letter, Mr Norman said he understood why the UK government was \"not favourably disposed\" to this solution, although he added that it was \"by far the best way of delivering a smooth trade flow\".\nRegardless of this, he added, many problems could be solved by a willingness to overlook \"trivial\" errors in paperwork and efforts to set up a \"trusted trader\" scheme.\n\"Any scheme should start on the basis that we are prepared to follow EU standards for products going to Northern Ireland,\" he said.\n\"The debate is not about meeting standards, this is about what we are required to do to show we are compliant.\"\nNumber 10 said Mr Norman's letter was a \"stark warning\" of \"the fundamental problems with the Protocol\".\n\"That is why we need to urgently tackle these issues, to ensure there is minimal disruption to people's lives in Northern Ireland, as the Protocol itself intended,\" it added.\nIt plans to set out details later on its approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe sort of products M&S is considering taking off the list for Northern Ireland this Christmas are ones containing a lot of different ingredients. For example, special occasion food like pies or pates, which people might order for a celebration. \nToday, the company's chairman wants to send a message that the way post-Brexit rules on trade with EU countries have been implemented is making it extremely difficult to get products over to the Republic of Ireland, forcing the retailer to cut back the range it sells there. \nAnd he fears Northern Ireland is heading the same way.\nIt won't be a co-incidence that Archie Norman's intervention comes just before we expect to hear more on the government's proposals. He presents an argument for introducing less disruptive trade processes after the grace periods expire.  \nWhether the EU will accept that is a whole other question."

      "tags": "Cosmetic surgery,Social media",
      "text": "The \"complete absence\" of regulation of non-surgical beauty treatments, such as botox-style injections and fillers, is dangerous and must urgently change, say MPs.\nAfter a year-long review, they claim the government has left the industry to regulate itself, despite concerns regularly raised by many within the sector.\nRecommendations include mandatory training for all practitioners.\nPatient Safety Minister Nadine Dorries says she will review the report.\nThe All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Beauty, Aesthetics and Wellbeing, says that while demand for non-surgical procedures has \"exploded\" in recent years, the UK government has failed to keep up - with aesthetic training courses almost entirely unregulated.\nIf invasive beauty procedures are not carried out properly, it can put the patient at risk of serious complications.\nSuch concerns were demonstrated in a recent BBC Three documentary which revealed complicated aesthetic procedures are being taught over the internet or on unsafe one-day courses.\n\"It's like the Wild West,\" explains inquiry co-chairwoman and Labour MP Carolyn Harris. \n\"We have people who are selling training courses which are not worth the paper they are written on. We have practitioners who are destroying the industry's reputation by practising completely unqualified and we have victims who are scarred for life.\"\nThe review makes 17 recommendations that it wants the government to implement.  \nThese include introducing mandatory training for all practitioners and setting up a national licensing system, to ensure premises meet certain hygiene requirements. \nIt's hoped this would stop treatments taking place in \"unsuitable locations\" like offices, hotel rooms and pop-up shops.\nMake-up artist Sarah Draa, 23, first got filler in her lips when she was 18.\n\"I would say, 'I want Kylie Jenner lips, I want to look like Kim K,'\" she explains. \"There's so much pressure when you are seeing influencers on massive social media platforms every day.\" \nAfter a few filler top-ups, Sarah still hadn't achieved the \"juicy, pouty lips\" she wanted - and lumps had started appearing.\nShe was also running out of money so decided to try the cheapest practitioner she could find. \nOne lump on her top lip got bigger and bigger.\n\"It become so noticeably big, my lips looked like they had collapsed,\" she says. \"I had to have more filler put into the other side to balance it out. \n\"I looked disfigured and it was so sore.\"\nSarah eventually agreed to have the filler dissolved and later refilled, after meeting with practitioner Amish Patels who is a member of Save Face, a register for medical professionals who provide non-surgical cosmetic treatments.\n\"I have been working in the industry for over five years and never before have I had so many enquiries for people seeking help,\" Amish says. \"I have built up my clinic and reputation on corrective work, which is sad. It shouldn't be that way.\"\nSarah agrees: \"You need to think before you get these things done. Looking back, I realise how young 18 is and if I could go back I probably would hold off.\n\"I'm not an anti-filler person because I believe you should do whatever makes you happy, but if you're going to do it, do your research on a practitioner's experience and possible complications.\"\nAs part of the Botulinum Toxin and Cosmetic Fillers (Children) Act 2021, it is due to become illegal for under-18s to receive Botox (botulinum toxin injections) or fillers in October.\nHowever, MPs say this should be extended to other invasive treatments like thread lifts. \nAesthetic surgeon Dr Vincent Wong supports the idea, saying: \"Eighteen years old is considered very young to be changing the structure or shape of your face. Young people should focus on good skin care products, but unfortunately many come to us and want to look like certain celebrities.\"\nThe report says social media platforms have driven demand for treatments and become a platform to sell them and must take responsibility for curbing misleading advertisements.\nThe inquiry also wants to challenge the idea that non-surgical treatments are a \"quick fix\" to improve self-esteem or happiness.\nIt has called for mandatory psychological screenings to take place ahead of treatments to understand a person's motivation and spot individuals at risk.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care will review the report's recommendations.\nNadine Dorries said: \"Patients must always come first, and I am committed to protecting their safety making sure people have the right information they need to make informed decisions about cosmetic surgery and ensuring the highest quality training is accessible to all practitioners.\"\nHowever, some fear that after years of inaction, little will change.\nDr Wong said: \"If theses findings aren't enough for the government to finally make a move, I really don't know what it will take for them to take this seriously.\"\nThe devolved government in Scotland has carried out a public consultation on the regulation of non-surgical cosmetic procedures and says it expects to announce its next steps \"in the near future\".\nNorthern Ireland's Department of Health said in a statement it would consider the report and respond in due course, while the Welsh government said it will be doing further work in this \"important area\"."

      "text": "Liverpool has been stripped of its World Heritage status after a UN committee found developments threatened the value of the city's waterfront.\nThe decision was made following a secret ballot by the Unesco committee at a meeting in China.\nUnesco had said that the developments, including the planned new Everton FC stadium, had resulted in a \"serious deterioration\" of the historic site. \nThe decision was described as \"incomprehensible\" by the city's mayor. \n\"Our World Heritage site has never been in better condition having benefitted from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment across dozens of listed buildings and the public realm,\" Joanne Anderson said.\nShe said she would work with the government to examine whether the city could appeal against the decision, which comes \"a decade after Unesco last visited the city to see it with their own eyes\".\nLiverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was \"a retrograde step that does not reflect the reality of what is happening on the ground\".\n\"Places like Liverpool should not be faced with the binary choice between maintaining heritage status or regenerating left-behind communities and the wealth of jobs and opportunities that come with it,\" he said.\nLabour's Kim Johnson, MP for Liverpool Riverside, said she remained \"proud of my city and what we've done\".\n\"People come here because it's amazing city and, while I'm disappointed, as a city we are resilient and we will always fight back.\"\nThe government said it was \"extremely disappointed\" and believes Liverpool still deserves its heritage status \"given the significant role the historic docks and the wider city have played throughout history\".\nLiverpool becomes only the third site to lose its World Heritage status since the list began in 1978, the other two being Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in 2007 and the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany in 2009.\nAnnouncing the decision, the committee chairman said 20 votes had been cast - with 13 in favour of deleting the city, five against the proposal and two ballot papers being invalid.\nLiverpool's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kemp said it was a \"day of shame\" for the city, adding that it would \"without a doubt, affect our tourism and inward investment\". \nThe city was awarded the much-coveted title in 2004 in recognition of its historical and architectural impact, joining places including the Taj Mahal, Egypt's Pyramids and Canterbury Cathedral.\nIt recognised its history as a major trading centre during the British Empire and its architectural landmarks.\nHowever, a report in June by the World Heritage Committee said developments on the city's waterfront had resulted in \"irreversible loss of attributes\". \nIt cited the Liverpool Waters project and Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock. \nChris Capes, director of development for Peel L&P's Liverpool Waters, said he was disappointed \"particularly given the considerable investment that the city has put into protecting and improving its heritage sites\".\nEverton have agreed to invest up to \u00a355m to \"preserve, restore and celebrate the heritage assets\" of the area as part of its stadium plan.\nThey project was approved following two public consultations, with the second survey attracting more than 40,000 people.\nThe club found 98% of people supported the proposed design of the stadium, while 96% backed the club's plans for historic features on the site. \nBy Claire Hamilton, BBC Radio Merseyside political reporter\nLiverpool has seen more peaks and troughs than most, and it's a city which has changed immeasurably since 2004 when the World Heritage Status was conferred.\nBack then, there was no Liverpool One shopping centre, no hint that Everton would consider building a multi-million pound waterfront stadium and its year as European Capital of Culture hadn't happened. The city has changed.\nToday, there's a sense of defiance in some quarters about Unesco's decision that the city doesn't need the title, especially if sits in the way of progress for an area which has lain neglected and semi derelict for decades.\nCritics argue the benefits of being a World Heritage status were never properly spelled out and there wasn't the political will in the city to address Unesco's concerns until recently, when it was too late.\nMany people argue that tourists visiting the Pier Head, St George's Plateau or Penny Lane are not coming because Liverpool is a designated World Heritage site - they probably don't even realise it is.\nThey're coming for the Beatles, the football, food and the history but that history will remain.\nYet today's announcement worries those who fear that the ability to protect heritage, architecture and history is now diminished, that there will be a free-for-all of unsuitable, careless development. \nThe argument for the last decade has been presented as a binary choice: heritage or progress? The feeling in Liverpool is, couldn't we have had both?\nDr David Jeffery, who is a lecturer of British politics at the University of Liverpool, said he believed the decision would not have a \"serious impact\" on the city's tourism industry. \n\"I do hope this serves as a warning to the council to stop approving ugly buildings though,\" he said.\nWayne Colquhoun, who has campaigned for 15 years to keep Liverpool's heritage status, said he was \"devastated\" by the news.\n\"It's the status symbol that has put us up there with the Great Wall of China and the pyramids and now it has gone,\" he said. \n\"You've got to be clever being a World Heritage city and be able to take traditional materials and build them in a modern manner.\"\nRichie Wright, 40, who has lived in Liverpool all his life, said the status had \"on many occasions, hampered and restricted development in a city that is ripe for development\".\n\"I hope that Liverpool and its wider city region now seizes this opportunity to make common sense decisions that make our city and the world proud,\" he said.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nurses and other NHS workers in England have been offered a 3% pay rise by government \"in recognition of unique impact of the pandemic\" on staff.\nIt comes after heavily criticised proposals made by the Department for Health and Social Care in March said only a rise of 1% was affordable.\nAll NHS staff in Wales will be offered a 3% rise by the Welsh government.\nBut some health unions opposed the new figure saying it does not reflect the sacrifices made by staff.\nThey point out the NHS workforce has been under unprecedented pressure.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, said the pay rise was disappointing and that junior doctors and some GPs could miss out on it altogether.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, of the BMA, said many doctors had not taken annual leave in the past year and now \"face a gruelling year ahead with millions of patients on waiting lists, and the country in the midst of another Covid-19 wave\".\nLabour's shadow health minister Justin Madders described the new pay rise as a \"U-turn\" and called on the government to \"make our NHS and key workers feel supported and valued after all they have done for us\".\nThe rise in pay for healthcare workers follows a public sector pay freeze for 2021-22, announced by the government in November, with exceptions made for those on salaries under \u00a324,000 and NHS staff.\nThe 3% pay rise is for most NHS staff including nurses, paramedics, consultants, dentists and salaried GPs and is backdated to April 2021. \nAccording to government calculations for the average nurse, this will mean an additional \u00a31,000 a year, while many porters and cleaners will receive around \u00a3540.\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"NHS staff are rightly receiving a pay rise this year despite the wider public sector pay pause, in recognition of their extraordinary efforts. \n\"We will back the NHS as we focus our efforts on getting through this pandemic and tackling the backlog of other health problems that has built up.\"\nNHS pay rises are negotiated by independent pay-review bodies that look at evidence from a range of groups before making recommendations to the government.\nThe pay rise does not include doctors and dentists in training who have their own separate, multi-year contracts. \nIt was a day of frustration for health unions and their members.  \nThere was a widespread expectation that the details would be revealed in a health minister's statement to the Commons at lunchtime.  \nBut MPs were told the government was still considering pay review body recommendations. \nThen the announcement came at 18:00 BST, suggesting a frantic afternoon finalising the deal with the prime minister, chancellor, and health secretary all self-isolating.  \nUnion reaction has been varied with one group acknowledging ministers had made a significant step up from the original 1% offer. \nOthers though said the 3% on the table was insufficient recognition of the huge effort of NHS staff during the pandemic.\nThe details will be put to union members in the next few weeks and it will be hard to predict the response at a time when pressure on the health service is intensifying because of another Covid surge.\nMembers of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) gathered in Westminster ahead of the announcement with placards and banners demanding a 12.5% pay increase.\nOne of those demonstrating, Kafeelat Adekunle, 55, a community matron with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London, described the pay rise as \"mad\".\n\"I'm not happy,\" she told the PA news agency. \"They're not listening, that's the whole problem. This is just to try and stop us from doing industrial action, just to keep us quiet, keep us shushed.\"\nAmy Fancourt, an A&E nurse and RCN member, told the BBC: \"Morale is extremely low, there's a lot of people leaving the NHS and there's a lot of people leaving the health sector more widely.\n\"And I think that is a direct consequence of years of being undervalued, on top of the extra pressure we faced during the pandemic.\"\nUnison general secretary Christina McAnea said the increase, though an improvement on the initial offer, fell short of what NHS staff deserved. \n\"The government has failed to show staff just how valued they are to us all,\" she said, warning some staff may now leave the health service.\nUnite national officer for health, Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe, described the 3% offer as \"small step forward on the insulting 1% the government offered in March\".\n\"However, this recommendation in no way recognises the 19% drop in real earnings that many NHS workers have endured in the last decade, nor the immense sacrifices that health staff have and are continuing to make as Covid infection rates rapidly rise again.\"\nRCN chief executive Pat Cullen said the announcement was \"light on detail\" and that nursing staff would \"remain dignified in responding to what will be a bitter blow to many\".\n\"But the profession will not take this lying down,\" she warned.\nMike Henley, a member of the consultants committee, British Medical Association, told the BBC: \"We're disappointed. We wanted more than 5% to make up for our one-third pay loss since 2008, so 3% is a long way below that.\"\nIn making the final decisions on pay the government will have factored in the impact of the pandemic on both the economy and the NHS.\nCurrently almost half the NHS's budget goes on staffing costs - a total of \u00a356.1bn.\nIn theory, the pay-review bodies make recommendations for NHS staff across the UK - but it is up to the individual UK nations to decide whether to accept them.\nIn Wales, Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the 3% rise \"recognises the dedication and commitment of hardworking NHS staff\".\nIn Scotland, most NHS staff have already been offered a 4% pay rise (backdated to December 2020). This follows a one-off Covid payment for health and social care staff of \u00a3500."

      "text": "Twelve people have died after record-breaking rainfall flooded underground railway tunnels in China, leaving passengers trapped in rising waters.\nVideo shared on social media shows evening commuters just managing to keep their heads above water. Water is seen rushing onto platforms.\nMore than 500 people were eventually rescued from the tunnels in Henan province, officials said.\nDays of rain have caused widespread damage and led to 200,000 evacuations.\nAbove ground, roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris swept along in fast moving currents. A number of pedestrians have had to be rescued.\nIn total, 25 people have died in Henan province and more than a dozen cities are affected. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that there had been \"significant loss of life and damage to property\". \nSeveral dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and trains in many parts of Henan have also been suspended.\nIn the provincial capital  Zhengzhou, the equivalent of a year's average rainfall has fallen in just three days. \nOn Tuesday, some of the city's flood defences were overwhelmed and water began flowing down into the railway tunnels.\nSurvivors have described how water leaked through the doors, rising slowly from \"our ankles to our knees to our necks\". \"All of us who could, stood on the subway seats,\" one woman wrote on Chinese social network site Weibo. \nChildren were lifted out of the water by their parents, while others threw off anything which might hold them down.\nAfter about half an hour, one passenger said it became \"hard to breathe\".\nAn order to shut down the line came at 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) so the evacuation could begin, Zhengzhou government officials said in a statement. Five people are being treated for injuries, with 12 having died.\nElsewhere in the central Chinese city, children had to be rescued from a flooded nursery school.\nState media aired footage of them being floated out in plastic tubs by rescuers.\nThe First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou Hospital also briefly lost power on Tuesday night, though this has now been restored, said a statement on Weibo by the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee. \nIt added that 600 critically ill patients had been transferred to another location. \nAnother resident, identified as Mr Liu, 27, told BBC Chinese he had had \"no water, no electricity, and no internet\".\n\"Never in my life had I seen so much rain,\" Mr Liu added. \"There was one hour where the rain was just pouring down on us from the heavens, and everything went completely white.\"\nBut the rising waters were not just confined to Zhengzhou. \nA 20-metre (65ft) breach has emerged in the dam in Luoyang city after it was damaged by storms, officials said. Soldiers have been deployed to the area and a statement from the army warned it could \"collapse at any time\".\nAnother user said that residents in Sishui town were stuck on rooftops. \"We don't know how to swim\u2026 the whole village is about to be washed away,\" the person wrote.\nHenan has experienced \"rare and severe rainfall\" since Saturday, China's meteorological authority said on Wednesday.\nZhengzhou saw 624mm of rainfall on Tuesday, with a third of that amount falling between 16:00 and 17:00 alone, which \"smashed historical records\".\nIt forecasted that parts of the region would continue to see \"severe or extremely severe storms\" and that the heavy rain was likely to end only on Thursday.\nMany factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.\nPart of the Yellow River basin in China, Henan has several major river systems running through the province which are prone to flooding. \nZhengzhou, which has a population of 12 million, sits on the banks of the Yellow River itself.\nScientists have warned that widespread dam construction has exacerbated climate change problems in China's flood zone, says the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell.\nConnections between rivers and lakes have been cut and disrupted flood plains which once absorbed much of the region's annual summer downpours."

They are tired.\"\nShe described the \"heroic\" workforce as the health service's \"greatest asset\", but the \"greatest vulnerability\" at the same time.\n\"Let's make no bones about it, before Covid our workforce was fragile in regards to our vacancies and our ability to recruit and retain in the north east\", Prof Hiscox said. \n\"During wave one and wave two we had an additional 1,000 staff came to work with us, which was tremendous. The rest of the country is remobilising, so these people have gone back to do what they need to do.\n\"On top of the underlying vacancies, this is the school holidays - I feel very strongly that our health and care staff need to have their annual leave like everyone else. It's critically important they get some recuperation time. On top of that, we have the additional loss of those who are isolating.\""

      "text": "Australia's government has lashed out after a United Nations report claimed it had not done enough to protect the Great Barrier Reef from climate change.\nUN body Unesco said the reef should be put on a list of World Heritage Sites that are \"in danger\" due to the damage it has suffered.\nKey targets on improving water quality had not been met, it said.\nEnvironment minister Sussan Ley said UN experts had reneged on past assurances.\nShe confirmed that Australia planned to challenge the listing, which would take place at a meeting next month, saying: \"Clearly there were politics behind it; clearly those politics have subverted a proper process.\"\nThe World Heritage Committee is a 21-nation group chaired by China, which has had a vexed diplomatic relationship with Canberra in recent years.\n\"Climate change is the single biggest threat to all of the world's reef ecosystems... and there are 83 natural World Heritage properties facing climate change threats so it's not fair to simply single out Australia,\" said Ms Ley.\nEnvironmental groups say the UN's decision highlights Australia's weak climate action, however.\n\"The recommendation from Unesco is clear and unequivocal that the Australian government is not doing enough to protect our greatest natural asset, especially on climate change,\" said Richard Leck, Head of Oceans for the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia.\nThe latest row is part of an ongoing dispute between Unesco and Australia over the status of the iconic site.\nThe reef, stretching for 2,300km (1,400 miles) off Australia's north-east coast, gained World Heritage ranking in 1981 for its \"enormous scientific and intrinsic importance\".\nAfter Unesco first debated its \"in danger\" status in 2017, Canberra committed more than A$3 billion (\u00a31.bn; $2.2bn) to improving the reef's health.\nHowever, several bleaching events on the reef in the past five years have caused widespread loss of coral.\nScientists say the main reason is rising sea temperatures as a result of global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels.\nIn 2019, Australia's own reef authority downgraded the reef's condition from poor to very poor in its five-year update.\nBut Australia remains reluctant to commit to stronger climate action, such as by signing up to a net zero emissions target by 2050.\nThe country, a large exporter of coal and gas, has not updated its climate goals since 2015. Its current emissions reduction target is 26-28% of 2005 levels by 2030.\nThese have been a tough few months for Australia and its climate change policy.\nInternational pressure has been mounting on Scott Morrison's government to pledge net zero emissions by 2050 and the prime minister has time and time again refused to commit - including as recently as last week at the G7 meeting in the UK. \nIn his address to US President Joe Biden's virtual climate conference with global leaders in April, the prime minister said the country will \"get there as soon as we possibly can,\" adding that \"for Australia, it is not a question of if, or even by when, for net-zero but, importantly, how\".\nThat in itself is at the heart of the problem. The \"when\" is as crucial as the \"how\" when it comes to climate change. \nScientists and global leaders say Australia is not doing enough or going fast enough.\nThe Great Barrier Reef row between Unesco and the Australian government is not new, but it will be quite embarrassing if the country's World Heritage Site is downgraded to the \"in danger\" list. \nIt's another reminder that if Australia does not get serious about tackling climate change with clear and decisive measures, this will affect its standing in the world, not just diplomatically and economically but culturally too.  \nIf the reef is downgraded, it will be the first time a natural World Heritage Site has been placed on the \"in danger\" list primarily due to impacts of climate change.\nListing a site as \"in danger\" can help address threats by, for example, unlocking access to funds or publicity.\nBut the recommendation could affect a major tourism destination that creates thousands of jobs in Australia and was worth A$6.4bn prior to the pandemic."

      "tags": "France,Home Office,English Channel,Europe migrant crisis,Migration",
      "text": "Home Secretary Priti Patel has defended a new \u00a354.2m deal with France to stem the rising number of migrants crossing the English Channel.\nThe number of people crossing the Channel this year is now more than the total for all of 2020. \nShe denied it was \"sending good money after bad\" after a \u00a328.2m deal last November failed to limit crossings.\nCalais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont suggested it would not have an impact as the French coastline is too long to patrol.\nGiving evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, Ms Patel said it was an \"evolving situation\", with the numbers of those attempting the crossing having \"increased considerably\". \nOn Monday at least 430 migrants crossed the Channel - a record for one day. The previous daily high of 416 was set in September last year.  \nAnd on Wednesday, a group of migrants was seen arriving at Dover, bringing the total number this year to more than the 8,461 who made the crossing in 2020. \nThe group included at least five children, according to reports.\nThe deal agreed on Tuesday between London and Paris will see France double the number of police patrolling its beaches. It will also fund improved intelligence sharing and introduce better technology to target the gangs who organise the crossings.\nBut some have questioned whether it will have an impact.\nBy BBC home editor Mark Easton, in Kent\nThe terrace of the Stade hotel, on the seafront in Hythe, is festooned by England flags. But its usual summer guests have been told their holidays there are cancelled. The hotel's owner says it has been block booked for 68 days by the Home Office - at an irresistible price to him of \u00a35,000 a day.\nThe occupants are young men who tell us - from their balconies - that they are 16 or 17 and from Iran. One has been there 11 days and they aren't allowed to leave their rooms. \nBetween 15 and 20 unaccompanied migrant children are currently accommodated in a government office building, Frontier House in Folkestone, in sleeping bags on camp beds and reportedly without proper washing facilities or medical support.  One agency has warned that the children's welfare is deteriorating.\nThe BBC has obtained photographs of conditions in one holding centre that show young boys sleeping on the floor with cushions for pillows and military-style camp-beds, trying to get some rest in what looks like an office waiting room.\nKent County Council has for a second year said it is unable to care for any more unaccompanied child asylum seekers. It is currently looking after 358 of them. \nConservative MP Tim Loughton said \"giving the French more money to carry on doing what they're doing badly is not going to solve the problem.\" \nThe home secretary said there had been a \"complete change in modus operandi in terms of the crossings\", with a \"widespread dispersal\" of launches of small boats \"along the whole French coastline\" rather than people just coming from Calais. \nShe said France had intercepted more boats than they did this time last year, because the numbers are \"so high\" and are \"going up.\"\nAnd she stressed that France would \"argue they are doing their bit\" but said they have a \"different interpretation\" of how to save lives at sea. \nBorder Force director general Paul Lincoln said last year France had made more than 2,100 interceptions of boats last year, while this year the figure was now over 6,000. \nCalais MP Mr Dumont has suggested the new deal would not have an impact as the French coastline is too big.\nHe told the Today programme: \"The fact is, we've seen it before. Having more money, having more police officers, having more controls, will not prevent people to succeed in these crossing attempts.\n\"We have too many kilometres of shore to monitor.\" \nMr Dumont added that the French are not supposed to intervene at sea - yet former Border Force chief Tony Smith has called for joint patrols. \nMr Smith said: \"That seems to be a step too far for the French at the moment. The French position is they are not prepared to intervene on the high seas, only on land.\"\nMs Patel and French interior minister Gerald Darmanin have agreed to \"strengthen co-operation\" over the crossings.\nShe told the Home Affairs Committee she had discussed with the French their obligations are under international law to return migrants trying to cross the Channel to their territory. She added they were looking at everything that could be done to save lives at sea, saying of the French: \"They absolutely know what their responsibilities are.\" \nThe Home Office said UK support last year helped France double the number of officers deployed daily on the beaches of its northern coast.  \nThe new support announced by the UK would enable France \"to respond by posting more security forces further up the coast, installing and utilising the latest surveillance equipment throughout northern France\", the Home Office said.\nAnalysis by Simon Jones, BBC reporter, in Dover\nFrom the famous White Cliffs of Dover, we watched this morning as another group of migrants was brought to shore by the Border Force, having been picked up in the Channel. \nConditions at sea are once again incredibly calm and the sun is shining, so these are unlikely to be the only arrivals today. \nAlmost 1,000 people have reached the UK by boat in the past three days, putting pressure on the home secretary to act. \nPriti Patel is now pledging more money to the French authorities to try to prevent the crossings. But the deal struck last night is very similar to one agreed between Britain and France last November - which has failed to stem the numbers arriving, though the Home Office points out the number of crossings being prevented by the French authorities has doubled.\nThe government here accepts there is no quick and easy fix to problems with the asylum system, but there's no doubt the home secretary will want to see swift results in return for the increased investment in northern France.\nMs Patel has previously pledged to make Channel crossings \"unviable\", with new legislation that will make it a crime to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission.\nThe Nationality and Borders Bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, will mean migrants entering without permission could face up to four years in prison.\nThe government hopes the overhaul of asylum rules will deter migrants from making the crossing. \nBut the plans have been criticised by charities including Refugee Action, which has called them \"extreme and nasty\". \nAmnesty International's Steve Valdez-Symonds told the BBC the new legislation was an \"extremely reckless and dangerous response\" to the issue and would not tackle the problem of people smugglers.  \nLabour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Home Office announcement was \"yet more empty words from the Conservatives about agreeing a deal with France to address trafficking gangs\". \nNumber 10 said the government was \"doing two things in parallel\" to tackle migrant crossings.

      "tags": "Sexual violence,Criminal justice system",
      "text": "Specialist courts in Scotland should be set up to deal with the most serious sex crimes, a review has recommended. \nOne suggestion is for cases to be heard by a single judge with no jury.\nThe review, led by Lord Justice Clerk Lady Dorrian, is part of a shake-up of how Scottish courts deal with rape and other sexual offences cases.\nOther proposals include the presumed use of pre-recorded evidence and sentencing powers of up to 10 years imprisonment.\nRape Crisis Scotland, Scottish Women's Aid, Victim Support Scotland and the Crown Office were all involved with the review.\nAmong the panel's other ideas are for juries to be given \"plain language directions\" with a pilot programme looking at how jurors can be told about rape myths and stereotypes.\nThe right for the complainer not to be identified should also be expressly set out in legislation rather than relying on the current convention, the group recommended. \nLady Dorrian told BBC Scotland she hoped the proposals would improve the way cases are handled for complainers, the accused and witnesses.\nShe said: \"We decided that we really needed to start from the ground up. If we started afresh what would the court to deal with these cases look like?\n\"We have made recommendations which we believe will fundamentally change and improve the way sexual offences are prosecuted in Scotland.\"\nLady Dorrian said increasing conviction rates in sex crime cases \"was not a driving force\" behind the group's recommendations. \nAt the proposed specialist court, cases would be presided over by a combination of High Court judges and sheriffs who had received trauma-informed training in the presentation of evidence of vulnerable witnesses.\nSimilar training for prosecutors and defence agents would include accredited courses in dealing with vulnerable witnesses and the use of examination techniques.\nThe dedicated court would have sentencing powers of up to 10 years' imprisonment with a provision for remit to the High Court for longer sentences if required.\nThe group also put forward proposals for evidence from complainers in serious sexual offence cases to be recorded by specially trained police officers as early as possible after an alleged incident. \nSandy Brindley, chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, said: \"All too often survivors tell us that the process of seeking justice - and in particular their experience in court - is as least as traumatic as the attack itself. \n\"It is clear that significant action is needed.\n\"The recommendations are bold, evidence based, and have the potential to transform Scotland's response to sexual crime.\"\nCrown Agent David Harvie said: \"The introduction of a specialist sexual offences court would be an important step towards meaningful improvement in the delivery of justice in Scotland, for complainers, for accused, for society as a whole and is one that I fully support.\"\nHowever, Solicitor Advocate John Scott QC warned against a move away from jury trials in a bid to allay fears over rape myths and stereotypes.\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We can and should improve the process.\n\"But if we change our system with a specific aim of increasing the conviction rate, then I think we skew it in a way that is very unsafe and worrying.\n\"We don't have an evidence base that justifies abandoning juries, which allows the unconscious bias we all have to be evened out between 15 people.\" \nThe recommendations will now be considered by the Lord Justice General, Lord Carloway and the next Scottish government formed after May's election.

      "text": "Temperatures reached some of the highest this year on the sixth day of the heatwave, with forecasters expecting even hotter weather to come.\nThe Met Office, whose extreme heat weather warning covers large parts of Wales, said temperatures hit 30C in south Wales on Wednesday.\nIt comes as millions of holidaymakers are set to hit the roads after swapping foreign holidays for staycations. \nTuesday was the UK's hottest day so far with temperatures hitting 32.2C (90C).\nLondon's Heathrow Airport was the hottest place in the country - beating Sunday's 31.6C (88F) best - while in Wales the mercury has peaked at 30.9C (88F) in Usk on Tuesday and Cardiff on Monday.\nEmergency services are under pressure due to the heat with the Welsh Ambulance Service declaring an \"incident\" due to \"extreme pressure\" on Monday evening with demand overtaking capacity as they are dealing with 2,000 999 calls per day.\nAn extra 160 spaces are being made available at Pontypridd's National Lido of Wales, Lido Ponty, for Friday's sessions.\nMore than 5,000 spaces were not enough for those seeking to cool off in the water, with demand for spaces being extremely high all season.\nAs some cooled off, others reached boiling point, as volunteer coastguards at West Shore, Llandudno, reported being verbally abused by people as they were trying to rescue them from the incoming tide.\u00a0\nThe Llandudno coastguard posted on Facebook: \"Most people were unaware the danger they were in and were happy to take our advice, however we also received some abuse from a small number of people. \u00a0\n\"We don't do it for fun, we are there to keep you safe.\"\nWelsh Water urged customers to use water \"sensibly\" after a billion litres of water was used in one day instead of the usual 800 million litres.\nThe not-for-profit company said water demand had increased in tourist hotspots - such as Pembrokeshire - by up to 20%.\nChief executive Peter Perry said: \"We just ask people to use water sensibly.\n\"We've been planning for some time because we knew there was going to be a big staycation influx into Wales this year.\"\nOne top doctor has warned that most hospitals across Wales are \"under extreme strain\" and were at capacity most of the time.\n\"We see in the hot weather a lot of conditions deteriorate, certainly respiratory conditions, and heart conditions, they are the two most that we see presenting,\" Dr Mark Poulden, Morriston Hospital's clinical director of emergency medicine told BBC Radio Wales.\nDoctors have also advised parents to encourage children to play in the shade as much as possible, wear hats and long sleeves, and apply regular applications of sun cream to the skin.\nBut Saturday and Sunday will see a change with a yellow weather warning in place for much of Wales with \"heavy, thundery showers likely\".\nIt comes as the RAC has warned Wednesday could be be the busiest day on the UK roads with 2.6 million leisure trips, followed by 2.3 million on Friday.\nTraffic data expert Inrix has warned delays on the roads could be up to a third longer than normal July traffic as people holiday in the UK due to foreign holiday travel restrictions during the pandemic.\nWales is also expected to be one of the UK's most popular destinations with an RAC survey suggesting 11% of people heading to Welsh destinations - with the West Country and Scotland ahead of Wales as the most popular places to go.\nAlthough temperatures did not set records on Wednesday - the highest temperature ever recorded in Wales was 35.2C at Hawarden Bridge in Flintshire on 2 August 1990 - the Met Office said Thursday could be hotter again.\nForecasters had predicted temperatures of 30C (86F) across southern and western England and 25C (77F) in Belfast.\nThe Met Office's extreme amber heat warning remains in place for much of Wales, central and southern England and Northern Ireland until Thursday, although scattered thunderstorms and flood warnings are in place in parts of eastern England.\nThe Environment Agency has some flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - in place throughout parts of London, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.\nWe're into heatwave conditions for most of Wales. The Met Office's new warning for extreme heat means we need to be wary of impacts such as heatstroke and sunburn as well as the effect on infrastructure and public transport. \nA ridge of high pressure has been building over the UK over the past days, which is why it's been getting increasingly warmer.\nOn Wednesday we'll see a mild start with a little morning mist and patchy cloud but that will soon burn away leading to temperatures in the high 20s and low 30s.\nThursday and Friday will continue sunny and dry too, with just some patchy high cloud possible - and very warm again.\nBut could it all be over by the weekend? It does look like we could see the hot spell breaking down, with thundery showers pushing up from the south west on Friday.\nWatch this space - that beer garden booked for the weekend may need a rethink.\n* Source: The Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Saturday and Sunday but this time for rain, covering 19 of the 22 local authority areas in Wales.\nConwy, Denbighshire and the Isle of Anglesey are the only areas not included.\nHeavy, thundery showers are likely, particularly on Sunday when these could be widespread and locally torrential, according to the Met Office.\nLightning and hail are also expected and there could be rainfall of up to 100mm (4in) in some areas, with a chance of flooding.\nTraffic data analysts said the worst days for traffic could be Wednesday and Friday, with typical congestion pinch points being up to a third busier than normal.\nInrix said roads to watch for jams included parts of the M25 around London, the A303 in Wiltshire, the M1 in the East Midlands and the M4 around the Brynglas Tunnels at Newport.\nExperts also said to look out for hotspots including the M5 through Somerset and Devon and roads leading to other places such as the Lake District and the south coast.\nThe RAC predicted an \"unprecedented summer\" on the UK roads, saying more than 29 million staycations were planned, 16 million of these in the school holidays alone.\n\"We seem to have all the elements of a perfect storm on the UK's roads this summer,\" RAC spokesman Simon Williams said.\n\"With millions of drivers having already planned their staycation trips, plus the very real prospect of huge numbers more booking last minute if their foreign travel plans end in tatters because of Covid travel restrictions.\n\"After the hot weather last weekend, the scene is really set for an incredibly busy few weeks on the country's roads, whether that's on motorways or on smaller, minor routes that take people to popular tourist destinations by the coast or in the countryside.\"\nThe heat has led to reports of melting tar on the roads, including on the A478 between Kilgetty and Narberth in Pembrokeshire.\nCommuters and passengers have been warned of possible delays on the trains due to reduced speeds on some services because the hot weather can cause tracks to warp and buckle.\n\"There are some train speeds that have to be reduced just to make sure we're travelling safely in case there are buckles on the infrastructure, and that does have a knock-on effect on the timetable,\" said Transport for Wales safety and sustainability director Leyton Powell.\n\"That does mean that we do have some cancellations so we make sure [the trains are] safe to continue.\"\nIn terms of passenger comfort, Transport for Wales said they were ensuring air conditioning systems were working, asking people to open windows where possible and providing water and fluids as well as asking people to come prepared.\n\"What we will ask people....is to plan that journey,\" added Mr Powell.\n\"Not just to where you're going but that essential travel back home - don't wait like everyone else until those last journeys where it is likely to be more crowded.\"\nFor Sian Richardson, founder of the Bluetits Chill open water swimming group, the heatwave makes her usual swim in St David's in Pembrokeshire seem like it is happening in the Mediterranean.\n\"It's around 17 degrees at the moment. It's just incredible for us because it can go down to 6C in the winter and we swim all the year round,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We love the winter, we love the cold water but it's much more about quick dips, screaming and getting in, getting out, wrapping up, drinking coffee.\n\"This is all calmer. It's about really wanting to get in because the water is so delightful. Particularly at the moment because it's so hot we're all rushing to get in, then we're lounging about on the beach, drinking coffee and saying isn't it amazing?\n\"It's so hot here that it is cooling off, and we're all saying, gosh it's like the Mediterranean it's got that lovely holiday feel to it when you go on holiday and the sea is flat.\""

      "text": "Industry bodies have reacted with dismay at the government's plan for firms to apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules.\nThe government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be \"considered on a case-by-case basis\".\nKaren Dee, chief executive of the airport operators association, said the scheme was \"simply unworkable\".\nThe food supply industry called for clarity on how the scheme would work.\nThe new policy comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that fully-vaccinated people in critical roles in England would be able to continue working even if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid. The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms.\nIndividual businesses will have to contact their relevant government department to apply for any exemption.\nThose deemed eligible, which includes NHS and care staff, will be able to take daily tests instead.\nDowning Street said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors.\nThe number of exceptions outside of the NHS is expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands.\nThere are ongoing discussions with companies in critical industries.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"A number of those exemptions are in process of being granted or have been granted.\"\n'Pingdemic'\nFirms have warned of increasing staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app. Iceland and Greene King said on Monday they had had to shut shops and pubs as a result.\nBusiness lobby group the CBI has warned that the problem could hamper the economic recovery.\nRod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the plan felt like it had been \"thought up on the hoof without proper organisation or thought\".\n\"Truckers were classed as essential workers at the start of the pandemic; now they may be or may not be,\" he said.\n\"It's too confusing. The criteria isn't clear and it risks being both unfair and devastating to an already creaking supply chain.\"\nMs Dee, of the airport operators association, said the government \"must reconsider and exempt categories of workers\", such as airport security staff  and air traffic controllers from the requirement to self-isolate.\n\"As 24-hour operations, we need clear rules that are workable and easy to implement or there is a risk of unnecessary temporary closures,\" she said.\n\"Applying for each individual for an exemption from self-quarantine if they are 'pinged' is simply unworkable.\"\nShane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said: \"What is the application process for businesses to use this? Who will qualify? Do you have to prove you are severely affected? How long will it take? \n\"If it's not simple and quick, it will not help and most businesses will have to ignore it.  \nHe said the number of people absent in the food sector due to isolation requests was \"growing exponentially across the food supply chain\".\nAndrew Selley is the chief executive of food wholesaler Bidfood, which has about 5,000 employees across the UK and 24 depots.\nHe said the number of staff who were self-isolating changed on a day-to-day basis, but added the company had \"well over 100 people\" off at the moment.\nThe firm, which has large contracts with schools, hospitals and prisons, recently had half a shift off at one depot due to staff being told to isolate.\nMr Selley said it was a \"little ridiculous\" to expect individual companies to seek exemptions for staff who had been told to self-isolate.\nHe added entire sectors, such as food supply, should be exempted and the government's scheme should work in the \"same way it did for key workers\" at the beginning of the pandemic.\nThe government has said it is \"crucial\" for people to quarantine after being \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid-19 app.\nIts message comes after business minister Paul Scully said it was a decision for individuals and employers whether they should isolate after a \"ping\" from the app.\nThe Times reported that another minister in the business department, Lord Grimstone of Boscobel, stressed in a letter to one large employer that the app was only an \"advisory tool\" and that people were not under any \"legal duty\".\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said \"business-critical areas\" would be able to apply to be exempt from isolating.\n\"It's not a blanket exemption and my understanding is we're not going to be producing a list covering individual sectors,\" he said.\n\"It's important that anyone who feels they're in a critical industry or wants to raise potential issues because of isolation are able to contact departments and get advice and where necessary get exemptions.\"\nAsked specifically about supermarket workers, the spokesman said: \"We're not seeking to draw lines specifically around who or who is not exempt. \n\"What's important is to make sure critical services are able to function and get that balance right between requiring people to isolate... but also making sure critical services can function.\""

We need a proper renegotiation,\" he said.\nHe criticised the EU and said Brussels had \"failed to recognise the concerns of unionists\". \nThe government has issued a 28 page command paper to accompany today's ministerial statements.\nBut it boils down to one simple sentiment: \"Trust us.\"\nThey are telling the EU that it's single market can be protected without the panoply of checks and controls which currently apply to goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nThey are suggesting this can largely be achieved through a light-touch, trusted trader scheme and new legislation to discourage smuggling.\nBrexit veterans will recognise these as the sort of \"alternative arrangements\" suggested earlier in this process.\nThe EU was not persuaded then and with trust in short supply it will be a struggle to persuade them now.\nThe Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said he hoped Wednesday's statement would lead to \"movement in the direction of finding pragmatic, workable solutions\".\n\"I hope that the European Union will take their time in considering these proposals in good faith and will not reject them out of hand,\" he added.\nThe UUP leader will travel to Dublin on Thursday to meet the Taoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin to make that case to him directly. \nStormont's other main parties - Sinn F\u00e9in, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance - have said they recognise concerns about the protocol but that must be fully implemented in the absence of another arrangement.\nSinn F\u00e9in chairman Declan Kearney said the British government had agreed and ratified all elements of the protocol with the European Commission. \n\"It should now stop the evasion, and get on with it's implementation,\" he said. \n\"It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation.\"\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the government's statement on Wednesday as a \"shameless position based on political expedience rather than providing the stability that people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland need\".\nHe said he believed a resolution was still possible but would require the government to \"step back from its bad faith interventions\". \nAlliance's deputy leader Stephen Farry also said the government was attempting to \"rewrite history\" and that their actions had undermined trust with the EU in finding sustainable solutions.\nHis party has supported suggestions from the EU for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a way to reduce most checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nThat would require the UK to follow all EU agri-food rules.\nThe UK said it is unwilling to cede control to the EU on this issue and is instead pushing for an equivalence arrangement in which the EU would recognise UK food production standards as being equivalent to its own.\nSimon Hoare, chairman of Westminster's Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, described the UK's new proposals for the protocol as an \"interesting approach\".\n\"If there is to be any chance of change, mutual and binding trust will be the key currency. I am fearful that this is in short supply and needs to be worked on energetically and now. \n\"Common sense and pragmatism must not be a dirty word for either side,\" Mr Hoare added.\nEarlier, Ireland's Europe minister, Thomas Byrne, said \"there can be no renegotiation of the [NI] protocol\".\nBut he added that the arrangement had its complications, and said Irish government is \"willing to discuss any creative solutions within the confines of the protocol\".\nAhead of the publication of the UK paper, the chairman of Marks & Spencer Archie Norman warned of the impact of full protocol checks on fresh foods when grace periods end this autumn.\n\"This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,\" he said.\nMr Norman called for a \"common sense\" solution to post-Brexit problems at his firm's stores on the island of Ireland.\nThe M&S said the level of checks and controls are \"very threatening\" to Marks and Spencer's Irish business.\nHe suggests the easiest solution would be to \"agree a time limited veterinary/food standards agreement\".\nSpeaking on Radio 4 on Wednesday morning, Mr Norman said the problems his company has faced exporting to the Republic of Ireland are likely to be replicated in Northern Ireland by the autumn.\n\"At the moment only about 80% of our product is getting into [the Republic of] Ireland - so 20% doesn't arrive at all,\" he said.\n\"It's not the rules of the Customs Union that is the problem, it's the Byzantine and pointless and honestly pettifogging enforcement which means that wagons can't get through.\"\nHe said trucks had been turned away on the basis of the wrong colour of typeface used on documents.\n\"We're employing 13 full-time vets who are not looking after animals or welfare, they're simply ticking boxes and filling out forms,\" he added.\n\"Sandwiches typically require about three vets' certificates to get through.\n\"Come October our experience in southern Ireland is probably, as it currently stands, set to be replicated in Northern Ireland.\""

A discovery by a four-year-old may point the way to how the extinct reptiles kept their feet on the ground.\nYoung Lily from Barry, in the Vale of Glamorgan, found an impressive fossil footprint in January.\nIt was so good, the 200 million-year-old imprint is now on display at the National Museum Cardiff.\nLily's mother said they were \"thrilled\" the find was going on show.\nThe fossilised footprint was spotted at Bendricks Beach, near Barry.\nCurators said it was \"the best specimen ever found\" on a beach.\nThe track is a type of footprint called Evazoum, and belongs to an unknown herbivorous dinosaur from the Upper Triassic period of earth's history.\nThe museum's palaeontology curator Cindy Howells said the fossil was \"one of the best-preserved examples of its type from anywhere in the UK and will really aid palaeontologists to get a better idea about these early dinosaurs and how they walked\".\nLily's mother Sally said: \"We were thrilled to find out it really was a dinosaur footprint, and I am happy that it will be taken to the National Museum where we can be enjoyed and studied for generations.\"\nKarl-James Langford, from Archaeology Cymru, was asked for his advice on the find by Lily's family.\n\"As only the fifth person to see it live, I identified the dinosaur footprint, as of international importance, and the best to be discovered in the United Kingdom for 20 years or more,\" he said.\n\"This was very real. It was a much finer print than any I had ever seen, in all my years looking at the rocks on the beach with school parties and adults.\"\nChristina Byrne, Senior Environmental Assessment Officer for Natural Resources Wales said: \"The dinosaur footprint is a spectacular find and we were pleased to grant permission and work in partnership to ensure its careful removal, so that it can be preserved as a scientific and educational resource for future generations to enjoy.\""

      "text": "Liverpool has been stripped of its World Heritage status after a UN committee found developments threatened the value of the city's waterfront.\nThe decision was made following a secret ballot by the Unesco committee at a meeting in China.\nUnesco had said that the developments, including the planned new Everton FC stadium, had resulted in a \"serious deterioration\" of the historic site. \nThe decision was described as \"incomprehensible\" by the city's mayor. \n\"Our World Heritage site has never been in better condition having benefitted from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment across dozens of listed buildings and the public realm,\" Joanne Anderson said.\nShe said she would work with the government to examine whether the city could appeal against the decision, which comes \"a decade after Unesco last visited the city to see it with their own eyes\".\nLiverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was \"a retrograde step that does not reflect the reality of what is happening on the ground\".\n\"Places like Liverpool should not be faced with the binary choice between maintaining heritage status or regenerating left-behind communities and the wealth of jobs and opportunities that come with it,\" he said.\nLabour's Kim Johnson, MP for Liverpool Riverside, said she remained \"proud of my city and what we've done\".\n\"People come here because it's amazing city and, while I'm disappointed, as a city we are resilient and we will always fight back.\"\nThe government said it was \"extremely disappointed\" and believes Liverpool still deserves its heritage status \"given the significant role the historic docks and the wider city have played throughout history\".\nLiverpool becomes only the third site to lose its World Heritage status since the list began in 1978, the other two being Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in 2007 and the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany in 2009.\nAnnouncing the decision, the committee chairman said 20 votes had been cast - with 13 in favour of deleting the city, five against the proposal and two ballot papers being invalid.\nLiverpool's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kemp said it was a \"day of shame\" for the city, adding that it would \"without a doubt, affect our tourism and inward investment\". \nThe city was awarded the much-coveted title in 2004 in recognition of its historical and architectural impact, joining places including the Taj Mahal, Egypt's Pyramids and Canterbury Cathedral.\nIt recognised its history as a major trading centre during the British Empire and its architectural landmarks.\nHowever, a report in June by the World Heritage Committee said developments on the city's waterfront had resulted in \"irreversible loss of attributes\". \nIt cited the Liverpool Waters project and Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock. \nChris Capes, director of development for Peel L&P's Liverpool Waters, said he was disappointed \"particularly given the considerable investment that the city has put into protecting and improving its heritage sites\".\nEverton have agreed to invest up to \u00a355m to \"preserve, restore and celebrate the heritage assets\" of the area as part of its stadium plan.\nThey project was approved following two public consultations, with the second survey attracting more than 40,000 people.\nThe club found 98% of people supported the proposed design of the stadium, while 96% backed the club's plans for historic features on the site. \nBy Claire Hamilton, BBC Radio Merseyside political reporter\nLiverpool has seen more peaks and troughs than most, and it's a city which has changed immeasurably since 2004 when the World Heritage Status was conferred.\nBack then, there was no Liverpool One shopping centre, no hint that Everton would consider building a multi-million pound waterfront stadium and its year as European Capital of Culture hadn't happened. The city has changed.\nToday, there's a sense of defiance in some quarters about Unesco's decision that the city doesn't need the title, especially if sits in the way of progress for an area which has lain neglected and semi derelict for decades.\nCritics argue the benefits of being a World Heritage status were never properly spelled out and there wasn't the political will in the city to address Unesco's concerns until recently, when it was too late.\nMany people argue that tourists visiting the Pier Head, St George's Plateau or Penny Lane are not coming because Liverpool is a designated World Heritage site - they probably don't even realise it is.\nThey're coming for the Beatles, the football, food and the history but that history will remain.\nYet today's announcement worries those who fear that the ability to protect heritage, architecture and history is now diminished, that there will be a free-for-all of unsuitable, careless development. \nThe argument for the last decade has been presented as a binary choice: heritage or progress? The feeling in Liverpool is, couldn't we have had both?\nDr David Jeffery, who is a lecturer of British politics at the University of Liverpool, said he believed the decision would not have a \"serious impact\" on the city's tourism industry. \n\"I do hope this serves as a warning to the council to stop approving ugly buildings though,\" he said.\nWayne Colquhoun, who has campaigned for 15 years to keep Liverpool's heritage status, said he was \"devastated\" by the news.\n\"It's the status symbol that has put us up there with the Great Wall of China and the pyramids and now it has gone,\" he said. \n\"You've got to be clever being a World Heritage city and be able to take traditional materials and build them in a modern manner.\"\nRichie Wright, 40, who has lived in Liverpool all his life, said the status had \"on many occasions, hampered and restricted development in a city that is ripe for development\".\n\"I hope that Liverpool and its wider city region now seizes this opportunity to make common sense decisions that make our city and the world proud,\" he said.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "A neo-Nazi student who created two extremist groups and promoted a \"distorted and wicked cause\" has been jailed.\nAndrew Dymock, 24, from Bath, led the outlawed groups System Resistance Network (SRN) and Sonnenkrieg Division.\nA judge said Dymock was \"driven by an extremist mindset\" and had taken the path of \"total hatred and bigotry\".\nHe was convicted of 15 offences and jailed for seven years, with a further three years on extended licence. \nDymock's trial in June heard he used the SRN website and a Twitter account to state that Jewish people should be exterminated and encourage lone actor terror attacks.\nHe advocated for societal collapse and a race war, and called for gay people to be \"purged\" from society.\nJudge Mark Dennis QC, sitting at The Old Bailey, said he believed Dymock was dangerous and posed a \"significant risk of serious harm\" to the public.  \n\"It is clear you were a leader and not a follower,\" he said.\nHe added Dymock was an \"intelligent, well-read\" person but also \"wholly misguided\".\nThe court had heard Dymock wrote an online article stating a \"racial holy war is inevitable\" and that \"every stabbing, bombing, shooting further plays into our hands\".\nHe was expelled from SRN in late February 2018 and arrested in June of that year at Gatwick Airport, as he tried to board a flight to the US.\nIn his luggage police found extreme right-wing literature including Siege, an anthology of pro-Nazi essays written by James Mason, and Mein Kampf, along with clothing bearing neo-Nazi logos.\nJudge Dennis said: \"Despite all the advantages of a good education and family upbringing you chose, at the age of 20, to take the path of dreadful bigotry, intolerance and hatred towards other members of our society solely on the basis of their race, creed or sexual orientation.\n\"In setting up and running the website and Twitter account for your extremist cause, you were prepared to inflame such vile prejudices in others and to promote and encourage hatred and violence towards other human beings in furtherance of your distorted and wicked cause.\"\nThe former student had been supported throughout his trial by his parents, Stella and Dr David Dymock, a professor of dentistry at Bristol University, who he lived with.\nThe court heard they had written to the judge asking for leniency ahead of the sentencing.\nDefence lawyer Andrew Morris said they were \"extremely worried\" about the impact of jail on their son.\nDymock, who at the time was studying politics at Aberystwyth University in Wales, denied being behind the SRN accounts, claiming he was set up by an ex-girlfriend, who had failed to recruit him to join banned terrorist group National Action (NA).\nHe denied being a neo-Nazi and told police: \"In fact, I am bisexual but lean towards being homosexual, in direct conflict with Nazism.\"\nHe was found guilty of five charges of encouraging terrorism, two of fundraising for terrorism, four counts of disseminating terrorist publications, possessing a terrorist document, stirring up racial hatred and hatred based on sexual orientation, and possessing racially inflammatory material.\nDet Chf Supt Martin Snowden, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, which led the investigation into Dymock, said: \"Dymock represented a threat to our society, not simply because of his mindset but because of the considerable efforts he exerted spreading his ideology and misusing his abilities.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The poles are set deep into concrete, but were bent at right angles to their normal position.\n\"We don't know if he was thrown out of the car or managed to crawl out.\n\"The drivers of other cars then saw him crawling across the road towards the centre like a crocodile, and stopped to raise the alarm.\n\"The first collision left his car facing the opposite direction to the flow of the traffic, so he may have thought he was crawling to safety.\"\nThe court heard a lorry driver, who was not called to give evidence, saw the hazard lights of other cars that had stopped and changed lanes to avoid them.\nBut the darkness meant he did not see Mr Murray in the path of his vehicle until it was too late.\nConsultant pathologist Mark Atkinson told the hearing: \"His injuries were so massive in the second collision that it's difficult to know what happened.\n\"But if he wasn't wearing a seat belt, it's inevitable that he would have sustained severe impact in the first collision, to the point where he was only just surviving, rather than making decisions.\"\nActing senior coroner Kate Sutherland said: \"Ciaran Michael Murray had some bad news that day about the health of a family member and had gone out in the car to clear his head.\n\"But there is no clear evidence that he intended to kill himself.\"\nMr Murray's family previously described him as generous, loving, kind and sensitive."

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "Children aged 12 to 15 are to be offered a second dose of the Covid vaccine.\nIt's in response to concerns about the newly identified Omicron variant.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises the UK governments on vaccines - has said that 12 to 15-year-olds should be offered a second jab - to be given at least 12 weeks after the first.\nIt's one of of a number of measures the JCVI say should be carried out, in case the Omicron variant spreads more easily or is more severe than current types of Covid.\nChildren aged 16 and 17 are already being offered a second dose.\nEngland and Scotland have already said they will act on the JCVI's advice, and it is likely to be accepted in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nNo. When vaccination for 12-15s was first rolled out, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said it would be as an \"offer\".\nHe said young people and their parents needed to be supported, and there should be no stigma attached to their choice.\nHealthy children aged 12 to 17 are advised to wait 12 weeks after testing positive for coronavirus before having their Covid jab.\nA four-week gap applies to children who are deemed at higher risk because of underlying health conditions, or because they live with vulnerable adults.\nAlthough parental consent is being sought, children under 16 who can prove they understand the risks and benefits can ask for the vaccine - or refuse it - if they disagree with their parents.\nThis important legal test of whether a child can consent to treatment is known as \"Gillick competence\". It is named after a famous dispute in which a teenager wanted contraceptive advice without her mother's consent.\nIn practice, it would be extremely unusual for a child under 13 to be judged Gillick-competent.\nTeenagers aged 16 and 17 don't need parental permission, unless there are exceptional circumstances. \nUnder-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine has also been authorised for use in children in the UK.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for under-12s in the UK. \nThe MHRA - which regulates medicines in the UK - said today that despite initial concerns about side-effects in under-18s, monitoring and a \"thorough review\" had found the jab to be safe, with \"no new safety issues\". \nEarlier in the year, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were linked to extremely rare cases of heart inflammation in young men. However, the EMA said that the benefits of vaccination still far outweighed the risks. \nAlmost all children and young people are at very low risk from Covid-19. \nData for England suggests about 25 children died from Covid in the first 12 months of the pandemic. \nThe majority of them also had severe health problems, including complex neurodisabilities. \nOnly six had no recorded health conditions. \nIn the year to 31 August 2021, Public Health England statistics suggest there were about 50 deaths among under-19s.\nMany countries are vaccinating children over the age of 12.\nCorrection 21 September 2021: An earlier version of this article wrongly implied that the Gillick competence test was named after a case involving a mother and daughter and this line has been amended."

      "tags": "Policing,Teaching,Doctors,Nursing,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Every Thursday evening the UK is clapping for NHS staff, carers and other key workers. But many are on low pay. \nThe weekly applause ran for 10 weeks during the UK's first coronavirus lockdown last spring and is set to return from 7 January.\nKey workers are the individuals recognised by the government as being critical to the running of the country, ranging from NHS and care workers to delivery drivers and shop workers. \nAcross the UK, the median salary for all full-time employees last year was \u00a331,461. \nWe use the median income - the salary right in the middle of all employees - because, unlike the (mean) average, it doesn't get pushed up by the small number of extremely well-paid individuals at the top. It can therefore be seen as a better indicator of the \"typical\" income. \nThe Office for National Statistics' (ONS) annual earnings survey provides a detailed picture of key workers' pay, as well as higher and lower pay brackets.\nThe following chart represents where most workers - 60% - sit in the salary range. But 20% of people in each profession earn less than the bottom of this range. And 20% earn more than the top of the range.\nAnd in many cases, those starting out earn significantly less than the bottom of the range -  police officers can expect a salary of around \u00a325,400 a year to start with, the lowest NHS pay band for a nurse is under \u00a320,000 and junior doctors receive under \u00a330,000 for their first foundation year. \nThere are dozens of professions and roles that count as key workers. This selection has been chosen to cover a number of sectors but is not exhaustive. \nThe average full-time cashier, shop assistant, care worker, food processor, bus driver and postal worker all earn below the median income. \nNurses and primary teachers are paid just above the median income, while doctors and pharmacists earn substantially above it. \nHowever, working out average salaries is an inexact science with various factors affecting pay - like overtime, part-time work or extra money for working in an expensive area. \nLow income employees, for example, are more likely to work part-time or hour-by-hour (such as through zero-hour contracts). This means a large number will not earn anything close to their occupation's full-time median income.\nThe ONS estimates that the hourly pay for a care worker, cashier or shelf stacker is under \u00a39 - which is more or less in line with the minimum wage (\u00a38.72 for those aged 25 and over). But that falls short of what the Living Wage Foundation charity calculates is necessary to meet basic needs. It recommends \u00a39.50 - or \u00a310.85 in London. \nAnalysis by the BBC's Shared Data Unit last year found that hundreds of thousands of key workers earn below that. \nThe government plays a large role in the pay of individuals working in the public sector - that's anyone whose job is directly funded by taxes. \nPolice officers, nurses, civil servants and teachers all have representatives who work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with annual recommendations for how much pay should change. \nThe government sets \"remits\" on these boards. \nBetween 2011 and 2018, most public sector pay was either frozen or capped at 1%, as part of the government's austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit.\nThis meant that as prices increased with inflation, salaries did not keep up. \nThe government has less control over private sector pay. \nThis includes people who work in transport, supermarkets, postal and courier services.\nIt also includes most care home staff and any services (such as cleaning or catering) the NHS might outsource.\nThe government does not directly set their wages, but they can lower taxes, provide benefits and increase the minimum wage. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak announced in November's Spending Review that 1.3 million public sector workers would be getting their pay frozen again.\nBut 2.1 million workers earning less than \u00a324,000 a year were promised a pay rise of at least \u00a3250.\nAnd more than a million NHS workers will get an increase.\nThe minimum wage will go up by 19p to \u00a38.91 an hour in April 2021. The Conservatives have pledged to increase this to \u00a310.50 by 2024.\nSome private companies, including supermarkets and delivery services, have already increased pay for staff during the coronavirus crisis.

      "text": "Phone numbers used by two Dubai princesses have reportedly been found as part of an investigation into the phone hacking spyware known as Pegasus.\nPrincess Latifa is the daughter of the ruler of Dubai, and Princess Haya Bint al-Hussain is his former wife.\nIn mid-February, BBC Panorama broadcast a secret video from Princess Latifa in which she said she was being held as a hostage and feared for her life.\nPrincess Haya meanwhile fled Dubai in 2019 saying she feared for her life.\nThe UAE has denied both women's allegations.\nTheir numbers are apparently on a list of some 50,000 phone numbers of people believed to be of interest to clients of Israeli-based firm NSO Group. \nThe list was leaked to major news outlets.\nThe discovery of the princesses' phone numbers on the list - and those of some acquaintances - has raised questions about whether they could have been the possible target of a government client of the group.\nHuman rights organisation Amnesty International has issued a statement alleging that the find implicates NSO Group \"in the catalogue of human rights violations\" inflicted on the two women.\nIt calls for regulation to rein in \"an unchecked surveillance industry\".\nNSO has denied any wrongdoing. \nIt says the software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists, and is made available only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies with good human rights records.\nThe original investigation which led to the reports - by Paris-based NGO Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International - was \"full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories\", the Israel-based group said.\nThe reports are part of a series of news articles suggesting thousands of prominent people have been targeted.\nA senior Israeli official confirmed to the BBC that the Israeli government had set up a team to examine allegations about the Pegasus software.\nPrincess Latifa told the BBC this year that she was kidnapped and imprisoned after trying to escape Dubai.\nShe said that after escaping the UAE and boarding a boat across the Indian Ocean in 2018, she was seized from a yacht and taken back to Dubai, where she says she was imprisoned in a villa converted into a jail.\nThe story prompted an international outcry. After the UN demanded proof of life, Dubai's royal family said she was \"being cared for at home\".\nPrincess Latifa has not been seen or heard from in months. Photos allegedly showing Princess Latifa in public and even travelling have appeared on an acquaintance's Instagram profile in recent months.\nPrincess Haya meanwhile has accused her ex-husband of abduction, torture and a campaign of intimidation. A UK court published the allegations in a series of judgements last year. \nAccording to the documents, her marriage fell apart after she became suspicious about what happened to Princess Latifa, as well as another of her ex-husband's children, Sheikha Shamsa.\nShe fled to the UK in April 2019 with her two children. The court heard last year that veiled threats from Sheikh Mohammed had left her terrified for her own safety, as well as fears that her children could be abducted and forcibly returned to Dubai."

      "text": "Travellers to England from green and amber list countries may no longer face Covid checks on arrival - according to a union representing border staff.\nOfficers will no longer routinely verify arrivals have tested negative before departure or completed a passenger locator form, the ISU said.\nThe Guardian first reported the change and said it aimed to reduce queues.\nThe government said carriers were checking all necessary requirements including forms and test bookings.\nA spokesperson added: \"This legal requirement on carriers is underpinned by a robust compliance regime, which is overseen by regulators.\n\"Compliance with these rules is essential in order to protect the population from new variants of Covid-19, and so there will be tough fines for those who do not follow the rules.\"\nAirlines UK, which represents easyJet, Tui and British Airways among others, said: \"Carriers are committed to working with Border Force on these requirements, which is why compliance has remained consistently extremely high.\"\nBut Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the government of \"yet more staggering incompetence\" and added: \"They must - urgently - get a grip.\"\nFrom Monday, carriers were asked to begin checking vaccine status certification. They were already legally required to ensure passengers have completed necessary requirements before travelling.\nThe Guardian said it had seen a leaked memo that told border staff they no longer had to search for a passenger locator form when the computer system failed to find one.\nThe memo also reportedly confirmed that electronic border gates \"will no longer refer passengers to in-person checks by Border Force officers if a passenger locator form is not found\".\nThe memo, which the Guardian said became operational on Monday as other restrictions eased in England, has not been seen by the BBC.\nBorder Force officers were previously instructed to check 100% of passenger Covid documentation at the border - a direction blamed by some for contributing to queues of up to six hours. \nPreviously about 10% of passenger Covid documentation had been checked.\nBut Lucy Moreton, of the ISU trade union, confirmed the reported memo was accurate.\n\"Ultimately this is a political decision,\" Ms Moreton said.\n\"Certainly, it will reduce queue times significantly and hopefully also the level of verbal abuse to which Border Force staff are subject.  \n\"That is welcome to us. The impact on the UK's Covid security is ultimately a scientific determination.\"\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has warned of continuing disruption to travel, saying passengers should expect much of that to be focused at check-in and before travel, rather than at the border.\nAll arrivals regardless of where they are coming from abroad are required to test negative before departure and have valid proof of their test status.\nThey are also required to conduct another test two days after their arrival, and prove this is organised pre-departure.\nAll travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form with basic details including an address.\nThose arriving from amber list countries, who are not fully vaccinated, must also complete a further test on day eight and quarantine at an address listed on the form. \nPeople who have been fully vaccinated are no longer required to carry out home quarantine when arriving from an amber list country.\nArrivals from red list countries must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days, at a cost of at least \u00a31,750 per adult.\nAdditional reporting by George Bowden."

      "text": "Hail the size of golf balls fell in a thunderstorm damaging cars and smashing windows as extreme heat warnings stayed in place across England.\nKatie Jaffar, from Kibworth Beauchamp, Leicestershire, said both of their family cars were a \"total write-off\" and \"covered in big dents\".\nSeveral roads in the East of England also flooded as temperatures of 30C (85F) turned to heavy rain and hail.\nThe Met Office had earlier issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms.\nThe hail storm hit Leicestershire at about 18:15 BST on Tuesday, with some car windows obliterated.\n\"One minute the kids were playing with their friends in the paddling pool and it was gloriously hot,\" Mrs Jaffar said.\n\"The next minute huge dollops of rain started falling and then it turned into hail - huge lumps of it thundering down.\n\"It was so fast, it was pretty terrifying.\"\nKibworth Court care home had to move all residents to the first floor after two lounges, the dining room and reception flooded. \nManager Caroline Harrison said: \"We were watching it with the residents because it was massive hailstones, and we realised it was actually getting really close to the front door, and then all of a sudden it just [came] straight through all the windows.\n\"We had to get the residents upstairs [and] phoned the fire brigade, because by then we were under at least eight inches of water. \n\"They came out and pumped the car park - the car park was like a massive pond.\"\nMs Harrison said staff had worked through the night to clean up and were \"all pretty exhausted\" and \"grateful\" to villagers who dropped off towels and helped after an appeal on Facebook. \n\"Most of the staff came in to help us have a massive clean-up last night - we've been here all night,\" she added.\n\"We've lost all the carpet - it's not something I want to go through again.\n\"The back garden is absolutely devastated. The gazebos all have holes in them, the umbrellas have gone.\n\"The devastation's pretty gutting.\"\nBy Anna Church, BBC East Midlands Today senior weather presenter \nAlthough hail is not unusual in the summer, the size of it experienced in Kibworth and surrounding areas on Tuesday is uncommon.  \nIt formed due to a number of factors. The atmosphere was highly unstable across the region yesterday, which led to strong updrafts in the cloud, allowing the hail longer to form and therefore get bigger.\nThe instability was also deep, with a large area of cloud above freezing. \nThe hail accompanied thunderstorms, which also caused flash flooding in places.\nSeveral Twitter users posted videos of the torrential showers, pictures of the giant hail and smashed car windows.\nOne Kibworth resident, who did not want to be named, said every car in the village would have been damaged if it was not in a garage or under cover.\n\"They were huge boulders coming from the sky, it was unbelievable,\" she said.\n\"I know a lot of people that have had their cars damaged. My car and partner's van were hit, my mother-in-law's greenhouse and window sill on the conservatory have boulder-sized holes in them.\n\"It felt like it lasted over an hour and a half, it was freaky.\"\nKevin Messenger saw his car damaged by the storm.\n\"It was a surreal experience to be honest,\" he told BBC Radio Leicester.\n\"One minute you are basking in the glorious sunshine, and then a little bit of rain started and all of a sudden the noise started echoing around the house. \n\"I woke up this morning almost feeling a bit fortunate and a bit grateful - [there are] definitely worse-impacted people than me.\"\nPrimary school teacher Phil Morrish, 53, who is an avid weather watcher, said he was sent pictures from friends in Kibworth village.\n\"People are shocked by it,\" he said. \"There are quite a few cars being damaged by this huge hail.\n\"It is crazy weather. The hailstones are three to five centimetres big.\"\nPaul Arscott, a market researcher and father-of-two from Kibworth, said: \"The roads were nuts, everyone pulled up on grass verges and pavements trying to hide under trees or bridges from the A6 all the way to Kibworth, all at different angles. It was like some Armageddon film.\"\nJoe Starmer, who runs a nearby car body repair shop, said he had received several calls on Wednesday morning from residents.\n\"I only live down the road from Kibworth and my workshop wasn't affected - we just got rain,\" he said.\n\"But I drove down and it's not a good look. Pretty much every car I drove past was affected - the roof panels and bonnets broken, windscreens smashed, every single panel dented.\"\nKibworth Golf Club said it would be closed all day on Wednesday because of damage to the course.\nClub secretary Wendy Quilter said members and volunteers had been down with rakes and brushes to help with the clean-up. \n\"All the grounds are dimpled and waterlogged... the skylights around the clubhouse smashed, guttering demolished, there's not a flower left in the place,\" she said. \n\"I have never seen anything quite like it.\"\nElderly residents on the upper floor of retirement home Morrison Court, in Kibworth, were evacuated by fire crews after several skylights were shattered and water started flowing into the corridors.\nOne of the residents, Andrea Smith, 75, said: \"It was horrifying. Water started coming through the lights in the corridor ceilings and it forced them to crash to the ground with live electric wires hanging down.\n\"One of the ladies who lives here nearly got smashed on the head with one of these lights - it fell down just in front of her.\n\"It was really scary because it was so noisy. It sounded like gunshots. There was glass everywhere.\"\nOfficers closed the A6 Harborough Road, at Kibworth, in both directions due to flooding.\nLeicestershire Police said it was \"dealing with an incident\" and advised motorists to find alternative routes.\nLeicestershire Fire and Rescue Service has warned people not to \"attempt to drive through flood water\". \nExtreme heat warnings, alerting people to the risk of sunburn and heat exhaustion, are in place until Friday.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "title": "Dr Michael Heath: Families feared they cremated the wrong person",
      "text": "Two bereaved families feared they had \"cremated the wrong person\" due to errors in the post-mortem reports of a serially discredited pathologist.\nThe BBC has spoken to several families who say Dr Michael Heath made multiple errors in his investigations into the deaths of their loved ones.\nHe led a disputed forensic inquiry into the death of Stuart Lubbock after a party at Michael Barrymore's home.\nDr Heath's work also led to a man being wrongly convicted of murder.\nThe General Medical Council (GMC) is currently investigating Dr Heath. Despite repeated attempts, the BBC has been unable to reach him for comment.\nRelatives of Ann House say a post-mortem examination on the 74-year-old contained errors, including mentioning her gallbladder - which had been removed five years earlier.\nMs House, a former social worker, was admitted to East Surrey Hospital in May 2020 suffering from shortness of breath. \nShe died at the hospital three months later, and a post-mortem examination was carried out by Dr Heath.\n\"All the way through the report there was sort of various anomalies,\" her son Alistair House said.\n\"[The report said] my mother's body was well-nourished. Well when she died, she weighed less than 50 kilos.\n\"And then what really sort of got the alarm bells ringing was the mention of a gallbladder that she'd had removed in 2016,\" Mr House added.\n\"Having already cremated my mum, we started to fear that we potentially cremated the wrong body.\"\nAmy Dickson also feared she had cremated the wrong body after receiving Dr Heath's post-mortem report on her father.\nMs Dickson said she felt \"utter disbelief\" when the report described her father, an alcoholic, as overweight with a healthy liver.\nShe says her father, Steve Goodenough, was frail with a poor liver and healthy heart. \nHowever, the report put his death down to a failed heart and probable alcohol withdrawal, but ignored the fact he had received a wine delivery days before he died, Ms Dickson said.\n\"I sort of read it through and it just didn't ring true.\"\nReceiving an incorrect report \"added a whole new dimension\" of trauma, she said.\nIncorrect post-mortem reports could have \"really, really important\" consequences \"in terms of the care their loved one received, in terms of potentially criminal investigations,\" Ms Dickson said \n\"There are people who will never get the answers that they need for their own peace of mind.\"\nTwo further families have come forward to the BBC with similar concerns about Dr Heath's work.\nFor 20 years Dr Heath's career has been littered with controversy.\nIn 2001, his work came under scrutiny when his findings over the death of Mr Lubbock differed from those of other pathologists. \nA disciplinary panel in 2006 found mistakes in Dr Heath's post-mortem examinations on Mary Anne Moore and Jacqueline Tindsley led to their partners being tried for murder.\nStephen Puaca, Ms Tindsley's partner, served three years of a life sentence for her murder following Dr Heath's evidence, before his conviction was overturned. \nFollowing the report, Dr Heath stood down from police work, but in recent years has been conducting post-mortem examinations for Surrey Coroner's Court. \nIn 2009 the GMC found Dr Heath guilty of serious misconduct, but ruled his fitness to practise was not impaired.\nIn March this year the GMC launched a new investigation into Dr Heath.\nThe GMC said it could not comment on ongoing investigations, but has placed a series of stringent conditions on Dr Heath's licence to practise.\nSurrey County Council has since suspended Dr Heath from working for the coroner."

      "tags": "Welsh government,NHS Wales",
      "text": "All NHS staff in Wales will be offered a 3% pay rise by the Welsh government.\nThe increase will be backdated to April 2021, and follows a recommendation by NHS pay bodies.\nWelsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan said it \"recognises the dedication and commitment of hardworking NHS staff\".\nBut the decision - which will apply to nurses, doctors, dentists and other workers - was dubbed \"bitterly disappointing\" by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) union.\nIt follows a similar announcement in England of a 3% pay rise for nurses and other NHS workers.\nThe decision in Wales comes after recommendations from the NHS Pay Review Body and the Doctor and Dentist Review body.\nIt applies to employed nurses, cleaners and porters, consultants, doctors in training, salaried GPs and dentists, among others.\nBritish Medical Association Wales said it was \"extremely disappointed\" there had not been a more generous offer for staff who had gone \"above and beyond\" during the pandemic.\nAnita Charlesworth of The Health Foundation called it a \"treading water pay offer\", adding the pay system needed to \"both prevent NHS staff from leaving and encouraging highly-skilled new people to join\".\nMs Morgan thanked staff for their \"extraordinary efforts over the course of this pandemic\".\n\"Many staff have worked extremely long hours under enormous pressure,\" she said.\n\"This pay rise recognises the dedication and commitment of hardworking NHS staff and the enormous contribution they have made. It is also a recognition of how valued they are by Welsh communities.\"\nShe said it means that the lowest paid staff would also receive more the living wage recommendation of \u00a39.50 an hour.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said they were \"delighted\" at the pay award, while Plaid Cymru said staff might feel \"let down\", considering the 4% offer in Scotland.\nBut Helen Whyley, RCN Wales' director, said: \"The 3% award is a long way off the 12.5% claim of the Royal College of Nursing, which would bring nurses in line with other professions and redress the fact that their wages have reduced over the last 10 years.\n\"It also does not recognise the commitment of nursing staff throughout the pandemic.\"\nIt follows a row earlier in the year where the UK government suggested it would only support a 1% pay rise for NHS workers in England.\nWelsh Labour had criticised the proposed cap during the recent Senedd election campaign, but did not state what it would offer instead, with ministers saying they would wait for the pay bodies' recommendations. \nPlaid Cymru's deputy leader, Sian Gwenllian, said: \"Our health service is already under pressure, under-resourced and under-staffed, and the least we can do is ensure our workers do not remain under-paid.\"\nWelsh Conservative shadow health minister, Russell George, said the pay award was \"recognition of their extraordinary efforts during the most challenging period in the history of our treasured national health service\".\nThe Welsh NHS' funding comes mostly from the UK government, and Welsh officials said the Treasury had not said whether any additional cash would be provided for the pay deal.\nIt is in addition to an earlier one-off payment of \u00a3735 last March."

      "text": "The foreign secretary has accused the EU of seeking \"to undermine the UK's sovereignty over Gibraltar\". \nDominic Raab said he was \"disappointed\" by EU proposals for a post-Brexit deal over the British overseas territory.\nMr Raab said a draft mandate from the European Commission \"directly conflicts\" with a framework deal agreed by the UK, Gibraltar and Spain last December. \nEU leaders must sign off on the EU's mandate before negotiations can begin.\nGibraltar's sovereignty is disputed by Spain and Britain. The territory was not included in the trade agreement settled between the EU and the UK last year and a separate deal has to be agreed.\nIt is thought that British objections to the EU plans centre on the nature of proposed new border arrangements in Gibraltar.\nLast December's political deal between the UK, Gibraltar and Spain gave a prominent role to the EU's border agency Frontex but the Commission's mandate appears to give greater responsibility to Spanish officials. \nIn a statement, the foreign secretary said: \"We have consistently showed pragmatism and flexibility in the search for arrangements that work for all sides, and we are disappointed that this has not been reciprocated. We urge the EU to think again.\"\nThe European Commission said the proposed negotiating directives \"put forward solutions to remove physical checks and controls on persons and goods\" at the border between Spain and Gibraltar.\n\"It is without prejudice to the issues of sovereignty and jurisdiction, and focuses on cooperation in the region,\" the bloc added.\nThe mandate includes rules for establishing responsibility for asylum, visas, residence permits and police cooperation and information exchange.\nThe EU's post-Brexit negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, said its proposals seek to make a \"positive impact\" on those living either side of the border with Spain while protecting the single market.\n\"By putting forward this draft mandate, we are honouring the political commitment we made to Spain to start the negotiations of a separate agreement between the EU and the UK on Gibraltar.\n\"This is a detailed mandate, which aims to have a positive impact for those living and working on either side of the border between Spain and Gibraltar, while protecting the integrity of the Schengen Area and the single market.\"\nIn March the Foreign Secretary, and Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo agreed a joint approach to the negotiations on a new Gibraltar treaty between the EU and the UK."

      "tags": "Policing,Violence against women,Sarah Everard murder",
      "text": "A top police officer will be put in charge of tackling violence against women and girls in England and Wales, the home secretary has announced.\nThe creation of the role was recommended in a report after 33-year-old Sarah Everard was murdered in March.\nHer death sparked a public debate about women's safety.\nThe new national policing lead is part of a broader strategy to deliver \"lasting change\", Priti Patel said.\nIt comes amid concern about record low rape conviction rates and a culture of sexual harassment in schools.\nMs Patel said the new policing lead would \"drive change\" to end \"abhorrent abuse and violence\" against women and girls.\n\"Every aspect of policing and criminal justice system must have a determined approach to ending violence against women and girls,\" she said.\nShe added that the new post would \"bring together the incredible work of police officers around the country and create a consistent response to ending these appalling crimes\".\nThe government's strategy to tackle violence against women and girls includes a 24-hour rape and sexual assault helpline, \u00a35m of funding to tackle violence in public places at night, and an online tool where women and girls can log areas where they have felt unsafe.\nIn a statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday evening, Home Office minister Victoria Atkins said the message from government was \"enough is enough\", before telling MPs: \"Through this strategy we will strive relentlessly to prevent these crimes, to support victims and to bring perpetrators to justice.\"\nHowever, shadow Home Office minister Jess Phillips said the government's strategy was \"not ambitious enough\".\nShe told MPs: \"The first responsibility of any government is the safety and security of its citizens.\n\"Today rape prosecutions are at a record low, domestic abuse in this country is soaring, charging is falling. Sexual abuse in schools is being normalised, according to the recent Ofsted inspections.\n\"Ending violence against women and girls is a cross-party issue, on all sides of this House there is a profound concern and desire for an ambitious strategy that would deliver. \n\"The strategy today is not ambitious enough.\"\nWomen's groups have been calling for new legislation to make sexual harassment of women in public places, such as wolf-whistling and lewd or sexual comments, to be made illegal.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Tory former minister Caroline Nokes said she was disappointed there is \"no current commitment to outlawing public sexual harassment\" and asked Ms Atkins to commit to \"identifying gaps\" in the law.\nMs Atkins vowed to appear before the Women and Equalities Committee, which Ms Nokes chairs, and that ministers were \"looking very thoroughly at the issue of street harassment\".\nMaya Tutton, co-founder of Our Streets Now - a campaign to end public sexual harassment in the UK, said existing legislation for these type of offences was \"piecemeal and antiquated\" and not written with public sexual harassment in mind.\nRose Caldwell, chief executive of Plan International UK - a charity promoting equality for girls, is urging the government to quickly review legal gaps -\u202fand\u202fthen\u202fcommit to a new\u202fpublic\u202f sexual\u202fharassment\u202flaw \"as a matter of urgency\".\u202f\u202f\u202f \n\"It is extraordinary that if a girl is going to school on the train and a man leans against her; presses his body against her, invades her space and whispers obscene comments in her ear, she is not protected by existing laws,\" she said. \nAre you scared to walk home alone at night? Have you been sexually harassed, abused or assaulted? Most women would answer yes to these questions.\nViolence against women has always been an issue. But in March the murder of Sarah Everard brought acute distress and anger. It changed the idea that women would remain silent about their experiences.\nAnd the launch of Everyone's Invited, where schoolgirls and students spoke out about their sexual assaults and rapes, shone a much needed light on what women were facing.\nThe government's reaction to this is, sensibly, to take a comprehensive approach trying to improve policing, transport, education, victim support and offender management.\nBut the scale of the problem and the lack of justice women face means solutions need to be on a grand scale. \nPlans including a few more million pounds to protect women out at night, an advertising campaign and a promise to look at new laws don't feel like enough to make an immediate difference.\nThe Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said it welcomed the \"whole system approach to tackling violence\" but added it would \"only succeed with sustainable funding\".\n\"It is tragic that it took the murder of Sarah Everard for society to recognise that violence against women and girls is an epidemic in this country,\" said Sophie Linden and Donna Jones, victims leads.\n\"We want all victims to feel safe coming forward to report, knowing that the police will listen and confident that justice will be served.\"\nMs Everard's death sparked vigils and protests calling for more action to tackle violence against women.\nIt prompted the government to reopen its Call for Evidence to inform its strategy, which was originally launched last December. \nThe 33-year-old was abducted by serving police officer Wayne Couzens as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March. He has admitted murdering her.\nLast month, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland admitted in an interview with the BBC that budget cuts were partly to blame for record low rape conviction rates.\nIn the year to the end of March 2020, 58,856 cases of rape were recorded by police forces in England and Wales.\nThese led to just 2,102 prosecutions, compared with 3,043 in the previous 12 months.\nAnd in recent months, the Everyone's Invited website has revealed a culture of sexual harassment among some school students.\nSupport and resources for sexual abuse and violence are available via the BBC Action Line.\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "People with Covid in Northern Ireland can now stop self-isolating after five full days, if they have have two negative tests. \nThese rules are also in place in England, where the prime minister has said that there will \"soon be a time\" when self-isolation is not required.\nThe self-isolation period for anyone who develops symptoms or tests positive for Covid is five full days. \nThe day symptoms begin - or you test positive - is day zero. The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately.

If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

      "text": "A second dose of the Pfizer vaccine will be offered to 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK, following updated advice from the UK's vaccine committee.\nAll over-18s across the UK can have two Covid vaccine doses, as can some vulnerable, high-risk children over 12.\nHealthy, low-risk children between 12 and 15 have only been offered a single dose - which should be delayed until 12 weeks after a coronavirus infection.\nThe Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says a second dose for those aged 16 and 17 is safe and effective 12 weeks after the first.\nThe JCVI has previously held back from recommending a second dose because of concerns over a very rare heart condition, called myocarditis, experienced by tiny numbers of young people - particularly boys - after the second dose.\nIt says it is now reassured by evidence from other countries that a 12-week gap between doses would lower that already very small risk.\nA decision on a second dose for 12-15s has not yet been made but could happen in the next few weeks.\nIn the meantime, all 12-17 year olds should wait 12 weeks after a Covid infection before having their first or second dose.\nNo vaccine is currently approved for under-12s in the UK.\nIf you're over 18, and want to book your first, second or booster dose, you can find out how here.\nNo. If you're under 40 or pregnant you'll be given Pfizer or Moderna.\nEvery woman who is pregnant (or planning to become pregnant) is encouraged to get two vaccine doses. Hospital figures show that 98% of pregnant women admitted to intensive care this year were not vaccinated.\nUnder-18s have so far been offered Pfizer. \nThe vaccines are very effective at protecting people against becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid-19. \nLatest data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests more than 90% protection against hospitalisation and death with all three vaccines.\nThe vaccines are less effective at stopping people becoming infected by the virus, developing mild symptoms or passing it on - but they do reduce the risk of that happening too.\nIf you've been double-jabbed, you are far less likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid.\nCovid vaccines aren't compulsory, but everyone is urged to get jabbed to protect themselves, their family, friends and wider society.\nChildren under 16 don't need parental consent to get jabbed, as long as they are believed to have \"enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what's involved in their treatment\". This is known as \"Gillick competence\". \nBeing fully vaccinated can make travelling to most other countries easier, and in many cases means you will not have to self-isolate either when you return to the UK. \nHowever, it's worth bearing in mind that under-16s are not eligible for their own digital NHS Covid Pass, which is now accepted widely as proof of vaccination. \nWhat's more, the single jab which most UK teenagers have so far received, is not recognised as full vaccination by some countries (including France), and more tests may be required.\nCheck your destination's rules on the Foreign Office website before you travel. \nMost are mild, completely normal and disappear after a few days. \nThey happen because the body's defences are reacting to the vaccine, and include:\nA very small number of people had a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, so you should discuss any allergies you have before vaccination.\nThere's no evidence to suggest you should avoid alcohol altogether, but drinking in large quantities can suppress your immune system.\nSome women have experienced unusually heavy, painful or prolonged periods after being jabbed.\nThis may be because the vaccine prompts an increase in activity in the immune system, which also plays a role in the menstrual cycle. \nHowever, there's no evidence  the vaccine has any impact on pregnancy or fertility.\nPregnant women are being urged to get the vaccine, to protect themselves and their babies.\nCoronavirus can cause serious illness in some women in later pregnancy, and possibly a slightly higher rate of stillbirth.\nIf you're planning a pregnancy or are breastfeeding, government guidance says you can still get vaccinated, \nA recent study suggests vaccination can help improve long Covid symptoms.\nResearchers think the vaccine could be pressing the body's reset button and helping it recover.

In line with the rules, Keir and his family will now be self-isolating,\" said a Labour spokesperson. \"Keir was already doing daily tests and tested negative this morning. He will continue to take daily tests.\""

      "text": "People buying flats in buildings lower than 18m (59ft) in England will no longer have to provide safety details on external walls to get a mortgage, the government has said.\nBarclays, HSBC and Lloyds welcomed the change, and said it should pave the way for updated industry guidance.\nIt follows concerns over large bills to remove cladding facing many flat owners since the Grenfell Tower fire.\nBut Labour called the height-based stipulation \"arbitrary\".\nAfter the 2017 fire in Grenfell Tower, west London, in which 72 people died, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar dangerous cladding.\nWork to remove the material, as well as fix other safety issues, meant many residents were charged thousands of pounds, often leaving them in negative equity and unable to sell their property.\nMortgage lenders began asking for assurances on the safety of external wall systems as a condition of approving mortgage applications.\nMortgage applicants were asked to get safety assessors to sign off a form - known as EWS1 - to prove their property is safe. \nLenders have been asking for the forms for many different types of buildings, including those without cladding. \nTo begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected.\nAfter the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers.\nBut on Wednesday, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said this guidance would now be changed to exempt leaseholders in low-to-medium-rise blocks from this requirement.\nHe said the change followed new advice from fire safety experts commissioned by the government earlier this year. \nHome fires were at an all-time low, he said, while 91% occurred in houses, bungalows or converted flats. \nBy BBC business presenter Sarah Corker\nThis is an attempt to unlock parts of the property market that have been paralysed by the cladding crisis. \nIt's estimated that up to 3 million flats have been left unsellable because lenders are demanding an EWS1 form. \nIt's left people in low and mid-rise buildings, where the safety risks are deemed as low, unable to move with properties valued at zero. \nEven blocks with no cladding have been affected. \nThe problem has been compounded by a shortage of fire engineers to carry out the checks and flat-owners have faced long delays obtaining the paperwork. \nThere is an acceptance too that \"extreme risk aversion\" from lenders, insurers, and the wider property industry has resulted in flat-owners across the UK receiving massive bills for work that is not necessary. \nLenders have now committed to review their practices on this, but the response from leaseholders has so far been muted. \nThey are waiting for banks to actually change their policies - only then will this policy make a real difference to those caught up in the cladding scandal.\nMr Jenrick also said: \"In the small number of cases [in purpose-built tower blocks below 18m] where there are known to be concerns these should be addressed primarily through risk management and mitigation.\"\nHe added: \"Fire-risk assessors and lenders should not presume that there is significant risk to life unless there is evidence to support this.\n\"This would ensure that they respond only to the evidence and adopt a far more proportionate and balanced approach.\"\nMr Jenrick said he was pleased major lenders had agreed to change their rules, adding: \"I hope and expect other lenders to follow suit swiftly.\"\nThe change, which will apply only in England, would influence mortgage lenders' attitudes across the UK, he added.\nFor Labour, shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell said there was a \"cosy relationship between developers and the private inspectors they handsomely pay\".\nShe added: \"The government should think again about its arbitrary definition of high-risk buildings.\""

      "text": "US climate envoy John Kerry has called on China to increase the speed and depth of its efforts to cut carbon.\nWithout sufficient emissions reductions by China, Mr Kerry said, the global goal of keeping temperatures under 1.5C  was \"essentially impossible\".\nMr Kerry said he was convinced that China could do more and the US was willing to work closely to secure a reasonable climate future.\nEvery major economy must now commit to meaningful reductions by 2030, he said.\nMr Kerry was speaking at Kew Gardens in London, ahead of a G20 environment ministers meeting in Italy later this week. \nReferring to the key COP26 gathering in Glasgow in November, the former Secretary of State said that \"in little more than 100 days we can save the next 100 years\".\nDoing so would not be easy he said. Mr Kerry said that the promises made during and since the Paris climate agreement in 2015 would still see the world's temperature increase by 2.5-3C.\n\"We're already seeing dramatic consequences with 1.2C of warming,\" he said, referring to recent heatwaves in the US and Canada, and flooding in Europe.\n\"To contemplate doubling that is to invite catastrophe.\"\nHe castigated the efforts of some countries which are still building new coal-fired power stations. He was scornful of nations that are illegally cutting down the rainforest\n\"They're removing the lungs of the world, destroying irreplaceable biodiversity and destabilising the climate all at the same time.\"\nObservers say that the envoy was likely referring to Brazil and Indonesia.\nMr Kerry paid special attention to the efforts of China, saying the country was now \"the largest driver of climate change\".\nChina has promised to peak emissions by 2030 - but the US diplomat said that was not good enough.\n\"If China sticks with its current plant and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the entire rest of the world must go to zero by 2040 or even 2035,\" he warned.\n\"There is simply no alternative because without sufficient reduction by China, the goal of 1.5C is essentially impossible. China's partnership and leadership on this issue of extraordinary international consequence is essential.\"\nMr Kerry said he was convinced that China could outperform the targets it had set itself and that despite their diplomatic differences, the US was keen to co-operate.\nHe also said all other major economies would have to step up, with more ambitious targets and plans for the next decade.\nMr Kerry's comments come as new research shows that G20 countries are continuing to support fossil fuels in ways that are incompatible with the goals of the Paris agreement.\nAccording to Bloomberg's Climate Policy Factbook, G20 nations collectively cut fossil fuel funding by 10% from 2015 to 2019. However, eight countries, including the US, Canada and Australia increased their financial support for oil, coal and gas in this period. \nLast week, Mr Kerry travelled to Moscow where both sides agreed that the climate issue is one of common interest. President Putin said that Moscow \"attaches great importance\" to achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement. \nIn May, Mr Kerry was criticised by some scientists for rejecting the idea that Americans would have to change their consumption habits, for example, eating less meat. \nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

      "text": "Downing Street has insisted it is \"crucial\" to self-isolate when sent an alert by the Covid app - and businesses should help employees to do so.\nIt comes after business minister Paul Scully said he would encourage people who are \"pinged\" to self-isolate but they can make an \"informed decision\". \nThe app has always been voluntary to download and any alerts are advisory.\nLabour accused the government of \"making it up as they go along\" and creating confusion.\nIn recent days, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption.\nPub chains, supermarkets, transport networks and other businesses have warned of the crippling effect blanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations.\nPeople who are \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid app and told they have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nHowever, anyone contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace - either by phone, text or email - must self-isolate.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported a further 46,558 new daily Covid cases alongside another 96 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMeanwhile, a \"very small\" number of critical workers - including NHS and care staff - could carry on working even if told to self-isolate under a new government scheme.\nIndustry bodies reacted to the plan with dismay, describing it as \"simply unworkable\", amid confusion over how it would operate.\nDowning Street confirmed the first exemptions had been issued under the scheme by government departments.\nNo 10 was unable to say how many people the government will approve for the loosened rules.\nPlans for the fully vaccinated to be made exempt from self-isolation were delayed until 16 August in England, with ministers warning at the time of a huge knock-on for the economy and workplaces, including the NHS. \nIn a BBC interview, Mr Scully was asked whether people should self-isolate if they are \"pinged\". \"I would absolutely encourage people to do that. But they can make an informed decision,\" he replied.\n\"I don't want to have to mandate people and tell people what to do as government any longer than I really have to. \n\"But they do have a responsibility to themselves, to their families and to their communities. It's by doing the right thing that we can keep Covid at bay.\"\nEarlier, he told Times Radio that self-isolating after being told to by the app was a decision for individuals and employers.\n\"It's important to understand the rules,\" he said. \"You have to legally isolate if you are... contacted by Test and Trace, or if you're trying to claim isolation payments. The app is there to allow you to make informed decisions.\"\nThe Times is also reporting that ministers have written to major manufacturers emphasising that staff are not legally obliged to isolate if \"pinged\". Investment minister Lord Grimstone told one large employer the app was only an \"advisory tool\" and that people were not under any \"legal duty\", the paper said.\nFollowing the ministers' comments, Downing Street attempted to clarify the government's position, insisting isolation remained the \"most important action\" people can take to stop the spread of the virus.\n\"Given the risk of having and spreading the virus when people have been in contact with someone with Covid, it is crucial people isolate when they are told to do so, either by NHS Test and Trace or by the NHS Covid app,\" a No 10 spokeswoman said.\n\"Businesses should be supporting employees to isolate, they should not be encouraging them to break isolation.\"\nNow that legal restrictions have been lifted in England, cases of coronavirus will undoubtedly rise further. \nBut a significant number of adults are not yet fully vaccinated. \nIn the meantime, the test and trace system remains the only way the government can contain the virus to a level it deems acceptable. \nSo the message on how closely people should follow the advice to isolate if \"pinged\" by the app is crucial. \nAlthough it's not a legal requirement to do so (only if contacted directly by test and trace) any suggestion that it's up to you, optional, or a judgement call risks undermining the government's entire approach. \nThat's why we saw a junior minister's choice of words was quickly corrected by Downing Street this morning. \nThe rules change next month, allowing double jabbed adults to avoid isolation. \nUntil then the government will have to hope it can keep the public's confidence in the app and its instructions to isolate. \nJohn Edmunds, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said contact tracing and self-isolation should be maintained \"as stringently as we can\".\n\"We have one of the highest rates of cases in the world right now. The NHS has been under strain for a long time and they are busy trying to catch up on operations and are very, very busy. So to put them under more pressure now is going to be awkward,\" he told Times Radio. \nJustin Madders, Labour's shadow health minister, accused the government of \"making it up as they go along\".  \n\"Yet again there is more confusion and incompetence from the heart of government at the expense of public health. They need to get a grip,\" he said. \nWhile the Covid app can only advise people to self-isolate, anyone in England who is called, texted or emailed by NHS Test and Trace must isolate for 10 days.\nFailure to self-isolate for the full time period can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000.\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Efforts are being stepped up to convince more Scots to get the Covid-19 jab as lower age groups become the vaccination programme's chief target. But are younger adults less likely to turn up for their vaccine appointments? If so, why might this be, and what is the government doing about it?\nLooking at a snapshot of current vaccination levels, it is true that younger people seem to be the last group still waiting to be jabbed.\nBut then they were also the last to be offered them. And there is little to suggest that, for example, people aged 20 have in general been any slower to come forward than those aged 30 or 40.\nInitial take-up when the programme moves into a new age group is usually pretty fast. The lines on the graph are markedly similar - a steep rise, followed by a fairly sudden plateau.\nThe immediate take-up rate of the vaccine among younger people has been similar to that of older demographics. The difference has been that groups in the under-50 cohort have started to plateau at lower levels.\nFor example, about 95% of the 55 to 59-year-old cohort had been given a first jab before the take-up rate began to level off. In 50-54s it was about 90%.\nIn 40 to 49-year-olds the graph began to level off at 85%, and in 30 to 39-year olds it was at 75%. Each group has since added another five percentage points to its total, so progress is still ticking along - just more slowly.\nWe have not yet seen where the 18 to 29-year-old group will level off, but uptake already seems to be slowing - it has taken two weeks to go from 60% to 70%, having gone from 40% to 60% in the fortnight before that.\nFrom these figures, it would appear that the change has not occurred since vaccination of the youngest age bracket began - it is the continuation of a trend which started as soon as the JCVI priority groups of those over 50 were complete.\nThat is also the point at which many older people started getting second doses - more of which have been given out than first doses on almost every day since.\nA number of reasons have been offered.\nYoung people have been told throughout the pandemic that they are less likely to fall seriously ill or die from Covid-19. They are not invincible - there are plenty who have been hit hard by the symptoms of the virus or who continue to struggle with long Covid. \nBut they have not been in the position of older demographics where the pandemic has been a personal matter of life and death.\nDarren Pake, 25, from Dundee, told BBC Scotland's The Nine programme that it should be a choice whether people get the jab or not.\nHe said: \"I was always very on the fence but more leaning towards not wanting it because I didn't feel like I was particularly at risk. The big threat that was always lurking was vaccine passports as a new normal, that never really sat right with me.\"\nThere is also an element of distrust in politicians. Bobby Douglas, 18, also from Dundee, said he had not gone for a jab as a \"protest\" against the government for not lifting restrictions more quickly.\nHe said: \"If we do get it, restrictions aren't going to end tomorrow or soon - even if Scotland moved past level zero on 9 August, there's always that possibility that restrictions might be brought back in.\n\"What is the point in the vaccine if restrictions are going to be brought back?\"\nOthers have voiced concerns about the vaccines themselves. Simone Pearson, 48, from Edinburgh, said she \"desperately\" wanted a jab but did not want the Oxford-AstraZeneca after it was linked to rare blood clots.\nShe said: \"I have visited numerous vaccination hubs to be told that I don't have a choice, even although they have other vaccines there.\"\nMs Pearson thinks it is \"down to luck\" what you are offered.\nShe explained: \"I've had friends at work in the over 40's age category who received the Moderna vaccine. It seems likely it is more of what's available on the day. At least two friends of mine in their 40's have now received Moderna, and I feel like I'm having to tour the country to try and get something that isn't AstraZeneca.\"\nThe virus itself may be one of the stumbling blocks to younger people attending their vaccine appointments.\nScotland started vaccinating the 18 to 29-year-old group in earnest around the start of June.\nThis was also roughly the time that Scotland's case numbers began to climb the crest of the third wave. There have been almost 100,000 new cases since, and these were disproportionately among younger people.\nPeople are not meant to have the vaccine for 28 days after developing symptoms or testing positive, and others may also have missed appointments when self-isolating.\nThere may also be non-virus factors involved - those aged 25-50 are significantly more likely to be in work than other cohorts and to have other commitments, for example with young families.\nThe Scottish government has insisted that the vaccine drive is proceeding well, and that there are only a few groups left to \"chip away\" at.\nNicola Sturgeon has issued a plea for younger people to keep getting vaccinated, asking families to encourage young relatives to take part.\nThe government has put out adverts across television and social media platforms aimed at younger people, including a range of Facebook and Instagram ads shown only to people under 35.\nHealth boards have also opened drop-in centres and mobile clinics to make it easier for people to get vaccinated in a time and place that works for them.\nThe first minister said: \"We are exploring all possible methods of making vaccines as accessible as possible, but also ways in which we can address any of the other reasons why people might be reluctant to come forward.\n\"Ultimately vaccine is not compulsory - that means people do have the right to decide not to get vaccinated. But I would really urge people not to exercise that right, but to exercise the right to protect themselves and others as much as possible from Covid.\""

Many included a sense of the teller lining themselves up shoulder-to-shoulder with her: \"She was the same age as me\", \"I used to live near her\", \"I've walked the same route\".\nMs Everard didn't set herself up to be such an everywoman, a symbol of longstanding - and ongoing - violence against women. She had no choice in her name becoming a battle cry for change. \nThe private, excoriating grief of friends and family seems to have been subsumed by the wider - albeit important and valid - reactions of protest and polemic, marches and mass mourning. \nSarah Everard was a daughter, sister, friend and colleague. According to those in the know, she was dreadful at karaoke but \"brilliant\" at everything else. \nThere were just 38 minutes between the time this \"clever, articulate and caring\" woman left a friend's house and the last time she was seen. \nThe final image of her, captured by a bus camera, also showed a white Vauxhall Astra with its hazard lights on and both front doors open.\nThe car had been hired specifically for kidnapping a woman. It was returned to the rental company the following morning, having served its purpose.\nSarah Everard was dead.\nHer body was found a week later in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, where her killer owned a patch of land. \nA complete stranger, a police officer, had kidnapped, raped and murdered her.\nHe knew what he was doing, this man who killed her for his own gratuitous wants.\nOutwardly, he had what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary life. A responsible job. Wife and children. A house in Deal in Kent he shared with them.\nBut the 48-year-old officer's fa\u00e7ade hid the actions of a sexual predator who had been planning the crime - although not yet selecting his victim - in chilling detail. On 28 February, three days before he killed Ms Everard, he had been accused of indecent exposure in a branch of McDonald's. It wasn't the first time.\nThe very same day, he bought a roll of self-adhesive plastic described as \"carpet protector\" and booked the hire car he would use to abduct the marketing executive. He arranged for time off work.\nAfter he killed Ms Everard, he bought builders' bags, a tarpaulin and a cargo net, wiped his phone and concocted an implausible and time-wasting web of lies about his involvement in her disappearance.\nThat they won't have to sit through the grisly evidence and twisted lies of a trial must be scant relief to her loved ones.\nMs Everard should have had a brilliant future, a lot to look forward to. She had bounced back after a relationship breakup and was seeing someone new. She had just started a new job. \nShe, her boyfriend Josh Lowth and four others were planning a trip to Ibiza at the end of summer.\nOne of Ms Everard's friends said: \"What I loved about her was that she had depth. She wasn't a vapid, nice person. She had opinions, sarcasm and wanted things to be better. \n\"We could trust her to fight the good fight.\"\nMs Everard grew up in York, with an older brother and sister. Her father was a professor and her mother a charity worker.\nDescribed by her family as \"bright and beautiful\", \"kind and thoughtful\", \"caring and dependable\", she \"always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour. She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all\".\nRose Woollard has been a close friend of Ms Everard since university, and was one of the first to become alarmed. She contacted the BBC in an attempt to raise awareness before Ms Everard's disappearance had become an official police investigation.\nMs Woollard said: \"Sarah has always been an exceptional friend, dropping everything to be there to support her friends, whenever they need her.\n\"It was only recently that she was telling me the good news about her new role, which she was excited to start.\"\n\"She was sunshine and light, and made you feel warm and good and safe,\" said another friend. \"I feel angry about it as well, but my main anger is that it happened to her.\"\nA former colleague said: \"Sometimes you meet a person with a beautiful soul and it shines through. \n\"There is nothing anyone can say that will make things better for her family and loved ones. They must be in hell. I can only say that Sarah was a very special person and will be missed by so many.\"\nThe uproar over Ms Everard's death, and what she has come to represent, led one friend to say: \"I would like to just say who she was to me, as a person. \n\"Finding the right words is so hard. \n\"I can't sum her up in a few well-chosen words, nor express what she meant to me by sharing memories. I can only skim the surface now in the wake of the horror and the anger, and work through the rest alone in the weeks and months to follow.\n\"Sarah was open. Honest. Unflinching in her ability to listen and empathise. There are some people you know for a relatively short time, but whom you instantly strike up a close bond with due to your similarities - Sarah was one of these people. We shared a lot, and I was never in any doubt of her discretion or sincerity in her support and kindness. We laughed, we cried. We talked about the future. \n\"She should be here.\"\nA simple post on Facebook on 14 June said: \"Happy Birthday Sarah Everard. I miss you today, and every single day\".\nWhen she was taken, Ms Everard was less than a mile from her flat in Brixton. The killer had been cruising around for more than four hours before he saw her for the first time. Years of predatory behaviour, days of planning, hours of scouting, and mere minutes to trap his prey.\nThis was a decision he made. It was not a frenzied attack in which a person loses self-control. It was cool-headed and clinical. \nInvestigators are looking into the hypothesis he used his police ID card as a means to stop Ms Everard, under the guise of questioning her about Covid restrictions.\nAt any point he could have driven away. \nHe chose not to."

      "text": "A pub and a restaurant have both closed due to scorching temperatures in Wales.\nThe Pipeworks Bar said the heat was \"unbearable\" for staff behind the bar at Pontyclun in Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nThe Stone Crab restaurant in the Welsh seaside resort of Saundersfoot in Pembrokeshire has also shut and said it \"cannot let our staff continue to suffer in this hot weather\". \nMonday was Wales' hottest day of 2021 as 30.9C temperatures were recorded in Cardiff amid an extreme weather alert.\nThe Met Office issued one of its new-style extreme heat weather warnings for the first time for parts of the UK, including larges parts of Wales.\nThe amber warning will be in place until Thursday, when temperatures are expected to peak and could reach 33C (91.4F) in some western areas.\nIn a Facebook statement, the Pipeworks Bar said: \"As well as being too hot outside, it's unbearable behind our bar. \n\"Everything that is keeping the drinks cold is making us even hotter,\" it said, referring to its three fridges.\n\"Plus, masks are just horrid to wear at the moment. So, it's only fair on the staff that we give them a couple of days off... We didn't ever think we would close due to sun.\"\nOwner Simon Cole said he was also thinking of the customer enjoyment when making the decision.\n\"I went there and had a pint on my day off and the pint was warm within five minutes and it wasn't very nice,\" he told BBC Wales.\nHe said as well as the fridges, he had an ice machine which pumped out hot air and there was no air conditioning. Even the outdoor area which has a pergola was \"like a greenhouse\".\nThe temperature inside the bar when he opened up had registered 40C and a bottle of spirits he picked up was hot to the touch.\n\"It's mainly just for our staff to have a break and not have to endure the heat. I think they felt relief,\" he said.\n\"We have great staff. I messaged them at the weekend and they said it was awful.\n\"It's not worth the money to have upset staff. It's [only closing] for a few days.\"\nThe Stone Crab said on Facebook it was \"with a heavy heart and with deep thought\" that they have closed until Friday due to the Met Office's extreme temperature weather warnings.\n\"We cannot in good knowledge let our staff continue to suffer in this hot weather,\" their statement said.\n\"We have already been under significant pressure whilst working due to this heat wave, and the new warnings that have come out this evening make it unsafe for our staff to work, let alone the hours that we are all working due to staff shortages in the area.\"\nUnder UK law, there is no legal right to leave work when workplaces hit a certain temperature.\nHowever under the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992, employers have a legal obligation to provide a \"reasonable\" temperature in the workplace, although that does not mean they have to provide air conditioning, for example.\nBy 14:00 BST on Tuesday, Cardiff had recorded the highest temperature in Wales at 30.2C, with Usk in Monmouthshire and Llysdinam in Powys both registering 29.3C, the Met Office said.\nThe highest temperature of the year in Wales was set on Monday in Cardiff at 30.9C, and could still be beaten on Tuesday as temperatures are still rising.\nHealth services have issued advice to the public on how to stay cool and safe in the heat.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service declared a business continuity incident - where service is at risk of being disrupted - because of pressure on its services and asked people to think carefully before calling an ambulance.\nIt said the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, coupled with the warm weather and an influx of holidaymakers and day-trippers to Wales, meant it was facing a busy summer period.\nCardiff and Vale University Health Board said its emergency unit remained very busy and asked people not to attend unless it was life-threatening but to ring for an appointment instead.\nHywel Dafydd, consultant plastic surgeon at Morriston Hospital's Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery, warned people to be very careful in the hot weather, especially in regard to protecting children.\n\"The UV index is very high at the moment, and so the risk of getting severe damage from the sun in the form of sunburn is very, very high and it will happen very quickly,\" he told BBC Wales.\n\"My advice primarily is to stay out of the sun, particularly in the height of the sun between the hours of 11am and 3pm, and if you do have to be in the sun then protect yourself by wearing high factor sun screen such as factor 50 and cover up by wearing long-sleeved light cotton or linen-type shirts, wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect your face, and sunglasses.\"\nHe said children who got a severe blistering sunburn before the age of 10 doubled their risk of getting melanoma skin cancer, which was more prevalent among people aged 16-30.\nExcess heat was also affecting transport.\nNetwork Rail said three watchmen were on the lines to monitor temperatures since early morning and had identified three places where speed restrictions were needed, including Llanbister in Powys, where trains were running at 20mph."

      "tags": "United Arab Emirates,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Billionaire and long-time Donald Trump ally Thomas J Barrack has been arrested in Los Angeles for allegedly acting as an agent of a foreign government.\nThe 74-year-old investment firm founder served as a key adviser to the former US president's 2016 campaign, and was considered a top fundraiser.\nMr Barrack is accused of illegally lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates during and after the campaign.\nA spokesman for Mr Barrack said he planned to plead not guilty.\nHe is the latest ex-Trump official to face federal charges.\nMr Barrack is charged with conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making multiple false statements to the FBI during a 2019 interview.\nAlso charged are Matthew Grimes, 27 - who works for Mr Barrack - and UAE citizen Rashid Sultan Rashid Al Malik Alshahhi, 43, according to the seven-page indictment. \nActing Assistant Attorney General Mark Lesko said the conduct alleged in the indictment was \"nothing short of a betrayal\" of US officials including Mr Trump himself.\nThe three men are accused of seeking to advance the interests of the UAE government both by influencing Trump officials and through media appearances.\nIn May 2016 Mr Barrack is alleged to have inserted language praising the UAE into a Trump campaign speech. An advanced draft of the speech was allegedly sent to Mr Alshahhi to pass on to UAE officials. \nThe defendants are also alleged to have received \"talking points\" from senior UAE officials for use in media appearances.\n\"After one appearance in which Barrack repeatedly praised the UAE, Barrack emailed Alshahhi, 'I nailed it... for the home team,' referring to the UAE,\" the charging document states.\nThe men also allegedly agreed to promote the candidacy of a UAE-favoured individual to serve as US ambassador to Abu Dhabi.\nIn December 2016 - following the election - Mr Barrack is also alleged to have advised Mr Grimes and Mr Alshahhi to create a \"wish list\" of US foreign policy items that the UAE wanted to see accomplished during the Trump administration. \nWhile Mr Barrack and Mr Grimes were both arrested in California on Tuesday morning, Mr Alshahhi remains at large.\nWith the announcement, Mr Barrack becomes the latest Trump aide to face criminal charges, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump Organization lawyer Michael Cohen.\nDonald Trump may be out of office, but members of his inner circle are still in the prosecutorial cross-hairs. Tom Barrack is just the latest target.\nIt's difficult to overstate Barrack's ties to Trump over the course of their four-decade friendship. He was instrumental, for instance, in convincing then-candidate Trump to hire Paul Manafort as his campaign manager and helped fill out senior staff positions.\nNow, like Manafort and other Trump associates, Barrack faces accusations of using his ties to Trump to advance the interests of a foreign government.\nIt's yet another indication that during Trump's campaign and the early days of his presidency, nations sought to take advantage of the novice nature of Trump's political team to gain influence over US foreign policy - both above the table and under it.\nBarrack and Trump reportedly have had a falling out, but their ties run deep. If he wants to talk about Trump's past activities, prosecutors may be inclined to listen."

      "tags": "Robert Buckland",
      "text": "The government is pressing ahead with plans to limit how the public can legally challenge official decisions, despite fears it will damage justice. \nThe Ministry of Justice says its legislation to reform judicial review will save money and court time. \nCritics call it an attempt to stop scrutiny of bad decisions. \nJudicial review most famously led to the Supreme Court's judgement that Prime Minister Boris Johnson unlawfully closed down Parliament ahead of Brexit. \nAny decision taken by a public body can be challenged in a judicial review before a High Court judge - and the power is used daily to examine whether officials are following the laws set by Parliament governing their work. \nRecent examples include a challenge to exam grades being set by algorithms in England - the threat of which contributed to a government U-turn - and the blocking of the release of the so-called \"black-cab rapist\" John Worboys. \nBut critics of judicial review say the wide-ranging right to bring cases has led judges to go beyond their role in upholding the law and into taking political decisions that should be left to Parliament. \nUnder the proposals, ministers say reforms will prevent the courts from being abused and give judges new powers over how they implement decisions that go against the government. \nJudges will have clearer powers to delay when and how public bodies must act to correct their unlawful actions - and they could even rule that they do not have to retrospectively apply it to the unlawful action that led to the case in the first place. \nThe bill will also ban a particular type of last-ditch judicial review seen in immigration cases.\nRobert Buckland, Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, said the Judicial Review and Courts Bill would create a better balance between the rights of citizens and effective government.  \n\"The government has pledged to ensure that the courts are not open to abuse and delay,\" he said. \n\"Today we are delivering on that commitment. We are giving judges the powers they need to ensure the government is held to account, while tackling those who seek to frustrate the court process.\"\nOne of the government's most controversial proposals was to explicitly prevent judges from examining entire types of decisions, which could have led to ministers gaining wide-ranging immunity from legal action. \nWhile that explicit proposal has been abandoned - the bill keeps the idea alive by introducing a way to create so-called \"ouster clauses\" at a later date. \nStephanie Boyce, president of the Law Society, which represents solicitors, said that while ministers appeared to have heeded some concerns, the proposals could still weaken checks and balances on power. \n\"There is a great deal here that should ring alarm bells for people who come up against the might of the state,\" she said.\n\"Removing or limiting the retrospective effect of an order would mean that nobody who has been a victim of an unlawful state action - not even the person who brought the challenge - would benefit from a ruling that the government had behaved unlawfully.  \n\"This would have a chilling effect on justice.\"\nA type of court case that allows members of the public to challenge the legality of a government decision."

This is the fourth time the Labour leader has had to self-isolate since the pandemic began.\nIn the House of Commons, Sir Keir described a \"summer of chaos\" amid soaring numbers of people self-isolating at home.\nThe Labour leader dubbed Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is himself self-isolating at his country house in Buckinghamshire - the \"Chequers one\" as he mocked Mr Johnson's isolation in the same week that most remaining curbs were lifted in England.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Sir Keir said: \"Everything may be calm from the prime minister's country retreat but back here the truth is we're heading for a summer of chaos.\"\nAppearing virtually at PMQs, Mr Johnson urged people to stick with self-isolation rules ahead of changes next month because it is \"a vital tool in our defence\".\nHe added: \"I apologise to everybody in business up and down the land in all kinds of services, public sector or otherwise, who are experiencing inconvenience.\"\nMore than half a million alerts telling people to self-isolate were sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the first week of July, with supermarkets saying they may have to cut opening hours or shut shops due to a lack of staff.\nBusinesses have warned of increasing staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app. Iceland and Greene King said on Monday they had had to shut shops and pubs as a result.\nBusiness lobby group the CBI has warned that the problem could hamper the economic recovery.\nThe government has said it is \"crucial\" for people to quarantine after being \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid-19 app.\nFollowing news on Saturday that Sajid Javid had tested positive and been in contact with Mr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, No 10 said a workplace pilot scheme would allow them to keep working from Downing Street.\nBut the announcement met with an angry response, with opposition parties saying it suggested there was \"one rule for them and another for the rest of us\".\nThe prime minister and chancellor later announced they would complete a period of isolation.\nSpeaking in a video on Twitter after the U-turn, Mr Johnson said: \"We did look briefly at the idea of us taking part in the pilot scheme, which allows people to test daily, but I think it's far more important that everybody sticks to the same rules and that's why I'm going to be self-isolating until Monday 26 July.\""

      "text": "The backlog of surgery and procedures across Scotland caused by the pandemic could take years to tackle, the chief executive of NHS Grampian has said.\nProf Caroline Hiscox said waiting lists were currently the longest since records began, with Covid disruption expected to continue.\nAberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI) and Dr Gray's in Elgin have been among several hospitals at capacity in recent weeks.\nThey have been dealing with a rise in patients and staff absences.\nProf Hiscox spoke to BBC Scotland about how the hospital service had been affected by the virus, and what plans are in place to aid the recovery.\nShe said: \"The modelling that we have is looking at lots of different scenarios.\n\"So, locally and nationally, we are working really closely with other boards and the Scottish government to understand what is the recovery programme for surgery.\n\"And also, how does that need to look different to allow us to recover waiting lists that are bigger than we have ever seen before in NHS Scotland since we started recording them.\n\"We are definitely not talking weeks or months, we are talking years to be able stabilise and recover and redesign our approach to surgery in NHS Scotland.\"\nARI and Dr Gray's were placed on \"code black\" status earlier this month, having reached full capacity.\nIn recent days, a \"small number\" of staff - nurses and healthcare support workers - have been released from the vaccination programme to provide additional support at Dr Gray's.\nAsked how long that situation could continue, Prof Hiscox said: \"I think if I had the answer to that I would be a very fortunate chief executive and I think that's one of the challenges in regard to the situation that we are facing.\n\"So I try to avoid the use of language such as crisis, but actually I'm sure some colleagues would concur with that view.\n\"This is a combination of, yes, the third wave of Covid, but also the backdrop of a health and care sector that has been working relentlessly for 18 months.\n\"And we are now experiencing demands on our system that we would normally experience in the winter months. They are tired.\"\nShe described the \"heroic\" workforce as the health service's \"greatest asset\", but the \"greatest vulnerability\" at the same time.\n\"Let's make no bones about it, before Covid our workforce was fragile in regards to our vacancies and our ability to recruit and retain in the north east\", Prof Hiscox said. \n\"During wave one and wave two we had an additional 1,000 staff came to work with us, which was tremendous. The rest of the country is remobilising, so these people have gone back to do what they need to do.\n\"On top of the underlying vacancies, this is the school holidays - I feel very strongly that our health and care staff need to have their annual leave like everyone else. It's critically important they get some recuperation time. On top of that, we have the additional loss of those who are isolating.\""

It has been looking for a new home for 25 years.\nUpon learning of Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick opting not to intervene in the council's planning process, Everton said it was a \"momentous day\".\nMr Jenrick decided there was no need to \"call-in\" the application, the ministry spokesman added.\nFans, former players and supporter groups expressed their \"delight\" at the news on social media and said it was \"a huge day\".\nThe club's longest serving captain, Kevin Ratcliffe, said it had been a \"long time coming\" and \"at one stage it would seem like it would never happen\".\nHe said the stadium would be a \"great masterpiece for Liverpool\" although he admitted \"it will be heartbreaking for some fans to leave Goodison Park, but it is a ground that is ageing.\"\nNick Mernock of the independent Everton's Fans Forum, which was involved in consultations over the stadium, said his overwhelming reaction was \"relief\". \n\"We recognise it is bigger than just football as it will be a fundamental regeneration for a large piece of unloved land,\" he said. \nHe said the fans' main priority was that its design could recreate the \"atmosphere of Goodison Park.\"\nFootball finance expert, Keiron Maguire, from the University of Liverpool, said the stadium would be a \"game-changer\" for increasing the club's revenue.\nThe new stadium will be situated within developer Peel's \u00a35.5bn Liverpool Waters site.\nThe director of development for the site, Darran Lawless, said the firm was \"delighted\" with the decision.\nHistoric England, which had objected to the new stadium on the grounds it could harm the city's heritage, said it understood \"the strength of feeling for the stadium among many Liverpudlians and respect the process which has led to this decision\". \nCLARIFICATION - 28 March 2021: The original version of our article stated Everton had \"received final approval\" from the government.

      "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron is one of several world leaders believed to have been targeted for phone hacking using spyware, media reports say.\nThe software, known as Pegasus, infects phones and allows operators to spy on their targets. \nThe leaders are on a list of some 50,000 phone numbers of people believed to be of interest to clients of Israeli-based firm NSO Group. The list was leaked to major news outlets.\nNSO denies any wrongdoing.\nIt says the software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists.\nIt says it is made available only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies with good human rights records. \nThe original investigation which led to the reports - by Paris-based NGO Forbidden Stories and the human rights group Amnesty International - was \"full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories\", the Israel-based group said.\nThe reports are part of a series of news articles suggesting thousands of prominent people have been targeted.\nFrench newspaper Le Monde reports that Moroccan intelligence services identified a phone that Mr Macron had been using since 2017. \nMorocco has denied being a client of Israeli manufacturer of Pegasus.\nBeing on the list does not mean that the software was used but it does mean that the person was a potential target. \nIt is not clear if the software was ever installed on the French president's phone. \nNumbers on the leaked list are also said to include those of President Baram Salih of Iraq and South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa, as well as the current prime ministers of Pakistan, Egypt and Morocco, and the King of Morocco.\nMore than 600 government officials and politicians from 34 countries are on the list.\nThe French presidency said that if the revelations were true, they would be very serious. \nForeign leaders are always a top target for spies - intercepting their communications means uncovering their intentions and secrets. \nPoliticians and officials know they are frequently targeted but when this becomes public it can cause real fall-out.\nEspecially because it is not always just a country's adversaries who are involved. \nBack in 2013, it emerged that America's NSA was potentially tapping dozens of world leaders - including ally German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone, causing severe embarrassment and a fairly hefty diplomatic row.\nWhat is notable about the latest reports is that the possibility of carrying out surveillance against foreign leaders is now potentially for sale and available to a much wider range of states. \nIt is not clear how many of those on this list were actually targeted but even the possibility will do much to raise the pressure on NSO Group - and the governments who might have targeted other leaders.

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "A Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, is at the centre of a dispute between the UK and the European Union (EU).\nSince it came into force at the start of 2021 the protocol has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested it could suspend parts of the arrangement by triggering part of the protocol known as Article 16.\nThe protocol allows lorries to deliver goods without having paperwork and goods checked when they cross the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.\nThis arrangement was easy to maintain before Brexit. When both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, they automatically followed the same EU trade rules, which meant no checks were required.\nHowever, a new arrangement was needed after Northern Ireland (along with the rest of the UK) left the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods, such as milk and eggs, arrive from non-EU countries. Similar rules exist in other areas, such as medicine licensing. \nTo try to get round the problem the UK and the EU negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is now part of international law.\nRather than checks taking place along the Irish border, it was agreed any inspections and document checks would take place between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) instead.\nThis was allowed after it was agreed that Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on product standards (part of the EU's single market rules). \nChecks on GB goods take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, this has led to criticism that a new trade border has effectively been created in the Irish Sea. \nUnionists are strongly opposed to the checks because they don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nAlso, not all checks under the protocol have been fully implemented yet. For example, supermarkets had reduced paperwork required under a temporary \"grace period\". However, the UK decided to extend these periods - something the EU said was a breach of international law. \nDespite signing up to the agreement in 2019, the UK government now says the protocol represented a huge compromise by the UK and has accused the EU of applying it too rigidly.\nThe UK is calling for changes, which include:\nArticle 16 is a set of three paragraphs in the protocol that allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss - now the UK's lead Brexit negotiator - said she would trigger Article 16 if the UK failed to secure changes.\n\"I want a negotiated solution but if we have to use legitimate provisions, including Article 16, I am willing to do that,\" she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\nIf the UK went down this route, it could prompt the EU to respond with measures that would impose tariffs (or import taxes) on aspects of trade between the two sides.\nThe EU has warned that any such move would \"lead to instability and unpredictability\".\nThe EU has set out proposals, but says a renegotiation of the text of the Protocol is out of the question:\nIn return, the EU wants extra safeguards to prevent products from Great Britain crossing into the Republic of Ireland.\nThe border is a sensitive issue because of the history of Northern Ireland and the agreements made to bring peace, which included the removal of visible signs of the border.\nThe fear is that if any infrastructure were to be installed, such as cameras or border posts, it could become a target and lead to political instability.\nDuring negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority."

I partner because I want to progress the work I do off the pitch and most of any fee I would receive contributes to that.\n\"Last summer, 1.3M children had access to food support, through my relationship with Burberry children have a safe place to be after school where they will be fed, following the November investment vulnerable children have safe places to go this summer holiday, and due to my relationship with Macmillan 80,000 children now have a book to call their own.\n\"Do I have a larger commercial appeal following the U-turns? I'm sure. But I'm also a Manchester United and England international footballer. Why has there always got to be a motive? Why can't we just do the right thing?\n\"I actually enjoy reading bits from The Spectator now and again but this is just a non-starter.\"\nRashford, who received free school meals himself, was made an MBE in the delayed 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours List.  \nA mural honouring the footballer was vandalised with graffiti following England's defeat to Italy in the Euro 2020 final.\nHundreds of heartfelt notes were later placed on the artwork in Withington, Manchester.\nHe was was targeted with racist abuse on social media after the game along with Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka, who also missed a penalty.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Stay-at-home orders are now in place in South Australia, Victoria and parts of New South Wales.\nMany people have expressed frustration at being back in highly policed lockdowns 18 months into the pandemic. \nAnd re-openings in the UK and the US have put pressure on the government.\nFewer than 14% of people are vaccinated - the worst rating among OECD nations.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has been heavily criticised over the slow vaccination rate, but has resisted calls to apologise.\n\"No country has got their pandemic response 100%,\" he told reporters on Wednesday.\nHe again mentioned Australia's success in keeping overall infections low compared to those in many nations.\n915 people have died of Covid in Australia.

      "text": "Scotland's justice secretary says he would not shy away from \"radical\" reforms if they would improve conviction rates on sex crimes.\nKeith Brown said proposals for specialist sex crime courts and the abolition of the not proven verdict would need to go out to consultation.\nBut he said major changes could be brought in if consensus is reached.\nHis comments came after a visit to The Meadows centre for victims of sexual assault at Larbert near Falkirk.\nThe specialist facility was set up by NHS Forth Valley after the Scottish government decided that forensic examination suites should be moved out of police stations and into the community. \nEarlier this year, a review group led by Lord Justice Clerk Lady Dorrian suggested there should be specialist courts to deal with the most serious sex crimes. \nThe group also said consideration should be given to holding trials with a single judge instead of a jury.\nMr Brown said: \"If you were to change the law on corroboration, if you were to change the law on jury sizes, none of those things can be achieved without taking forward primary legislation.  \n\"That involves a lot of consultation, talking with partners, talking in the parliament as well.  It needs to be a long and profound process to make sure we get it right.\"\nScottish government figures show that from 2019 to 2020 there were 2343 rapes or attempted rapes reported. Of the 300 prosecutions that followed, just 130 resulted in guilty verdicts.\nOnly 43% of rape and attempted rape trials result in a conviction, compared to an overall conviction rate of 88%\nMr Brown said: \"The very low conviction rates suggest we'll have to do something quite different in order to improve that, if we're to serve the victims sufficiently well.\n\"We should not shrink away, if that's what's required, from possible radical action.\"\nDuring the Holyrood election campaign in April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggested it was time to consider ending the \"not proven\" verdict. \nThis is expected to win broad political support, but some lawyers regard the verdict as a safeguard against miscarriages of justice.  \nMr Brown added: \"It's something that's been the subject of consultation in the past, but it's quite clear there are different views on it.\n\"It's right to draw it into this area of work because it all hangs together - not proven, corroboration, the size of juries. We will take our time to consider that.\n\"I think we have to do something quite radical in this situation.\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives' shadow community safety minister Russell Findlay said there was no need to consult further on the so-called third verdict.\nHe said: \"Yes, we need to be careful, but the debate about not proven has been raging for years. \n\"There appears to be a political consensus, there appears to be a consensus for those representing victims of sex crimes, that the time is now. We should fix this wrong and improve the system.\"\nThe Law Society of Scotland said it would support change \"that brought meaningful improvement for complainers and witnesses... provided the rights of an accused person are preserved\".\nIts president, Ken Dalling, said: \"It will be essential to consider the full implications of any future proposals for reforming the criminal justice system.\n\"The not proven verdict, which has been the subject of much debate, is a long-standing part of the justice system and great care will be needed in considering any proposals for its removal.\"\nMeanwhile, the justice secretary also praised The Meadows centre as a \"beacon\" of the model he would like to see across Scotland.\nAt the facility, victims can be examined by medics, interviewed by police and supported by nurses and voluntary organisations. \nPolice say it helps provide a safe and comfortable environment for people reporting sex crime.\nMr Brown added: \"To enable victims to come forward, it is vital that they are treated with compassion, respect and are properly supported from the moment any sexual assault is reported.\""

      "text": "The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland.\nThe government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. \nBrexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the \"fabric\" of the UK.\nThe EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal. \nThe checks are included in the Northern Ireland Protocol, a section of the Brexit deal designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland.\nLord Frost called on the EU to look on the UK's proposals with \"fresh eyes,\" adding: \"We cannot go on as we are.\"\nHowever, he announced the UK would not be triggering Article 16 of the protocol - which would allow it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal - before talks with Brussels. \nHe added that the government believed using it was justifiable, but said: \"Nevertheless, we have concluded that it is not the right moment to do so.\"\nLord Frost told the House of Lords there was a \"growing sense in Northern Ireland we have not found the right balance, seen in an ongoing febrile political climate, protests and regrettable instances of occasional disorder\".\nHe also called on the EU to agree a \"standstill period\" to prevent a ban on sending chilled meat products such as sausages from Great Britain coming into force in September, when the full terms of the deal kick in.\nHe later told reporters it was \"perfectly normal to change treaties in the light of experience, and it happens all the time\".\nIn a 28-page document, the UK government suggested changes to:\nThe protocol was agreed to prevent the return of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, as both the UK and EU want to prevent any return to the Troubles, which lasted 30 years and cost more than 3,500 lives.\nUnder its terms, Northern Ireland effectively remains part of the EU's single market for goods, meaning it complies with standards set by Brussels.\nThe biggest practical difficulty, in trade terms, concerns the movement of food from Britain to Northern Ireland, which could then be transported into the EU via the Irish land border.\nThe prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the protocol had been a \"fudge\".\nBoth sides had wanted to \"sign up to something that was not what either side really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future to figure out later\", he added.\nEuropean Commission Vice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the EU was willing to \"seek creative solutions within the framework of the protocol\" to ease border issues. \nBut he added the 27-member union would not agree to a \"renegotiation\" of the Brexit deal.\n\"Respecting international legal obligations is of paramount importance,\" he added. \nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: \"We welcome the acceptance from the government that the protocol is not working, that it is causing real harm to our economy in Northern Ireland and it is simply not sustainable.\"\nHe called the UK government's statement - and its publication of a command paper describing its demands - an \"important first step\".\nHowever, Sinn Fein Brexit spokesperson Declan Kearney called on the UK government to \"stop the evasion\" and \"get on\" with implementing the deal it agreed.\n\"It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation,\" he added. \nIndustry group Manufacturing NI said the UK's proposals would create \"confusion and uncertainty for business\" and were likely to \"create conflict with the EU\".\nIt called on the EU to \"go further to ensure the UK's market works for business and consumers in Northern Ireland\".\n\"Both parties owe it to the people in Northern Ireland to skip the drama and get on with dialogue and decision making,\" the body added. \nFor Labour, Brexit spokeswoman Baroness Chapman urged the government to \"fix the problems the prime minister created\".\n\"Communities are tired of these games and the political stalemate,\" she added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

It wants workers to spend some time in the office and some time at home. \nA wholesale \"mass return\" to offices next week could risk pushing up infection levels, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on 19 January, Boris Johnson said that the government was no longer asking staff to work from home.\nHe said people \"should now speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office\". \nThe government had reintroduced its guidance to work remotely when it tightened Covid regulations on 8 December to help tackle the spread of Omicron. \nHowever, that guidance did also say that people should continue travelling to work if they needed \"to access equipment necessary for their role, or where their role must be completed in person\".  \nEmployers were also told to consider letting people come to work if they had a \"challenging home working environment\".\nIn Northern Ireland, ministers said that more people working from home would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they didn't tell employers to impose home working, but instead asked them to support it \"where possible\".\nIn Wales, employers are also encouraged to let people work from home where possible. Guidance says staff should not be \"required or placed under pressure to return\" to the workplace unless there's a clear business need. Employers could be fined up to \u00a310,000 for failing to allow staff to work from home where it is \"reasonably practicable to do so\".\nFrom 28 January, the requirement to work from home moves from law to guidance. \nLatest figures suggest that 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home in 2020, up from 27% the previous year.\nIn the last week of November 2021, seven in 10 travelled to work at least once. \nIn the same week, one in seven said they had been working at home and travelling to work.\nAlthough social distancing limits no longer apply across most UK workplaces businesses still have a legal duty to manage the risks to staff and customers. \nEmployers must follow official safety guidance and carry out Covid risk assessments for those staff who are in the office. \nSafety measures can include:\nFace-coverings remain mandatory for staff and customers in shops and on public transport across the UK, apart from England, where they will cease to be required in any public space on 27 January. \nRegular lateral flow testing remains widespread across the NHS and other parts of the public and private sector.\nNorthern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have already introduced Covid passport schemes which are partly designed to protect staff who work in hospitality and events. \nHowever, England will scrap its mandatory Covid certification scheme from Thursday 27 January, although venues will be able to keep checking customers' status on a voluntary basis if they wish. \nThere is more detailed advice for some industries - including construction, hospitality and manufacturing, plus specific advice for employers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIf employees feel unsafe, they can raise concerns with their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). \nWorking from home is one of the most effective ways to reduce social exposure, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nIt greatly limits face-to-face contact both with colleagues and on public transport.\nAs such, Sage says it has a \"strong impact\" against virus transmission and the R number, which represents a disease's ability to spread.\nMuch of the risk depends on how crowded it is and your distance from other people.\nWearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible."

It wasn't healthy.\"\nHe added: \"There was domestic abuse on my part, and I ended up doing a couple of prison sentences. I wouldn't let my father come in and see me in prison because I was ashamed. \n\"I can only imagine how it must have affected my exes. Even though we were both into drugs and drink, they trusted me.\n\"For me to break that trust because of my own mixed-up mental state must have been heart-breaking for them. \n\"It wasn't until my last sentence that I had time to straighten out my head. Being in prison, being stuck behind that door, it gives you a lot of thinking time and I just had to better myself.\n\"I did a few courses in prison and picked up a few tools that helped me deal with things. This course [with Barnardo's] was like a refresher - I also learnt a lot more. There's no judgement, they don't hold anything against me.\n\"Every relationship has little niggles, but we can read each other like a book, we both know when to give each other a bit of space.\"\nMike has recently had his first child with his new partner, Emma - we've changed both their names to protect their children.\nWhile theirs is a healthy relationship, Emma previously experienced domestic abuse with the father of her older children, who were taken into care as a result of the violence at home.\n\"All I ever wanted was for them to be children,\" she said.\n\"Caring for them was no problem but trying to stop them seeing the stuff they shouldn't see - domestic abuse, physical, verbal - it was hard. Especially when the perpetrator only wanted to do it in front of the children.  \n\"I found myself begging for him to stop, but I think he thrived off seeing me panic.  \n\"You feel like it's your fault. How could I have let myself be so weak? How can the father of my children do that to me and to them?\"\nShe explained the turning point came when she started being honest with her social workers about what was going on, as she'd previously tried to protect her children by dealing with it alone.\n\"I've come through it with help and support from this project. I'm not a victim anymore, I'm a survivor,\" said Emma.\n\"There's never been any domestic abuse between me and my partner, but he's obviously had situations like that in the past. \n\"He has techniques now, and knows support is there. It gives me that confidence that I'll never have to be frightened again. And I know what to look out for, how to deal with it, what to do, who to call.\"\nSince completing the opening \"Closed Doors\" project with Barnardo's Cymru, Emma and Mike's baby is no longer on a child-protection plan with their local social services and Emma hopes one day to have her older children back home.\n\"[Barnardo's] have worked brilliantly with my kids,\" she said.\n\"My son is a different child. It makes me happy how happy they are now, because they're not in an environment that's bad for them.\" \nMike added: \"My little boy is a blessing. I'd go to the end of the world for him. He's like the reward I get for turning my life around and motivation to keep everything on track. \n\"Now, I've got little eyes on me and I've got to make sure I set a good example for him.\"\nThe project has been given funding for a second year by the Home Office and has worked with more than 500 families across Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen, Monmouthshire and Caerphilly.\nResults show three-quarters of the children are now in safer, more stable homes.\nAn evaluation by the Institute of Care at Oxford Brookes University found it had a positive impact on families.\nIn almost half of cases, involvement from social services had been reduced - and 95% of children's case files showed improvement in their emotional health and wellbeing.\nFeedback from parents noted children were less angry, aggressive or violent, while some no longer ran away, wet the bed or self-harmed.\nThe report said recovery is likely to be a long and complex process over a number of years rather than months, but the scheme was worth investing in and rolled out further.\nGeorgia Lagden works as a support worker for perpetrators with Barnardo's Cymru and explained that not all men want to engage at first.\n\"Some of them are in desperate times and want that support. Then I work with some guys who will ignore that it's happening - it's a denial process.\n\"We like to get to know people - these behaviours are learnt somewhere; these people don't just become violent or abusive or controlling and we recognise that.\n\"If they've had childhood trauma - that's quite often the case - we can focus on that and look at how they felt as a child and explain we don't want their children to feel like this. That can be their lightbulb moment.\"\nAs many will also struggle with poor mental health or substance use, a number of factors will have to be addressed.\n\"It's a vital service for all the families that get referred to us,\" she said.\nSam Jenkins is one of the team supporting the victims. \n\"We see lots of changes,\" he said. \"Confidence, self-esteem, better decision-making, more independence and freedom. \n\"It depends on the situation, but some couples stay together and their relationship improves, some people decide they don't want to be in that relationship anymore and move on but we do see a lot of positive outcomes.\""

      "text": "The \u00a320 a week increase in Universal Credit should be permanent, according to senior politicians from across the UK.\nIn a letter, the chairs of four welfare committees from around the UK say removing the temporary top-up would affect families on the lowest incomes.\nAnd sources have also told the BBC that Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey supported keeping the uplift.\nThe government insists the extra \u00a320 is a short-term measure ending in October.\nThe letter calling for the top-up to be made permanent was signed by the chairs of committees at Westminster, the Scottish Parliament, Senedd in Wales and Northern Ireland Assembly. \nThe joint letter from the four committee chairs of the UK's four parliaments is thought to be a first.\nIt is signed by Labour's Stephen Timms at Westminster, the SNP's Neil Gray for Holyrood, Paula Bradley of the DUP for Stormont and Welsh Labour's Jenny Rathbone at the Senedd in Cardiff. \nThey say: \"Ending the uplift would mean that the six million people claiming Universal Credit will lose \u00a31,040 in annual income overnight.\n\"The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has estimated that removing the uplift would force 500,000 people, including 200,000 children, into poverty. \n\"Families on the lowest incomes, those with children and particularly single parents, BAME families, and families where someone is disabled are disproportionately affected.\"\nThey also call for the extra \u00a320 a week to be extended to people on legacy benefits - which were created before universal credit. \nThey warn the chancellor and Ms Coffey: \"You also risk removing this support from families at the very time unemployment is expected to peak, as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme comes to an end.\" \nExtending the uplift would cost around \u00a36bn a year - but the government says spending has to be brought under control after unprecedented emergency interventions during the pandemic. \nMinisters have said the decision to end the additional payment was supported across the government - but several sources have told the BBC that Ms Coffey wanted to maintain it. \nSources said the chancellor resisted that and those close to Rishi Sunak say it was a collective agreement. \nBut Prime Minister Boris Johnson could face a backbench rebellion, with a number of Tory MPs among those concerned about the impact of removing the uplift.\nThey include former work and pensions secretaries and a number of MPs representing constituencies in the north of England. \nThey expect more pressure to be put on the government in September. \nA government spokesperson said: \"Universal Credit has provided a vital safety net for six million people during the pandemic, and we announced the temporary uplift as part of a \u00a3400bn package of measures put in place that will last well beyond the end of the roadmap.\n\"Our focus now is on our multi-billion pound Plan for Jobs, which will support people in the long-term by helping them learn new skills and increase their hours or find new work.\""

      "title": "Why are rape prosecutions falling?",
      "tags": "Sexual violence,Crown Prosecution Service,Reality Check",
      "text": " Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has apologised to rape victims for low conviction rates in England and Wales. \nOver the past five years, cases reported to police - and initially recorded as rape - have risen sharply.\nHowever, the proportion making it to court (prosecutions) in that time has more than halved.\nIn the year to the end of March 2020, 58,856 cases of rape were recorded by police forces in England and Wales. \nThese led to just 2,102 prosecutions, compared with 3,043 in the previous 12 months. \n\"This is devastating news for victims and survivors of rape, and all forms of sexual violence and abuse. There is no disputing how dismal these figures are,\" said Katie Russell from the charity Rape Crisis. \nFrom the point that a crime is reported to the police, to a decision being made in court, there are a number of hurdles that have to be overcome. \nAnd at each stage in the criminal justice system, cases are dropped. \nAs a result, rape prosecutions represent a small percentage of all reported rapes. And an even smaller proportion lead to a conviction - when someone is found guilty. \nSo, what is going on?\nThe police have to gather enough evidence in order to refer a case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) -  the body that conducts criminal prosecutions in England and Wales. \nBut there has been an increase in the amount of evidence to consider, often from phones and social media. This has made these cases more difficult for police, prosecutors and, potentially, victims.\nVictims' commissioner Dame Vera Baird said in her annual report that the level of prosecutions has got so low that \"what we are witnessing is the de-criminalisation of rape\". \nShe said that some victims withdrew their complaints because \"they cannot face the unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into their privacy\". \n\"This is because many will be required to handover their mobile phones, so that the data can be downloaded to see if it has any bearing on a possible criminal prosecution.\" \nIn July 2020, the CPS and police scrapped the digital consent form that people alleging rape had been asked to sign. This form gave full access to their mobile phone data.\nIt followed a court case brought by the Centre for Women's Justice and an investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office.\nThe government review recommends that \"no victim is left without a phone for more than 24 hours, with an ambition that victims have their own phones returned within this period, with replacement phones being provided in a minority of cases\". \nOnce a case is referred to it by the police, the CPS decides whether there is enough evidence to charge a suspect with a crime. Only after this can it go to court.\nIn the year to March 2020, just 1.4% of rape cases recorded by police resulted in a suspect being charged (or receiving a summons).\nThe CPS has been bringing fewer rape prosecutions over the past few years, which is partly due to fewer referrals by police. This is thought to be in part a reaction to a fall in the number of successful convictions.\nThe victims' commissioner's report says: \"Anecdotally, some police officers say the reason they made fewer referrals was precisely because they knew that CPS were prosecuting fewer cases after 2017.\"\nIn November 2019, it was revealed the CPS had previously had a secret conviction rate target, introduced in 2016 - that 60% of rape cases should end in a conviction. It was suggested this may have led prosecutors to drop weaker or more challenging cases.  \nThe CPS called it an \"ambition\" or \"benchmark\" and said it had stopped using it in 2018. \nThe End Violence Against Women Coalition brought a legal challenge, arguing the approach had been unlawful, but it was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 15 March. \nThe CPS has launched a five-year blueprint to make sure offenders of sexual violence are brought to justice.\nMax Hill, director of public prosecutions said: \"It is clear that more needs to be done both to encourage victims to come forward with confidence, and to support them through the criminal justice process so the gap between reports of rape and cases that reach the courts can be closed.\"\nIn Scotland, there was a 43% increase in convictions for rape and attempted rape between 2017-18 and 2018-19.\nIn Northern Ireland the number of crown court cases for rape fell by about a quarter from 2017-18 to 2018-19, although the number of defendants convicted of at least one offence was almost the same.\nThe Justice Secretary was asked about whether government cuts were a factor. \nRobert Buckland said: \"Like all parts of public service, big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case.\" \nThe Institute for Government estimated that the budget of the CPS was cut by 28% between 2009-10 and 2018-19 after adjusting for inflation. \nCPS staff numbers fell too:\nIn August 2019, the government announced an extra \u00a385m funding for the CPS to help it investigate violent crime and deal with the \"explosion in digital evidence\". \nAt the time, the FDA union - which represents CPS lawyers - welcomed the investment but warned that \"it is not enough to undo all the damage that has been done by years of cuts\".\nThis piece was originally published in April 2019, but has been updated to include the latest statistics. It was altered on 24 June 2021 to clarify that the CPS is not funded as part of the Ministry of Justice.    \nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

      "text": "Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from France have to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. \nThe government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. \nFrench authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France.\nBeta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa.\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants.\nThese tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. \nMost are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. \nSome of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations.\nBeta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled \"variants of concern\". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on.\nBeta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. \nAnother mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. \nThere is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people.\nAs with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions.\nVaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. \nThere is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections.\nBut experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary.\nA trial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK.\nSome of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. \nThe Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. \nSo far, the UK has recorded just over 1,000 cases of Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. \nSouth Africa has reported higher cases of Beta.\nWhen it was first identified in the UK, the government recommended surge testing in the community in some regions to help stop the spread. \nA system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. \nAlthough adults who were fully jabbed in the UK now no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. \nThey will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious. \nUK scientists are tracking variants, including Beta, to learn more and are providing genomic sequencing help to other countries so that they can do the same.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused,\" BP said.\n\"Our supply chain has been impacted by the industry-wide driver shortages across the UK, and was exacerbated by the temporary closure of our Hemel Hempstead fuel distribution terminal last week because of necessary Covid-19 isolations amongst staff. The terminal is now operating as normal once again.\"\nLorry drivers are currently in short supply, with the Road Haulage Association estimating a shortfall of about 60,000.\nIt said some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nPreviously, a temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours was met with backlash from the industry who said the government is applying a \"sticking plaster\" to driver shortage problems.\nBP's announcement came as retail industry body the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned supermarkets were experiencing \"minor disruption\" due to a shortage of drivers.\nSome supermarkets are understood to be suffering shortages of particular brands. But while customers may not be able to find the exact product they are after, the same product made by different brands is available.\nThe BRC called on the government to \"rapidly increase\" the number of HGV driving tests taking place.\nThe Department for Transport said it is looking to increase testing capacity.\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said supermarkets were working closely with suppliers to \"ensure consumers still have access\" to the same selection of goods.\n\"Government must rapidly increase the number of HGV driving tests taking place, fill gaps by providing visas for EU HGV drivers, and also look for a longer-term solution to this issue,\" he added.\nSome stores have also reported an increase in workers having to self isolate due to being \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid app, but levels are not said to be near previous peaks in the pandemic.\nOther sectors are also experiencing staff shortages due to workers needing to isolate.\nRoyal Mail said in a \"limited number of areas\" services were being disrupted due to Covid-related absences.\nThe shortages in workers comes as the government announced firms can apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules.\nThe government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be \"considered on a case-by-case basis\".\nHowever, the numbers of those who will be granted exemption outside of the NHS are expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands.\nRod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the government's plan was \"confusing\" and felt like \"it's been rushed\".\nHe said: \"Where do you draw the line on lorry drivers, essential workers, the people in the supply chains? Because most of the people I know in the supply chain would say 'hang on a sec, I'm an essential worker'.\"\nIn a letter to the logistics sector, government ministers said they would consult about \"the delegation of off-road manoeuvres\" as part of the HGV test, which they said would boost testing capacity.\nIt added the Department for Transport would also look to into issuing provisional licences to drive rigid and articulated lorries. \nDowning Street previously said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors."

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer is self-isolating after one of his children tested positive for Covid at lunchtime. His office said Sir Keir had been doing daily tests and tested negative this morning before attending the House of Commons for PMQs. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the chancellor are also self-isolating after contact with the health secretary who tested positive at the weekend. More than half a million alerts telling people to self-isolate were sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the first week of July, with firms warning of rising staff shortages due to people being \"pinged\". \nA breakdown of the numbers of people who died with Covid-19 in care homes across England has been published for the first time. The data, released by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), shows that more than 39,000 care home residents died with the virus between 10 April 2020 and 31 March 2021. Care homes in the North West had the most Covid-related deaths in the pandemic's first wave, while those in the South East were hardest hit in the second. \"Every number represents a life lost,\" said Kate Terroni, CQC chief inspector for adult social care. You can read more about how families and care home staff coped here.\nA union says bad decisions by managers at the DVLA driving licence body have meant a \"catastrophic\" processing backlog of 1.4 million cases. Mark Serwotka, head of the Public and Commercial Services union, told MPs on the transport select committee that if staff were allowed to work from home the backlog could be reduced. The union wants more staff to be able to work from home to allow better social distancing in offices and so that those self-isolating could continue to be productive. Julie Leonard, the DVLA's chief executive, said staff safety had been taken \"incredibly seriously at every point\".\nDozens of councils across England have been forced to suspend bin collections due to staff self-isolating. Most have temporarily paused garden waste pick-ups, but some recycling collections have also been affected. Collections are also being affected by a shortage of HGV drivers unrelated to self-isolation. The Local Government Association said if Covid rates increased further, many would have to prioritise services that protect the most vulnerable.

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Femicide,Women",
      "text": "A vigil is being held a week after the killing of teacher Sabina Nessa, in a park in south-east London.\nHow many women are the victims of violent crimes?\nIn the year to March 2020, 207 women were killed in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). This means about one in four killings were of women. \nThe number of female victims was lower than in the previous year, when 241 women were killed - the highest number in a decade. \nResearch from the Femicide Census - an organisation which collects information on men's violence against women - calculates that across the UK, 1,425 women were killed by men in the 10 years to 2018.\nThat is about one killing every three days. \nIn the past decade, there were 4,493 male victims of killings and 2,075 female victims (31%) in England and Wales.\nMore than nine out of 10 killers were men.\nAbout 57% of female victims were killed by someone they knew, most commonly a partner or ex-partner. This compares with 39% of men. \nThe other victims were either killed by strangers - 13% in the case of women and 30% among male victims - or no suspect has been identified.\nMore than 70% of women were killed in their own home - twice the figure for men.\nIn general, men are more likely to be victims of violence such as assault.\nIt is estimated that about 1.3% of women were victims of violent crime in the year ending March 2020, compared with 2% of men. \nMost violent attacks are by people the victim knows - 92% in the case of women and 79% among men.\nWe don't have statistics which show what proportion of women were attacked by men or other women, but most people found guilty of violent crimes are men. \nIn 2019, about 85% of people sentenced in court for violent crime were men.\nIn the year ending March 2020, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that 4.9 million women had been victims of sexual assault in their lives. This included 1.4 million who had been raped, or had faced attempted rape.\nAbout 989,000 men had experienced sexual assault, including 87,000 victims of rape or assaulted rape.\nIn total, 98.5% of the rapists were identified as men.\nSexual assault was most common among younger women, with about one in 10 women aged 16 to 24 having been a victim in the past year. \nOne in 40 young women said they had been victims of rape in the past year.\nOne in five women has been the victim of stalking since the age of 16 - twice the number for men.\nThe estimates used the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which interviews thousands of people and is seen as the best way of measuring crimes including those not reported to the police. \nThe vast majority of sexual offences do not get solved. In fact, most sexual offences do not even get reported to the police. \nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales shows 151,000 people - including 144,000 women - were victims of rape or attempted rape in the last year for which these figures are available.\nBut just 59,000 rapes were actually reported to the police last year.\nIn the same year, just 1,439 people were actually convicted of rape. This was the lowest number since figures started being released in 2014-15. \nAlmost a third of women tell no-one if they are victims of rape, or attempted rape, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales.\nFewer than one in six report it to the police. This falls to one in 10 women under 25.\nThe most common reasons for not reporting it are embarrassment, thinking the police couldn't help, or thinking they wouldn't be believed. \nOfficial statistics don't provide estimates of how many women face sexual harassment. \nHowever, surveys suggest the problem is common. \nA recent YouGov poll for UN Women found that seven out of 10 women had experienced some form of sexual harassment in public.\nThis number was nearly nine out of 10 for younger women. \nThe survey found: \nAnother YouGov survey, in 2016, found that half of women had been victims of sexual harassment at work, most often through inappropriate comments or touching.  \nLast year, it was estimated that 1.6 million women in England and Wales were victims of domestic abuse. There were 757,000 male victims.\nThese figures include all forms of abuse, including physical, emotional and financial. \nThere was an increase in domestic abuse since lockdowns began in March of last year.\nThere were 444,000 domestic abuse-related crimes - against both men and women - in England and Wales between April and September.\nThis was almost one in five crimes recorded."

      "text": "Dominic Cummings has revealed he discussed ousting Boris Johnson within days of the Conservatives winning the December 2019 election by a landslide.\nThe PM's former chief adviser told the BBC it seemed that, by mid-January 2020, Mr Johnson did not \"have a plan\".\nMr Cummings also alleged the PM's wife Carrie Johnson had tried to influence government appointments.\nBut, despite quitting Downing Street last autumn following a power struggle, he denied being motivated by revenge.\nAsked about Mr Cummings's comments, a government spokesperson said ministers were fully focused on recovery from the pandemic and restoring the economy.\nIn his first major TV interview, Mr Cummings - who ran the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum campaign before working as the prime minister's adviser - told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that:\nThe Conservatives won the 2019 general election with a far better than expected 80-seat Commons majority, after a campaign involving Mr Cummings and other former Vote Leave staff in which they promised to \"get Brexit done\".\nMr Cummings claimed that Carrie Johnson - then Carrie Symonds - had been pleased to have Vote Leave veterans working in Downing Street until then. \nBut he added: \"As soon as the election was won, her view was 'Why should it be Dominic and the Vote Leave team? Why shouldn't it be me that's pulling the strings?'\"\nDominic Cummings: The Interview will be broadcast in the UK on BBC Two at 19:00 BST on Tuesday, and it will be available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds\nMr Cummings said he and his allies began to fear for their positions by January 2020 and started discussing Mr Johnson's future.\n\"[People] were already saying, 'By the summer, either we'll all have gone from here or we'll be in the process of trying to get rid of [Mr Johnson] and get someone else in as prime minister',\" he said.\nDefending the discussions about removing the democratically elected Mr Johnson, Mr Cummings said: \"He [the prime minister] doesn't have a plan, he doesn't know how to be prime minister and we only got him in there because we had to solve a certain problem not because he was the right person to be running the country.\"\nHe also said: \"The situation we found ourselves in is that, within days... the prime minister's girlfriend is trying to get rid of us and appoint complete clowns to certain key jobs.\"\nBad feelings remained within Downing Street, Mr Cummings said, with his relationship with the prime minister effectively broken by July last year.\nFour months later, on 14 November, he quit his government job.\nHis departure also came at a point when the prime minister was \"fed up with the media portrayal of him being a kind of puppet for the Vote Leave team - it was driving him round the bend\", Mr Cummings said.\nA Downing Street spokesperson declined to comment in detail on Mr Cummings's allegations against Mrs Johnson, but said: \"Political appointments are entirely made by the prime minister.\" \nDespite running the successful Vote Leave campaign in the referendum, Mr Cummings said that \"no-one on Earth\" could be certain it had been the right decision to quit the EU.\n\"I think anyone who says they're sure about questions like that has a screw loose, whether you're on the Remain side or on our side,\" he said.\n\"One of the reasons why we won is... we didn't think we were all right and all Remainers were idiots or traitors or anything else.\"\nBut the Leave campaign has come in for criticism over its use during the campaign of a controversial claim that the UK was giving \u00a3350m a week to the EU.\nQuestioned over this, Mr Cummings said it had been a trap \"to try and drive the Remain campaign and the people running it crazy, so they would start arguing about it\".\nUK voters decided by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.\nAsked whether the UK had become more divided and politics more brutal in the years since, and whether he had damaged to the country through his campaigning style, Mr Cummings replied: \"Obviously I think Brexit was a good thing\u2026 I think that the way in which the world has worked out since 2016 vindicates the arguments that Vote Leave made in all sorts of ways. \n\"I think it's good that Brexit happened.\"\nIn recent months, Mr Cummings has written several blogs highly critical of Mr Johnson and attacked his competence and handling of the the pandemic when appearing before a parliamentary select committee.\nBut he denied that doing all this, and agreeing to be interviewed by the BBC, was part of a quest for revenge.\nMr Cummings admitted that people thought of him \"generally as a nightmare\", but said it \"doesn't matter if people are upset\" by attempts to reform government.\n\"A lot of people have a pop at me, but you don't see me crying about it,\" he said.\nHe also revealed that he had not spoken to the prime minister since quitting, having not answered a call from Mr Johnson shortly after he left Downing Street.\nIt did not \"bother me one way or the other\" whether they would speak again, he added. \nMr Cummings was repeatedly challenged throughout his BBC interview to back up his version of events.\nHe said many of his claims about the workings of government would be corroborated if there was a public inquiry into its handling of the Covid pandemic."

      "tags": "Sexual violence,Scottish Parliament election 2021,Nicola Sturgeon,Women",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has said it is time to consider ending the 'not proven' verdict in Scotland's legal system.\nThe first minister said she has changed her view on the matter because of \"mounting evidence\" that the verdict is linked to low conviction rates in rape and sexual assault trials.\nCampaigners against the verdict were galvanised by a case in 2018 when a woman sued a man cleared of raping her.\nSenior figures in all major parties have criticised the verdict.\nMs Sturgeon, who trained as a lawyer at the University of Glasgow, said it had been \"imprinted\" on her brain that not proven was one of the \"totemic\" things that make Scots law distinctive.\nIn an interview with PA Scotland, she said she had perhaps \"had a bit of a lawyers' view\" of the not proven verdict in the past.\nShe added: \"I do think it is time to look at the not proven verdict. The conviction rate for rape and sexual assault is shamefully low. \n\"And I think there is mounting evidence and increasingly strong arguments that the not proven verdict is a part of that. So I think it is something that it is time to look at.\"\nRape Crisis Scotland has led a campaign to scrap not proven since 2018, along with a woman known as Miss M, who successfully sued a man for damages after he was cleared of raping her.\nMiss M claimed she was raped after a night out in St Andrews, when she was an 18-year-old student in 2013.\nStephen Coxen denied the charges against him and in November 2015 a jury in a criminal court gave a not proven verdict.\nBut in 2018, in a case understood to be the first of its kind in Scotland, a sheriff in a Personal Injury Court ruled that Coxen had raped the woman and demanded he pay damages.\nScotland, unlike most of the world's legal systems, has three possible verdicts in criminal cases - guilty, not guilty and not proven.\nThe legal implications of a not proven verdict are exactly the same as a not guilty verdict - the accused is acquitted and is innocent in the eyes of the law.\nNot proven is seen by some as offering additional protection to the accused, ensuring they will not be convicted if the jury has any doubts.\nBut critics argue that it is confusing for juries and the public, can stigmatise an accused person by appearing not to clear them and fails to provide closure for victims.\nA study published in 2019 found removing the not proven verdict might incline more jurors towards a guilty verdict in finely balanced trials. It also found inconsistent views on the meaning of not proven and how it differed from not guilty.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross last week said his party was \"fully committed\" to abolishing the verdict, adding the bill would be the first act of his party in the new parliamentary term.\nHe said a \"disproportionate number of not proven verdicts in rape cases\" which he said \"certainly doesn't deliver for the victim and it still leaves the accused with an uncertain verdict\".\nScottish Green Party co-leader Lorna Slater also pledged to scrap the verdict, citing her party's \"rights-based approach\" to policy.\nShe said: \"Having an ambiguous third option as a possible verdict in criminal trials is confusing for juries and unfair on both complainers and the accused. \nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Scottish Parliament have? MSPs pass laws on most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and welfare benefits. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote?\u00a0Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can\u00a0register to vote online. \n\"Importantly, this verdict is disproportionately used in rape trials where often the victim faces a torrid time in court. That needs to end.\"\nScottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said he sympathised with those who arguing to drop the verdict, adding: \"It is clear though that matters like not proven can't be looked at in isolation. \n\"We have been working with victims' groups and survivors to understand how to make things better.\"\nAnd deputy Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie said: \"Scottish Labour have long believed in the abolition of the not proven verdict and we have brought forward members' bills in the parliament which were blocked by the SNP.\n\"We urgently need to reform our justice system to ensure it protects women and moving to a two verdict system would be one step in the right direction.\""

      "title": "'Catastrophic' backlog at driving licence body, warns union",
      "text": "Decisions made by managers at the DVLA driving licence body have meant a \"catastrophic\" processing backlog of 1.4 million cases, a union says.\nMark Serwotka, head of the Public and Commercial Services union, said if staff were allowed to work from home the backlog could be reduced.  \nHe told Transport Committee MPs other members of the civil service \"were tearing their hair out\" at the DVLA.\nHe said it is a \"stain\" on the reputation of the civil service. \nMr Serwotka said the DVLA are \"refusing to engage in a proper discussion.\"\n\"In 21 years [in this role], I have never encountered the level of incompetence and mismanagement that is on display at the DVLA in Swansea,\" Mr Serwotka told the MPs on Wednesday. \n\"The tragedy of that is not just that public are suffering. Our members, many of whom are quite lowly paid and very stressed at work, are bearing the brunt of this.\"\nMr Serwotka said there had been 643 Covid cases and one fatality at the DVLA during the course of the pandemic and that there are serious risks to staff health and safety because of its actions. \nSarah Evans, the DVLA branch chair at PCS, said that staff are worried as they can see cases rising on site, but that they have been told not to complain. \n\"Our work site is very different because there is a high volume of staff in a small area,\" Ms Evans told the committee. \nThe union wants more staff to be able to work from home to be able to allow for better social distancing in the offices and to allow those isolating at home to still continue to be productive.\nIt said other departments had been able to deliver remote working.\n\"We believe that if the Department of Work and Pensions can deal with three million universal credit claims, if HMRC can deliver furlough scheme, if we have workers in the Home Office,  Ministry of Justice, devolved nations, working from home, handling in some cases much more secure data, so could the DVLA,\" said Mr Serwotka.\n\"We know there can't be a security issue in the DVLA that's not the same in the rest of the civil service.\n\"Weeks and weeks of productivity have been lost by stopping staff working from home,\" said Ms Evans. \"There's no doubt at all that we would not be in situation we are in\u2026 had we been given the capability.\"\nLaura-Louise Fairley says she applied for her driving licence online on 10 June. Nearly six weeks later, she's still waiting. \"It's bad enough when things don't work, but there's no contact point, that's the problem,\" she told the BBC. \n\"A six week wait is not the end of the world, but I don't know if that will turn into a six month wait. Until then, I can't make plans.\"\nMs Fairley applied for a replacement driving licence in order to hire a car to visit family in Buckinghamshire and Berkshire with her daughter. \nShe says she has attempted to reach the DVLA around 30 times, but has only been able to speak to an operator once. On other occasions, she says she was directed to an automated message that then ended the call, and on the website, her request is labelled as being \"in process\".\nA DVLA spokeswoman told the BBC: \"Our contact centre is open during business hours but there are significant delays in contacting us due to ongoing social distancing requirements in Wales which means that we have fewer staff than usual on site at any one time. \n\"We understand this is causing frustration for our customers and we are sorry for the inconvenience.\"\nShe added that demand is currently \"very high\" and staff are working \"extremely hard\" to answer customer queries.\nMr Serwotka added that although it believed there was a lack of investment in technology, the union had been told that it was also because the DVLA was concerned about trust and supervision of staff. \nThe PCS and the DVLA are currently in an industrial dispute that has seen targeted strike action since April where staff in different departments have walked out for a few days at a time. \nThe PCS said that it negotiated a deal after months of discussions that would protect the health of workers and provide respite and recognition of what they had done over the last few months. \nIt said that the agreement was withdrawn on 1 June without an explanation. Baroness Vere of Norbiton, Minister for Roads, Buses and Places, told the committee that the government and DVLA estimated that 400,000 of the backlog is due to the industrial action and that that they were being 'held to ransom' by the PCS union.\nShe said that while the industrial action was undertaken about covid safety, that it was not right that PCS were introducing a bonus and holiday request to end the strikes, and that it was likely that the strike could be settled \"if they took requests for holiday and bonuses off the table\".\nDVLA's chief executive Julie Leonard told MPs it was advisable for people to do their applications online where possible. Paper documentation can take six to 10 weeks, whereas online processing can be sorted \"in days\", she said.\nShe added: \"We have taken staff safety incredibly seriously at every point in this. Had it been easy to have more people working at home, we would have done it. \n\"Staff safety really has come first. It will still come down to if we are receiving 60,000 items of mail, we will still need people on site to open and process those items that are arriving each and every day and that's a real challenge for us.\n\"We are exploring every single option to see how we can increase the numbers who work from home. We are conscious of resilience should this be a difficult winter.\""

      "tags": "UK government,Coronavirus testing,Self-isolation,Paul Scully,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Downing Street has insisted it is \"crucial\" to self-isolate when sent an alert by the Covid app - and businesses should help employees to do so.\nIt comes after business minister Paul Scully said he would encourage people who are \"pinged\" to self-isolate but they can make an \"informed decision\". \nThe app has always been voluntary to download and any alerts are advisory.\nLabour accused the government of \"making it up as they go along\" and creating confusion.\nIn recent days, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption.\nPub chains, supermarkets, transport networks and other businesses have warned of the crippling effect blanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations.\nPeople who are \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid app and told they have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nHowever, anyone contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace - either by phone, text or email - must self-isolate.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported a further 46,558 new daily Covid cases alongside another 96 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMeanwhile, a \"very small\" number of critical workers - including NHS and care staff - could carry on working even if told to self-isolate under a new government scheme.\nIndustry bodies reacted to the plan with dismay, describing it as \"simply unworkable\", amid confusion over how it would operate.\nDowning Street confirmed the first exemptions had been issued under the scheme by government departments.\nNo 10 was unable to say how many people the government will approve for the loosened rules.\nPlans for the fully vaccinated to be made exempt from self-isolation were delayed until 16 August in England, with ministers warning at the time of a huge knock-on for the economy and workplaces, including the NHS. \nIn a BBC interview, Mr Scully was asked whether people should self-isolate if they are \"pinged\". \"I would absolutely encourage people to do that. But they can make an informed decision,\" he replied.\n\"I don't want to have to mandate people and tell people what to do as government any longer than I really have to. \n\"But they do have a responsibility to themselves, to their families and to their communities. It's by doing the right thing that we can keep Covid at bay.\"\nEarlier, he told Times Radio that self-isolating after being told to by the app was a decision for individuals and employers.\n\"It's important to understand the rules,\" he said. \"You have to legally isolate if you are... contacted by Test and Trace, or if you're trying to claim isolation payments. The app is there to allow you to make informed decisions.\"\nThe Times is also reporting that ministers have written to major manufacturers emphasising that staff are not legally obliged to isolate if \"pinged\". Investment minister Lord Grimstone told one large employer the app was only an \"advisory tool\" and that people were not under any \"legal duty\", the paper said.\nFollowing the ministers' comments, Downing Street attempted to clarify the government's position, insisting isolation remained the \"most important action\" people can take to stop the spread of the virus.\n\"Given the risk of having and spreading the virus when people have been in contact with someone with Covid, it is crucial people isolate when they are told to do so, either by NHS Test and Trace or by the NHS Covid app,\" a No 10 spokeswoman said.\n\"Businesses should be supporting employees to isolate, they should not be encouraging them to break isolation.\"\nNow that legal restrictions have been lifted in England, cases of coronavirus will undoubtedly rise further. \nBut a significant number of adults are not yet fully vaccinated. \nIn the meantime, the test and trace system remains the only way the government can contain the virus to a level it deems acceptable. \nSo the message on how closely people should follow the advice to isolate if \"pinged\" by the app is crucial. \nAlthough it's not a legal requirement to do so (only if contacted directly by test and trace) any suggestion that it's up to you, optional, or a judgement call risks undermining the government's entire approach. \nThat's why we saw a junior minister's choice of words was quickly corrected by Downing Street this morning. \nThe rules change next month, allowing double jabbed adults to avoid isolation. \nUntil then the government will have to hope it can keep the public's confidence in the app and its instructions to isolate. \nJohn Edmunds, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said contact tracing and self-isolation should be maintained \"as stringently as we can\".\n\"We have one of the highest rates of cases in the world right now. The NHS has been under strain for a long time and they are busy trying to catch up on operations and are very, very busy. So to put them under more pressure now is going to be awkward,\" he told Times Radio. \nJustin Madders, Labour's shadow health minister, accused the government of \"making it up as they go along\".  \n\"Yet again there is more confusion and incompetence from the heart of government at the expense of public health. They need to get a grip,\" he said. \nWhile the Covid app can only advise people to self-isolate, anyone in England who is called, texted or emailed by NHS Test and Trace must isolate for 10 days.\nFailure to self-isolate for the full time period can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000.\nIn other developments:"

      "title": "Long Covid: What is it and what are the symptoms?",
      "tags": "Long Covid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates about 1.3 million people in the UK have \"long Covid\" - symptoms lasting more than four weeks. \nMost people who catch Covid don't become severely ill and get better relatively quickly. \nBut some have long-term problems after recovering from the original infection - even if they weren't very ill in the first place.\nLong Covid is not fully understood, and there is no internationally-agreed definition - so measures of how common it is or what symptoms are involved vary. \nGuidance for UK health workers describes long Covid as symptoms that continue for more than 12 weeks after an infection which cannot be explained by another cause. \nAccording to the NHS website, these can include:\nBut patient surveys have identified tens and even hundreds of other symptoms. A large study by University College London (UCL) identified 200 symptoms affecting 10 organ systems.  \nThese include hallucinations, insomnia, hearing and vision changes, short-term memory loss and speech and language issues. Others have reported gastro-intestinal and bladder problems, changes to periods and skin conditions.  \nThe severity of symptoms varies, but many have been left unable to perform tasks like showering or remembering words. However these symptoms can have other causes too. \nONS research published in September 2021 found 0.5% of people who tested negative for coronavirus had at least one symptom that lasted for three months, compared to 3% who tested positive. \nThere is currently no standard test, with doctors first ruling out other possible causes for symptoms.\nPeople who are suspected of having it are likely to be tested for other issues first like diabetes, thyroid function and iron deficiency, before being offered a long Covid diagnosis. \nIt is possible that a blood test could become available in the future. \nWe don't yet know for sure.\nIt could be that the initial infection makes some people's immune systems go into overdrive, attacking not just the virus but their own tissues. \nThe virus itself getting into and damaging our cells might explain some symptoms like a loss of smell and taste, while damage to blood vessels could, for example, contribute to heart and lung problems. \nAnother theory suggests that fragments of the virus could remain in the body, possibly lying dormant and then becoming reactivated. \nThis happens with some other viruses, like herpes and the Epstein Barr virus which causes glandular fever. \nHowever, there isn't currently much evidence for this happening with Covid.\nIt's likely there are several different things going on in different people, to cause such a wide range of problems. \nThis is difficult to pin down because doctors only recently started recording long Covid.\nThe latest ONS estimate suggests that about 1.3 million people in the UK have it. Of those, 892,000 (70%) first caught the virus at least 12 weeks ago and 506,000 (40%) at least a year ago.\nThe survey asked nearly 352,000 people to record their own symptoms.\nIt suggests the condition is most common in: \nIn April, the ONS indicated about one in every 10 people with Covid had symptoms lasting at least three months. \nBut in September, it suggested this proportion was one in 40.\nFigures will continue to change as more data is collected, and will vary according to the definitions used. \nChildren are less likely than adults to catch Covid and are therefore less likely to develop long Covid - but some still do. \nHowever, in August 2021 leading experts said they were reassured about the scale of long Covid in young people after the biggest study in the world showed persistent symptoms were less common than feared. \nSome early estimates had suggested as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid.\nA team of researchers, led by the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, investigated more than 200,000 positive cases among 11 to 17-year-olds between September 2019 and March 2020.\nThey think that between 4,000 and 32,000 of those were still experiencing symptoms 15 weeks later. \nWe don't have know how severe the symptoms were, but there was little evidence that children were left bedridden or unable to go to school.\nBut the researchers stressed the risk to young people is \"not trivial\", and said it was vital children get the medical support they need. \nSome reports suggest people who have been vaccinated are less likely to have long Covid. \nVaccination can help prevent people contracting the virus and developing long Covid in the first place.\nIt may also prevent infections \"turning into\" long Covid but this is less clear. \nAbout 90 long Covid assessment centres have been set up across England.\nSimilar clinics have opened in Northern Ireland, while in Scotland and Wales patients are referred to different services by their GPs or other health professionals, depending on their symptoms.\nAt the moment there are no proven drug treatments and the main focus is on managing symptoms and gradually increasing activity. \nStudies on how best to spot, treat and improve the lives of people with long Covid are continuing.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nCancelling the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games - which kicks off with women's softball and football competitions later - is still an option, according to the head of the organising committee. Toshiro Muto says cancellation has not been ruled out and he would be keeping an eye on infection numbers. His comments are at odds with International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach who said on the same day that cancellation was \"never an option\". So far more than 70 people associated with the event have tested positive ahead of Friday's official opening ceremony.\nAnger is growing in Australia as more than 13 million Australians - about half the population - are in lockdown after a third state imposed restrictions to curb a Delta outbreak. South Australia joined Victoria and parts of New South Wales in lockdown on Tuesday. Residents there will endure seven days at home after five infections were found in a country where lockdowns have been highly policed to ensure compliance with rules.\nA new Covid health pass has come into effect in France amid a surge of infections which saw cases rise by another 18,000 in 24 hours. People need proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from Covid to enter most museums and cinemas. This could be extended to cafes, restaurants and shopping malls from August. This pass and compulsory vaccination for all health workers by September has led to protests, with demonstrators vandalising two vaccination centres this week.\nWe've been wearing masks to help stop the spread of coronavirus. But what does the evidence show about the effect of masks and what happens when they are no longer compulsory?

      "text": "More than 200 people in 27 US states are being tracked for possible rare monkeypox infections, health officials say.\nThey fear people may have come in to contact with a Texas man who brought the disease in from Nigeria earlier this month.\nThe man - believed to be the first monkeypox case in the US since 2003 - was taken to hospital but is in a stable condition.\nSo far, no new cases have been found.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  says it is concerned passengers who were on board two flights the man made may have been exposed to the disease.\nHe flew into Atlanta, Georgia from Lagos, Nigeria on 9 July, before taking a flight to Dallas, where he was hospitalised, the CDC said.\nIt said it was working with the airlines to assess \"potential risks to those who may have had close contact with the traveller\".\nBut the chances of the disease spreading on the plane were low because passengers had to wear face masks, it added.\nA CDC spokesperson told the BBC it was \"working with state and local health departments to follow up with individuals who may have been exposed to monkeypox\".\n\"The risk to the general public is thought to be low,\" the spokesperson said, adding that none of the 200 people they were monitoring were thought to be \"high risk\".\nMonkeypox is a rare viral disease from the same family as smallpox, but is much less severe.\nIt occurs mostly in remote parts of central and west African countries, near tropical rainforests. \nThe symptoms include:\nMost cases of the virus are mild, sometimes resembling chickenpox, and clear up on their own within a few weeks.\nMonkeypox can sometimes be more severe, however, with one in 100 cases being deadly, according to the CDC.\nThough rare, the disease has been discovered in the US before. A 2003 outbreak caused 47 confirmed or probable cases, and was linked to rats flown into the country. \nLast month, three cases were identified in the UK."
