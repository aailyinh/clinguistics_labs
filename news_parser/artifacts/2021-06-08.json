      "text": "NHS and care staff in England are so burnt out that it has become an \"emergency\" and risks the future of the health service, MPs have warned.\nA highly critical report said workers were exhausted and overstretched because of staff shortages.\nIt said the problems existed before the pandemic - although coronavirus has worsened the pressures.\nDoctors' and nursing unions welcomed the report, saying it highlighted the stress and anxiety facing staff.\nIt has already been well documented that the NHS is short of staff.\nLast July, the health and social care committee - made up of MPs and chaired by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt - launched an inquiry to look at the issue, including how burnt out NHS staff were.\nIts report, published on Tuesday, said one of the main problems was that there was no accurate forecast of how many staff the NHS needed for the next five to 10 years - something it called \"workforce planning\".\nIt said there needed to be a \"total overhaul of the way the NHS does workforce planning\" - and there should be annual reports published on how many workers the NHS would need for the next five, 10 and 20 years.\n\"It is clear that workforce planning has been led by the funding envelope available to health and social care rather than by demand and the capacity required to service that demand,\" said the report.\nAnd it said that NHS workers needed to know there was a solution on its way to fix the staff shortages.\nLiz Stavacre, an intensive care nurse, said her unit had seen a lot of resignations, including people leaving nursing altogether \"because they're so burnt out and can't deal with it anymore\".\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's been a very difficult year. We're very tired - we're physically tired, we're emotionally tired, and there's very little time to take a break from what's happening.\"\nDr Rosemary Leonard told BBC Breakfast it felt like her GP surgery had been \"under siege\" since the end of lockdown as people were coming in with \"shopping lists of problems and we just don't have the manpower to deal with it\".\nShe said everybody in primary care was working \"incredibly long days\" and was under \"huge, huge pressure\". Asked what would help alleviate the stress, she said: \"It really is manpower.\"\nBefore the pandemic began, the NHS faced shortages of around one in 10 or one in 12 staff, the report said - and there were 50,000 nursing posts unfilled in the UK.\nMeanwhile in adult social care, 7.3% of roles had been vacant during the financial year 2019-20, equivalent to around 112,000 vacancies at any one time, the report heard.\nAccording to the NHS staff survey in 2020, 44% of staff reported feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress in the previous year.\nMr Hunt told the Today programme that a shortage of NHS staff was \"the single biggest problem\" as far as staff well-being was concerned.\nHe said there weren't enough doctors or nurses in \"nearly every medical specialty\" but tackling the issue was \"never enough of a priority\" for the government because the amount of years required to train up staff meant there weren't immediate results.\nHe added that training more doctors and nurses would save money in the long run as it would avoid the need to employ temporary staff which \"ends up costing tax payers much more\".\nMany groups representing doctors have warned that having stressed and unwell staff risks safe patient care.\nThe chairman of the Royal College of GPs, Prof Martin Marshall, said: \"We simply don't have enough GPs or other members of the practice team to meet demand and general practice is only set to get busier as we support our communities' recovery from the pandemic.\"\nAnd Dr David Wrigley from the British Medical Association said: \"Health and care staff suffered stress and work-related anxiety before the pandemic but it is now far more serious and we believe the current level of staff burnout and stress presents a worrying risk to the future functioning of the health and care system and safe patient care.\n\"There's an urgent need to address the severe workforce crisis facing health and care services, and - as called for by the BMA and others - the report also calls for continuous and transparent assessments of workforce shortages and future staffing requirements.\"\nThe RCN's acting general secretary, Pat Cullen, said: \"The unprecedented demand on nursing staff during the pandemic has had a huge impact on their own well-being.\n\"But, as this report shows, the cracks in the systems designed to look after nursing staff appeared years ago.\""

      "text": "TV host Louise Minchin is to leave BBC Breakfast after almost 20 years. \nMinchin first presented the BBC One morning programme in 2001 and became one of its lead presenters in 2012 when production moved to Salford.\nShe told viewers she had loved being on the show but \"it is time I stopped setting my alarm for 03:40\", and is now looking forward to \"lots of lie-ins\".\nShe said she would leave \"some time after the summer\" and would take \"lots of happy memories\" away.\n\"We've had fun times. We've had some incredible guests. I love hearing people's stories, I love being able to tell their stories.\"\nAsked what she would do next, she replied: \"Anybody who watches will be very well aware my passion is endurance sport, and I will absolutely continue to do that. I've got lots of really exciting adventures planned. I'm trying to write a book about that as well.\n\"And I'll continue with my podcast, which is all about the mental and physical benefits of sport and exercise. \n\"And I'll be having lots of lie-ins. That's what I'm most excited about right now.\"\nMinchin's co-host Dan Walker said: \"From a personal perspective, my life will be a lot poorer without you.\n\"You are not only a star, you are fantastic at your job, you're brilliant to work with but you're also a great friend.\"\nActor Stephen Graham, who was a guest on Tuesday's programme, said he was \"devastated\" Minchin was leaving the show. \nThis year will mark 20 years since Minchin presented her first edition of BBC Breakfast as a stand-in host. She later replaced Sian Williams as a full-time member of the team.\nWalker, Naga Munchetty and Charlie Stayt are also in the current line-up of presenters.\nBBC Breakfast editor Richard Frediani said: \"Millions of viewers have regularly woken up with Louise for 20 years and welcomed her and BBC Breakfast into their homes.\n\"We will miss her brilliant journalism, good humour and boundless energy. She has been a tremendous BBC Breakfast colleague on and off screen and will always be a friend to the team.\"\nBBC News director Fran Unsworth said: \"I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Louise for her contribution to BBC News - she is a brilliant presenter and journalist and will be greatly missed by her colleagues and the team in Salford.\"\nIt's not known who will take Minchin's seat on the sofa, but possible names include Sally Nugent, who hosted with Walker earlier this year when Minchin was on leave. \nNugent has been filling in for BBC Breakfast's regular hosts on a freelance basis since 2011 and currently serves as the show's main relief presenter, as well as regularly presenting the show's sport slots.\nOther stand-ins who could be promoted include news correspondent Sima Kotecha and Rachel Burden, who has co-hosted the BBC Radio 5 Live weekday breakfast show since 2011.\nOther contenders could include Tina Daheley, who currently reads the news on Zoe Ball's BBC Radio 2 breakfast show, and business presenter Nina Warhurst.\nMinchin started work for Radio 5 Live in 1998 and presented programmes including Drive and Breakfast. \nBetween 2003 and 2012, she was a regular BBC News Channel presenter.\nShe was also one of the main relief presenters for the BBC News at One until April 2012, when she became a permanent member of the Breakfast line-up alongside Bill Turnbull, Susanna Reid and Stayt.\nDuring her time, she has covered major global news stories including the last three general elections, Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.\nFrom 2008, she also presented a weekday programme called Missing Live along with Rav Wilding, and has also worked for the Latin American section of the BBC World Service, the Today programme and various local radio stations. \nOutside work, Minchin is an amateur triathlete and has competed in the World Triathlon Championships.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "ANOM: Hundreds arrested in massive global crime sting using messaging app",
      "tags": "Organised crime,Mafia,United States,Australia",
      "text": "More than 800 suspected criminals have been arrested worldwide after being tricked into using an FBI-run encrypted messaging app, officials say. \nThe operation, jointly conceived by Australia and the FBI, saw devices with the ANOM app secretly distributed among criminals, allowing police to monitor their chats about drug smuggling, money laundering and even murder plots.\nOfficials called it a watershed moment.\nTargets included drug gangs and people with links to the mafia. \nDrugs, weapons, luxury vehicles and cash were also seized in the operation, which was conducted across more than a dozen countries. This included eight tonnes of cocaine, 250 guns and more than $48m (\u00a334m) in various worldwide currencies and cryptocurrencies.\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the operation had \"struck a heavy blow against organised crime\" around the world. \nEuropean Union police agency Europol described Operation Trojan Shield/Greenlight as the \"biggest ever law enforcement operation against encrypted communication\". \nThe FBI began operating an encrypted device network called ANOM, and covertly distributed devices with the chat app among the criminal underworld via informants.\nThe idea for the operation came after two other encrypted platforms were taken down by law enforcement agencies, leaving criminal gangs in the market for new secure phones. \nThe devices were initially used by alleged senior crime figures, giving other criminals the confidence to use the platform.\n\"You had to know a criminal to get hold of one of these customised phones. The phones couldn't ring or email. You could only communicate with someone on the same platform,\" the Australian police explained. \nAustralian fugitive and alleged drug trafficker Hakan Ayik was key to the sting, having unwittingly recommended the app to criminal associates after being given a handset by undercover officers, police said.\nDubbed the \"Facebook gangster\" by Australian media outlets, Ayik is seen in social media photographs with large tattoos and a muscular physique. Local outlets say he has been living in Turkey since evading arrest, living a luxury lifestyle with a Dutch wife.\nPolice said he was \"best off handing himself into us\" as soon as possible, as he may be in danger himself, having unwittingly helped the FBI with their sting.\nIn total, some 12,000 encrypted devices were used by around 300 criminal syndicates in more than 100 countries. \nThis is a fascinating example of law enforcement, perhaps growing tired of wrangling with US tech giants over accessing encrypted data and locked devices, taking matters into its own hands.\nRunning a sort of WhatsApp platform for criminals is a bold move, and getting bespoke handsets into the hands of the very law-breakers they were trying to catch, was ambitious, to say the least.\nOfficials reportedly took control of a communications firm called ANOM around three years ago, after a convicted criminal promised them access to it in return for a more lenient sentence. The devices were billed as super-secure and had a very specific target market - organised crime groups. \nThe authorities even took advantage of a current trend in Silicon Valley - they charged a monthly subscription for the product.\nOfficers were able to read millions of messages in \"real time\" describing murder plots, mass drug import plans and other schemes.\n\"All they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other, innocent people who are going to be murdered, a whole range of things,\" said Australian Federal Police commissioner Reece Kershaw.\nIn total, some 9,000 police officers around the world were involved in the sting. \nCalvin Shivers of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division said the operation had enabled police agencies to \"turn the tables on criminal organisations\", with intelligence gathered preventing murders and a number of other crimes.\n\"We were actually able to see photographs of hundreds of tons of cocaine that were concealed in shipments of fruit,\" he said. \nStatements from law enforcement agencies did not name any of those arrested in the sting. \nIn Australia, 224 people were arrested including members of outlaw motorcycle gangs, mafia groups, Asian crime syndicates, and serious and organised crime groups.\nPolice said they also seized three tonnes of drugs and A$45m (\u00a325m; $35m) in cash and assets, and acted on 20 \"threats to kill\", potentially saving the lives of a \"significant number of innocent bystanders\".\nMr Morrison said the sting, which was called Operation Ironside, was \"a watershed moment in Australian law enforcement history\".\nNew Zealand police said 35 people in the country had been arrested, and about NZ$3.7m (\u00a31.9m, $2.7m) of assets seized. \n\"We believe the termination of these operations will have a significant impact on New Zealand's organised crime scene,\" National Organised Crime Group Director Detective Superintendent Greg Williams said. \nIn the US, the FBI unsealed an indictment against 17 people for distributing the ANOM-enabled devices - eight have so far been arrested, while the rest are on the run. \nThe FBI is expected to present more details later on Tuesday.\nEuropol's deputy executive director Jean-Philippe Lecouffe described the operation as an \"exceptional success\". \nThe agency did not break down the arrests in each country, but local officials said they included 70 people in Sweden and 49 in the Netherlands, according to Reuters news agency. \nLinda Staaf, the Swedish police's head of intelligence, said the operation had helped to prevent more than 10 planned murders in Sweden.

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "text": "Passengers on a cruise ship touring the UK have been told they will not be allowed to disembark in Scotland.\nThe MSC Virtuosa's operator says Scottish government Covid rules block it from entering the port of Greenock.\nThe government has said domestic cruises can only restart when restrictions in all of Scotland reach level one.\nIt insisted the decision was based on the risks \"between both cruises and the wider travel context\".\nThe MSC Virtuosa left Liverpool earlier this week for a seven-night cruise, with planned stops in Greenock in Inverclyde, as well as Belfast, Southampton and the Isle of Portland.\nIt was then due to stop in Greenock again on the return journey.\nIt can carry more than 6,000 passengers but has just under 900 currently on board to allow for social-distancing measures.\nThe Scottish Passenger Agents Association (SPAA) confirmed that Wednesday's scheduled stop in Greenock had been cancelled. The ship was due to dock in Greenock at about 09:30, departing at 20:00 the same day.\nThe industry body said the situation meant Scots on board the vessel were effectively \"barred from setting foot in their own country\". Passengers will not be able to get on the ship at Greenock either.\nThe SPAA said it understood 75% of passengers on board were fully vaccinated, and had recently tested negative.\nThe organisation's president, Joanne Dooey, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme she believed the decision was \"ludicrous\" when people can travel into Scotland by train or car unhindered.\nShe said: \"We had the Northern Belle in last week to Edinburgh from Manchester which had lots of tourists on it with no testing at all.\n\"What's the difference between a cruise ship coming in and football taking place in Glasgow with no testing being put in place?\n\"And when are we ever going to have confidence in the vaccination progress? We are going to have to live with new variants coming in and we have to get on with our lives.\"\nThe SPAA has seen a copy of an email sent to current passengers by the cruise operator.\nIt says: \"Due to the latest Scottish government Covid 19 restrictions and regulations... we are sorry to inform you that the port call of Greenock has been cancelled.\n\"No guests are allowed to embark or disembark... This decision has been made by the Scottish government and is out of our control.\"\nScottish passengers were due to join the cruise in Greenock and the SPAA anticipated that a third of those currently on board were expected to go ashore for excursions on Wednesday.\nMichele Lister, who works for Glasgow-based Glen Travel, is one of those who boarded the ship in Liverpool.\nShe said: \"We were expecting to go into Greenock tomorrow morning for the full day... and we're not allowed to go into my own country which is really disappointing.\n\"There's about half a dozen people that I'm aware of on board that are Scottish and they want to show off to the English customers what Scotland's all about and they want to spend the money in the area as well, which is badly needed.\"\nLinda Hill, who owns LAH Travel in West Kilbride, described the decision as \"another nail in the coffin for the travel industry\".\nShe told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme: \"The cruise industry has obviously been very hard hit over the past 18 months.\n\"But we had seen a way to start, very safely, some UK cruises with lots of very safe protocols including limited numbers on board.\n\"This is a brand new cruise ship which was coming to Greenock tomorrow and there was great excitement to see such a fabulous cruise liner in our own waters.\n\"Sadly, the Scottish government has said passengers cannot embark or disembark at Greenock. The sailing is still going ahead - it's just missing out Scotland.\"\nIn a statement, the Scottish government said it fully understood \"the impact of the current restrictions on domestic cruises\". \nIt added: \"We explained our concerns about the transmission risks posed by cruise vessels in an update to industry on the 24 May and confirmed that we would clarify the position in June. \n\"Following extensive engagement with stakeholders, we have now confirmed that domestic cruises can restart when all of Scotland reaches level one and we have made industry, including the operator, aware of this.\"\nAn MSC spokeswoman said: \"In light of recent information received, we are now awaiting further clarification from the relevant authorities in Scotland about the situation for cruising which regrettably means that we have had to cancel our proposed visit to Greenock tomorrow.\n\"We hope that our calls to Scotland with our special cruises can commence soon considering how much we were looking forward to welcoming our Scottish guests onboard MSC Virtuosa and how we are aware of the important and widespread contribution that the cruise industry makes to Scotland.\"\nAffected passengers have been advised to contact the operator for further information."

      "text": "A major outage has affected a number of high profile websites including Amazon, Reddit and Twitch.\nThe UK government website - gov.uk - was also down as were the Financial Times, the Guardian and the New York Times.\nCloud computing provider Fastly, which underpins a lot of websites, said it was behind the problems.\nThe firm said there had been issues with its global content delivery network (CDN) which it was fixing. \nIn a statement, it said: \"We identified a service configuration that triggered disruption across our POPs (points of presence) globally and have disabled that configuration.\"\nA POP allows content to be sent from globally distributed servers that are close to the end user.\n\"Our global network is coming back online.\"\nThe issues began at around 11:00 BST and lasted for an hour. Other affected websites included CNN and streaming sites Twitch and Hulu. The outage also broke some parts of other services, including Twitter's emojis.\nWebsites were also beginning to be restored, after around an hour of downtime.\nFastly runs what is known as an \"edge cloud\", which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, as well as protect them from denial-of-service attacks and help them when traffic is peaking.\nIt currently looks as if the problems were localised, meaning specific locations across Europe and the US were affected.\nOther websites knocked offline included:\nSimilar problems have also affected Amazon Web Services and Cloudflare in the past, two other huge cloud computing firms.\nSome websites managed to find workarounds to the problem, with tech site The Verge taking to Google Docs to publish its news, but forgetting to limit those who could write on it, leading to a series of amusing edits and tweets.\nThe hashtag \"InternetOutage\" was soon trending on social media as more and more broken websites were discovered.\nThe disruption has led some to question the wisdom of having so much internet infrastructure in the hands of a few companies.\nJake Moore, a cyber-specialist at security firm ESET said: \"This highlights the importance and significance of these vast hosting companies and what they represent.\"\nAdam Smith, a software testing expert with the BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, said outages with content delivery networks \"highlight the growing ecosystem of complex and coupled components that are involved in delivering internet services\".\n\"Because of this, outages are increasingly hitting multiple sites and services at the same time.\"\nStephen Gilderdale, senior director at Dell Technologies, said such outages were bound to occur occasionally but that they would be rare and brief.\n\"Cloud providers build in redundancies for such events to give their users secure access to replicated copies of data. \n\"In most cases, services are only affected for a short time, and data is easily retrievable. Far from being a cause of concern, it shows the resilience of the network that it can recover so quickly.\"\nIt is estimated that even an hour's worth of downtime could cost companies up to $250,000 (\u00a3176,000), and some lawyers think there could be compensation claims.\n\"Liability for loss of service will probably be covered by the service level agreement with customers of paid-for cloud services but the agreements will typically not cover all losses sustained,\" said Prof Rebecca Parry of Nottingham Law School.

      "text": "Shoppers face higher prices or possibly even empty shelves unless more is done to help end a shortage of lorry drivers, the industry has warned. \nOne leading Welsh haulier said lorry firms were facing a \"perfect storm\", caught between Brexit and Covid.\nOwens Group in Carmarthenshire said it had lost 50 drivers who were EU citizens, as they did not meet the new criteria for skilled work visas.\nThe UK government said it was working with hauliers on the issue.\nIt said its new immigration system meant employers should invest in the domestic workforce.\nBut Ian Jarman from Llanelli-based Owens Group has called for more action to be taken.\n\"In the pandemic we were seen as an important industry keeping the deliveries going in the UK,\" he said.\n\"If it doesn't improve in the coming months there could possibly be delivery shortages.\"\nWine importer Daniel Lambert said that was already happening.\nHe brings in drinks to his warehouse near Bridgend and supplies pubs, restaurants and supermarkets across the UK.\n\"It's pretty dire at the moment,\" he said, highlighting one delivery service from Devon and Cornwall that used to deliver overnight but now takes three to four days.\n\"What we have seen since Brexit is that transit times have dramatically increased,\" he claimed.\n\"I'm aware of a major haulier who has 550 containers of wine waiting in Belgium to come to the UK, but they can't because the paperwork isn't right.\"\nHe said some continental producers at a vineyard level did not realise they have to complete special paperwork to sell to the UK.\n\"They haven't left the EU but they still have to deal with Brexit,\" added Mr Lambert.\nThe construction industry in Wales said it was also feeling the pinch.\nRichard Brian, the managing director of building merchants Hughes Forrest in Newport, said it felt like driver shortages meant haulage loads were being \"cherry picked\" - with fewer deliveries and rising prices.\nHe said timber prices had doubled in the past 18 months and they have had to start rationing other products, such as cement.\n\"If someone is asking for 60 bags, I say I can only give you 40,\" said Mr Brian.\nSince 1 January, EU citizens are included in a new immigration system in the UK, which gives priority to high-skilled roles.\nHGV drivers are not among the list of eligible skilled occupations, which means they are excluded from a skilled work visa.\nOwens Group has 1,000 vehicles and employs 950 drivers so it is the skills shortage that Mr Jarman is worried about.\nStanding by one of his new lorries, he said: \"Not everyone can take that out onto the road and manoeuvre into places customers want you to drive it.\" \nHis concerns have been echoed by industry body the Road Haulage Association.\nIt said there were about 60,000 driver shortages and that there used to be about 60,000 drivers from the EU. \nIt added about 30,000 HGV driving tests were lost last year because of Covid.   \nChief executive Richard Burnett has warned the UK government its Covid recovery plans will be hit \"if we do not do something soon\".\n\"The industry will be unable to maintain the integrated supply chains and cope with artificial spikes caused by hot weather and the easing of lockdown, increasing demand for food and drink into supermarkets, pubs and restaurants and goods into retail outlets,\" he said.\nThe Home Office said its points-based immigration system said employers should \"focus on investing in our domestic workforce, especially those needing to find new employment, rather than relying on labour from abroad.\"\n\"The government is working with the haulage sector to promote jobs, training and a range of other initiatives to get more people into HGV driving,\" added a spokesperson."

She's currently receiving help to breathe.\n\"Both Georgia and Melissa are on heavy doses of intravenous antibiotics, so we're really hoping that if any infection does develop that they'll be able to catch it really quickly,\" says Hana.\nHana says Georgia is an experienced diver, but was \"so frightened\" when she came face to face with the croc.\n\"Thank goodness she's had that training. She said her adrenaline kicked in and she knew what to do.\"\nTheir dad is in contact with the British Embassy in Mexico to try and get support for his daughters, but Hana say it's stressful being so far away from her sisters.\nTheir concern now is how they'll pay for Georgia and Melissa's hospital stay - they're not sure yet if their insurance will cover the treatment they're receiving.\nBut they've been able to speak with Georgia on WhatsApp and she's made FaceTime calls from her hospital bed.\n\"Georgia's getting sporadic updates from the doctors as they come in to see her, about Melissa's condition. It's difficult,\" says Hana.\n\"She is so brave and I think she's still in shock.

      "tags": "NHS",
      "text": "The creation of a central NHS digital database from GP records in England will be delayed by two months, the government has announced.\nThe system was due to begin on 1 July, but the date has now been pushed back to 1 September.\nThe NHS had been calling for a delay to allow patients more time to learn about the system. \nThe British Medical Association and the Royal College of GPs had also expressed concern.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Health Minister Jo Churchill said the GP data programme would \"save lives\".\nHowever, she said the government was \"absolutely determined to take people with us on this journey\" and had therefore decided to push the implementation date back to the beginning of September.\nShe said ministers would use the extra time to \"talk to doctors, patients and charities to strengthen the plan... and ensure data is accessed securely\".\n\"Patients own their own data,\" she added.\nLabour's shadow health minister Alex Norris welcomed the delay but argued that the \"current plans to take data from GPs, assemble it in one place and sell it to unknown commercial interests for purposes unknown has no legitimacy.\"\nHe criticised the government for a lack of \"public engagement\" and said the plans had been \"snuck out under the cover of darkness\".\nNHS Digital said that the data would only be accessible to organisations \"which will legitimately use the data for healthcare planning and research purposes, and they will only get the specific data that is required\".\nIt added that the information would never be used for insurance or marketing purposes, promoting or selling products or services, market research and advertising and any requests for data would be \"scrutinised by NHS Digital against stringent criteria\".\nUnder the proposed system - the General Practice Data for Planning and Research - information from surgeries in England will be added to an NHS Digital database.\nThe includes data from records created up to 10 years ago.\nThe collected data includes sex, ethnicity, sexual orientation, diagnoses, medications and information about a patients' physical, mental and sexual health.\nIt does not cover names and addresses - except for a postcode which is replaced by a unique code generated by de-identification software.\nSimon Bolton, head of NHS Digital, said all collected data would be protected or pseudonymised before it leaves the GP \"to ensure patients cannot be directly identified\".\nHe also said patients would be able to opt out of sharing their data.\nPatients can prevent their new data being shared at anytime, but would need to opt out before 1 September to stop past data being transferred to the new system. \nDuring the pandemic, patient data was used to assess how effective certain treatments were and to identify which groups were most at risk from Covid.\nGP data has also been used to identify disparities in care for individuals with learning disabilities and to improve services for diabetics.\nEarlier this week, the British Medical Association and Royal College of General Practitioners expressed their concerns \"about the lack of communication with the public\".\nIn a joint letter, they urged NHS Digital to \"take immediate action to run a public information campaign\".\nWelcoming the delay, Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said \"appropriate use\" of data was important for improving healthcare but added that any system should be \"built around trust\".\nHe said the NHS should communicate with \"every patient\u2026 clearly articulating the benefits and risks of data sharing so that patients can make a genuinely informed decision about whether they are happy for their data to be shared - and if they are not, how they can opt out\".\nAnalysis by Chris Vallance, BBC Technology reporter\nIt was evident last week that NHS Digital wanted a delay to a programme that proposes to transfer information from the records of every GP patient in England to a central NHS database. \nDoctors representatives were clear: patients needed more time to learn about the programme to extract data and the job of informing them couldn't be left to GPs busy with the pandemic and its aftermath.\nNow the government have conceded that a delay is necessary after maintaining as late as Friday that none was needed.\nIt's news that will be greeted with a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with those who remember the cancelled Care.data programme, a previous effort to collect centrally GP record data. \nIt foundered in part because of a lack of awareness among patients, in spite of a national information campaign. \nToday the Information Commissioners Office told me \"the success of any project will rely on people trusting and having confidence in how their personal data will be used\". \nThe NHS will need to use the time this delay affords to rebuild just that: trust.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Politics Live programme, Caroline Cake, chief executive of Health Data Research UK, said using data during the pandemic had helped find new Covid treatments and provide information on the impact of vaccines. \nShe said it was essential that all groups of society are \"represented\" within the new system."

      "tags": "Lindsay Hoyle,UK aid,Andrew Mitchell",
      "text": "A group of Conservative rebel MPs has been thwarted in its bid to overturn \u00a34bn of government cuts to the overseas aid budget.\nThey had suggested returning spending from 0.5% to 0.7% of national income next year through a bill dealing with the UK's new research agency.\nBut the proposal was ruled inadmissible by Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, meaning it will not be put to a vote.\nHowever, he called on ministers to give MPs an \"effective\" vote on the issue.\nSir Lindsay said the rebels' amendment was not within the remit of the law they wanted to change - meaning it could not be allowed.\nDespite this, he said ministers should give the Commons \"the respect it deserves\" and find a way to allow MPs an \"effective decision\" on the target.\nHe has granted the rebels a three-hour emergency debate on Tuesday to put their point across - although there will not be a binding vote on their desired changes. \nA leading rebel, Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, claimed the group would have had enough support to defeat the government if the vote had taken place.\nHe said maintaining the cuts would lead to \"hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths\" in affected countries. \nHe had previously pledged to \"use all the parliamentary procedures we can\" to force a vote on the issue if their amendment was not selected on Monday.\nThe government reduced aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income this year, without changing the 2015 law that made the target binding.\nMinisters have argued this legislation allows the target to be temporarily missed in exceptional circumstances - and says the Covid pandemic counts. \nBut the decision not to give MPs a vote on the issue has angered a number of backbenchers, and led to the threat of legal action. \nMinisters will be relieved to avoid a vote on the aid cuts, ahead of welcoming world leaders from the G7 group for a summit in Cornwall this weekend.\nThe failure by MPs to secure a vote on the government's aid cuts does not mark the end of the story.\nWhile the rebels may have been stymied by a parliamentary technicality, the Speaker made it very clear he wanted the Commons to having a meaningful vote on the issue soon.\nAnd if it did not, then he would \"look at other ways we can move forward\".\nIn the formal language of a parliamentary speaker, this is a threat that if the government does not arrange a vote itself, he may allow the next amendment the rebels table.\nTheir problem, however, is that a legislative opportunity may not now come until the autumn.\nIt means a summer of continuing uncertainty for aid charities, and those they help.\nAs for the government, it has achieved its immediate aim of avoiding what could well have been its first parliamentary defeat.\nBut it still faces another day of criticism for its international aid cuts in the same week it hosts the G7 summit.\nThe government says aid spending will return to the higher 0.7% level \"when the fiscal situation allows\" - but has not specified a date.\nOn Sunday, a group of charities and academics warned \"devastation\" caused by the cuts would lead to families going hungry and girls missing school.\nThe group, including Oxfam and ActionAid UK, also argued it would undermine the UK's international standing and its hosting of the G7.\nLee Margaret Webster from ActionAid told the BBC the cuts had forced a project tackling violence against women and girls in Rwanda to close.\nThis included shutting down seven shelters providing sanctuary for girls escaping domestic violence, she said.\nEarlier, Solicitor General Lucy Frazer said the UK was a big aid donor but added: \"We have a duty to ensure we protect our citizens here as well as those in the rest of the world.\"\nAnd ex-Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey argued the UK shouldn't \"end up going into deeper debt in order to finance other countries\".\nWriting in the Telegraph, she said the UK should instead help poorer countries \"trade their way out of poverty\".\n\"If more and more aid was the solution, large parts of Africa would have escaped all poverty decades ago,\" she added.\nThe rebels had wanted to amend legislation setting up the Advanced Research and Invention Agency - a new body designed to conduct \"high risk\" research.\nTheir amendment would have forced the organisation to make up any shortfall from the 0.7% target from January 2022.\nSir Lindsay said he shared the \"frustration\" of MPs about the lack of a vote to date - but after consulting officials, he decided their amendment was outside the scope of the bill, meaning under Commons rules it could not be debated.\nHe added: \"I expect that the government should find a way to have this important matter debated and to allow the House formally to take an effective decision\".\nLabour - which along with the Lib Dems and SNP supported the amendment - called on ministers to come up with a \"clear timeline\" for reversing the cuts.\nThe party's shadow international development secretary Preet Kaur Gill said the \"strength and depth\" of support among MPs for the move was \"clear\".

That stood at 55% in early May 2021, compared with around 8% of the UK's wider workforce.\nFurlough support is set to be reduced from next month with further cuts until it stops at the end of September."

      "text": "A study that dug into the history of the Amazon Rainforest has found that indigenous people lived there for millennia with \"causing no detectable species losses or disturbances\".\nScientists working in Peru searched layers of soil for microscopic fossil evidence of human impact.\nThey found that forests were not \"cleared, farmed, or otherwise significantly altered in prehistory\".\nThe research is published in the journal PNAS.\nDr Dolores Piperno, from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Balboa, Panama, who led the study, said the evidence could help shape modern conservation - revealing how people can live in the Amazon while preserving its incredibly rich biodiversity. \nDr Piperno's discoveries also inform an ongoing debate about how much the Amazon's vast, diverse landscape was shaped by indigenous people. \nSome research has suggested the landscape was actively, intensively shaped by indigenous peoples before the arrival of Europeans in South America. Recent studies have even shown that the tree species that now dominates the forest was planted by prehistoric human inhabitants. \nDr Piperno told BBC News, the new findings provide evidence that the indigenous population's use of the rainforest \"was sustainable, causing no detectable species losses or disturbances, over millennia\". \nTo find that evidence, she and her colleagues carried out a kind of botanical archaeology - excavating and dating layers of soil to build a picture of the rainforest's history. They examined the soil at three sites in a remote part of north-eastern Peru. \nAll three were located at least one kilometre away from river courses and floodplains, known as \"interfluvial zones\". These forests make up more than 90% of the Amazon's land area, so studying them is key to understanding the indigenous influence on the landscape as a whole. \nThey searched each sediment layer for microscopic plant fossils called phytoliths - tiny records of what grew in the forest over thousands of years. \"We found very little sign of human modification over 5,000 years,\" said Dr Piperno. \n\"So I think we have a good deal of evidence now, that those off-river forests were less occupied and less modified.\"\nDr Suzette Flantua from the University of Bergen is a researcher in the Humans on Planet Earth (Hope) project. She said this was an important study in working out the history of human influence on biodiversity in the Amazon. \n\"But it's like assembling a puzzle of ridiculous extent where studies like this are slowly building evidence that either supports or contradicts the theory that the Amazonia of today is a large secondary forest after thousands of years of human management,\" she said. \"It will be fascinating to see which side ends up with most conclusive evidence.\"\nThe scientists say their findings also point to the value of indigenous knowledge in helping us to preserve the biodiversity in the Amazon, for example, by guiding the selection of the best species for replanting and restoration. \n\"Indigenous peoples have tremendous knowledge of their forest and their environment,\" said Dr Piperno, \"and that needs to be included in our conservation plans\".\nDr Flantua agreed, telling BBC News: \"The more we wait, the more likely that such knowledge is lost. Now is the time to integrate knowledge and evidence, and establish a sustainable management plan for Amazonia and the prehistoric human presence should be included.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "tags": "Earth science,Geology,Telecommunication,Atlantic Ocean,Angola,Democratic Republic of Congo,Oceans",
      "text": "Scientists are reporting what they say is the longest sediment avalanche yet measured in action.\nIt occurred underwater off West Africa, in a deep canyon leading away from the mouth of the Congo River.\nSomething in excess of a cubic kilometre of sand and mud descended into the deep.\nThis colossal flow kept moving for two whole days and ran out for more than 1,100km across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe event would have gone unrecorded were it not for the fact that the slide broke two submarine telecommunications cables, slowing the internet and other data traffic between Nigeria and South Africa in the process.\nAnd also because of the prescient action of researchers who had lined the length of the Congo Canyon with instruments capable of measuring current and sediment velocities.\n\"We had a series of oceanographic moorings that were hit by the event, which broke them from their seafloor anchors so that they popped up to send us an email,\" said Prof Peter Talling from Durham University, UK.  \n\"This thing gradually got faster and faster. Because it erodes the seabed as it goes, it picks up sand and mud, which makes the flow denser and even quicker. So, it has this positive feedback where it can build and build and build,\" he told BBC News.\nThe underwater avalanche - more properly called a turbidity current - was initiated on 14 January last year. It's only being reported now because scientists needed time to recover the sensors and fully analyse their data.\nThe team says two factors combined to prime and then trigger the prodigious flow.\nThe first was an exceptionally large flood along the Congo River in late December 2019. A 1-in-50-year occurrence, this delivered vast quantities of sand and mud to the head of the underwater canyon. But this was still two weeks before the slide.\nWhat followed in January, however, were some unusually big spring tides. \n\"The turbidity current we think was triggered at low water, at low tide,\" said Prof Dan Parsons from Hull University. \n\"As the loading of the ocean above declines, so you get a change in the pore water pressure within the sediment - and that's what allows it to fail. \n\"But first you have to load the dice by delivering the sediment. Then the tidal signature can kick everything off.\"  \nThe analysis shows the turbidity current reached the shallowest of the team's velocity profilers at 22:31 GMT on 14 January 2020, and arrived at the final instrument almost 24 hours later at 21:01 GMT on 16 January. By that stage the slide had reached an ocean depth of more than 4,500m.\nThe team had an early assessment of the speeds involved simply by noting the times when their sensors surfaced. \nThe recovery of the profilers, though, enabled the rough velocity calculations to be properly calibrated.  \nThis showed the flow initially travelled at 5.2m/s in the upper canyon, but then continuously sped up to 8m/s by the time it reached the end of the channel.\nProf Talling and colleagues have detailed the event in a White Paper aimed particularly at the international submarine cable sector. \nThere are important lessons on how to mitigate risks.\nIt's obviously not possible to predict with certainty when a damaging turbidity current will occur, but knowing something about the conditions that trigger sediment failures could influence the global positioning of cable repair ships. \nThe occurrence of another flood along the Congo River like the one experienced in December 2019 would make it wise to keep a vessel on standby in the region, for example.\nThe two cables that broke in mid-January 2020 - the South Atlantic 3/West Africa (SAT-3/WASC) cable and the West Africa Cable System (WACS) - were repaired within a few weeks. But there have been additional breaks since as further sediment has tumbled downslope.\nOne interesting finding concerns why some cables get severed and others do not. This may relate to differences in erosion rates along the flow path.\nIn some areas, the turbidity current will dig deep into the seafloor, while in others, large amounts of sand and mud are dumped. \nThe Congo study is the first to document this patchwork effect of erosion and deposition.\n\"This is new information for the cable industry and is being used to design new routes in this and other canyons - to avoid the areas that are most likely to experience deep erosion (immediately upstream of steep steps in the canyon that look like underwater waterfalls, known as 'knickpoints') as this will leave the cable more vulnerable to damage,\" explained Dr Mike Clare, a marine geoscientist at the UK's National Oceanography Centre and who advises the International Cable Protection Committee.\nIt's hard to overstate the importance of the global submarine cable network. \nMore than 99% of all data traffic between continents goes through these connections, including daily money transfers to the value of trillions of dollars.\nThe research in the Congo Canyon has wide-ranging participation, including from IFREMER (Institut Fran\u00e7ais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la MER) in France and GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Germany. The project is co-led from Durham and Angola Cables. "

      "text": "Israel says a media building destroyed by one of its air strikes in the recent Gaza conflict was being used by the Hamas militant group to try to jam its Iron Dome missile defence system.\nThe Jala Tower housed the offices of Associated Press (AP) and Al Jazeera.\nAP news agency said it had not seen evidence to support Israeli allegations that militants were operating there.\nHamas, which controls Gaza, denied it had offices in the building and called its destruction \"a scheming war crime\".\n\"The Israeli occupation's repeated lies about the presence of Hamas offices in Jala Tower is a failed attempt to justify its crime by targeting a civilian tower that houses media offices and international television channels,\" spokesman Hazem Qassem told the BBC.\nThe recent conflict began after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. \nHamas began firing rockets into Israel after warning it to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes from Israel on Gaza targets.\nAt least 256 people were killed in Gaza, according to the UN, and 13 people were killed in Israel during 11 days of fierce fighting before a ceasefire was agreed on 21 May.\nThe UN said at least 128 of those killed in Gaza were civilians. Israel's military said 200 were militants; Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, put the number of fighters killed at 80.\nFollowing the attack on the tower block on 15 May, both AP and Al Jazeera demanded an explanation from the Israeli government.\nIsrael's envoy to the UN and ambassador to the US, Gilad Erdan, travelled to AP's offices in New York on Monday and the Israel Defense Forces also released a statement on Tuesday.\nMr Erdan told executives of the US news agency that the building housing its Gaza operation was being used by Hamas to develop an electronic jamming system against the Iron Dome.\nHe said Israel did not suspect AP employees \"were aware a covert Hamas unit was using the building in this way\".\nMr Erdan said Israel \"upholds the importance of press freedom,\" adding: \"Israel is willing to assist AP in rebuilding its offices and operations in Gaza.\"\nThe IDF statement said Hamas was using the building to carry out Sigint (signals intelligence), Elint (electronic signals intelligence), and EW (electronic warfare) operations.\nMore than 4,300 rockets were fired towards Israel from Gaza during the conflict, 680 of which fell short and landed in Gaza, according to the IDF. It says the Iron Dome intercepted about 90% of the rockets that crossed into Israeli territory and were headed for populated areas.\nAssociated Press told Haaretz it welcomed the meeting with Mr Erdan and the rebuilding offer, but added: \"Israeli authorities maintain that the building housing our bureau was destroyed because of a Hamas presence that posed an urgent threat. We have yet to receive evidence to support these claims.\n\"AP continues to call for the full release of any evidence the Israelis have so that the facts are public.\"\nShortly after the air strike, Sally Buzbee, AP's executive editor, said it had had offices in the building for 15 years and had never had any indication that Hamas might be there.\nQatar-based Al Jazeera strongly condemned the attack and said it would do all it could to \"hold the Israeli government responsible for its actions\".\nIt condemned what it called a \"clear act to stop journalists from conducting their sacred duty to inform the world and report events on the ground\".\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken was among those calling for an explanation.\nIsrael gave an hour's prior warning of the air strike on the 12-storey block, allowing evacuation.\nThe ceasefire in the region has since held, and the UN Human Rights Council has voted to investigate the violence, a move welcomed by the Palestinians.\nBut Israel said the move showed an \"anti-Israel obsession\" and the US said it would endanger progress in bringing calm to the region."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "Scotland will start to vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 as quickly as possible if experts recommend it, Nicola Sturgeon has said. \nThe Pfizer-BionTech vaccine was approved for use among the age group by the UK's medicine regulator last week.\nThe Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization on whether it should begin vaccinating children.\nMs Sturgeon said the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated. \nBut she told the Scottish Parliament that if the JCVI recommends the use of the vaccine for children over the age of 12, the country would \"move as quickly as possible to implement the advice\".\nThe first minister added: \"It is vital that we rely on expert advice in all of our vaccination decisions. \n\"However, vaccination may well be an important way of giving children greater protection, minimising any further disruption to schooling, and further reducing community transmission of the virus.\"\nMs Sturgeon also insisted that the decision was not simply a choice between \"vaccinating children and playing our part in global vaccination\".\nMore than half of Scotland's adult population has now had both doses of a Covid vaccine - with the total number standing at 2,282,203. \nPfizer has said its vaccine trials had shown 100% efficacy and a strong immune response in children between 12 and 15, and that the vaccine was safe with no unusual side-effects.\nIts use among children in the UK was approved by the MHRA on Friday of last week, with the regulator saying it had carried out a \"rigorous review\" which showed the vaccine was safe and effective in adolescents. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) must now advise governments on whether this age group should be vaccinated as part of the UK rollout.\nThe UK government has also said it will be guided by expert advise from the JCVI, and that any decision would be \"clinically based\".\nAnd it has said that the UK has enough supplies to vaccinate children if the move was recommended by the JCVI.\nBut some experts have questioned whether it is morally right to vaccinate children - who have an extremely low risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid - in wealthy countries such as the UK rather than donating the extra doses to the rest of the world. \nWhat do you think about vaccinating teenagers? Would you like to see young people aged 12-15 vaccinated before the beginning of the next school term?  Please share your stories and pictures with us.\nYou can now get in touch with BBC Scotland on the phone messaging service, WhatsApp. \nTo start using the app, simply download WhatsApp on to your smartphone free from the internet.\nThen add our WhatsApp number +44 7902 704679 to your phone's contact list.\nPlease make sure you read our terms of use and privacy policy.\nThe World Health Organization has already called on wealthy countries to postpone any plans to immunise children.\nAnd Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland at the weekend that she hoped the UK would \"step up\" to donate vaccines to poorer countries rather than vaccinating teenagers. \nProf Bauld said there were good reasons for vaccinating 12-15 year olds as well over 80% of the total population would need to be vaccinated to achieve population immunity against the virus.\nBut she said there were many countries around the world where vaccination levels were low but cases were \"skyrocketing\".\nShe said that not addressing vaccine roll-out issues in countries with high levels of infection would curtail global travel in the future and lead to a much higher risk of more dangerous variants emerging.\nA further 695 people tested positive for the virus in Scotland on Monday, which was 5% of the total number of tests carried out. \nTwo council areas - Clackmannanshire and Dundee - currently have infection rates of more than 200 cases per 100,000 people.\nIn addition, six areas which are currently in level one have a rate above 50 cases per 100,000, which has previously been the threshold for level three restrictions. These included Angus, where the rate is above 150 per 100,000.\nThe number of people in hospital with the virus across Scotland now stands at 121 - one fewer than yesterday - while the number of patients in intensive care units remains at 12.\nThere have been no deaths registered in the past 24 hours of people who had recently tested positive for Covid.\nAhead of Ms Sturgeon's statement, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf was questioned over the controversial plans for a fan zone in Glasgow Green during the European Championships.\nMr Yousaf said he understood the concerns, but that it was an attempt to cater \"in as safe a way as possible\" for fans who wanted to watch the matches.\nHe said it was a \"low risk event\" which would be monitored on an ongoing basis, adding: \"Any changes considered necessary will be made, up to and including withdrawing permission, should significant concerns arise.\"\nPublic health officials in England have warned that football fan zones for the European championships could become super spreader events, but the Scottish government seems content to press ahead. \nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf told parliament that the Glasgow zone would be outdoors and highly regulated. He dismissed calls for mandatory testing, highlighting concerns about digital exclusion, but revealed that Glasgow city council would be contacting ticket holders to encourage them to get a lateral flow test before attending. \nThis is in contrast to the cautious approach ministers have adopted with soft play areas. The sector's been demonstrating outside Holyrood to highlight what is sees as an anomaly - that trampoline parks and bowling alleys can open in level two, but soft plays cannot.  \nMinisters make the point that good leadership can involve making unpopular decisions. \nThey may yet need to disappoint football fans. Mr Yousaf acknowledged that the zone will be monitored throughout, and the plug could be pulled if problems are perceived."

      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "A secret ballot should have been held to affirm Edwin Poots' leadership but the result would not have changed, DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley has said. \nIt comes after two councillors were among a number of party members to quit over concerns about the party's direction.   \nA vote to hold a secret ballot on the night that Mr Poots and Ms Bradley were ratified was rejected. \nMs Bradley said there was no \"purge\" taking place in the party. \nMr Poots, speaking to BBC's Spotlight for an interview due to be aired on Tuesday, said the issue was \"peripheral\" but he did not want to lose anyone from the party. \nThe interventions follows the resignation of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen, along with others in the party's South Down association.\nMr Hanna said there was a \"culture of fear\" in the party and claimed he witnessed \"bullying\" at last month's meeting of the DUP executive, during which Mr Poots' election as DUP leader was ratified by party members. \nHe also alleged that people who had put their hands up at the meeting in support of a secret ballot on the leadership were told to put them down. \nParty member Roberta McNally, who was also at the DUP executive meeting, said she \"witnessed senior members telling people to put their hands down to enable to vote to be open\".\nWriting on social media, she said that she had informed the DUP's Upper Bann chairman of her resignation on Sunday night.\nMs Bradley told William Crawley on BBC Radio Ulster's TalkBack programme that she did not see this happening. \nShe said that with hindsight, a secret ballot should have taken place, but that the result would not have changed. \n\"With hindsight, if it had of calmed what we have now, well then yes of course [there should have been a secret ballot],\" Ms Bradley said. \n\"With hindsight, and the ramifications of what has happened, then yes, it would have. I don't think the result would have changed in any way.\"\nMrs Owen said women and moderates in the DUP have been left \"voiceless\". Mr Hanna said there was no attempt to fix rifts after the leadership contest.\nThe DUP said it was disappointed but thanked the members for their service.\nIn regard to the issues the pair raised, a party statement said: \"The party takes these matters very seriously and any complaints should be made in writing to enable a thorough and fair investigation.\"\nA source close to Mr Poots also rejected the suggestion that there was a \"purge\" to oust some members of the party.\nThe Belfast Telegraph reported that Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who was defeated by Mr Poots in the recent DUP leadership contest, has expressed support for those who have quit, saying it was highly regrettable that \"senior and valued members now feel the DUP is no longer a warm house for them\".\nIt is understood Mr Hanna and Mrs Owen will remain as independent councillors on Newry, Mourne and Down District Council. \nIt means the number of DUP members on the council will fall from three to one.   \nThe DUP resignations follow recent tensions within the South Down association between assembly member Jim Wells - a firm supporter of Mr Poots - and members who had supported Sir Jeffrey for the leadership.\nMr Wells did not wish to comment. \nThe South Down association held its AGM on Saturday night, which saw Mr Hanna removed as chairman by eight votes to seven.\nMr Hanna had been a long-standing member of the DUP ruling executive but had openly criticised the party during the vote to ratify Mr Poots as leader almost a fortnight ago. \nHe has also criticised the handling of former DUP leader Arlene Foster's ousting from office during the meeting.\nIn a statement, Mr Hanna said he accepted there was a democratic vote to remove him as association chairman, but claimed \"the lack of prior warning echoed how the Poots team treated Arlene Foster\". \n\"If he was leader, Sir Jeffrey would have openly acknowledged the glaringly obvious divide in the party and worked to unite and rebuild. He would not have acted in the way of the new leadership,\" he said.\nA source close to Mr Poots told BBC News NI that the new DUP leader had \"no prior knowledge\" of the moves in South Down to replace Mr Hanna as chair of the association, and insisted Mr Poots was working to rebuild relations at all levels of the party.\nMr Hanna also said the DUP leadership's actions would be \"catastrophic for unionism\" and urged anyone with \"decency and integrity\" in the party to consider their position.\n\"To be honest, I have often felt the burden of being the face on the ground following the numerous bad behaviours in the DUP and ashamed of them,\" he added.\n\"I believe I will be a better councillor without the weight of the DUP on my shoulders.\"\nThe fact that Paula Bradley is the one out front and centre fielding the difficult questions about what happened over the weekend perhaps speaks volumes for the job that she is going to do for Edwin Poots. \nShe's the face of the moderate side of the party and being able to bat back any suggestion that Mr Poots is going to take the party in a hard-line direction. \nI think we're going to have judge what happens by actions and not words. \nMs Bradley talked about receiving calls from people who felt isolated - we'll have to see where that goes and whether there are any formal complaints made in writing to the party and, if so, what the process will be for dealing with those.  \nWe'll also have to see who Mr Poots decides to put into his front bench ministerial posts. \nThat will also send out an indication of how he plans to rebuild relationships within the party, if, for example, he puts someone on his front bench who didn't want him as party leader, but Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. \nThe party is as deeply divided this evening as it has been over the course of the past five or six weeks. \nIn what is his second week in charge, the new leader's headaches continue. \nMr Hanna said the \"bullying\" that set it off for him was what happened at the meeting to ratify the new leadership. \n\"I watched senior members of the DUP going round and telling people to put their hands down so that there was no secret vote,\" Mr Hanna said.\n\"That really did put the lid on it for me.\"\nThe councillor claimed many elected members and DUP staff were scared to protest because their income depends on their position within the party.\nIn her statement, Mrs Owen said she had been considering her position in recent weeks, but resigned after witnessing the treatment of Mr Hanna at the AGM.\nShe said: \"It is apparent to me there is a purging of Donaldson supporters and it is only a matter of time before this continues across the party.\n\"It would be against my principles as a veteran, mother and independent woman to stand idly by and allow this behaviour to continue, rewarded by my silence and inaction.\"\nShe added that women and moderates within the party felt voiceless, saying: \"The only way to stop this coercion and control is to remove the fuel that feeds it and empower these voices.\"\nMrs Owen, who was co-opted as a councillor in 2019 but joined the DUP nearly a decade ago, later told the Nolan Show on Radio Ulster that she had been \"shut down, I've been shut out. I've been cold shouldered\".\nMs Bradley said the party now needs to come together because \"the union is at stake, Northern Ireland is at stake\". \nShe said the party needs to sit down and talk about these \"personal issues\". \nMs Bradley reiterated that she has not yet spoken to Mrs Foster but she hoped to do so \"at some stage in the future\". \nLater, Ms Bradley, who is also welfare officer for the party, said there are issues that have been ongoing and they need to be resolved. \nAllegations of bullying were concerning and will be investigated, Ms Bradley added. \nShe said she had received several calls from \"various members who were feeling hurt about everything that went on\". \n\"I have spoken to them and I have reassured them that they are important to us and that their views also matter,\" Ms Bradley said. \nShe also said she would speak to both Mr Hanna and Mrs Owen. \nResignations of elected representatives had been threatened after the internal acrimony erupted, but Mr Hanna and Mrs Owen are the first councillors to officially step away from the party.\nMr Hanna's daughter Diane Forsythe, who stood for the party as its South Down candidate in the 2017 general election, has also quit the party.\nMs Forsythe said her voice was not being heard and was \"better out of that party\". \nIn its statement about the South Down Association AGM, the DUP said:  \"Some of the members who have resigned sought re-election to hold office within the party. \n\"It is disappointing they have chosen to resign from the party, following the outcome of the meeting. \n\"We thank them for their service.\""

      "text": "London is the latest UK city to trial e-scooters - which the government hopes will be a more environmentally-friendly way to travel. \nMore than 30 areas - including Newcastle, Bristol and Bournemouth - are already operating rental schemes.\nThe Covid pandemic brought the trials forward, because they offer people a way of getting around at a social distance.\nE-scooters are available to rent in four boroughs to start with:\nScooters can also be hired in Canary Wharf and ridden through the borough of Tower Hamlets. The City of London is due to join in July.\nThe most powerful privately-owned e-scooters can reach up to 68 mph (110 km/h) but rental e-scooters in the UK have maximum limits of 15.5mph (24.9km/h)\nThe London trials use technology to create \"go-slow areas\", where the top speed is reduced to 8mph (13km/h) for safety.\nHire charges vary, but it typically costs \u00a31 to unlock an e-scooter (using a smartphone app) plus a fee of 14p-20p per minute.\nRental e-scooters in London have front and rear lights.\nThe only e-scooters that can be used on public roads are those rented as part of government-backed trials. \nIf you own an e-scooter, you can only use it on private land and not on public roads, cycle lanes or pavements.\nCurrently, there isn't a specific law for e-scooters so they are recognised as  \"powered transporters\" - falling under the same laws and regulations as motor vehicles. They are subject to all the same legal requirements - MOT, tax, licensing and specific construction. \nAnd so, because e-scooters don't always have visible rear red lights, number plates or signalling ability, that's why they can't be used legally on roads.\nYes. To use an e-scooter from an official trial, you need to have category Q entitlement on your driving licence. \nFull/provisional UK driving licences with categories AM, A or B include category Q permissions.\nIf you have a provisional licence, you don't need L plates when using an e-scooter.\nIf you have an overseas provisional licence, learner permit or equivalent - you can't use an e-scooter.\nNo. In London you have to complete an online course first. \nCycle helmets are recommended, but not legally required.  \nYes. \nThe Met Police say they will issue fines of \u00a350 for riding on the footway - and \u00a3100 and six driving licence penalty points for using a mobile phone or riding through a red light.\nThe Transport Committee of MPs has called for e-scooters to be legalised on roads, but not pavements.\nIt says allowing wider use of e-scooters would:\nThe London Cycle Campaign (LCC) says e-scooters offer a \"cleaner, low carbon alternative\" for those who can't or don't want to cycle. \nUnsurprisingly, manufacturers say e-scooters can improve mental health and balance. But the London Assembly found there could be a negative health benefits if e-scooters replaced walking or cycling. \nThe exact number of crashes involving e-scooters is said to be under-reported however Ch Supt Simon Ovens from the Met Police said the numbers were increasing \"sharply\". \nIn July 2019, TV presenter and YouTuber Emily Hartridge, 35, died when the e-scooter she was riding crashed due to an underinflated tyre. And Julian Thomas, 55, died when his e-scooter hit a parked car in September 2020. \nThere's concern that e-scooters are being used by criminal gangs. \nE-scooters were involved 574 recorded crimes in London, such as robberies or assaults, between 1 July 2020 and 30 April 2021 - say the Met.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan says incidents involving e-scooters are \"underreported\", but work is being done with the police to ensure all incidents are addressed.\nCaroline Pidgeon, a Lib Dem London Assembly member, is worried the \"speed and nimbleness\" of e-scooters now offer an attractive option for some criminals.\nThe needs of pedestrians and disabled people should \"never be sacrificed\", she says, and it is \"vital\" e-scooters are not ridden irresponsibly or left cluttered on pavements."

      "text": "A US drug company says it has created the first therapy that could slow Alzheimer's disease, and it is now ready to bring it to market. \nCurrently, there are no drugs that can do this - existing ones only help with symptoms. \nBiogen says it will soon seek regulatory approval in the US for the \"groundbreaking\" drug, called aducanumab. \nIt plans to file the paperwork in early 2020 and has its sights on Europe too.\nApproval processes could take a year or two. If successful, the company aims to initially offer the drug to patients previously enrolled in clinical studies of the drug.\nThe announcement is somewhat surprising because the company had discontinued work on the drug in March 2019, after disappointing trial results. \nBut the company says a new analysis of a larger dataset of the same studies shows that higher doses of aducanumab can provide a significant benefit to patients with early Alzheimer's, slowing their clinical decline so they preserve more of their memory and every day living skills - things that the disease usually robs. \nAducanumab targets a protein called amyloid that forms abnormal deposits the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Scientists think these plaques are toxic to brain cells and that clearing them using drugs would be a massive advance in dementia treatment, although not a cure. \nThere haven't been any new dementia drugs in over a decade.\nBiogen's chief executive Michel Vounatsos said: \"We are hopeful about the prospect of offering patients the first therapy to reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer's disease.\"\nHilary Evans from Alzheimer's Research UK said: \"People affected by Alzheimer's have waited a long time for a life-changing new treatment and this exciting announcement offers new hope that one could be in sight.\n\"Taking another look at aducanumab is a positive step for all those who took part in the clinical trials and the worldwide dementia research community. As more data emerges, we hope it will spark global discussions about the next steps for delivering much-needed treatments into people's hands.\"\nProf Bart De Strooper, Director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at University College London, said: \"It is fantastic to hear of these new positive results emerging from the aducanumab trials. We currently have no effective treatments to slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease and I hope this signifies a turning point.\"\nDementia is not a single disease, but is the name for a group of symptoms that include problems with memory and thinking.\nThere are lots of different types of dementia and Alzheimer's is said to be the most common and most researched.\nThere are currently 850,000 people with dementia in the UK.\nIt's been a long and tortuous journey to find new drugs for the disease and recent attempts have ended in failure. \nExperts hope a treatment is in sight, but they are cautious and will need to closely scrutinise these aducanumab trial findings.

Almost everyone is on the verge of death - our eyes are affected by the hunger, the situation is perilous.\n\"Death is knocking on our door. You can see the hunger on the face of each of us.\"\nResidents said they had seen vehicles carrying aid pass by, but no-one had bothered to inquire about their predicament.\nBecause they are trapped.\nThe older farmer said people have been trying to travel elsewhere, like the towns of Shire and Sheraro - about 200km (125 miles) east of their district, to find food and humanitarian supplies.\nBut transport has been difficult to come by and those that have vehicles have been prevented from leaving the area by the militia.\n\"When we want to go to the place where there is aid all roads are blocked,\" he said, adding that those who have tried to flee on foot have been asked to pay bribes, which they cannot afford. \n\"Even if we try on foot, if the militias from Amhara found us they force us to pay 4,000-5,000 birr [between $90 and $115] each.\"\nThe younger farmer added that people feared being killed if they came face-to-face with the militia in the bush.\n\"If we try to go to the place where there is aid we will be killed in the forest,\" he said.\nA local administrator appointed for the area in the wake of the conflict told the BBC that no federal aid was available and only limited assistance was coming through for neighbouring Amhara.\nMr Guterres warned the situation would \"only keep getting worse\" unless funding was increased and humanitarian access was improved.\nThe government says international humanitarian workers have been allowed into most parts of Tigray. \nMonths after the conflict begun, many critical services have not been fully restored. Dozens of health centres and hospitals have been destroyed or looted. \nIt erupted when Ethiopia's government launched an offensive to oust the region's then ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).\nThe party had had a massive fallout with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed over political changes to the country's ethnically based federal system - though the TPLF's capture of federal military bases in Tigray was the catalyst for the invasion.\nMr Abiy, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, declared that the conflict was over at the end of November, but fighting has continued.\nThousands of people have been killed and about 1.7 million have fled their homes. Tens of thousands have sought refuge in neighbouring Sudan.\nThe conflict has also involved troops from neighbouring Eritrea fighting with the government. \nAll sides have been accused of numerous human rights abuses."

      "text": "International travel for non-essential reasons like going on holiday has been legal since 17 May, but with so few countries on the green list, the destinations where travellers can go without quarantining are few in number. \nWhile the government has always said that international travel would be limited, the travel industry had not foreseen that the list would be as limited as it is, particularly now that Portugal has been moved to the amber list.\nSo what could get travel going again and what are the roadblocks?\nWhile the government is concerned about importing new cases into the UK, the biggest concern is that tourists could bring in a vaccine-resistant variant that would render vaccination efforts useless and endanger public health. \nThe difficulty is working out when a variant - or in Portugal's case - a mutation, is significant enough to change a country's traffic light status.\nIs it when it is classified as being \"of concern\", \"of interest\" or just when it's identified in the first place?\n\"The move from variant of interest, to variant of concern, has never been properly identified as the parameters to look at,\" Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at University of Exeter's Medical School tells the BBC.\n\"They mostly all start off as variants of interest and become variants of concern when displaying activities and properties of being more infectious, severe disease causing and bypassing the current vaccines.\"\nBut where that line is drawn is important, particularly if the identification of a variant or mutation is enough to move a country from one level to another. \nSome in the industry think the government is becoming too risk-averse.\n\"There's talk of a new variant and everything shuts down,\" says budget airline Jet2's boss Steve Heapy. \"Is that how it's going to be going forward?\"\n\"If it is, then they're trying to defeat mother nature - virus do have variants all the time.\"\nTim Alderslade, the chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, says the sector isn't calling a reopening of travel everywhere.\n\"But if the government is going to have this kind of risk appetite...then it's going to be really difficult to see how we can have a summer season,\" he says. \nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"We have always been clear that protecting public health is our priority and that if decisive action was needed, it would be swiftly taken.\"\nThe industry had hoped that while mainland Greece and Spain might not yet be on the green list, at least some of the Spanish and Greek islands would be.\nThe island policy was used last year and Transport secretary Grant Shapps said in April that it was something his department wanted to consider.\nBut there are difficulties with looking at individual islands, partly because of their size.\n\"Healthcare facilities are limited and they can provide what they can and no more,\" says Dr Pankhania. \n\"There could come a time when a British holidaymaker is told, wait - we have Spanish people here who are sick and they could take priority, leaving holidaymakers stuck.\"\nThere are also worries that while coronavirus testing is showing infection rates for island residents, it isn't including the test results for tourists, who might still spread it amongst one another.\nHowever, others argue that including smaller regions on the green list would helpful keep travel flowing where the risk is low.\nThis is a sore point with the travel industry, which says it doesn't understand what tips a country between the different colours. \nWhile the government has laid out criteria like vaccination rates, virus levels, variants and the quality of genomic sequencing offered by a country, it hasn't set out exactly what level of each leads to a move up or down the list.  \n\"We can't plan what we're doing,' says Mr Heapy. \"We've either got to assume all the destinations will be green, none of the destinations will be green or use a lottery machine and try to work it out in the absence of a structured methodology.\"\nUltimately, this isn't just a decision about other countries' data. \nWhile ministers are given recommendations by the Joint Biosecurity Centre about other countries' positions, they also weigh up other issues too, like the UK's health situation, or the practicalities of putting a country on the red, amber or green list. This is still a political decision.\nThere's nothing in the government's guidelines about international business travel, or taking what other nations are doing into account when deciding whether to put a country on the green list.\nYesterday, transatlantic airline bosses came together to put pressure on UK and US politicians to reopen flights between the UK and USA for business and leisure travel. \nThey want to see US President Joe Biden and Boris Johnson commit to announcing a travel corridor at this weekend's G7 meeting in Cornwall.\nThere is no doubt that time is of the essence for airlines, whose finances have been stripped by a year with minimal passengers. \nDelta Airline boss Ed Bastion said it was rare to see all his aviation competitors come together, but that they were \"speaking in one voice\". \nHe warned that as Europe begins to open up to US travellers, the UK could be left behind, missing out on lucrative tourist income.\nThe European Commission has announced that its EU Digital Covid-19 Passport will begin on 1 July, and may also be issued to non-European travellers, including visitors from the UK and the US.\nHowever, European nations are already beginning to welcome travellers.\nSpain, which is on the amber list, started allowing British travellers to enter without the need for a Covid test or vaccination certificate from Monday. \nSo you could visit Spain, but you'd still have to quarantine on your return. \n\"It just beggars belief,\" Travel Trade Gazette editor Sophie Griffiths tells the BBC. \"Especially as countries are opening up and Britain is closing down. People are just confused and frustrated about why that's happening.\"\nEasyJet boss Johan Lundgren agrees: \"This decision has cut Britain off from Europe and from the world for that matter - it's utterly confusing for the British people.\"\nIt is becoming a fine and delicate dance to find the equilibrium between the demands of travel bosses and governments. \n\"I can see where [travel bosses] are coming from,\" says Dr Pankhania.\n\"But from an infection control point of view we are finely balanced now. We are nearly there - it would be better to be completely certain before opening the gates to all, [as] once opened, it is difficult to close them again.\""

      "text": "US Vice President Kamala Harris has urged would-be migrants in Guatemala not to try to enter the United States illegally.\nSpeaking on her first overseas trip since taking office, she said the journey north was dangerous and would mainly benefit people smugglers. \nMs Harris warned people they would be turned back at the border.\nShe has been tasked by President Joe Biden with controlling a surge in migration at the southern border.\nMs Harris has described her task as finding solutions to tackle the root causes of the border crisis, including corruption and the lack of economic opportunities. Her staff say this first visit is primarily an information-gathering trip.\nIn a news conference alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, she warned against illegal migration to the US, saying: \"Do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders.\"\nShe added: \"If you come to our border, you will be turned back.\"\nMs Harris said she wanted the US and Guatemala to \"work together\" to find solutions to \"long-standing problems\".\nShe said people must be given a \"sense of hope that help is on the way\".\n\"It must be coupled with relationships of trust. It must be coupled with tangible outcomes, in terms of what we do as leaders to convince people that there is a reason to be hopeful about their future and the future of their children,\" Ms Harris added.\nPresident Giammattei defended his government's own record of fighting corruption and said the fight against drug trafficking should be an key part of tackling the issue.\nHe announced a new processing centre for migrants who had been sent back from the US and Mexico and said that the focus for both countries should be on creating prosperity.\nMs Harris said the US would send 500,000 coronavirus vaccines to Guatemala and provide $26m (\u00a318.3m) to fight the pandemic there. The region has been hard hit by the virus, further worsening living conditions. \nShe also met civil society leaders and entrepreneurs in the country before travelling on to Mexico where she will hold talks with President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on Tuesday.\nPresident Biden has been criticised by Republicans who accuse him of ignoring the crisis on the southern border.\nBut in a recent speech to Congress, he said: \"When I was vice president, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked.\"\nFor the Guatemalan government, there will have been some satisfaction in being the hosts of the vice-president's first international visit. It is a sign of improved ties with Washington after the Trump administration. However, in reality, the Biden administration has few other feasible partners in the region, embroiled as they are in diplomatic tension or open conflict with the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\nThe joint news conference revealed a number of things. \nCertainly the rhetoric from the Biden administration is more compassionate than over the past four years. The vice-president mentioned \"hunger, hurricanes and pandemic\" as \"acute\" drivers of migration, and talked of empowering the indigenous community in Guatemala.\nCertainly the promise of 500,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine from the US will have been welcomed as the region lags well behind much of the world on the road towards a fully-vaccinated society.\nBut many Guatemalans will have met other measures with some scepticism. \nThe proposed anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling measures will struggle to unpick the sophisticated criminal networks, which run the migrant and drug routes north. Despite much talk of creating jobs and incentives inside Guatemala, many know that Washington's plan also involves bolstering the police and security forces to better prevent migrants from leaving in the first place. And the promise of hundreds of millions in development aid will also ring alarm bells over exactly how those funds will be administered.\nIndeed, the discussion of a corruption task force appeared to touch a raw nerve with President Giammattei, who became defensive as he denied \"meddling\" in the work of anti-graft prosecutors in the country. \nIf nothing else, this trip has underlined the scale of the task ahead.\nThe border\nMore than 178,000 migrants arrived at the border this April, the highest one-month total in more than two decades, according to US border officials.\nOf those migrants, more than 40% originated from the Central American region known as the Northern Triangle: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\nThis will be the main focus of Ms Harris' trip.\nCorruption\nA central issue contributing to the border crisis is the corruption of government officials in the region, who have been accused of aiding in drug and human trafficking.\nMs Harris will to discuss the situations in Guatemala and Mexico. But the vice-president has yet to speak to the leaders of Honduras and El Salvador.\n\"We have the capacity to give people hope,\" Ms Harris said last month. \"Part of giving people hope is having a very specific commitment to rooting out corruption in the region.\"\nEconomic growth\nMany migrants leaving the Northern Triangle say they are fleeing violence, discrimination and poverty.\nThe steady \"brain drain\" of locals has exacerbated problems caused by decades of political instability.\nThese countries have also stressed that they are feeling the most adverse effects of global warming - most notably hurricanes - despite hardly contributing to climate change.\nMs Harris said in her press conference in Guatemala that \"we are doing the work of requiring certain progress be made\" in order to attract US investment to the region.\nShe also pledged US investments towards agriculture, entrepreneurship and affordable housing, as well as for \"a young women's empowerment initiative to increase education and opportunities for girls and women\"."

      "tags": "David Cameron,House of Commons",
      "text": "Parts of the North of England and the Midlands will lose parliamentary seats while areas in the South gain under proposals for a shake-up of England's electoral map in 2023.\nThe Boundary Commission for England says the aim is to make Parliament fairer by giving each MP a roughly similar number of voters. \nIt means redrawing and renaming some seats.\nScotland and Wales will see their total cut - while England gains 10 MPs. \nThe task of reconfiguring parliamentary constituencies is being carried out by independent commissions in each UK nation who will report separately, with the plans for England the first to be published. \nThe proposals suggest the first major overhaul of seat boundaries in England since 2010, with just under 10% of existing constituencies remaining unchanged.   \nUnlike previous reviews, the total number of seats in the House of Commons will stay at 650 but population changes mean England is set to have 543 MPs, Wales 32 and Scotland 57 - that is an extra 10 for England, with Wales losing eight and Scotland's count cut by two. \nIt comes after plans by the former conservative prime minister, David Cameron, to cut 50 seats were dropped by the government in March 2020 because of the \"Brexit workload\". \nThe review is designed to end the discrepancies in the current system with some MPs having only 50,000 constituents and others having double that. \nSeats will be redrawn so they have, by law, between 69,724 and 77,062 registered voters each; with some island constituencies, such as the Isle of Wight and Anglesey, being given special dispensation to be outside these requirements. \nPopulation changes mean that, in England, the North East, the North West and the West Midlands will lose two seats each, while London gains two, the South West gets three extra and the South East is up seven. \nA seat straddling Devon and Cornwall has been avoided but the Commission said it had \"not always been possible to allocate whole numbers of constituencies to individual counties\" or to avoid crossing boundaries and that \"significant change\" was necessary in Avon, Somerset and Devon.\nLikewise in London, 31 constituencies will cut across borough boundaries.\nAmong constituencies affected are Sir Keir's Holborn and St Pancras constituency, which could be renamed Kentish Town and Bloomsbury to reflect the changes; while Chancellor Rishi Sunak's North Yorkshire seat could see alterations.\nTory MP for Lichfield in Staffordshire, Michael Fabricant, says the changes show \"no knowledge\" of his constituency.\n\"It divides Lichfield Trent Valley station in two and cuts off the eastern edge of Lichfield itself. Frankly, it's a nonsense,\" he said.\nHe added: \"It bears all the hallmarks of boundaries drawn in the 19th and 20th centuries by Whitehall mapmakers in days of empire without any knowledge or care of the regions and people concerned.\"\nBut Boundary Commission Secretary Tim Bowden stressed that while the proposals mark the first chance people will have to see what the new parliamentary map could look like, these are just \"initial thoughts\". \nHe said the Commission wanted to hear the views of the public to \"ensure that we get the new boundaries for parliamentary constituencies right\".\nBy Sean Curran, BBC parliamentary correspondent\nIf these proposals sound familiar that's because it's taken years to redraw the electoral map. \n A lot has happened in British politics since the then prime minister, David Cameron, asked the independent boundary commissions to draw up plans for a smaller House of Commons made up of 600 seats all with roughly the same number of voters.\nFor years Conservatives had complained that the way the electoral map was drawn up gave their political opponents an unfair advantage. They argued that Labour seats tended to have fewer voters than Tory areas.   \nLabour responded by accusing the coalition of gerrymandering. \nThe changes were never introduced because Nick Clegg pulled the plug on the proposals after a rebellion by Conservative MPs killed off plans to reform the House of Lords.  \nBut the plans to get rid of 50 MPs never went away and nor did the arguments.\nIt was probably always going to be a challenge to get MPs to vote themselves out of a job and Theresa May didn't have enough support to get the plans through parliament. \nBoris Johnson's government has dropped the idea of cutting the number of MPs which might take some of the sting out of the forthcoming changes but every shake up of the boundaries produces winners and losers.\nSome MPs will find themselves with safer seats, others will see their seats disappear altogether. There will be some gloomy and disappointed politicians at Westminster today, but this is only the start of a long consultation and this is unlikely to be the final picture.  \nThe initial proposals will now be subject to consultations and revisions.\nThis first one will run for eight weeks before closing on 2 August. \nA second consultation with public hearings will then get under way in spring 2022, followed by a final four-week consultation on revised plans in autumn 2022. \nFinal recommendations are due by 1 July 2023, after which the government has four months to implement the plans.\nThe changes will only come into effect in late 2023, which could be be too late for the next election if Boris Johnson decides to call it early.  \nThe Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill brought forward in the Queen's Speech would make it possible for the prime minister to call an election before 2024, when one is next due under the current rules. \nIf that were to happen before the new boundaries are in place, the election would be fought on the old boundaries. \nSome polling experts have suggested the review could hand more seats to the Tories.\nBut Martin Baxter, founder of Electoral Calculus, said it was likely to be a mixed bag.\n\"People have been moving from Wales and the North of England down to the South, which means fewer seats in the North and more seats in the South. \n\"That helps the Conservatives overall, but not as much as it might have done since they now hold some 'red wall' seats themselves which might disappear, and there will also be more seats in Labour-friendly areas such as London.\"\nBut he said \"the net change will be fairly modest, and would be easily dwarfed by a change in public opinion by a percent or two\".\n\"The next election will ultimately be decided by the views of the British people rather than by the precise shape of all the constituency boundaries.\"\nThe new review for England is estimated to cost \u00a32.5m. \nPublic feedback to the initial plans set out in the 2018 review changed 50% of the initial plans."

      "text": "Wales now has the highest proportion of children in the UK being cared for by the state, prompting one expert to raise concerns.\nThere are 7,170 children being looked after away from home in Wales - which is 1.14% of children.\nThe rate has steadily increased since 2003, when it was 0.64% - while the current UK average is 0.72% of children.\nThe Welsh government said reducing the number in care was a priority.\nDonald Forrester, director of Cardiff University's Children's Social Care Research and Development Centre, said there were many factors behind the statistics, including poverty.\nBut he also told BBC Wales' Newyddion S4C programme that a lot of the increase did not seem \"to be because of changes in things like deprivation\". \nHe said a child in Wales was 50% more likely than a child in England to be placed into care, and also pointed to varying rates across Welsh council areas as proof there were other factors behind Wales' high rates.\n\"Since 2003, there's been an 80% increase in the numbers of children in care in Wales. In Carmarthenshire, the rate has stayed exactly the same,\" said Prof Forrester.\n\"A child in Torfaen is five times more likely to be in care than a child in Carmarthenshire. Some of that may be down to deprivation, but a lot seems to also be about the way some local authorities practise.\nProf Forrester said nobody was saying no children should be in care.\n\"But as a country, we need to be confident we're doing everything we can to help families stay together before a child comes into care,\" he said.\n\"The big variations between local authorities in Wales and the differences between Wales and England means this is really something we need to be looking at much more closely.\"  \nAngharad Roberts, who lives on Anglesey, was put into care aged two. One of seven siblings, she said although \"there was a lot of love\" at home, her parents \"couldn't look after\" the children.\nSeparated from her brothers and sisters, between the ages of two and nine she was moved six times. \nShe then spent seven years with one foster family before moving once more for the final two years of full-time education.\nShe said she faced difficulties while growing up as a result of being placed in care.\n\"I felt lonely and I didn't like it. I had to move around, live with different families, go to different schools.\"\n\"I found it difficult to settle down and make friends. And also to build a relationship with my foster parents because I thought I'll be leaving soon, what's the point?\"\nChild psychologist Mair Edwards said, from her experience, a more cautious approach was often taken in Wales when it came to child protection. \nShe said she believed this was positive for the country.\n\"Wales generally, and Welsh local authorities take child protection extremely seriously,\" she said.\n\"I work across the border in England occasionally, and there are times there where someone comes across cases where children should have been put into care much earlier. \n\"So I see it as a positive that local authorities here take child protection seriously.\"\nIn England, the UK government said its education secretary had been clear the social care system was not always delivering a better quality of life for those it was designed to help, and an independent review of children's social services was being undertaken to tackle inconsistencies across the country.\nThe Welsh government said: \"We are committed to providing more services for parents whose children are at risk of coming into care and exploring ways of reforming services for looked after children and care leavers. \n\"This includes providing resources to enable children placed outside of Wales to be placed closer to home and strengthening public bodies' role as corporate parent.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives called for action \"before we see another lost generation in Wales\".\nSocial services spokesman Gareth Davies said: \"A lack of improvement in our education system, combined with a failure to lift our most desperate communities out of poverty, has created an uneven playing field where far too many children are left behind, never to realise their full potential.\""

He also fronted The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise. \nThe Bachelor and The Bachelorette revolve around a single man or woman selecting a potential spouse from a pool of suitors. \nThe news of Harrison's permanent exit came a day after season 17 of The Bachelorette began without him. Former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe are the show's hosts instead.\nIn February, Harrison \"stepped aside\" and apologised for \"speaking in a manner that perpetuates racism\" during an interview with former Bachelorette Rachelle Lindsay. \nIn the interview, he commented on photos showing The Bachelor contestant Rachael Kirkconnell at a ball themed around a slavery-era plantation when she was 18.\nHarrison later issued a longer apology, saying: \"By excusing historical racism, I defended it. I invoked the term 'woke police', which is unacceptable. I am ashamed over how uninformed I was. I was so wrong.\"\nKirkconnell also apologised, saying: \"At one point, I didn't recognise how offensive and racist my actions were, but that doesn't excuse them.\n\"My age or when it happened does not excuse anything. They are not acceptable or okay in any sense. I was ignorant, but my ignorance was racist.\"\nIn June 2020, fans of the ABC show petitioned for it to address the unequal treatment of cast members of colour.\nAt the forefront of that initiative was Lindsay, who at the time was the only black lead to have ever served on The Bachelorette.\nThe show responded with a promise to address their race issues by casting more people of colour, and announced The Bachelor's first black lead, Matt James, for the series in which Kirkconnell was a contestant.\nShe ended up winning, and she and James are still in a relationship.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Climate change,Renewable energy in the UK,Renewable energy",
      "text": "Sales of halogen lightbulbs are to be banned in the UK from September, with fluorescent lights to follow, under government climate change plans. \nThe move will cut 1.26 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year and deliver consumers savings, officials say. \nThe UK began phasing out the sale of higher-energy halogen lightbulbs in 2018 under EU-wide rules.\nNow retailers will no longer be able to sell most remaining halogen bulbs, such as kitchen spotlights.\nLegislation for the plans is being brought forward this month by the government. \nThe plan will help continue the shift to low-energy LED lightbulbs, which account for about two-thirds of lights now sold in Britain.\nIt is expected to mean LEDs will account for 85% of all bulbs sold by 2030, officials said.\nLED lights last five times longer than traditional halogen bulbs and produce the same amount of light, but use up to 80% less power.\nTo help people to choose the most efficient lightbulbs, changes to the energy labels that consumers see on bulb packaging are being brought in, with the A+, A++ and A+++ ratings abandoned and efficiency graded between A-G, with only the most efficient bulbs given an A rating.\nLED bulbs could be incorporated into the fluorescent light fittings as a more energy-efficient alternative, officials said. \nLegislation will also include moves to phase out high-energy fluorescent lightbulbs - such as strip lights commonly found in offices - with a view to bringing an end to their sale from September 2023.\nThere was a time when the humble light bulb became the centre of a political storm over \"green madness\".\nThe EU had announced a ban on old-fashioned incandescent bulbs - the ones that give off more heat than light and use a lot of electricity in the process.\nIt was a move that led to a campaign of resistance with one newspaper even giving away the bulbs to encourage their use.\nBut this latest move - the final step in ending sales of halogen lights - comes in very different times. \nMany types of halogen bulbs were already banned several years ago, so this is a tightening of the screw on energy waste rather than a massive upheaval.\nBut it does provide another signal that if the UK is to meet its promises to tackle the heating of the climate, every sector of the economy - in fact almost every aspect of our lives - will have to see some kind of change.  \nThe cut in carbon emissions as a result of the new rules is the equivalent of removing more than half a million cars from the UK's roads, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial strategy said. \nIt is part of a package of measures which it says will save consumers money and includes the right to get goods repaired, new energy labels and higher efficiency standards for white goods, TVs and other appliances.\nEnergy minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: \"We're phasing out old inefficient halogen bulbs for good, so we can move more quickly to longer-lasting LED bulbs, meaning less waste and a brighter and cleaner future for the UK.\n\"By helping ensure electrical appliances use less energy but perform just as well, we're saving households money on their bills and helping tackle climate change.\"\nStephen Rouatt, chief executive of Signify UK, which owns Philips lighting, said: \"Using energy-efficient LED equivalents for halogen and fluorescent lighting on an even broader scale will significantly help the UK on its journey to decarbonisation, as well as lowering the annual electricity bills for consumers.\""

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Shirley-Anne Somerville",
      "text": "Scottish school pupils will have the right to appeal their assessment grades - but could see them revised up or down, the education secretary has said.\nShirley-Anne Somerville told MSPs that there would be a \"direct right of appeal\" for pupils when Higher and National 5 results come out in August.\nBut she said a \"fair, consistent and credible\" system would have to be able to revise grades down as well as up.\nOpposition parties said this made appeals a \"perverse gamble\" for pupils.\nGrades are to be based on teacher judgements - without the use of any algorithms or the past performance of schools - after exams were cancelled for the second year running due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMs Somerville - who recently replaced John Swinney as education secretary - told MSPs that ensuring young people are able to achieve \"fair and credible grades\" despite the ongoing pandemic was the government's \"absolute priority\".\nShe said she took \"very seriously\" the anxiety and concern of some young people, parents and teachers about the model being used, but insisted it was \"the fairest possible\" in a challenging set of circumstances.\nNational 5, Higher and Advanced Higher exams have all been cancelled, with grades to be based on the \"professional judgements\" of teachers and what learners have demonstrated during the school year.\nHowever due to the second national lockdown from the start of the year, much of the assessment work done by teachers has come in the final weeks of term - leading to claims these are \"exams by another name\".\nMs Somerville said parents and pupils have been listened to, adding: \"Awarding qualifications will always be challenging under these circumstances, but we believe that the model we have is the fairest solution in the interests of young people.\"\nAnd she said there would be a \"direct right of appeal\" for all pupils for the first time, which would be free at the point of use.\nGrounds for appeal will include disagreement with the \"academic judgement\" behind grades, administrative or procedural errors or appeals related to the Equality Act, including assessment arrangements.\nAppeals will be assessed by subject specialists, but Ms Somerville said the system must be \"symmetrical\" - meaning they can move grades up, down or leave them unchanged.\nShe said: \"Without symmetry, there would not be a full and fair review of the evidence. This could be perceived as unfair to other learners and raise questions over the credibility of qualifications awarded this year.  \n\"In adopting a symmetrical approach to appeals, judgements at appeal will be made on individual learners' work only and not on an algorithm or on a school's past performance.\"\nOpposition parties were critical of the plans, with Green MSP Ross Greer arguing for a \"no detriment\" approach to appeals where grade could not be revised down.\nHe said lacking such a system made appeals a \"perverse gamble\", adding: \"Schools will support the strongest evidence they have in support of the initial grade - why would they have stronger evidence suitable for an appeal which they chose not to submit in the first place?\n\"It seems the risk of downgrading is increased by an appeals process reliant purely on limited and likely weaker evidence, rather than on the professional judgement of teachers.\"\nMs Somerville replied that it was \"exceptionally rare\" for pupils to have grades reduced on appeal, saying this happened in eight cases out of 13,000 in 2017 and one among 11,000 in 2019.\nThe Children and Young People's Commissioner, Bruce Adamson, said it was disappointing that grades could be marked down on appeal, saying this was \"an unnecessary and disempowering barrier to young people\" and could exacerbate anxiety for pupils.\nLiam Fowley, vice chairman of the Scottish Youth Parliament, said the appeals process is \"simply not acceptable\" and fails to take into account the \"exceptional circumstances\" faced by young people during the pandemic. \nThe Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) teaching union meanwhile welcomed much of the statement, saying staff were doing \"a quite phenomenal amount of work\" to deliver grades amid the pandemic.\nHowever the NASUWT union - which opposed the current certification model - raised concerns that teachers might have to be available during the summer holidays to engage with the appeals process, despite already facing \"overwhelming and unacceptable levels of workload and anxiety\".\nAppeals are always part of the exams system in Scotland but arguably the role they play this year is much more important. \nNormally appeals are made through schools and for a limited number of reasons, usually a pupil has to have been given a worse grade in the final exam than their teacher predicted. \nAllowing pupils to appeal directly to the SQA and for a wider range of reasons will be welcomed by young people. \nWhat will not be as welcome is the fact that grades can be revised down as well as up. \nThis is normal practice, but many argue that this year that option should be off the table to account for the disruption young people have faced and that this could be seen as downgrading teacher judgement.\nMeanwhile, BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme has found that more than 6,500 pupils have been using a website set up to cheat in this year's assessments. \nIt comes after it was revealed last month that details of assessments were being shared by pupils on TikTok.\nEach school has its own arrangements and set its own assessments, but the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has provided question papers which they can use - and many have been shared on an \"anti SQA\" site online.\nIn some cases, these papers - at Advanced Higher, Higher and National 5 - are being shared in their entirety, along with answers.\nScottish Conservative education spokesman Oliver Mundell said assessment papers were available online \"on an industrial scale\".\n\"Nobody condones attempts to cheat, but SNP ministers were too busy trying to paint a rosy picture instead of tackling the reality for pupils,\" he said.\nA Scottish government spokesman said the SQA had taken action to contact schools \"to ensure that posts were removed as soon as possible and to reiterate the importance of security arrangements around assessment materials\".\nLabour education spokesman Michael Marra said he had been contacted be \"very many\" angry parents, saying the publication of the appeal process was \"well over a month late\" and came 20 days before teachers have to submit grades.\nAnd he said there had been reports of \"widespread variation\" in the way pupils have been assessed, with complaints that some had faced multiple assessments in a short period of time.\nLib Dem MSP Beatrice Wishart said a constituent had told her the current system was the worst model possible, saying it had \"increased stress levels\" for pupils and that there were \"no excuses left\" for the SQA."

      "text": "A \"sadistic\" paedophile targeted almost 2,000 victims online, blackmailing them into sending him degrading images of themselves and abusing others.\nAbdul Elahi, of Birmingham, also ran encrypted digital \"master classes\" to train paedophiles to avoid detection, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.\nAt Birmingham Crown Court, he admitted 158 offences against 79 victims.\nThe NCA said it was \"some of the most sickening sexual offending\" it had seen and that the scale was \"industrial\".\n\"The investigation team have been horrified by Elahi's sadistic depravity and stunned by the industrial scale of his worldwide offending,\" Tom Cook, from the NCA, said.\nDetectives, who believe there are many more victims, said the 26-year-old would operate by targeting people across the world on so-called sugar daddy websites, promising thousands for posed images.\nThe victims ages on the charge sheet range from between eight months to adults, the NCA said.\nHe singled out victims who were in debt or too young to legitimately be on the sites, tricking them into sending naked or partially clothed images of themselves, the NCA said.\nWhen he had received enough material, the agency said he would then threaten to expose the victims while blackmailing them to send more extreme footage and photos.\nSimultaneously, he would sell the graphic content in \"box sets\" through encrypted platforms, making upwards of \u00a325,000 in the process, according to the NCA.\nHe forced victims to abuse themselves in various ways including self-mutilation, blackmailing women to send him footage of them abusing young children and making girls abuse siblings, the NCA said.\nThe Revenge Porn Helpline said it had been working with the NCA to remove the online content for more than 18 months.\n\"We have managed to remove thousands of images but there is more outstanding and this work will continue for many months to come,\" said Sophie Mortimer, from the charity.\n\"This content is some of the most extreme that the helpline has ever dealt with.\"\nElahi was arrested in December 2018 following allegations he was blackmailing a 15-year-old girl in the United States.

      "tags": "NI Brexit,David Frost,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU says its patience is \"wearing very thin\" with the UK in talks aimed at avoiding a post-Brexit trade war.\nTop EU official Maros Sefcovic said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit \"divorce\" settlement.\nThe UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation.\nBoris Johnson said a solution that protects trade flows and the peace process was \"easily doable\".\nAnd he dismissed talk of a trade war with the EU, saying he was \"not worried\" it would overshadow the G7 summit.\nThe prime minister is in Cornwall, where he will host the leaders of the world's richest nations, including US President Joe Biden, who is said to have \"deep\" concerns that a UK-EU trade row could endanger peace in Northern Ireland.\nAsked about this, Mr Johnson said everyone needed to be \"absolutely clear\" that the purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol - the part of the Brexit deal at the centre of the row - was to \"uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to make sure that we keep the balance in relationships in Northern Ireland\".\nHe said he was \"optimistic\" a solution could be found that \"protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom\". \nTalks between Mr Sefcovic - a vice-president of the European Commission - and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost broke up earlier without agreement.\nMr Sefcovic said he was \"positive we can find a solution\" but added: \"Our patience really is wearing very, very thin, and therefore we have to assess all options we have at our disposal.\"\nThis could include legal action, arbitration or retaliatory trade measures such as tariffs, he explained.\nHe said \"trust\" had to be restored between the two sides, after the UK had broken the terms of the 2019 Northern Ireland protocol.\nA key flashpoint is a looming ban on the export of sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nGreat Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules but Northern Ireland does - because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\nEU food safety rules do not allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members like the UK. Frozen meat is not covered by the rules.\nIn January, the two sides agreed a six month \"grace\" period to allow companies to set up alternative supply chains, but that runs out at the end of June.\nThe UK has already held back from carrying out full checks on supermarket goods and parcels moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, prompting the EU to accuse the UK of undermining the protocol and to begin legal proceedings.\nMr Sefcovic said: \"If the UK were to take further unilateral action in the coming weeks the EU will not be shy in acting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure the UK abides by its international obligations.\"\nA UK source close to the negotiations said: \"Nobody wants to get into a trade war or anything close to it.\"\nIt was \"much better to find agreed ways forward\", added the source, and \"the people in Northern Ireland want solutions not threats\".\n\"But unfortunately we have got used to living in an atmosphere where there are threats.\"\nAsked by ITV's Robert Peston if the UK would take unilateral action, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said \"we're not at that stage yet but we've said we will keep all options open.\"\nThere's a clash of cultures at the heart of this increasingly serious dispute. \nThe EU is a union of laws and rules - and once it has an agreement it tends to stick to the details. \nThe British government, on the other hand, decided to kick some of the details down the road in its desire to \"Get Brexit Done\". \nBut those details never went away, and now they are threatening to provoke another crisis in Britain's relationship with Europe, and to destabilise Northern Ireland.  \nDuring the 2019 general election campaign Boris Johnson said there would be no checks on goods moving in either direction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of his Brexit deal, even though official documents at the time made clear that there would be.\nNow his government says the EU needs to show more flexibility, that it's being too legalistic. \nThe practicalities of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full are certainly pretty challenging. Northern Ireland's chief vet recently told Assembly members in Belfast that it would require more checks on food than are done in the whole of the EU. And he only has 12 vets. \nThe EU says it is prepared to be flexible, but says the UK cannot walk away from its legal obligations. \nBoth sides talk about \"considering all our options\" if a compromise can't be found. \nIn public at least, it's hard to see where the common ground lies. \nMr Sefcovic said the EU had offered a temporary solution to the chilled meats row, ahead of a comprehensive trade deal, but he said the UK was not prepared to accept it because it would involve signing up to EU food standards.\n\"Ideology prevails over what is good for the people of Northern Ireland,\" he added.\nSpeaking after his meeting with Mr Sefcovic, Lord Frost said the protocol was \"being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation\".\n\"There weren't any breakthroughs, there weren't any breakdowns either and we are going to carry on talking,\" he added.\n\"What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions, which support the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal.\"\nLord Frost said the EU was insisting that the two sides \"operate the protocol in an extremely purist way\" and he did not see any problem with continuing to allow exports of chilled meats.\n\"We don't see what risk is caused to Northern Ireland if chilled meats are imported there from GB.\"\nNorthern Ireland's deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who also took part in the meeting - challenged the UK government to \"honour its commitments\" on the Brexit protocol.\n\"Certainly there's a frustration that the British government have signed up to this agreement, however they have failed to bring forward ways to implement the Protocol in its entirety,\" she added."

      "tags": "Amazon",
      "text": "A major outage has affected a number of high profile websites including Amazon, Reddit and Twitch.\nThe UK government website - gov.uk - was also down as were the Financial Times, the Guardian and the New York Times.\nCloud computing provider Fastly, which underpins a lot of websites, said it was behind the problems.\nThe firm said there had been issues with its global content delivery network (CDN) which it was fixing. \nIn a statement, it said: \"We identified a service configuration that triggered disruption across our POPs (points of presence) globally and have disabled that configuration.\"\nA POP allows content to be sent from globally distributed servers that are close to the end user.\n\"Our global network is coming back online.\"\nThe issues began at around 11:00 BST and lasted for an hour. Other affected websites included CNN and streaming sites Twitch and Hulu. The outage also broke some parts of other services, including Twitter's emojis.\nWebsites were also beginning to be restored, after around an hour of downtime.\nFastly runs what is known as an \"edge cloud\", which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, as well as protect them from denial-of-service attacks and help them when traffic is peaking.\nIt currently looks as if the problems were localised, meaning specific locations across Europe and the US were affected.\nOther websites knocked offline included:\nSimilar problems have also affected Amazon Web Services and Cloudflare in the past, two other huge cloud computing firms.\nSome websites managed to find workarounds to the problem, with tech site The Verge taking to Google Docs to publish its news, but forgetting to limit those who could write on it, leading to a series of amusing edits and tweets.\nThe hashtag \"InternetOutage\" was soon trending on social media as more and more broken websites were discovered.\nThe disruption has led some to question the wisdom of having so much internet infrastructure in the hands of a few companies.\nJake Moore, a cyber-specialist at security firm ESET said: \"This highlights the importance and significance of these vast hosting companies and what they represent.\"\nAdam Smith, a software testing expert with the BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, said outages with content delivery networks \"highlight the growing ecosystem of complex and coupled components that are involved in delivering internet services\".\n\"Because of this, outages are increasingly hitting multiple sites and services at the same time.\"\nStephen Gilderdale, senior director at Dell Technologies, said such outages were bound to occur occasionally but that they would be rare and brief.\n\"Cloud providers build in redundancies for such events to give their users secure access to replicated copies of data. \n\"In most cases, services are only affected for a short time, and data is easily retrievable. Far from being a cause of concern, it shows the resilience of the network that it can recover so quickly.\"\nIt is estimated that even an hour's worth of downtime could cost companies up to $250,000 (\u00a3176,000), and some lawyers think there could be compensation claims.\n\"Liability for loss of service will probably be covered by the service level agreement with customers of paid-for cloud services but the agreements will typically not cover all losses sustained,\" said Prof Rebecca Parry of Nottingham Law School.

      "tags": "Elon Musk,Amazon,Tax,Tax avoidance,Jeff Bezos,George Soros",
      "text": "Details claiming to reveal how little income tax US billionaires pay have been leaked to a news website. \nProPublica says it has seen the tax returns of some of the world's richest people, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett.\nThe website alleges Amazon's Mr Bezos paid no tax in 2007 and 2011, while Tesla's Mr Musk paid nothing in 2018.\nA White House spokeswoman called the leak \"illegal\", and the FBI and tax authorities are investigating. \nProPublica said it was analysing what it called a \"vast trove of Internal Revenue Service data\" on the taxes of the billionaires, and would release further details over coming weeks.\nWhile the BBC has not been able to confirm the claims, the alleged leak comes at a time of growing debate about the amount of tax paid by the wealthy and widening inequality.\nProPublica said the richest 25 Americans pay less in tax - an average of 15.8% of adjusted gross income - than most mainstream US workers.\nJesse Eisinger, senior reporter and editor at ProPublica, told the Today Programme: \"We were pretty astonished that you could get [tax] down to zero if you were a multi-billionaire. Actually paying zero in tax really floored us. Ultra-wealthy people can sidestep the system in an entirely legal way.\" \n\"They have enormous ability to find deductions, find credits and exploit loopholes in the system,\" he said.  \nSo while the value of their wealth grows enormously through their ownership of shares in their company, that's not recorded as income. \nBut there's more than that, he said: \"They also take aggressive tax deductions, often because they have borrowed to fund their lifestyle.\" \nHe said US billionaires buy an asset, build one or inherit a fortune, and then borrow against their wealth.  \nBecause they don't realise any gains or sell any stock, they're not taking any income, which could be taxed.  \n\"They then borrow from a bank at a relatively low interest rate, live off that and can use the interest expenses as deductions on their income,\" he said. \nThe website said that \"using perfectly legal tax strategies, many of the uber-rich are able to shrink their federal tax bills to nothing or close to it\" even as their wealth soared over the past few years.\nThe wealthy, as with many ordinary citizens, are able to reduce their income tax bills via such things as charitable donations and drawing money from investment income rather than wage income.\nProPublica, using data collected by Forbes magazine, said the wealth of the 25 richest Americans collectively jumped by $401bn from 2014 to 2018 - but they paid $13.6bn in income tax over those years. \nPresident Joe Biden has vowed to increase tax on the richest Americans as part of a mission to improve equality and raise money for his massive infrastructure investment programme.\nHe wants to raise the top rate of tax, double the tax on what high earners make from investments, and change inheritance tax.\nHowever, ProPublica's analysis concluded: \"While some wealthy Americans, such as hedge fund managers, would pay more taxes under the current Biden administration proposals, the vast majority of the top 25 would see little change.\"\nOne of the billionaires mentioned, the philanthropist George Soros, is also alleged to have paid minimal tax. His office had not replied to a BBC request for comment, but said in a statement to ProPublica that Mr Soros did not owe tax some years because of losses on investments.\nThe statement also pointed out that he had long supported higher taxes on America's wealthiest people.\nAccording to reports in the US, Michael Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York whose tax details were among the documents, said the disclosure raised privacy concerns and he would use \"legal means\" to uncover the source of the leak.\nProPublica, an investigative website, has written several articles about how budget cuts at the US Internal Revenue Service have hampered its ability to enforce tax rules on the wealthy and large corporations. The news organisation said it received the leaked documents in response to these articles. \nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that \"any unauthorised disclosure of confidential government information\" is illegal.\nTreasury Department spokeswoman Lily Adams said in an emailed statement to Reuters that the matter has been referred to the FBI, federal prosecutors and two internal Treasury Department watchdogs, \"all of whom have independent authority to investigate\".\nUS Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig said: \"I can't speak to anything with respect to specific taxpayers. I can confirm that there is an investigation, with respect to the allegations that the source of the information in that article came from the Internal Revenue Service.\"\nWhat's going wrong here? Let's take a very simplified analysis. If the shares I own in the company I founded are worth \u00a31bn at the beginning of the tax year and rise to a value of \u00a32bn by the end of the tax year - how much income tax do I owe? Easy - zero. Because while I am twice as rich, I received zero income.\nOn the other hand, if I have zero assets, and I make \u00a330,000 in income, I will pay roughly \u00a36,000 in income tax and national insurance. That's why the revelations that some of the richest Americans paid little or no income tax may provoke outrage but should not come as a surprise. It's not comparing apples with apples. \nThat's not to say these super rich folks have no money coming in to pay their yacht bills. There is a widespread tactic employed by the rich to borrow cash secured against their vast wealth - which again is not income - it's proceeds of a loan and here's the (perfectly legal) biscuit-taking bit. \nThe interest on that loan can be deducted from any other income to further reduce income tax liability. It sounds egregious - but it's legal. \nSmall wonder that many politicians around the world (Elizabeth Warren in the US and Jeremy Corbyn/John McDonnell in the UK) and academics such as Thomas Piketty have argued that we need a way to tax wealth, not income. \nThe billionaire in our example WILL pay capital gains, currently 20% in UK, the moment he or she sells those shares and realises a profit\nUNLESS, that is, the profit is sunk into another business, which the tax system as it stands is designed to encourage to promote economic growth and new jobs - jobs that will produce income and therefore tax.\nThat, say its defenders, is capitalism at work - but as with the new global consensus on taxing multinationals - the clamour for tax change is getting louder.

      "text": "Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire will receive extra help to tackle a rise in the Delta variant. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said a \"strengthened package of support\" would be provided to boost Covid vaccinations and testing. \nIt will include military support and supervised in-school testing in the areas hardest hit.\nPeople have also been advised to minimise travel in and out of the area and avoid meeting indoors.\nGreater Manchester and parts of Lancashire have been identified as places where the so-called Indian variant, now named the Delta variant by the World Health Organization, is spreading the fastest.\nAs part of the government guidance, residents are also being encouraged to get tested twice a week and continue to work from home if possible. \nSchools can also reintroduce face coverings in communal areas if advised to do so by directors of public health.\nMr Hancock said the package was based on \"what's working in Bolton\" which saw its infection rates drop after being offered enhanced support. \n\"We know that this approach can work, we've seen it work in south London and in Bolton in stopping a rise in the number of cases,\" he said.\n\"This is the next stage of tackling the pandemic in Manchester and in Lancashire, and of course it's vital that people in these areas - as everywhere else - come forward and get the jab as soon as they're eligible because that is our way out of this pandemic together.\" \nThe Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said people should be cautious and vigilant but should \"carry on living their lives\". \n\"This is guidance, it is advice to the public, it is not a lockdown, it is not a ban,\" he said. \n\"This is not about telling people to cancel their plans, it is asking them to be careful in setting any new ones, to minimise non-essential travel and that in our view is a sensible approach given the rise in cases.\" \nNHS North West medical director Dr David Levy said the vaccine rollout has had \"a tremendous impact\" on reducing the number of Covid cases.\nBut he urged anyone who is eligible for the vaccine to book their jab as \"things are very different this time\". \n\"What we are seeing is younger patients coming into our North West hospitals at the moment,\" he told BBC North West Tonight.\nThe tactics deployed in Bolton over the past month are now being seen as the template for how to curb the Delta variant. \nWhen infection rates took off in early May the area was flooded with testing, while there was a big push on getting people to come forward for vaccination - the numbers receiving their first jab more than trebled in the space of a few weeks.\nThe result has seen a drop in infection rates - they are down by more than a quarter in the past 10 days - without the need to impose extra restrictions.\nWith other parts of Greater Manchester seeing big rises, the hope now is that the tactics will work on a wider footprint.\nBut these tactics have their limitations. At the moment the rise in cases in England is largely being drive by what is happening in the North West - more than 40% of all cases over the past week were in this region.\nIf other parts of the country start to see more significant rises, the approach becomes more difficult to pull off as resources become more stretched.\nThe new support and advice has been issued to all 10 boroughs in Greater Manchester as well as places within the Lancashire County Council area. \nThose include Burnley, Chorley, Fylde, Hyndburn, Lancaster, Pendle, Preston, Ribble Valley, Rossendale, South Ribble, West Lancashire and Wyre.\nDr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health for Lancashire County Council, said Covid cases were \"continuing to rise at a worrying pace\". \nHe said the council had been pushing to extend the surge testing and vaccinations, which was already being rolled out in Burnley.\n\"The government has listened to our calls and has now agreed to provide Lancashire with enhanced support, which gives us more flexibility to fight this new wave of infections,\" he added. \nLatest government figures showed that 18 of the top 20 areas with the highest infection rates in England in the week leading up to 4 June were in Greater Manchester or Lancashire, with the neighbouring Cheshire East borough one of the other two.\nBlackburn with Darwen had the highest rate with 556.5 cases per 100,000 people, while in second-placed Bolton and third-placed Rossendale the rates dropped to 320.3 cases and 310.6 cases respectively over the same period.\nThe other areas in the top 10 - Hyndburn, Burnley, Ribble Valley, Preston and South Ribble in Lancashire and the Greater Manchester boroughs of Salford and Manchester - all also saw rates rise.\nA total of 5.7m people live in areas of England covered by the government's enhanced coronavirus guidance, which is the equivalent of 10% of the population.\nAcross the UK there have been a further 6,048 coronavirus cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to Tuesday's daily government figures.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Enderby,Narborough,DNA",
      "text": "A double child killer who was the first murderer to be convicted using DNA evidence can be released, the Parole Board has confirmed. \nColin Pitchfork, 61, was jailed for life for raping and murdering 15-year-olds Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth in Leicestershire in the 1980s.\nPitchfork has spent 33 years in prison - he was last denied parole in 2018.\nThe Parole Board said it was satisfied Pitchfork was suitable for release, which is subject to conditions.\n\"Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care. Protecting the public is our number one priority,\" a Parole Board spokesman said.\nThe decision is provisional for 21 days, the spokesman added.\nIn a document explaining its decision, the Parole Board said at the time of the offences, Pitchfork had been someone who thought \"about sex a lot\" and used \"violence and excessive force\" and \"sex to demonstrate power and control over women\".\nHe also struggled to cope with anger, loneliness and had a willingness to \"seek revenge\".\nBut in prison, the Parole Board said he had taken part in several courses to address his behaviour and the panel heard Pitchfork's \"behaviour in custody had been positive and had included extensive efforts to help others\", including learning skills to help disabled people.\nThe panel concluded: \"After considering the circumstances of his offending, the progress made while in custody and the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel was satisfied that Mr Pitchfork was suitable for release.\"\nA source close to Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the government would take legal advice to explore the use of the \"reconsideration mechanism\".\nThe Parole Board Reconsideration Mechanism, introduced in 2019, gives people the right to ask for a decision to be looked at again if they believe it was \"procedurally unfair\" or \"irrational\".\nSouth Leicestershire MP Alberto Costa, who had met with the Parole Board over Pitchfork's case, told the BBC he was \"appalled\" at the news.\n\"Even though some 30 years have passed, this isn't the sort of crime one can ever forget,\" he said.\n\"My constituents remember the victims, people who went to school with these victims.\n\"It would be immoral, wrong and frankly dangerous to release this disgraceful murderer of two children.\"\nHe added he would be lobbying Mr Buckland to block the release.\n\"I will work my socks off to make sure [the decision] is reconsidered and he is kept behind bars,\" he said.\nSpeaking to the BBC when Pitchfork was last denied parole, Lynda's mother Kath Eastwood said: \"The Parole Board have made the right decision [and] put the families of the victims first and listened to us before the murderer.\n\"Let us hope this continues.\"\nWhen Colin Pitchfork was given a life sentence, it came with a minimum term that he had to serve behind bars as punishment, before he could ask experts to review whether he would be safe for release on what's known as a \"licence\". \nThat's a set of controls on his movements and activities that he must abide by for the rest of his days. \nIf he breaks any of the 35 conditions, he can be immediately taken back to jail - and so his life sentence hangs over him forever. \nOnly a tiny fraction of offenders are subject to a \"whole life\" order, because the system acknowledges many offenders may become less dangerous as they respond to rehabilitation programmes over the years. \nThe judges and other experts who make up the Parole Board can only authorise a lifer's release on licence if the evidence shows that it is no longer necessary to hold the offender in prison for public protection. \nThe families can petition the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland to ask the Parole Board to think again - but a review would have to show that it would be irrational to release Pitchfork on the available evidence. Mr Buckland cannot overturn the decision because of political or media pressure. But Parliament can change the law. MPs will get the chance to do so when they vote on a government proposal that future premeditated child killers are considered for whole life terms when they are convicted and sentenced. \nPitchfork's parole hearing was held via video link on 22 March and included evidence from his probation office and a prison service psychologist.\nThe board then considered the evidence along with an examination of the \"robustness\" of the risk management plan before concluding its review on 25 May.\nThe decision to direct Pitchfork's release was published on Monday. \nHis release is subject to a number of licence conditions. \nThese include living at a designated address, taking part in probation supervision, wearing an electronic tag, taking part in lie detector tests and having to disclose what vehicles he uses and who he speaks to, with particular limits on contact with children.\nHe will also be subject to a curfew, have restrictions on using technology and limits on where he can go.\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said: \"We understand this will be an extremely upsetting decision for the families of Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth and our heartfelt sympathies remain with them.\n\"If Colin Pitchfork is released, he will be closely supervised by the probation service for the rest of his life and can be brought back to prison if he breaks the strict conditions he will be subject to.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

On 24 May, the State Department had issued a warning against the country, citing a new wave of Covid-19 cases.\nThe CDC said it also expects more countries to get lower ratings in the coming weeks. \nIt comes after the bosses of all airlines that offer UK-US flights and Heathrow Airport issued a joint call for a trans-Atlantic travel \"corridor\" on Monday.\nThe group said it would be \"essential to igniting economic recovery\" in a statement and urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson and President Joe Biden to discuss the possibility at the upcoming G7 meeting.\nShai Weiss, the boss of Virgin Atlantic, said on Monday: \"There is no reason for the US to be absent from the UK green list. This overly cautious approach fails to reap the benefits of the successful vaccination programmes in both the UK and the US.\"\nAdding the US to the green list would remove the need for quarantine on return to the UK. Passengers would, however, still need to have proof of a negative Covid test result on departure.\n\"Customers, families and businesses need to book and travel with confidence.

      "text": "Millions of Covid vaccines could be wasted if rich countries send large amounts of leftover doses to poorer nations in one go, Unicef has warned.\nThe charity said there needed to be a steady supply throughout the year because poor countries do not have resources to use them all at once.\nThe UK and others have promised to donate their surplus doses - but they have been asked to give more earlier.\nStars including Billie Eilish and David Beckham are backing Unicef's plea.\nThe celebrities have signed a letter to the G7 group of rich countries - including the UK - asking them to donate 20% of their vaccines by August.\n\"The pandemic will not be over anywhere until it is over everywhere,\" said Beckham. \nThe other stars who have signed the letter include Andy Murray, Olivia Colman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Payne, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Orlando Bloom, Katy Perry, Gemma Chan, Whoopi Goldberg, Claudia Schiffer and Chris Hoy.\nUnicef's vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight that countries needed to vaccinate their own populations at the same time as the rest of the world.\n\"At some point, no doubt, we will need to vaccinate under-18s,\" she said. \"But the priority at this moment has to be making sure that all of the vulnerable and priority groups around the world get vaccines.\n\"So we're saying countries like the UK and the G7 need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home.\"\nBut last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said vaccinating children in the UK would take priority over sending doses abroad.\nUnlike other countries, the UK has not revealed how many doses it plans to donate to the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme, saying only that it will donate its excess doses. On Friday Mr Hancock said the UK did not currently have any spare doses.\nEarlier this week more than 100 former prime ministers, presidents and foreign ministers urged leaders of the G7 countries to pay two-thirds of the \u00a346.6bn needed to vaccinate low-income countries against Covid.\nEx-PM Tony Blair said the \"reality\" was that governments are \"obliged to look after [their] own people\" and so will always prioritise vaccinating their own country first.\nBut he said, \"you can't be absolutist about this, there may be some vaccine that we can ship out in advance\".\nAnother former UK PM, Gordon Brown, said the G7 and other wealthy nations \"should pay their share\" to help parts of Africa and Asia.\nHe said it should not be left to a \"whip round\" to deal with a \"disease that has got to be brought under control.\"\nUnicef's Ms Caprani called on G7 countries to start donating jabs now as well as throughout the summer and the rest of the year.\n\"Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers,\" she said.\n\"The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won't be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy.\" \nIn their letter, the celebrities said Unicef was already delivering vaccines in poor countries - but the charity was 190 million doses short.\nThe letter said the G7 countries  - the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US - will soon have enough to donate 20% of their doses between June and August without significant delay to their own rollouts, and doing that would provide more than 150 million doses to Covax.\n\"The virus is still spreading in many countries and producing new variants with the potential to put us all back where we started,\" said the letter to the G7 group.\nSome of the celebrities such as tennis star Murray are also urging people in the UK to donate to Unicef's VaccinAid appeal.\nSome countries, like the UK which has ordered 400 million doses of various vaccines, have already vaccinated a large proportion of their citizens.\nBut other countries are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax.\nAt the G7 summit later this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is planning to urge setting a target to vaccinate the world by the end of 2022.\nCampaigners and critics - as well as a group of MPs - say action needs to be taken now and Britain should donate a dose for every jab imported into the UK.\nThe UK government has already donated \u00a3548m in aid money to the Covax scheme, and half a billion doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab have been ordered by other countries and sent abroad. \nThe leaders of the seven G7 countries are meeting in Cornwall for their annual summit this weekend. \nThe US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to Covax. Like the UK, Canada is yet to put a figure on their planned contribution."

      "tags": "UK Parliament,UK aid",
      "text": "The government has \"no plans\" to offer MPs a vote on reversing \u00a34bn cuts to the overseas aid budget, No 10 has said.\nThe PM's spokesman argued the fall, from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income this year, was allowed under existing aid laws. \nIt puts ministers on a collision course with some Tory and opposition MPs, who say a vote on the cuts must take place.\nThey set out their case during an emergency Commons debate on Tuesday.\nIt came after a group of rebel Conservative MPs failed on Monday to overturn the cuts through a bill dealing with the UK's new research agency.\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle ruled their planned vote could not be allowed, as it was not within the remit of the law being debated at the time.\nBut he called on ministers to give the Commons \"the respect it deserves\" and find a way to offer MPs an \"effective\" vote on the issue.\nA leading rebel, Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, claimed the group would have had enough support to defeat the government if the vote had taken place.\nHe had previously pledged to \"use all the parliamentary procedures we can\" to force a vote on the issue, if their amendment was not selected.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, he said the government was denying MPs a vote because it \"fears it could lose\".\nHe added that the \"unethical\" and \"possibly illegal\" cuts also broke a Tory manifesto pledge at the 2019 general election to keep the 0.7% target.\nThe government reduced aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income this year, without changing the 2015 law that made the target binding.\nMinisters have argued this legislation allows the target to be temporarily missed in exceptional circumstances - and says the Covid pandemic counts.\nThe PM's spokesman repeated this argument on Tuesday, adding the law \"explicitly envisages the circumstances we now face\" in the pandemic.\nSome MPs and campaigners have rejected this argument - and have threatened legal action in a bid to force a vote on the spending.\nThe government has said there are no plans for a vote on the cut to overseas aid.\nBut that doesn't preclude the cut from being restored.\nSome of the Conservative rebels are hoping the chancellor will announce in due course - perhaps at the Spending Review - that the economy is on course to recover, and will say this allows him to gave a date for the 'temporary' reduction to end.\nBut the leading rebels are not pinning their hopes on wishful thinking.\nThey know that the Speaker is sympathetic to their argument that parliament is being by-passed.\nAnd to the fact that it is the government which is 'rebelling' against its own manifesto commitment.\nSo there are active discussions on what parliamentary mechanism could be used to force a vote.\nAs Sir Lindsay Hoyle has lived up to his pledge not overrule his officials - the 'Commons clerks' - then any mechanism which cuts the mustard with them would be watertight.\nAt that stage, the hope is this would force the government to set a date to restore the cut, rather than face a likely Commons defeat.\nBut I am told that there will be 'extra-parliamentary' action too - in other words, a campaign to highlight the concrete effects of the cuts - in an attempt to make those who are sceptical of aid spending in the abstract to think again.\nThe government insists it isn't cutting aid just because this is popular with some voters.\nMany former ministers are now determined to ensure that it's actually unpopular. \nDuring Tuesday's Commons debate, Treasury Minister Stephen Barclay said aid spending would return to the higher 0.7% level \"when the fiscal situation allows\" but did not specify a date.\nHe said the decision to cut spending had been \"difficult\", but was justified by the \"hugely difficult economic and fiscal situation\" caused by the pandemic. \nBacking the government's stance, Conservative backbencher Maria Miller said the \"fiscal crisis\" due to Covid also meant the move was right.\n\"It's not possible to continue with business as usual. These are not normal times,\" she added. \nFormer Prime Minister Theresa May was among several Tory ex-cabinet ministers backing the return to 0.7%, along with opposition MPs. \nMinisters will be relieved to avoid a vote on the aid cuts this week, ahead of welcoming world leaders from the G7 group for a summit in Cornwall. \nCampaigners have highlighted that the UK is the only member of the group of advanced economies to cut aid spending this year. \nBut the government has said that the UK remains one of the world's most generous spenders on aid, with spending above \u00a310bn this year.\nMPs may have to wait a while for another opportunity to force a vote on aid spending in the Commons. \nThis is because only a small number of government bills are due to receive detailed scrutiny in the coming months, following the start of the parliamentary year in May."

And therefore that is a natural reaction,\" he said.\nHowever, he added that it was \"inaccurate\" to say his team was only made up of his supporters.\n\"This team includes people who didn't vote for me, who did vote for me and who didn't declare their intentions,\" he said.\nMr Poots also rejected allegations made by some resigning DUP members that there had been bullying and intimidation from members of his camp during the leadership contest.\nHe said the DUP was \"a party that will reach out to people and I, as a leader, am not someone who is either scary or bullying - I want to nail that absolutely and factually\".\n\"If anybody wants to bring forward facts, they will be investigated, and they will be investigated fairly,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Poots announced his new ministerial team would be:\nThe appointments will come into effect on Monday, allowing Mrs Foster to host the British-Irish Council meeting in County Fermanagh on Friday. \nIt comes after Mr Poots admitted party members \"have been bruised\" over its leadership election. \nSpeaking to BBC NI's Spotlight, which is to be broadcast on Tuesday night, he described the resignations of a number of party members as \"peripheral, but nonetheless I don't want to lose anybody from the party\".\nHe also said the party could take \"a little time to heal\" and that he did not believe there had been attempts to sabotage his leadership. \nHis comments came after the resignation of DUP councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen, along with others in the party's South Down association.\nMr Hanna said there was a \"culture of fear\" in the party and claimed he witnessed \"bullying\" at last month's meeting of the DUP executive, during which Mr Poots' election as DUP leader was ratified by party members. \nHe alleged that people who had put their hands up at the meeting in support of a secret ballot on the leadership were told to put them down.\nThat claim was backed up by party member Roberta McNally, who was also at the DUP executive meeting and has also resigned.\nThe vote to hold a secret ballot was defeated, but DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley, who was ratified that night along with Mr Poots, has said a secret ballot should have been held to affirm Mr Poots' leadership.\nAll key positions on the front bench and back bench in terms of ministers and assembly committees have been filled. \nThe Poots team has indicated today that these changes will not take effect until next week at the earliest. That is to allow Arlene Foster to remain as first minister until she attends the British-Irish Council meeting on Friday. \nAdopting this tactic of announcing his new team, but saying they won't take up their positions immediately, allows a period of time to allow Mrs Foster to see out her days as first minister. \nWe may well see Mrs Foster tendering her resignation on Monday, which then would allow Team Poots to move in and put his people on the benches on Monday evening, or perhaps Tuesday. \nBut who knows? Predicting the DUP over the course of the past five weeks has been a bit of a lottery. \nMr Poots said he did not accept that there is a problem of misogyny in the party. \n\"I have personally only ever been respectful to all of the women in our party, and encouraged them. Politics is a very hostile place, and a lot of women don't like that level of hostility,\" Mr Poots said. \n\"It is for us to ensure that we can make our arguments strongly, but also respectfully.\"\nMr Poots said the personal abuse he receives - and Arlene Foster has received - as a politician is \"massive\". \nThe vote to make Mr Poots leader and Ms Bradley deputy leader came amid anger from within the party about how Arlene Foster was ousted.\nBut Ms Bradley said there was no \"purge\" taking place in the party. \nSpotlight is on BBC One NI at 22:45 BST on Tuesday."

      "tags": "Flexible working,Employment,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The five-day office week could become the norm again within two years, the Centre for Cities think tank has told the BBC.\nA blend of home and office work is expected to be popular while the UK recovers from the pandemic.\nBut some analysts then anticipate a shift back to pre-Covid working patterns for many.\nCurrently, people who can work from home are still advised to do so.\nHowever, that is likely to change if the government ends all social distancing restrictions on 21 June.\n\"I expect we will see three or four days a week in the office as the UK recovers,\" Paul Swinney, director of policy and research at Centre for Cities, told Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme.\n\"Over the longer term, I'm quite hopeful that we will see people return five days a week.\n\"The reason for that is, one of the benefits of being in the office is having interactions with other people, coming up with new ideas and sharing information.\" \nHe said people could not do this by scheduling a three o'clock meeting on a Tuesday - it had to happen randomly. \n\"If you're in the office on a Monday but someone else is in the office on a Wednesday, then you're starting to miss out. Or, if your colleague is in the office and having a meeting with your boss and you're not there, all of a sudden that changes the dynamic again.\"\nOffice for National Statistics data published in May revealed most people did not work from home in 2020, however the proportion of workers who did more than doubled during the pandemic. That hit the office property market while prompting lots of discussion about the future of the workplace.\nDemand for more city centre office space does now appear to be rising - albeit from a very low point. \nFigures from Savills estate agency show office take-up by square footage in the UK's six biggest regional cities has gone up significantly since the second quarter of 2020, the start of the pandemic. \nThe estate agency said it was also seeing \"record rents\" for some top tier office space in Greater London and regional city areas.\nSectors signing some of the biggest regional office deals were public services, education and health.\nOffice providers have struggled during the pandemic. On Monday, the shared office firm IWG warned of a sharp profits drop.\nNevertheless, the company said it was seeing \"unprecedented demand\" for its flexible office services as many more businesses adopted hybrid working.\nJessica Bowles, director of strategy at commercial property developer Bruntwood, which operates in Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool, told the BBC her firm has also seen a lot of demand for flexible and serviced office space on short leases.\n\"We've had really strong take-up. People want flexible terms. \n\"What's interesting is that it's corporates wanting to do that as well as small businesses and SMEs.\"\nBut hybrid working does not mean flexible office space leases are any cheaper as \"flexibility is priced in\". Most firms also want to keep a five-day office, she said.\n\"Most businesses that have got space with us now want to maintain having an office, and they don't see that they could give up the office for a certain number of days a week - they just want to use the space differently. \n\"That means more collaborative space, fewer banks of desks, places where people can come together and create and innovate.\"\nShe added that while hybrid working was growing in popularity before Covid-19 struck, the working pattern could be \"challenging\" for firms if some staff were at home, while some were in the office.\n\"I think from a personal, and a business level, we'll see more people seeing the value in coming together to collaborate. But Fridays are always pretty quiet in the office and I don't expect that to change.\"\nBusinesses reliant on office worker trade are hopeful their fortunes will soon improve.\nIn Birmingham, cafe owners and siblings James and Naomi Morris are looking forward to the arrival of more commuters to the city centre. They set up their business, Morridge, in 2019 specifically to target city workers.\nJames told the BBC he'd started to see more commuters coming into the cafe again.\n\"Over the past few weeks, office workers have slowly been returning. People are starting to work in the cafe - a lady came in for breakfast the other day and took a couple of work calls.\n\"Wednesdays and Thursdays are our busiest days.\"\nHe said he is expecting more workers to return to the city centre later in the month if the remaining Covid restrictions are lifted on 21 June, and said his customers had told him they expected more of their colleagues to return in September.\n\"It's looking good. I think it will all come back around.\"\nBut the prospect of a post-Covid mass return to the office - on even a hybrid basis - will not necessarily be universally welcomed by employees.\nStaff at Apple reportedly launched a campaign to push back against boss Tim Cook's plans for workers to be in the office at least three days a week by September. \nData visualization by Daniele Palumbo"

That stood at 55% in early May 2021, compared with around 8% of the UK's wider workforce.\nFurlough support is set to be reduced from next month with further cuts until it stops at the end of September."

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic,Shirley-Anne Somerville",
      "text": "Scotland's new education secretary has made a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that no young person will be further disadvantaged by this year's assessments. \nShirley-Anne Somerville promised pupils \"If your teacher thinks you deserve an A, you will get an A\". \nShe said she still had full confidence in the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA).\nBut she said lessons had to be learned from the Covid experience. \nAsked by the BBC if she could give a cast-iron guarantee that the situation pupils faced last year - when grades were subject to an algorithm and were weighted by a school's past performance or postcode - would not happen again, she said: \"Absolutely\".\nShe said: \"This year a teacher's judgement is based on an individual's demonstrated attainment. So if your teacher thinks you deserve an A, you will get an A. \n\"The assessment process is judged by your teacher and they will submit the grade. No-one is coming in to overrule that or second guess it. Your teacher will decide your grade, if you don't agree you have direct right of free appeal. No-one is coming in to second guess them or their teacher.\"\nTwo weeks from the end of a second turbulent school year, teachers, pupils and parents remain wary of qualification arrangements. \nNo formal exams have taken place since 2019 and after a disastrous 2020 results day, all eyes are on the 2021 solution.\nThe replacement has again drawn criticism for its numerous assessments and an unpopular appeals process.\nLast week, Ms Somerville announced a reform of the SQA and Education Scotland, just hours after Nicola Sturgeon gave the SQA her full confidence.\n\"We do have full confidence in the SQA,\" she said. \"But we also know that we need to learn lessons from the experience of Covid and also with the report coming up from the OECD, we, as a government, need to be open to reform, open to challenge and to suggestions of how we should change.\n\"The qualifications the SQA are delivering this year for young people are sound and they are credible, but that doesn't mean we should stop and we can't and shouldn't look at change and that's what we are determined to deliver.\"\nJust one month into her new post, the new cabinet secretary said she had seen the anticipated international OECD report into the entire Scottish education system.\nAhead of its publication this month, she said the Scottish government was \"open to reform\".\n\"It is very important that we demonstrate a direction of travel for the government and demonstrate an openness for change,\" she said.\n\"We know this big report is coming, we know the OECD has looked at education in the round and if the OECD is recommending change to us I think its quite right that early on in my time as education secretary say I am open to that change, I am open to that challenge, so is the whole of the Scottish government.\n\"That gives people at least a little time before that OECD report is published to take part in that conversation, have a think about what they want - because I hear a lot of people saying we should scrap the SQA or make dramatic changes but what I don't often hear is a solution to what can be replacements or what people want to change.\"\nLooking ahead to the new school year in August, the education secretary said she would like to see schools return to normal, but that contingency arrangements were in place if schools needed to move to a different way of working. \nShe gave parents and pupils reassurance that plans had been made. \nHowever, she said decisions had not yet been taken over next year's exams.\nIt's certainly planting her flag firmly in the ground. \nGiven the outcry that there was last year and the criticism about how things have been working this year, Shirley-Anne Somerville obviously doesn't expect to be in the same position her predecessor John Swinney was in last year when he had to make that U-turn on results.\nShe mentioned the OECD report a few times, particularly when talking about her decision to reform  the SQA and Education Scotland, so that potentially hints that the report might include something about that.\nComing into the new role, Ms Somerville said she believed the government had a very good record on education and that she was seeing progress in closing the attainment gap, and that empowerment in schools was making a difference. But she admitted there was more to do.\nShe said: \"When you look at context of Covid and reports coming out, the OECD, we know we can do more.\n\"We know we still have work to do, and Covid accentuated the need even more.\"\nIn response, Oliver Mundell, the Scottish Conservatives education spokesman, said he wanted to see the government to go further than reform.\n\"Rather than reforming the SQA I think they should be talking about axing it, scrapping it and starting from the beginning again, asking what kind of qualifications body do we want in Scotland, not shifting existing people around, and tinkering around the edges. The SQA has let young people down,\" he said."

      "tags": "Companies,Foreign & Commonwealth Office,Money,Travel insurance,Personal finance,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers.\nQuarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November.\nIf the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there.\nFor example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant.\nIf your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher.\nAn airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. \nA package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days.\nThis is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund.\nIn this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have.\nEasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its \"freedom to change\" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022.\nSome may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive.\nThey may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund.\nThat may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given.\n\"If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,\" he said. \n\"Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead.\"\nPeople who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator.\nOperators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate.\nIt is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel.\nTravel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy.\nThe majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel.\nImportantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go.\nRules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries.\nThe government has published a charter that \"clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place\".\nIt says it expects travel operators to be \"flexible\" with customers, given the circumstances, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firms they must stick to refund rules.\n"

      "text": "The US has recovered most of the $4.4m (\u00a33.1m) ransom paid to a cyber-criminal gang responsible for taking the Colonial Pipeline offline last month.\nDarkSide - which US authorities said operates from eastern Europe and possibly Russia - infiltrated the pipeline last month.\nThe attack disrupted supplies for several days causing fuel shortages.\nAccording to the firm, the pipeline carries 45% of the East Coast's supply of diesel, petrol and jet fuel.\nOn Monday, Deputy Attorney-General Lisa Monaco said investigators had \"found and recaptured\" 63.7 Bitcoin worth $2.3m - \"the majority\" of the ransom paid. Since the ransom was paid the value of Bitcoin has fallen sharply.\nThe US government has recommended in the past that companies do not pay criminals over ransomware attacks, in case they invite further hacks in the future.\nIt has since urged companies to increase security measures against ransomware attacks like this. Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said on Sunday that President Biden would raise the issue of such attacks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in a meeting planned this month. \nColonial Pipeline took itself offline on Friday 7 May after the cyber-attack.  \nIn a statement Joseph Blount, chief executive of the Colonial Pipeline Company, said his firm was grateful for the \"swift work and professionalism\" of the FBI, which helped to recover the ransom.\n\"Holding cyber criminals accountable and disrupting the ecosystem that allows them to operate is the best way to deter and defend against future attacks,\" he added.\nIn America's ongoing fight against the scourge of ransomware, this is a major victory.\nStealing back a ransom is, to my knowledge, a first and it shows how far the US is willing to go to deter cyber-criminals.\nIt sends a powerful message to the gangs who have been operating with impunity for years in states like Russia.\nPerhaps deliberately, the DoJ are being vague about exactly how they did it. \nAll they are saying is that the \"private key\" to the criminal's Bitcoin wallet is in the \"possession of the FBI\".\nWith this key, which is effectively a password, agents were able to simply log in and send the digital coins to another wallet they control.\nThe cyber-security world is abuzz with rumours and theories about how they got hold of the password. \nPerhaps the key was found on seized servers, or gifted by an angry insider, or handed over by a cooperative company used as part of the criminal infrastructure. \nEither way, it's a big moment and it is sending shockwaves.\nAfter the attack in May, Colonial made a cryptocurrency payment, and in return the company received a decryption tool so it could unlock the systems compromised by the hackers - although that was not enough to restart systems immediately, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nMr Blout told the newspaper he authorised the payment on 7 May after discussions with experts who had previously dealt with DarkSide.\nHe said he \"didn't make [that decision] lightly,\" but believed \"it was the right thing to do for the country.\"\nMr Blount added that it would take months before some business systems were recovered, and estimated that the attack would ultimately cost the company tens of millions of dollars. \nAt the time of the hack, the DarkSide criminal gang acknowledged the incident in a public statement.\n\"Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society,\" DarkSide wrote on its website.\n\"We do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for... our motives,\" the group added."

Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

Until now, the platform has only worked between Apple devices.\nThe new features form part of its latest operating system, iOS15.\n\"Allowing Apple owners to invite Android and PC users to FaceTime calls via a browser acknowledges the pandemic has sparked explosive growth in group video calling,\" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. \n\"Apple risked being left behind services such as Teams and Zoom - but browser-based calling won't be enough to close the gap.\"\nDigital keys are coming to Apple Wallet, announced the firm's Jennifer Bailey.\nCar firm BMW and hotel chain Hyatt will be among the first to offer the keys - and it will also be available for homes.\nThe collaboration with BMW was initially announced at WWDC 2020 but has yet to actually launch.\nIn some US states, iPhone users will also be able to store their State ID and driving licences, with the Transportation Security Administration lined up to be among the first to be able to use it, said Ms Bailey.\nApple also announced Live Text, which is able to scan a user's library of photos for text that can be made searchable and copied and pasted between apps - for example, a phone number from a business card or menu. \nSome note-taking apps have used optical character recognition (OCR) for similar reasons for years, but Apple's solution is baked into the phone operating system itself.\nThe health app can now track walking steadiness and issue alerts if a user appears less steady, along with exercise suggestions as to how it might improve.\nApple also enabled health app data sharing with doctors, and between family members, but only with the health app user's consent. The encrypted data is not visible to the tech giant, it stressed.\nHowever, there may be a cultural barrier to overcome here, said Ben Wood.\n\"The ability to share health data with other family members looks an interesting idea on paper, but it is hard to see that many parents would want to share updates with their children,\" he said.\nThere may, for example, be a number of reasons why a person's heart rate increases which are not medical emergencies.\nOthers, like Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies, said she could see it being taken up by families who live far away.\n\"My biggest worry over the pandemic was my mom and asking how she was felt like nagging her,\" she tweeted."

      "text": "Scotland will start to vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 as quickly as possible if experts recommend it, Nicola Sturgeon has said. \nThe Pfizer-BionTech vaccine was approved for use among the age group by the UK's medicine regulator last week.\nThe Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization on whether it should begin vaccinating children.\nMs Sturgeon said the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated. \nBut she told the Scottish Parliament that if the JCVI recommends the use of the vaccine for children over the age of 12, the country would \"move as quickly as possible to implement the advice\".\nThe first minister added: \"It is vital that we rely on expert advice in all of our vaccination decisions. \n\"However, vaccination may well be an important way of giving children greater protection, minimising any further disruption to schooling, and further reducing community transmission of the virus.\"\nMs Sturgeon also insisted that the decision was not simply a choice between \"vaccinating children and playing our part in global vaccination\".\nMore than half of Scotland's adult population has now had both doses of a Covid vaccine - with the total number standing at 2,282,203. \nPfizer has said its vaccine trials had shown 100% efficacy and a strong immune response in children between 12 and 15, and that the vaccine was safe with no unusual side-effects.\nIts use among children in the UK was approved by the MHRA on Friday of last week, with the regulator saying it had carried out a \"rigorous review\" which showed the vaccine was safe and effective in adolescents. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) must now advise governments on whether this age group should be vaccinated as part of the UK rollout.\nThe UK government has also said it will be guided by expert advise from the JCVI, and that any decision would be \"clinically based\".\nAnd it has said that the UK has enough supplies to vaccinate children if the move was recommended by the JCVI.\nBut some experts have questioned whether it is morally right to vaccinate children - who have an extremely low risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid - in wealthy countries such as the UK rather than donating the extra doses to the rest of the world. \nWhat do you think about vaccinating teenagers? Would you like to see young people aged 12-15 vaccinated before the beginning of the next school term?  Please share your stories and pictures with us.\nYou can now get in touch with BBC Scotland on the phone messaging service, WhatsApp. \nTo start using the app, simply download WhatsApp on to your smartphone free from the internet.\nThen add our WhatsApp number +44 7902 704679 to your phone's contact list.\nPlease make sure you read our terms of use and privacy policy.\nThe World Health Organization has already called on wealthy countries to postpone any plans to immunise children.\nAnd Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland at the weekend that she hoped the UK would \"step up\" to donate vaccines to poorer countries rather than vaccinating teenagers. \nProf Bauld said there were good reasons for vaccinating 12-15 year olds as well over 80% of the total population would need to be vaccinated to achieve population immunity against the virus.\nBut she said there were many countries around the world where vaccination levels were low but cases were \"skyrocketing\".\nShe said that not addressing vaccine roll-out issues in countries with high levels of infection would curtail global travel in the future and lead to a much higher risk of more dangerous variants emerging.\nA further 695 people tested positive for the virus in Scotland on Monday, which was 5% of the total number of tests carried out. \nTwo council areas - Clackmannanshire and Dundee - currently have infection rates of more than 200 cases per 100,000 people.\nIn addition, six areas which are currently in level one have a rate above 50 cases per 100,000, which has previously been the threshold for level three restrictions. These included Angus, where the rate is above 150 per 100,000.\nThe number of people in hospital with the virus across Scotland now stands at 121 - one fewer than yesterday - while the number of patients in intensive care units remains at 12.\nThere have been no deaths registered in the past 24 hours of people who had recently tested positive for Covid.\nAhead of Ms Sturgeon's statement, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf was questioned over the controversial plans for a fan zone in Glasgow Green during the European Championships.\nMr Yousaf said he understood the concerns, but that it was an attempt to cater \"in as safe a way as possible\" for fans who wanted to watch the matches.\nHe said it was a \"low risk event\" which would be monitored on an ongoing basis, adding: \"Any changes considered necessary will be made, up to and including withdrawing permission, should significant concerns arise.\"\nPublic health officials in England have warned that football fan zones for the European championships could become super spreader events, but the Scottish government seems content to press ahead. \nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf told parliament that the Glasgow zone would be outdoors and highly regulated. He dismissed calls for mandatory testing, highlighting concerns about digital exclusion, but revealed that Glasgow city council would be contacting ticket holders to encourage them to get a lateral flow test before attending. \nThis is in contrast to the cautious approach ministers have adopted with soft play areas. The sector's been demonstrating outside Holyrood to highlight what is sees as an anomaly - that trampoline parks and bowling alleys can open in level two, but soft plays cannot.  \nMinisters make the point that good leadership can involve making unpopular decisions. \nThey may yet need to disappoint football fans. Mr Yousaf acknowledged that the zone will be monitored throughout, and the plug could be pulled if problems are perceived."

      "tags": "Islam,Canada",
      "text": "Four members of a Muslim family were killed in a \"premeditated\" vehicle attack on Sunday, Canadian police say. \nThe attack took place in the city of London, Ontario province. A boy aged nine, the family's only survivor, is in hospital with serious injuries. \nA 20-year-old Canadian man has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.\nThe attack was the worst against Canadian Muslims since six people were killed in a Quebec City mosque in 2017.\n\"It is believed that these victims were targeted because they were Muslim,\" Det Supt Paul Waight told a news conference on Monday. \nPolice are weighing possible terrorism charges, he said, adding that it is believed to be a hate crime.\nTwo women - aged 74 and 44 - a 46-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl were all killed. They have not been named, in accordance with the wishes of the family. A nine-year-old boy was in hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries, said police.\nPolice named the alleged attacker as Nathanial Veltman, 20, of London, Ontario. He was arrested without incident at a shopping centre about 6km (4.8 miles) from the crime scene. \nIt is not yet known if the suspect has ties to any hate groups, said Det Supt Waight. \n\"There is no known previous connection between the suspect and the victims,\" Det Supt Waight said, adding that the suspect was wearing a vest that appeared to be \"like body armour\". \nPolice said Mr Veltman had no previous convictions.\nOfficials added that there was good weather and high visibility conditions when the black truck was seen mounting the kerb on Hyde Park Road at around 20:40 local time on Sunday.\nOne witness told CTV News she had to shield her young daughter's eyes from the bodies.\nAnother witness told CTV the scene was \"just chaos\".\n\"There were people everywhere and running,\" said Paige Martin. \"Citizens were trying to direct the emergency vehicles where to go. There was a lot of pointing and screaming and arm waving.\"\nA 2016 census found that London - a city about 200km (125 miles) south-west of Toronto - is growing increasingly diverse. One in five people was born outside of Canada, with Arabs being the area's largest minority group, and South Asians coming in a close second.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford was among those who paid tribute to the victims, tweeting: \"Hate and Islamophobia have NO place in Ontario.\" \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted that he was \"horrified\" by the news.\n\"To the loved ones of those who were terrorised by yesterday's act of hatred, we are here for you,\" he wrote.\n\"This was an act of mass murder, perpetrated against Muslims, against Londoners, and rooted in unspeakable hatred,\" said London Mayor Ed Holder.\nIn a statement, Mayor Holder said he was speaking \"on behalf of all Londoners when I say our hearts are broken\". \n\"We grieve for the family, three generations of whom are now deceased.\"\nThe mayor's statement added that he had ordered flags outside London City Hall to be lowered for three days of mourning.\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) said in a statement that the attacker should face terrorism charges.\n\"A man allegedly got in his car, saw a Muslim family walking down the street, and made the decision that they do not deserve to live,\" said the organisation's CEO Mustafa Farooq.\n\"He did not know them. This is a terrorist attack on Canadian soil, and should be treated as such,\" his statement continued.\nNawaz Tahir, a London lawyer and representative of the Muslim community, said during the police news conference: \"These were innocent human beings who were killed simply because they were Muslim.\"\n\"We will stand strong against Islamophobia. We will stand strong against terror with faith, with love, and a quest for justice,\" he continued. \n\"Hate will never overshadow the light of love.\"\nIt is not the first time members of the Muslim community in Canada have come under attack.\nIn January 2017, a Canadian man fatally shot six worshippers at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre, and seriously injured five others. The perpetrator was sentenced to life in prison. \nCanada's deadliest vehicle-ramming attack happened in 2018, when a self-described \"incel\" (involuntary celibate) ploughed his van into a group of pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 people."

      "tags": "Dementia,Alzheimer's",
      "text": "The first new treatment for Alzheimer's disease for nearly 20 years has been approved by regulators in the United States, paving the way for its use in the UK.\nAducanumab targets the underlying cause of Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, rather than its symptoms. \nCharities have welcomed the news of a new therapy for the condition.\nBut scientists are divided over its potential impact because of uncertainty over the trial results.\nAt least 100,000 people in the UK with a mild form of the disease could be suitable for the drug if it were to be approved by the UK regulator. \nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said there was \"substantial evidence that aducanumab reduces amyloid beta plaques in the brain\" and that this \"is reasonably likely to predict important benefits to patients\".\nIn March 2019, late-stage international trials of aducanumab, involving about 3,000 patients, were halted when analysis showed the drug, given as a monthly infusion, was not better at slowing the deterioration of memory and thinking problems than a dummy drug.\nBut later that year, the US manufacturer Biogen analysed more data and concluded the drug did work, as long as it was given in higher doses. The company also said it significantly slowed cognitive decline.\nAducanumab targets amyloid, a protein that forms abnormal clumps in the brains of people with Alzheimer's that can damage cells and trigger dementia, including:\nAldo Ceresa, who took part in the trial, first noticed problems differentiating between left and right 10 years ago.\nAfter his diagnosis, the 68-year-old, who is originally from Glasgow and now lives in Oxfordshire, close to his family, had to give up his job as a surgeon. \nMr Ceresa took aducanumab for two years before the trial was halted - and then had to wait almost as long for another trial, at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, in London, to begin.\n\"I'm quite happy to volunteer,\" he says.\n\"I really, really enjoy this journey that I'm going through - and obviously the benefits I'm getting from it, which I'm very, very grateful for.\"\nHe is convinced the drug has helped him.\n\"I feel like I'm not quite as confused. Although it's still there, it's not quite as bad. \n\"And I'm just getting that bit more confident now.\"\nMr Ceresa says his family has noticed improvements too.\n\"Before, if I was going to get something, I couldn't remember, you know, where to find things in the kitchen. \n\"That has become less of a problem,\" he says.\n\"I haven't caught up to the level that I was before - but I'm heading in the right direction.\"\nMore than 30 million people around the world are thought to have Alzheimer's, with most aged over 65.\nFor around 500,000 people affected in the UK, those eligible for aducanumab will be mostly in their 60s or 70s and at an early stage of the disease.\nWe need to keep our feet on the ground. \nThis is not a miracle drug, nor a cure for Alzheimer's but it is the first treatment which tackles the destructive mechanism in the brain that drives the destruction of neurons.\nAnd that makes this a landmark moment.\nBut scientific opinion both here and the United States is divided. While some have welcomed approval, calling it a milestone for millions living with Alzheimer's, others believe the drug will only have marginal benefits. \nAlzheimer's charities say they will be pressing for an early decision in the UK - but that could take another year.\nLastly, we don't know how much aducanumab will cost - it could be tens of thousands of pounds per patient each year. And if approved, access will be limited to those who've had specialist brain scans to confirm their diagnosis.\nDespite all the caveats, this is moment for very cautious celebration.  \nProf Bart De Strooper, director of the UK Dementia Research Institute, said the decision to approve aducanumab marked \"a hugely significant milestone\" in the search for treatments for Alzheimer's disease.\nIn the past decade, more than 100 potential Alzheimer's treatments have flopped. \nBut while he hoped it would prove a turning point for millions of people with the condition, he said there were \"still many barriers to overcome\". \nProf John Hardy, professor of neuroscience at University College London, said: \"We have to be clear that, at best, this is a drug with marginal benefit which will help only very carefully selected patients.\"\nAnd Prof Robert Howard, professor of old age psychiatry at UCL, went further calling the drug's approval \"a grave error\" that could derail the ongoing search for meaningful dementia treatments \"for a decade\". \nHe said the FDA had ignored data from the trial which showed no slowing of decline in cognition or function.\nHowever, Alzheimer's Society said the drug was \"promising\" but added it was \"just the beginning of the road to new treatments for Alzheimer's disease\".\nAnother charity, Alzheimer's Research UK, said it had written to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock asking the government to prioritise the fast-track approval process for the drug in the UK.\nChief executive Hilary Evans, said: \"People with dementia and their families have been waiting far too long for life-changing new treatments. \n\"It is now essential that regulatory authorities assess the evidence to decide whether they believe the drug is safe and effective for use in the UK.\" \nAlthough many doctors are doubtful of aducanumab's benefits, its US approval could be a huge boost to dementia research, which is traditionally underfunded compared with cancer or heart disease."

      "tags": "Alcohol,Northern Ireland Assembly",
      "text": "Proposals to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have taken another step towards becoming law.\nIt was a late night at Stormont as MLAs stayed to the early hours of Wednesday debating legislation to modernise NI's 25-year-old licensing laws.\nThe bill aims to allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend.\nIt also proposes removing restrictions around Easter drinking.\nIt is thought the legislation could pass its final stage in the assembly by the end of the month, with most of the changes then becoming law from October.\nThe proposals have been a very long time in the making, with Stormont first putting forward changes eight years ago.\nA previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, who share power together at Stormont.\nAs the lengthy debate began on Tuesday evening, Speaker Alex Maskey said it may run until the \"early hours of the morning and maybe some of us will be driven to drink afterwards\".\nCommunities Minister Deirdre Hargey described the proposals as a \"great move which brings our drinking laws into the 21st Century\".\nAfter debating 63 amendments, the Licensing and Registration of Clubs Bill passed its consideration stage in the early hours of the morning.\nSome of assembly members who took part in the debate, including Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong and DUP Chief Whip Joanne Bunting, tweeted photos as they left work after 03:00 BST. \nOne amendment from independent unionist MLA Claire Sugden suggested extending the definition of a \"place of public entertainment\" to include cinemas, so they can sell alcohol on their premises.\nIt is understood Ms Hargey has expressed reservations about that proposal.\nHer department has instead said it is preparing to carry out a 12-week public consultation on that specific matter over the summer.\nMs Hargey told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster that the proposals were \"fundamental changes\" and it was important to consider \"what the consequences of those are\".\nShe said no consultation had been done around cinemas, and \"there are very few places at which a family can go and enjoy entertainment where there is no alcohol sold\".\n\"I do think that there is a want within the community that that is retained on one hand, that said I am willing to listen as a minister in terms of doing further consultation on this,\" she added.\n\"I don't think it is good, at this point of laying legislation, of making a change that would be significant like this without doing the due consultation and seeing the impact.\n\"I want to make sure on the issue of cinemas and looking at that entertainment, which is very family focused, that we do more consultation on that issue.\"\nMs Sugden had questioned delaying a proposal that she believed was \"inevitable\".\nShe said cinemas in other parts of the UK can already sell alcohol to customers and she hoped MLAs would support her amendment.\n\"Cinemas have had a really difficult year with the pandemic and anything we can do to support them can only be a good thing,\" she added.\nOther changes in the bill include the extension in \"drinking-up time\" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends.\nThe law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol.\nThe current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements.\nColin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said that there had been a \"number of false dawns\" in relation to modernising licensing laws and now change was \"tantalisingly close\".\n\"We recognise alcohol is a controlled substance and needs to be treated as such, we haven't come asking for 24-hour drinking like England or deregulation, this is about looking at what the customer wants and actually modernise it.\n\"They are modest but significant in their impact measures, because people do go out later now, they want to go out and socialise.\n\"We have to be able to provide that (extended hours) particularly with tourists visiting here as well.\"\nMichael McAdam, managing director of Movie House Cinemas, said adults could already sample alcohol if they were watching an event at theatres in Northern Ireland.\n\"All we are saying at cinema is please give us a chance to be in line, to serve our customers, to give our customers what they want,\" he said.\n\"That is the choice to make an adult decision if they want to have an alcoholic beverage or not.\"\nAn amendment that would require the Northern Ireland Executive to review the \"surrender principle\" in Northern Ireland licensing law was one of those passed at Stormont. \nThe principle means no new licence can ever be granted unless another one is surrendered.\nLicences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means that every supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else.\nThe SDLP's Matthew O'Toole, who proposed the amendment, said that was likely to have contributed to the decline in the number of pubs and made it very difficult for new rural or small town pubs to be created as licences are scarce and expensive assets.\nHe emphasised that any review would have to carefully consider all the impacts - including on existing licensees.\nHe said: \"My amendment simply requires the department to appoint an independent person to review the licensing system, including the surrender principle.\n\"Critically the amendment makes clear that the reviewer has to have regard to the interests of existing licence holders, by ensuring they consider options for compensation in the event of reform.\"\nColin Neill said Hospitality Ulster members were \"terrified\" by Mr O'Toole's proposal, saying that bar owners were \"incredibly vulnerable\" following the latest Covid-19 lockdown.\nMr O'Toole is also proposing that the department should publish an annual report on the number of pubs and operational licenses by postcode.\nHe added: \"These amendments are not about rushing into reform - they are about getting robust information to plan for reform.\""

We'll have another update for you on Wednesday morning.\nMilitary support and supervised testing in schools are among extra measures being rolled out in Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire - to help tackle a rise in cases of the Delta variant. People have also been advised to minimise travel in and out of the area and avoid meeting indoors. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the package is based on \"what's working in Bolton\", which saw its infection rates drop after being offered enhanced support. Check the Covid cases in your area.\nChildren in Scotland between 12 and 15-years-old will be vaccinated as quickly as possible if experts recommend it, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. It comes after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for use among the age group by the UK's medicines regulator last week. The Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization on whether it should begin vaccinating children. So, who can get a vaccine now?\nEngland's Euro 2020 group matches at Wembley Stadium in the upcoming European Football Championships will be the UK's first sporting events where proof of being fully vaccinated will be used to gain entry. UK-based ticket holders aged 11 or over will be asked to show evidence both doses have been received at least 14 days before the match, to enter. Those not fully vaccinated must show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. \nLess than a quarter of pubs are confident they will still be in business at the end of the summer, figures from the Office for National Statistics show, after prolonged closures since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. Only 24% have a high level of faith they will survive the next three months, compared with 44% for all types of company.\nThe second wave of Covid-19 ravaged India as hospitals and then crematoriums ran out of space. While cities were first hit, the second wave soon reached rural parts of the country.

The majority of people in hospital with Covid appear to be those who haven't had the vaccine at all.\"\nOf the 12,383 new cases as of 3 June, 464 went on to present at emergency care and 126 were admitted to hospital.\nOf those, 83 were unvaccinated, 28 had one dose of vaccine and three had both doses, he said.\nHe also urged secondary school children to continue to take twice-weekly lateral flow tests, stressing cases were rising fastest among older schoolchildren. \nIn England, people aged 25 and older can go online or call 119 to book.\nIn Scotland, people aged 30 and over are eligible for a vaccine. Wales is six weeks ahead of schedule and is vaccinating over 18s. In Northern Ireland, people 18 and over are invited to book.\nNHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said: \"Getting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do, with NHS staff vaccinating at over 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship, sport stadiums and other convenient locations. \n\"So, when you get that text, book your appointment and join the millions who are already protected.\"\nPeople aged 39 and under who are eligible and pregnant women will be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, in line with guidance.\nA total of 40,460,576 people in the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, while 27,921,294 have received both.\nMeanwhile, the UK has recorded more than 5,000 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours.\nThere have been a further 154 hospital admissions, and there are currently 932 people being treated for Covid in hospital."

The president, meanwhile, is pulled away.\nTwo men have been arrested following the incident, French media report. \nPresident Macron later called it an \"isolated event\". \n\"We must not let ultra-violent people take over the public debate: they do not deserve it,\" he told French newspaper Le Dauphin\u00e9.\nThe man reportedly shouted \"Down with Macron-ism\" as he slapped the president, as well as \"Montjoie, Saint-Denis\" - the battle-cry of the old Kingdom of France, in reference to the banner of King Charlemagne.\nIn the video Mr Macron briefly returned to the barrier after the incident and once again interacted with the crowd.\n\"I continued and I will continue,\" he later told Le Dauphin\u00e9. \"Nothing will stop me.\"\nAs yet the identity and motive of the man are unclear. The local prefecture said he and another individual are being questioned by the gendarmerie, in a statement reported by AFP news agency.\nOfficers were out in force on the streets of Valence shortly after the slap, according to one French journalist's tweet. \nFrench presidents are protected by the Security Group for the Presidency of the Republic, known as GSPR. \nIt was set up in 1983 and is reportedly composed of 77 men and women to protect Mr Macron during events. \nAccording to French TV channel BFM, officers scout locations before a presidential visit. Armed personnel are then assigned to closely guard the president on the trip itself. \nThe channel reports that 10 members of the GSPR were with Mr Macron on Tuesday's trip. \nPoliticians have swiftly denounced the incident. \nPrime Minister Jean Castex told the National Assembly shortly afterwards that while democracy meant debate and legitimate disagreement \"it must never in any case mean violence, verbal aggression and even less physical attack\".\nFar-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon tweeted his \"solidarity with the president\" immediately after the slap.\nAnd far-right leader Marine Le Pen posted her own condemnation, saying that \"while democratic debate can be bitter, it can never tolerate physical violence\".\nPresident Macron is currently on a tour of France and had just visited a hotel school in Tain-l'Hermitage. His visit to the area was set to continue on Tuesday, officials said, with a trip to a vocational institute for 25-30 year-olds.\nThe president's visit comes on the eve of a major step for French bars and restaurants, which will be able to reopen to indoor customers after seven months of closure. France's overnight curfew is also being pushed back from 21:00 to 23:00 on Wednesday.\n\"Tomorrow, a new step will be taken,\" Mr Macron tweeted after his visit to the hotel school. \"Life will resume in all our territories!\""

People are paying attention to how women feel and how they want to be presented.\"\nWinslet, who was also executive producer on the HBO drama, has previously said she twice sent back the promotional poster because she felt it had been altered too much.\nToday co-host Nick Robinson asked why it mattered \"that the lines on her face were not airbrushed out\", and why \"as you put it in an interview did it matter that the bulging belly was shown\" in the sex scene.\nWinslet replied that she and Zobel were \"adamant about not touching the scene or digitally altering my body\". She said they \"both felt it was appropriate for the role\" and \"were always ruthless about keeping her as real as possible\".\nShe added: \"Craig also assured me respectfully that if I had wanted to be specific about how I looked without my clothes on that he understood that too, that it was my body on the screen for millions of people to see and not his, and I should be in complete control of how I wanted to present myself physically.\n\"I do feel proud that as a woman in the film industry in her mid-40s, having been doing this job since I was 17, that I'm being given this space to fully embrace all of these changes that life's years have left my face and body with.\n\"I feel good about myself. That seems to be being celebrated now because of Mare and how she has resonated with audiences. It's a good empowering moment. Hopefully other women will feel they can go more easily on themselves as a result because, frankly, it's just real.\"\nThe Oscar-winner also said the introduction of intimacy co-ordinators to film and TV sets was a big step forward.\nWinslet said: \"We have intimacy co-ordinators now\u2026 they help choreograph intimate moments between actors on screen and help the director to find the right words to communicate what they might want visually because it can be very uncomfortable for everyone involved.\n\"It can be scary and intimidating to be a young person and find it uncomfortable to even say certain words\u2026 of a sexual nature. In some countries it's a legal requirement [to have an intimacy coordinator on set].\"\nAt the Bafta TV Awards on Sunday, I May Destroy You star and creator Michaela Coel said specialist sex scene directors allow people to \"make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of power, without being exploited or abused in the process\".\nWinslet also said she felt women were more supportive of each other in the industry now.\n\"Actresses in general are celebrating one another really freely now. That didn't exist quite as much when I was younger.\"\nMare of Easttown's recent conclusion was praised by TV critics. Thrillist's Esther Zuckerman wrote that it was a \"devastating, graceful finale\".\n\"Where another show would lean into ugliness, Mare of Easttown chose beauty,\" she said.\nVariety's critic Daniel D'Addario praised the series for \"delivering an ending both of narrative wholeness and of real emotional power\".\nAnd IndieWire's Ben Travers said it \"managed to tie up far more of its loose ends than I ever expected\" and had an ending that \"avoided going off the rails\".\nMare of Easttown is available on Sky Atlantic and streaming service Now in the UK."

      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)",
      "text": "Lagan Valley assembly member Paul Givan has been announced as the DUP's nominee to be NI's new first minister.\nMr Givan would replace Arlene Foster, who was ousted as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader in April after an internal revolt.\nEdwin Poots, Stormont's agriculture minister, replaced her as DUP leader amid tensions within the party.\nA number of DUP members have quit over concerns about the party's direction since Mr Poots' election last month.\nMr Givan had been widely tipped to replace Mrs Foster.\nHe was first co-opted to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2010 and, aged 39, he will be Northern Ireland's youngest first minister.\nMrs Foster will remain as first minister until at least a meeting of the British-Irish Council in County Fermanagh on Friday. It is understood she will not remain in the post beyond Monday, but could leave sooner.\nThere is a seven-day period allowed for the approval of a first minister and deputy first minister by power-sharing partners Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP.\nTherefore, Mr Givan's nomination as first minister must be approved by Sinn F\u00e9in, which currently holds the position of deputy first minister.\nMr Givan said there was a \"huge responsibility that comes with the position\".\n\"We have a huge task when it comes to tackling our waiting lists and we need to get to work,\" he said.\n\"What we now need is an effective transition that needs to take place next week so that we have that smooth delivery of governance.\"\nMr Givan said it was a huge task to follow DUP founder Ian Paisley, and his successors Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster, whom he referred to as \"giants\".\nOn Tuesday, Mr Poots also made the following ministerial announcements:\nThe three new ministers are due to take up their posts from Monday.\nPaul Givan was one of the early names to be tipped for the post of first minister in the eventuality of Edwin Poots winning the DUP leadership contest.\nHe has previously served as a special adviser to Mr Poots, both when he was minister for the former Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and when he was environment minister.\nHis own assembly career began in 2010, when he was co-opted in the Lagan Valley constituency to replace Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who became an MP.\nPrior to his appointment as first minister, he was chairman of the Stormont Justice Committee, although he has now been replaced in that role by party colleague Mervyn Storey.\nHe became communities minister in 2016, with his time in the post cut short by the collapse of Stormont in January 2017.\nMr Givan found himself at the centre of a political row in 2016 over his decision to cut funding for an Irish language scheme.\nHe has also previously supported schools teaching the theory of creationism.\nMr Givan endorsed Mr Poots' bid for leadership of the DUP. \nOn Tuesday, Mr Givan's father, Alan, told BBC's Evening Extra programme that the announcement has come as a \"shock\". \n\"He's very young to be promoted to this position and it's something that we would fear, it's come a bit too early for him,\" he said.\n\"We just hope and pray that he makes a job of it. The responsibility that he has, and all the decisions, it's a lot of pressure on reasonably young shoulders.\"\nThere were not too many surprises in these announcements. \nSeventeen posts in total were handed out today - three women were included. We think there are possibly three, maybe four, among the 17 who wanted Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to be DUP leader. \nSo this is Edwin Poots' attempt to reach out to the other side to try and heal the wounds, but as we have noted in the tweets from Diane Dodds and Peter Weir, it looks as if that mission has failed. \nSpeaking to some in the Donaldson camp, this has fallen far short of what was expected in terms of building bridges within the party. \nAs for Paul Givan, he knows his way around government, so Edwin Poots will see him as a safe pair of hands. \nHe is also of the same political DNA as Mr Poots. He has effectively been on the DUP leader's shoulder throughout his political career from the minute he joined Mr Poots' office as backroom staff when he was 18, all the way to today when Mr Poots handed him his dream job as first minister. \nAlthough just 39 years of age, Mr Givan has experience of the corridors of power. \nThe ministerial appointments have been made against a backdrop of tension within the party over the manner in which Mrs Foster was ousted, and the direction of Mr Poots' leadership. \nDUP councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen have resigned, along with others in the party's South Down association. \nMr Hanna said there was a \"culture of fear\" in the party and claimed he witnessed \"bullying\" at last month's meeting of the DUP executive, during which Mr Poots' election as leader was ratified by party members.\nHe alleged that people who had put their hands up at the meeting in support of a secret ballot on the leadership were told to put them down.\nThat claim was backed up by party member Roberta McNally, who was also at the DUP executive meeting and has also resigned. \nDUP deputy leader Paula Bradley, however, said she did not see that happening.\nOn Tuesday, outgoing ministers Diane Dodds and Peter Weir criticised the ministerial appointments on Twitter as not showing signs of healing.\nMrs Dodds' tweet was retweeted by Mrs Foster and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson - who narrowly lost in the DUP leadership contest to Mr Poots - while Sir Jeffrey also retweeted Mr Weir's comments.\nJustice Minister and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said she and Mr Givan have at times had a \"tense\" relationship. \n\"We're not hostile to each other. We will have to work together and we have had to work together,\" Mrs Long told Evening Extra. \nMrs Long said the first minister's job is one of the \"most difficult in politics\".\n\"Even very shrewd political operators have at times struggled to keep things together in the executive,\" she said. \n\"I think if Paul approaches the job with a bit of humility, works with colleagues and the staff within the Executive Office, takes good advice from his officials, he will be as capable as anyone else to do it.\"\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the changing political personnel in the executive would make \"no difference to the lives of people across Northern Ireland unless there is a marked change in approach to government\".\n\"The faces may be changing but the people in power are still the same,\" he said.\n\"The DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in have been joint heads of government for 14 years.\n\"We have already started to see a lurch back to the same old politics of division and deadlock.\"\nDuring a number of appearances in Stormont's Great Hall on Tuesday, Mr Poots also announced the following committee and assembly appointments:"

      "text": "British holidaymakers who dashed back from Portugal before the country came off the green travel list have spoken of their frustration, calling it an \"absolute joke\".\nOne woman said it had been a \"massive inconvenience\" while another couple said they had lost hundreds of pounds.\nPortugal was moved to the amber list at 04:00 BST meaning arrivals must take two tests and quarantine for 10 days.\nAirlines put on dozens of extra flights as people scrambled to get home.\nThe final commercial flight back to the UK from Portugal appeared to be a WizzAir plane from Faro to Doncaster Sheffield Airport, landing at 02:58 - little more than an hour before the deadline.\nAt the same time Portugal was moved to the amber list, several countries went onto the red list which requires hotel quarantine, including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sudan, Trinidad and Tobago and Sri Lanka.\nPortugal was added to the UK's green list - indicating it is safe to travel for leisure - three weeks ago on 17 May and its reversal to amber has prompted criticism from the travel industry and holidaymakers.\nOne woman who flew into Gatwick Airport on Monday night after cutting short her holiday said: \"To put it on the green list and then to take it off three weeks later is just kind of unbelievable.\"\n\"I was part of a big group, there were 60 of us out there for a wedding... everyone's found it quite difficult.\"\nShe said it had been stressful booking new flights with just a few days' notice, adding: \"It's a massive inconvenience and obviously costs everyone a lot of money.\"\nOne couple said it cost them between \u00a3700 and \u00a3800 to come back a day early so they could still go to work, but that overall the trip was \"worth it\" to enjoy the sunshine and seaside with their children.\nThe Cunningham family from Hampshire, who also arrived at Gatwick on Monday, said it was \"100% ridiculous\" to put Portugal on the amber list, and the government was \"getting people's hopes up and dashing them down\".\n\"Social distancing in Portugal is brilliant, everyone's wearing masks, even on the beaches,\" they said.\nConsumer experts have also criticised how the travel list change was handled.\n\"Between flights selling out, expensive fares, and difficulties obtaining tests in time, it's clear the government's current approach to managing the changing situation around travel is flawed,\" said Rory Boland, editor of consumer magazine Which? Travel.\nThe head of industry body Airlines UK, Tim Alderslade, said \"three months in the summer\" now appeared to be the best case scenario for travel companies, and they could end up seeking further government financial support.\nBut Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended tough rules on travel as being necessary to protect the UK's successful vaccine rollout.\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said the situation in Portugal \"required swift action to protect the gains made with the vaccine rollout\".\nIt stated that the positivity rate for coronavirus tests in Portugal had nearly doubled since the travel lists were first created four weeks earlier.\nThe DfT added that 68 cases of the India variant, known as the Delta variant, have been identified in Portugal.\nSeparate NHS Test and Trace figures showed that of 200 arrivals from Portugal tested between 6 and 19 May, three were positive for the virus.\nThe latest changes to travel rules leaves Gibraltar and Iceland among the countries on the shortened UK green list.\nIt comes as 25 to 29-year-olds in England became eligible to book their first vaccine appointment.\nThe NHS booking system briefly crashed as people in the new age group attempted to book through the website. After showing an error message for a short while, the website resumed letting those trying to book join an online queue.\nA further 5,683 cases were reported across the UK on Monday, with a single death recorded. Latest figures showed a further 127,345 people received a first vaccine dose on 6 June, with 259,941 becoming fully vaccinated.\nMore than 76.8% of the UK's adult population has now received a first vaccine dose, with over half (53%) having received two doses.\nDid you miss the deadline to avoid quarantine or have you made it back in time?

      "text": "The uncle of one of the girls killed by double murderer Colin Pitchfork has described the family's \"shock\" that he can be released.\nPitchfork was jailed for life in 1988 for raping and murdering Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth in Leicestershire.\nOn Monday the Parole Board said the 61-year-old was suitable for release.\nDawn's uncle Philip Musson said the family had lived \"in fear\" of the decision, adding \"there is no parole for Dawn or Lynda\".\nMr Musson said: \"We are in a sort of shock. Obviously as a family we had sort of anticipated this eventuality - feared it - year on year.\n\"We are conscious of time passing but it doesn't pass for us in the same way it might for people looking towards parole.\n\"It has been a life sentence for the family and of course it has deprived Dawn of her life and there is no parole for her or Lynda Mann.\"\nHe added: \"There are some crimes so horrendous that a reprieve is not appropriate, it is an affront to natural justice.\n\"He took their lives in a way which is an absolute torment to those who cared and loved these girls.\"\nLin Garner, a friend of Dawn's mother Barbara, said: \"There is every emotion going through my head at the moment.\n\"But the main thing is just some justice for the girls, proper justice.\n\"Not this constant parole, parole upheaval, which is like knives in the families' hearts each time.\"\nPitchfork was the first murderer convicted on DNA evidence, after raping and killing the two 15-year-olds in the 1980s.\nHe was last denied parole in 2018.\nNow the Parole Board has authorised his release after the panel heard Pitchfork's \"behaviour in custody had been positive and had included extensive efforts to help others\".\nThe announcement has been sharply criticised by the victim's relatives and some politicians.\nA source close to Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the government would take legal advice to explore the use of a \"reconsideration mechanism\" to halt Pitchfork's release.\nThe Parole Board Reconsideration Mechanism, introduced in 2019, gives people 21 days to ask for a decision to be looked at again if they believe it was \"procedurally unfair\" or \"irrational\".\nBut Gavin Dingwall, Professor of Criminal Justice Policy at De Montfort University, said this would not be straightforward.\n\"So there is an appeal mechanism of sorts but Mr Buckland can't appeal just on the basis he felt uncomfortable with the decision, the Parole Board has the status of a court,\" he said.\n\"It is always going to be very difficult for a politician to challenge the decision of the Parole Board.\n\"They would have to prove the board did not follow correct procedure, for example did not consider key evidence.\n\"The other grounds - irrationality - would basically be a very, very high standard. [It would need] decision-making which was counter to any form of logic.\"\nDawn Ashworth's mother Barbara Ashworth told the Daily Mail: \"This news is so upsetting. There are still 15-year-old girls wandering around and this man could still have 20 years of his life to abuse them.\n\"He can't hurt me any more than he has done - Pitchfork ripped my family and I apart - but he can hurt other young girls.\"\nLynda Mann's sister Sue Gratrick, 55, said she did not believe Pitchfork could ever be rehabilitated.\n\"As a family we are so upset by this news. I don't believe somebody guilty of acts such as those he did is capable of being rehabilitated,\" she told the Daily Mail.\n\"Every time he comes up for parole, or there is some other development such as him being granted day release, our pain is heightened once more.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nBritish holidaymakers have been describing a race against time to make it back from Portugal before the country was moved to the amber list. Many of them tell of their frustration at having to cut short trips, rearrange flights and fork out hundreds of pounds to get back in time for the 4am deadline, after which arrivals must isolate for 10 days. We look at what's happening with foreign travel - and what it means for the industry.\nCelebrities are backing a charity's call for the G7 group of rich nations to donate 20% of their vaccines to poorer countries by August to prevent millions of doses being wasted. Unicef says the developing world needs a steady supply because it does not have the resources to distribute and administer them all at once. The UK and others have promised to donate their surplus doses - but they are being asked to give more earlier.\nMany NHS and care workers were exhausted and overstretched even before the pandemic because of staff shortages, according to a group of MPs. The health and social care committee says staff in England are now so burnt out it risks the future of the health service, and says the NHS needs to get better at \"workforce planning\".\nThe five-day office week could become the norm again within two years, according to the Centre for Cities think tank. A blend of home and office work is expected to be popular while the UK recovers from the pandemic but some analysts then anticipate a shift back to pre-Covid working patterns for many.\nYou might remember the sisters who became internet stars thanks to a viral video of their surprise reunion with their mum, who they had not seen for nine weeks during the UK's first Covid wave.

      "text": "The government plans to launch a new workers' watchdog to take over protecting the rights of UK workers.\nThe new body will be responsible for tackling modern slavery, enforcing the minimum wage and protecting agency workers.\nCurrently these tasks are spread across three different bodies.\nIt said it was looking at extra curbs targeting the garment sector including banning sales if brands' behaviour does not improve.\nThe government is looking at these specific measures after reports of serious problems in the industry, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said.\nOne of the leading online fashion retailers, Boohoo, came in for heavy criticism after concerns were raised that workers at its Leicester suppliers were being underpaid and not being protected against Covid-19 during the pandemic.\nIt was alleged last year that some factories in the UK working for the firm were paying staff as little as \u00a33.50 an hour and had working conditions that did not meet Covid guidelines.\nAfter an internal review, it cut its supplier network from an estimated 500 firms to under 100 following the allegations.\nBoohoo said earlier this year that if it were to discover any suggestion of modern day slavery it would \"immediately disclose this to the relevant authorities.\"\nThe government said it was looking into either creating a Garment Trade Adjudicator to investigate companies' supply chains, or it could extend an agricultural licensing scheme. \nUnder that scheme, businesses who provide agricultural workers must have a license, and can be inspected to make sure they are meeting employment standards.\nIf brands' behaviour doesn't improve, the government warned it could introduce harsher measures, including bans on goods made in factories where workers have been underpaid.\nBusiness minister Paul Scully said: \"This government has been absolutely clear that we will do whatever we can to protect and enhance workers' rights.  \n\"The vast majority of businesses want to do right by their staff, but there are a minority who seem to think the law doesn't apply to them. Exploitative practices like modern slavery have no place in society.\"\nHe added that the new watchdog would enable the government to \"take action against companies that turn a blind eye to abuses in their supply chains\".\nThe government also says the new watchdog will make it possible for vulnerable workers to get the holiday pay and statutory sick pay they are entitled to, without having to go through a lengthy employment tribunal process.\nPreviously, the rights of UK workers were split into three bodies - the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate and HMRC's National Minimum Wage Enforcement.\nThe new workers' watchdog will provide guidance to businesses on best practice, complementing existing work already being carried out by independent bodies like the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas).  \nIt will also have enforcement powers and will continue the government's existing Naming and Shaming scheme run by the Low Pay Commission, which in December 2020 named 139 businesses for failing to pay the national minimum wage."

Or, if your colleague is in the office and having a meeting with your boss and you're not there, all of a sudden that changes the dynamic again.\"\nOffice for National Statistics data published in May revealed most people did not work from home in 2020, however the proportion of workers who did more than doubled during the pandemic. That hit the office property market while prompting lots of discussion about the future of the workplace.\nDemand for more city centre office space does now appear to be rising - albeit from a very low point. \nFigures from Savills estate agency show office take-up by square footage in the UK's six biggest regional cities has gone up significantly since the second quarter of 2020, the start of the pandemic. \nThe estate agency said it was also seeing \"record rents\" for some top tier office space in Greater London and regional city areas.\nSectors signing some of the biggest regional office deals were public services, education and health.\nOffice providers have struggled during the pandemic. On Monday, the shared office firm IWG warned of a sharp profits drop.\nNevertheless, the company said it was seeing \"unprecedented demand\" for its flexible office services as many more businesses adopted hybrid working.\nJessica Bowles, director of strategy at commercial property developer Bruntwood, which operates in Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool, told the BBC her firm has also seen a lot of demand for flexible and serviced office space on short leases.\n\"We've had really strong take-up. People want flexible terms. \n\"What's interesting is that it's corporates wanting to do that as well as small businesses and SMEs.\"\nBut hybrid working does not mean flexible office space leases are any cheaper as \"flexibility is priced in\". Most firms also want to keep a five-day office, she said.\n\"Most businesses that have got space with us now want to maintain having an office, and they don't see that they could give up the office for a certain number of days a week - they just want to use the space differently. \n\"That means more collaborative space, fewer banks of desks, places where people can come together and create and innovate.\"\nShe added that while hybrid working was growing in popularity before Covid-19 struck, the working pattern could be \"challenging\" for firms if some staff were at home, while some were in the office.\n\"I think from a personal, and a business level, we'll see more people seeing the value in coming together to collaborate. But Fridays are always pretty quiet in the office and I don't expect that to change.\"\nBusinesses reliant on office worker trade are hopeful their fortunes will soon improve.\nIn Birmingham, cafe owners and siblings James and Naomi Morris are looking forward to the arrival of more commuters to the city centre. They set up their business, Morridge, in 2019 specifically to target city workers.\nJames told the BBC he'd started to see more commuters coming into the cafe again.\n\"Over the past few weeks, office workers have slowly been returning. People are starting to work in the cafe - a lady came in for breakfast the other day and took a couple of work calls.\n\"Wednesdays and Thursdays are our busiest days.\"\nHe said he is expecting more workers to return to the city centre later in the month if the remaining Covid restrictions are lifted on 21 June, and said his customers had told him they expected more of their colleagues to return in September.\n\"It's looking good. I think it will all come back around.\"\nBut the prospect of a post-Covid mass return to the office - on even a hybrid basis - will not necessarily be universally welcomed by employees.\nStaff at Apple reportedly launched a campaign to push back against boss Tim Cook's plans for workers to be in the office at least three days a week by September. \nData visualization by Daniele Palumbo"

      "tags": "Bosnia-Herzegovina,Srebrenica massacre,The Hague,United Nations",
      "text": "Former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic has lost his appeal against a 2017 conviction for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. \nThe UN court upheld the life sentence for his role in the killing of about 8,000 Bosnian Muslim (Bosniak) men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995.\nThe massacre, in an enclave supposed to be under UN protection, was the worst atrocity in Europe since World War Two.\nIt is not yet clear where Mladic will serve the rest of his sentence.\nThe five-person appeals panel in The Hague found Mladic had failed to provide evidence to invalidate the previous convictions against him, although the presiding judge dissented on almost all counts.\nHowever, the appeals chamber also dismissed the appeal brought by the prosecution, which had sought a second conviction against Mladic over crimes committed against Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats in some other areas during the war.\nThe verdict was delayed by technical difficulties, which continued throughout the session.\nMladic had denounced the tribunal during his appeal hearing in August, calling it a child of Western powers. His lawyers had argued he was far away from Srebrenica when the massacre happened.\nMladic, known as the \"Butcher of Bosnia\", was one of the last suspects to face trial at the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. He was arrested in 2011 after 16 years on the run.\nIn 2017 he was found guilty of genocide over Srebrenica, but acquitted of genocide over his army's 1992 campaign, in which Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats were expelled from their homes or detained in appalling conditions.\nIn 2016, the same court convicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic of planning the Srebrenica massacre, among other crimes. \nHis initial 40-year sentence for genocide and war crimes was later increased to life in prison in 2019 - the remainder of which he will serve in the UK.\nSurvivor Semso Osmanovic, who lost 23 family members in the massacre, told the BBC's Guy De Launey that the verdict meant he finally felt able to return to his home town.\n\"I was living the whole of my life for this moment - to see justice being done by the international court. And hoping to bring my children and my wife to Srebrenica,\" he said. \"That's the place I was born.\" \nSehida Abdurahmanovic, whose husband was killed in Srebrenica, watched the verdict at a memorial centre in Potocari. \n\"Mothers who barely hear, who can not see, those sick and can hardly walk, came to see this. As it was yesterday, everything is still fresh,\" she told BBC News Serbian. \n\"It is of utmost importance that he got this life sentence and that genocide in Srebrenica was confirmed.\"\nIn Sarajevo, one Bosnian newspaper led its online coverage of the verdict with the headline: \"Look at the butcher's tears when he realises that he will die behind bars.\"\nBut the reaction among Mladic's supporters was very different.\nThe former general's son, Darko Mladic, said his father \"did not have a chance for a fair trial\" and described the proceedings as \"a travelling circus\".\nThe current president of the Bosnian Serb enclave, Zeljka Cvijanovic, said the tribunal had \"once again confirmed its role as anti-Serb court, which establishes responsibility for war crimes not by evidence, but by the ethnicity of the indicted\".\nSome of the survivors who travelled to The Hague hoped that Ratko Mladic would use his last public appearance to offer an apology that could help reconciliation in the still divided region. \nWhen the final judgment came, the man guilty of severing so many lives offered only silence.\nSatko Mujagic, who survived the notorious Omarska death camp, told me: \"I'm sorry to say but I really can see evil in his eyes, he has no sorry, he really feels nothing, he doesn't care. He could have taken the floor and said I'm sorry it went so far. And it's a shame because his ideology, of division of nationalism, of hatred, is still living and in many people after him.\"\nAnd one dissenting opinion, from the presiding judge, could inflame tensions and be used as ammunition by those who seek to deny the genocide and glorify the former general. \nSpeaking outside court, chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz declared: \"The time has come to accept the truth, Mladic ranks amongst the most notorious war criminals in modern history... and his name should be consigned to the list of history's most depraved and barbarous figures.\"\nThe hearing in August had been delayed by Mladic's health problems and coronavirus restrictions.\nHe remained defiant throughout, attacking both the court and the prosecutor.\nSpeaking about Srebrenica, he said he had signed an agreement with the Bosnian Muslim army to honour it and other protected areas, and suggested he was not to blame for any violation of these zones.\nBut prosecution lawyer Laurel Baig said Mladic had been convicted of some of \"the most heinous crimes of the 20th Century\".\n\"Mladic was in charge of the Srebrenica operation,\" she said. \"He used the forces under his command to execute thousands of men and boys.\"\nA defence lawyer, Dragan Ivetic, denied his client had played a role, saying: \"Mr Mladic is not a villain. He was someone who at all times was trying to help the UN do the job it couldn't do in Srebrenica at a humanitarian level.\"\nBetween 1991 and 1999 the socialist state of Yugoslavia broke up violently into separate entities covering the territories of what were then Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia. \nOf all the conflicts, the war in Bosnia was the bloodiest as, ethnically and religiously, it was the most divided.\nYugoslav army units, withdrawn from Croatia and renamed the Bosnian Serb Army, carved out a huge swathe of Serb-dominated territory in Bosnia. \nMore than a million Bosniaks and Croats were driven from their homes in so-called ethnic cleansing, and Serbs suffered too. By the time the war ended in 1995, at least 100,000 people had been killed.  \nAt the end of the war in 1995, Mladic went into hiding and lived in obscurity in Serbia, protected by family and elements of the security forces.\nHe was finally tracked down and arrested at a cousin's house in rural northern Serbia in 2011."

      "text": "Scientists in Australia have classified a new species of dinosaur, discovered in 2007, as the largest ever found on the continent.\nThe Australotitan cooperensis or \"the southern titan\", is among the 15 largest dinosaurs found worldwide.\nExperts said the titanosaur would have been up to 6.5m (21ft) tall and 30m long, or \"as long as a basketball court\".\nIts skeleton was first discovered on a farm in south-west Queensland.\nPalaeontologists had worked over the past decade to identify the dinosaur - distinguishing it from other known species by comparing scans of its bones to those of other sauropods.\nSauropods were plant-eating dinosaurs known for their size. They had small heads, very long necks, long tails and thick, pillar-like legs.\nThese dinosaurs roamed the continent during the Cretaceous Period, about 92-96 million years ago.\nThe team of researchers had nicknamed the dinosaur Cooper while working on it, after the nearby Cooper Creek where it was found.\nThe identifying process had been a lengthy one due to the remote location of the bones and their size and delicate condition.\nBut many of the remains were found intact, said researchers from the Queensland Museum and the Eromanga Natural History Museum.\nThe team found the Australotitan was closely related to three other sauropod species - the Wintonotitan, Diamantinasaurus and Savannasaurus.\n\"It looks like Australia's largest dinosaurs were all part of one big happy family,\" said Dr Scott Hocknull, one of the lead researchers.\nThe bones were first found in 2007 on a family farm near Eromanga , which was owned by two of the dinosaur researchers, Robyn and Stuart Mackenzie.\n\"It's amazing to think from the first bones discovered by our son, the first digs with the Queensland Museum, through to the development of a not-for-profit museum that runs annual dinosaur digs, all have helped us to get to this point, it's a real privilege,\" Stuart Mackenzie said.\nThe Queensland state government welcomed the classification on Tuesday- calling it a boon for local dinosaur discovery.\n\"Australia is one of the last frontiers for dinosaur discovery and Queensland is quickly cementing itself as the palaeo-capital of the nation - there is still plenty more to discover,\" said Dr Jim Thompson,  chief executive of the Queensland Museum Network.

      "tags": "Genetics,Dementia,Brain,Alzheimer's",
      "text": "Dementia is the greatest health challenge of our time, the charity Alzheimer's Research UK has warned. \nDementia was first described by the German doctor Alois Alzheimer in 1906 after he performed an autopsy on a woman with profound memory loss.\nWhat he found was a dramatically shrunken brain and abnormalities in and around nerve cells.\nAt the time dementia was rare and was then barely studied for decades.\nBut today somebody is diagnosed with it every three seconds, it is the biggest killer in some wealthier countries and is completely untreatable. \nSo what is this disease? Why is it becoming more common? And is there any hope?\nNo - dementia is a symptom found in many diseases of the brain. \nMemory loss is the most common feature of dementia, particularly the struggle to remember recent events.\nOther symptoms can include changes to behaviour, mood and personality, becoming lost in familiar places or being unable to find the right word in a conversation. \nIt can reach the point where people don't know they need to eat or drink.\nAlzheimer's disease is by far the most common of the diseases that cause dementia. \nOthers include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the newly discovered Late.\nGlobally around 50 million people are currently living with dementia. \nBut cases are predicted to soar to 130 million by 2050 as populations age.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, deaths from dementia have doubled since 2000 and dementia is now the fifth biggest killer worldwide. \nBut dementia has already claimed number one spot in some richer countries.\nIn England and Wales, one in eight death certificates cite dementia. \nThere is also a key difference with other major killers such as cancer or heart disease, because there is not a single treatment that either cures or slows the pace of any dementia. \n\"Dementia certainly is the biggest health challenge of our time,\" Hilary Evans, chief executive of the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC.\n\"It's the one that will continue to rise in terms of prevalence, unless we can do something to stop or cure this disease.\"\nAs the disease progresses, people eventually need full-time care and the annual cost of looking after people with dementia is in the region of $1 trillion a year.\nThe answer is simple - we are living longer and the biggest risk factor for dementia is age.\nThat is why huge increases in dementia cases are predicted for Asia and Africa.\nWith a more philosophical hat on, you can see dementia as the price we pay for progress in treating deadly infections, heart attacks and cancer. \nAlthough there is an unexpected and hopeful trend emerging that has surprised some in the field - the proportion of elderly people getting dementia is falling in some countries.\nStudies have shown the dementia rate (the number of cases per 1,000 people) falling in the UK, Spain and the US and stabilising in other countries.\nThis is largely being put down to improvements in areas like heart health and education which in turn benefit the brain.\nNot necessarily.\nThere used to be a public perception that dementia was a normal part of the ageing process. \nHowever, the research is clear - dementia is caused by disease.\nAnd some people who live well into their 90s and beyond have brains that remain remarkably clear of any signs of dementia. \nProf Tara Spires-Jones, the deputy director of the centre for discovery brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh,  said: \"I think there are some people who would be fine, even if they lived for another 100 years.\"\nBe in no doubt - even a drug that just slows the progression of dementia would make someone a fortune.\nIt is not for the want of trying that there is no treatment for dementia. \nAducanumab, a drug that many hoped would work in Alzheimer's disease, is just the latest to fall by the wayside. \nIn March this year, Biogen and Eisai announced their drug was unlikely to be effective and ended the trial early. \nAducanumab, like those that have failed before, had been designed to target a toxic protein called amyloid beta that builds up inside the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. \nIf you go back to Dr Alzheimer in 1906, then some of the abnormalities he found in that brain autopsy were plaques of amyloid beta. \nSo a clear connection between amyloid beta and Alzheimer's emerged and the assumption was that the protein was killing brain cells. \nTherefore removing amyloid beta should save brain cells and slam the brakes on Alzheimer's, experts thought.\nThe drug companies poured in.\nMs Evans said: \"Some pharmaceutical companies were jumping on that thinking it was going to be the golden bullet, that hasn't been the case.\"\nAnd they left other avenues, relatively, unexplored.\n\"A lot of pharmaceutical companies put all their eggs in one basket,\" says Ms Evans.\nHas science made a massive, expensive mistake? Is the \"amyloid hypothesis\" dead? These are questions being asked.\nProf Bart De Strooper, the director of UK Dementia Research Institute, told me: \"The amyloid hypothesis as has been formulated over the last 20 years is dead, that I would accept.\n\"What I won't accept is that the importance of amyloid is dead.\"\nThere is a tonne of evidence that supports amyloid having a role in some dementias.\nThis includes genetic studies on people with familial dementia, who develop the disease in their 30s and 40s. It is caused by rare mutations in their DNA that alter the way amyloid works in the body. \nProf De Strooper says: \"The genetic evidence for amyloid is so strong that it's hard to go to the other side, which says that amyloid has nothing to do with the disease.\n\"What we need is a new theory.\"\nThe role of amyloid beta is being reimagined.\nSo instead of being the toxic protein that chokes nerve cells to death, it is being seen as the initial step that culminates in the dementia. \nProf Spires-Jones said: \"Some people call it a trigger and once you've pulled the trigger then the bullet is on its way.\n\"So doing anything to the trigger is no longer an effective method.\"\nThe optimistic view is that anti-amyloid drugs may have a role in preventing Alzheimer's, but only if they are used before the disease starts. \nThat may be why the current Alzheimer's drug trials have failed, because people are being treated too late.\nSome researchers are pinning hopes on another protein called tau. \nIf amyloid beta is the trigger, tau may be the bullet.\n\"Tau is one of my favourite proteins, where there's tau there's cell death in the brain,\" says Prof Spires-Jones.\n\"I think tau is very important for somehow causing the cells to get sick and die.\"\nHowever, again this is not 100% certain and there is no evidence in human trials that lowering levels of tau in the brain is going to stop neurones dying. \nFocusing on neurones and dangerous proteins can miss the bigger picture of what is happening in the brain. \nThis is a lesson being learned from cancer, where understanding the role the immune system plays has led to a whole new branch of medicine - cancer immunotherapy.\nThe immune system is being heavily implicated in dementia too. \nIf you look at genetic mutations that increase the risk of developing dementia, then a good chunk of them are involved in the immune system. \nWhile your brain is packed with neurones that do the \"thinking\" - they are ably assisted by special immune cells called microglia. \nThey do fight infections, but also keep the brain running smoothly by munching up anything that should not be there. \nAnd the blood vessels in the brain are increasingly being seen as a key player, not just in vascular dementia, but other dementias too. \nProf De Strooper still sees abnormal proteins as the trigger, but \"then you have the response of the brain on that threat\". \nHe told the BBC: \"Some people have very good genes, very strong inflammation response or a very good vascular (blood vessel) response, and they will maintain good health even while these biochemical changes are present in the brain.\"\nAnd, on the flip side, some people who are genetically programmed to respond poorly would go on to develop dementia symptoms. \nProf De Strooper said: \"All of a sudden, you open a broad box of possible drug targets, because you can then start to think about how do we improve the response of the brain at the inflammatory side, at the vascular side, at the neuronal side? \n\"That's what at this moment is happening.\"\n\"Unfortunately, we don't have a full understanding,\" says Prof Spires-Jones.\nShe said there were key gaps in our knowledge:\n\"So there's some big questions left that we need to understand in order to effectively treat the disease,\" she said.\nBut we have switched from talking about all dementias to mostly Alzheimer's disease, where most of the medical research has been focused.\nEach type of dementia has different traits, with different parts of the brain affected and different aberrant proteins building up in the brain.\nFor example, alpha-synuclein builds up in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia.  \nThere may need to be different treatments targeting different proteins and confusingly some patients have \"mixed dementia\", with multiple diseases playing out at the same time.\nThere are two significant factors - one is the sheer complexity of the brain and the other is a lack of funding for research. \nThe human brain is the most complex structure in the known universe and is made up of 100 billion neurones.\nTo steal Prof de Strooper's analogy; if every person on the planet (currently around 7.5 billion) had a computer and they were all hooked up and working together - that would still be less than a tenth of what's going on inside the brain. \nAnd yet for every single scientific study published on any form of neurodegeneration, there are 12 on cancer. \nThe focus has simply been elsewhere.\nLess than you might think.\nWhile completely curing all forms of dementia is the goal, there could be huge benefits from drugs that just slow the pace of a dementia. \nAn analysis by Alzheimer's Research UK argued a drug that delayed the onset of dementia by five years would cut the number of people living with the disease by a third.\nThe reason is dementia tends to be a disease of old age, and if you can buy just a little bit of time then you may well have died of other causes before your brain is affected.\nSlowing the decline would also keep people living independently for longer. \nProf Spires-Jones said: \"How resilient is the brain? It's phenomenal!\"\nAfter a stroke kills brain cells it is possible to regain some degree of lost function. But this does not come from growing new brain cells, but rewiring those that remain. \nProf Spires-Jones told the BBC: \"In Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, there's a similar amount of ability of the brain to cope by changing the network.\"\nIn fact, huge amounts of damage have already been done to the brain by the time somebody is diagnosed with Alzheimer's by their family doctor. \n\"When you look at people at that stage, they've already lost half of the neurones in a part of the brain really important for memory, the entorhinal cortex,\" Prof Spires-Jones said.\nBut that creates a new problem - starting treatment at this stage is not going to recover those lost brain cells. You are mostly born with all the brain cells you will ever have (there are some exceptions).\nLet's fast forward to a world where we do have treatments and now the brain's great asset, its adaptability, is the problem as it may have masked the disease for more than a decade. \nMs Evans, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"There's no point halting the progression of the disease in end stage disease.\"\nBut equally it will not be practical for everybody to have a regular brain scan to catch dementia early, because those scans are incredibly expensive. \nOne option is the approach taken in heart disease, where millions of people take pills to lower cholesterol levels in order to stop their arteries being clogged up. \nStatins lower risk before people have a medical problem. \nMs Evans said: \"I think the analogy with statins is a good one.\n\"I think there could be something that in mid-life, you would be able to take that could then lower your risk or ensure that the development of this disease would be slow.\"\nProf de Strooper envisages a system of screening people that may even start at birth with a DNA test that predicts who is at greater risk.\nThen regular cognitive tests throughout life would act like an early warning system for people who need a more detailed examination. \nAnd patients who turn out to already have a diseased brain would be offered drugs that stop brain cells dying, all before symptoms emerge.\nThere are no guarantees, but there are ways you can lower the odds of developing dementia. \nResearch estimates that one in three cases could be prevented by lifestyle changes including:\nIt is not completely clear why these protect the brain. \nDo these lifestyle factors actually stop the process of dementia in the brain?\nOr do they prepare the brain for dementia by increasing the connections and flexibility of the brain so that as neurones start to die, the brain can compensate for longer and symptoms don't emerge?\nOn a personal level it probably doesn't matter - not getting dementia, is not getting dementia. But scientifically the questions matter as the answers will illuminate what is going on in the brain. \n\"People who are very healthy and take good care of themselves are the group that I would say is most resilient to Alzheimer's disease,\" says Prof Spires-Jones.\nThere is now far more money being spent on dementia research. \nThe optimistic view is that we are at the same point as the Aids crisis was in the 1980s, when an HIV infection was a death sentence. \nBut now people who get anti-viral drugs have a nearly normal life expectancy. \nProf Spires-Jones said: \"We know from things like cancer, that if you do a lot of science and research into a field, you can make a huge difference and find cures and treatments for these complex diseases. \n\"So I think we'll get there, but we do need to understand more about the fundamental brain changes in order to come up with effective treatments.\"\nMs Evans said: \"There are potential trials, within this year, coming to fruition, I would hope to see some positive stories out of those in the next year or two.\nAnd Prof de Strooper expects the first treatment within a decade: \"It will not cure all dementia, I think we will have to cope with that for a long time. \n\"But it will certainly postpone the disease, you will decay much slower, and dementia will be much less a threat for the society.\"\nFollow James on Twitter."

      "title": "Licensing laws: Late night as MLAs debate plan to extend pub opening times",
      "tags": "Alcohol,Northern Ireland Assembly",
      "text": "Proposals to extend opening times for pubs and nightclubs in Northern Ireland have taken another step towards becoming law.\nIt was a late night at Stormont as MLAs stayed to the early hours of Wednesday debating legislation to modernise NI's 25-year-old licensing laws.\nThe bill aims to allow pubs and clubs to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend.\nIt also proposes removing restrictions around Easter drinking.\nIt is thought the legislation could pass its final stage in the assembly by the end of the month, with most of the changes then becoming law from October.\nThe proposals have been a very long time in the making, with Stormont first putting forward changes eight years ago.\nA previous bill to change Northern Ireland's licensing laws began its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, who share power together at Stormont.\nAs the lengthy debate began on Tuesday evening, Speaker Alex Maskey said it may run until the \"early hours of the morning and maybe some of us will be driven to drink afterwards\".\nCommunities Minister Deirdre Hargey described the proposals as a \"great move which brings our drinking laws into the 21st Century\".\nAfter debating 63 amendments, the Licensing and Registration of Clubs Bill passed its consideration stage in the early hours of the morning.\nSome of assembly members who took part in the debate, including Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong and DUP Chief Whip Joanne Bunting, tweeted photos as they left work after 03:00 BST. \nOne amendment from independent unionist MLA Claire Sugden suggested extending the definition of a \"place of public entertainment\" to include cinemas, so they can sell alcohol on their premises.\nIt is understood Ms Hargey has expressed reservations about that proposal.\nHer department has instead said it is preparing to carry out a 12-week public consultation on that specific matter over the summer.\nMs Hargey told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster that the proposals were \"fundamental changes\" and it was important to consider \"what the consequences of those are\".\nShe said no consultation had been done around cinemas, and \"there are very few places at which a family can go and enjoy entertainment where there is no alcohol sold\".\n\"I do think that there is a want within the community that that is retained on one hand, that said I am willing to listen as a minister in terms of doing further consultation on this,\" she added.\n\"I don't think it is good, at this point of laying legislation, of making a change that would be significant like this without doing the due consultation and seeing the impact.\n\"I want to make sure on the issue of cinemas and looking at that entertainment, which is very family focused, that we do more consultation on that issue.\"\nMs Sugden had questioned delaying a proposal that she believed was \"inevitable\".\nShe said cinemas in other parts of the UK can already sell alcohol to customers and she hoped MLAs would support her amendment.\n\"Cinemas have had a really difficult year with the pandemic and anything we can do to support them can only be a good thing,\" she added.\nOther changes in the bill include the extension in \"drinking-up time\" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends.\nThe law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol.\nThe current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements.\nColin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said that there had been a \"number of false dawns\" in relation to modernising licensing laws and now change was \"tantalisingly close\".\n\"We recognise alcohol is a controlled substance and needs to be treated as such, we haven't come asking for 24-hour drinking like England or deregulation, this is about looking at what the customer wants and actually modernise it.\n\"They are modest but significant in their impact measures, because people do go out later now, they want to go out and socialise.\n\"We have to be able to provide that (extended hours) particularly with tourists visiting here as well.\"\nMichael McAdam, managing director of Movie House Cinemas, said adults could already sample alcohol if they were watching an event at theatres in Northern Ireland.\n\"All we are saying at cinema is please give us a chance to be in line, to serve our customers, to give our customers what they want,\" he said.\n\"That is the choice to make an adult decision if they want to have an alcoholic beverage or not.\"\nAn amendment that would require the Northern Ireland Executive to review the \"surrender principle\" in Northern Ireland licensing law was one of those passed at Stormont. \nThe principle means no new licence can ever be granted unless another one is surrendered.\nLicences for selling alcohol on and off premises are also convertible in court, which means that every supermarket or convenience store seeking to add an off sales needs to acquire a licence from somewhere else.\nThe SDLP's Matthew O'Toole, who proposed the amendment, said that was likely to have contributed to the decline in the number of pubs and made it very difficult for new rural or small town pubs to be created as licences are scarce and expensive assets.\nHe emphasised that any review would have to carefully consider all the impacts - including on existing licensees.\nHe said: \"My amendment simply requires the department to appoint an independent person to review the licensing system, including the surrender principle.\n\"Critically the amendment makes clear that the reviewer has to have regard to the interests of existing licence holders, by ensuring they consider options for compensation in the event of reform.\"\nColin Neill said Hospitality Ulster members were \"terrified\" by Mr O'Toole's proposal, saying that bar owners were \"incredibly vulnerable\" following the latest Covid-19 lockdown.\nMr O'Toole is also proposing that the department should publish an annual report on the number of pubs and operational licenses by postcode.\nHe added: \"These amendments are not about rushing into reform - they are about getting robust information to plan for reform.\""

      "title": "Parliament: Shake-up of England's electoral map outlined",
      "tags": "David Cameron,House of Commons",
      "text": "Parts of the North of England and the Midlands will lose parliamentary seats while areas in the South gain under proposals for a shake-up of England's electoral map in 2023.\nThe Boundary Commission for England says the aim is to make Parliament fairer by giving each MP a roughly similar number of voters. \nIt means redrawing and renaming some seats.\nScotland and Wales will see their total cut - while England gains 10 MPs. \nThe task of reconfiguring parliamentary constituencies is being carried out by independent commissions in each UK nation who will report separately, with the plans for England the first to be published. \nThe proposals suggest the first major overhaul of seat boundaries in England since 2010, with just under 10% of existing constituencies remaining unchanged.   \nUnlike previous reviews, the total number of seats in the House of Commons will stay at 650 but population changes mean England is set to have 543 MPs, Wales 32 and Scotland 57 - that is an extra 10 for England, with Wales losing eight and Scotland's count cut by two. \nIt comes after plans by the former conservative prime minister, David Cameron, to cut 50 seats were dropped by the government in March 2020 because of the \"Brexit workload\". \nThe review is designed to end the discrepancies in the current system with some MPs having only 50,000 constituents and others having double that. \nSeats will be redrawn so they have, by law, between 69,724 and 77,062 registered voters each; with some island constituencies, such as the Isle of Wight and Anglesey, being given special dispensation to be outside these requirements. \nPopulation changes mean that, in England, the North East, the North West and the West Midlands will lose two seats each, while London gains two, the South West gets three extra and the South East is up seven. \nA seat straddling Devon and Cornwall has been avoided but the Commission said it had \"not always been possible to allocate whole numbers of constituencies to individual counties\" or to avoid crossing boundaries and that \"significant change\" was necessary in Avon, Somerset and Devon.\nLikewise in London, 31 constituencies will cut across borough boundaries.\nAmong constituencies affected are Sir Keir's Holborn and St Pancras constituency, which could be renamed Kentish Town and Bloomsbury to reflect the changes; while Chancellor Rishi Sunak's North Yorkshire seat could see alterations.\nTory MP for Lichfield in Staffordshire, Michael Fabricant, says the changes show \"no knowledge\" of his constituency.\n\"It divides Lichfield Trent Valley station in two and cuts off the eastern edge of Lichfield itself. Frankly, it's a nonsense,\" he said.\nHe added: \"It bears all the hallmarks of boundaries drawn in the 19th and 20th centuries by Whitehall mapmakers in days of empire without any knowledge or care of the regions and people concerned.\"\nBut Boundary Commission Secretary Tim Bowden stressed that while the proposals mark the first chance people will have to see what the new parliamentary map could look like, these are just \"initial thoughts\". \nHe said the Commission wanted to hear the views of the public to \"ensure that we get the new boundaries for parliamentary constituencies right\".\nBy Sean Curran, BBC parliamentary correspondent\nIf these proposals sound familiar that's because it's taken years to redraw the electoral map. \n A lot has happened in British politics since the then prime minister, David Cameron, asked the independent boundary commissions to draw up plans for a smaller House of Commons made up of 600 seats all with roughly the same number of voters.\nFor years Conservatives had complained that the way the electoral map was drawn up gave their political opponents an unfair advantage. They argued that Labour seats tended to have fewer voters than Tory areas.   \nLabour responded by accusing the coalition of gerrymandering. \nThe changes were never introduced because Nick Clegg pulled the plug on the proposals after a rebellion by Conservative MPs killed off plans to reform the House of Lords.  \nBut the plans to get rid of 50 MPs never went away and nor did the arguments.\nIt was probably always going to be a challenge to get MPs to vote themselves out of a job and Theresa May didn't have enough support to get the plans through parliament. \nBoris Johnson's government has dropped the idea of cutting the number of MPs which might take some of the sting out of the forthcoming changes but every shake up of the boundaries produces winners and losers.\nSome MPs will find themselves with safer seats, others will see their seats disappear altogether. There will be some gloomy and disappointed politicians at Westminster today, but this is only the start of a long consultation and this is unlikely to be the final picture.  \nThe initial proposals will now be subject to consultations and revisions.\nThis first one will run for eight weeks before closing on 2 August. \nA second consultation with public hearings will then get under way in spring 2022, followed by a final four-week consultation on revised plans in autumn 2022. \nFinal recommendations are due by 1 July 2023, after which the government has four months to implement the plans.\nThe changes will only come into effect in late 2023, which could be be too late for the next election if Boris Johnson decides to call it early.  \nThe Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill brought forward in the Queen's Speech would make it possible for the prime minister to call an election before 2024, when one is next due under the current rules. \nIf that were to happen before the new boundaries are in place, the election would be fought on the old boundaries. \nSome polling experts have suggested the review could hand more seats to the Tories.\nBut Martin Baxter, founder of Electoral Calculus, said it was likely to be a mixed bag.\n\"People have been moving from Wales and the North of England down to the South, which means fewer seats in the North and more seats in the South. \n\"That helps the Conservatives overall, but not as much as it might have done since they now hold some 'red wall' seats themselves which might disappear, and there will also be more seats in Labour-friendly areas such as London.\"\nBut he said \"the net change will be fairly modest, and would be easily dwarfed by a change in public opinion by a percent or two\".\n\"The next election will ultimately be decided by the views of the British people rather than by the precise shape of all the constituency boundaries.\"\nThe new review for England is estimated to cost \u00a32.5m. \nPublic feedback to the initial plans set out in the 2018 review changed 50% of the initial plans."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,NHS England,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All adults aged 25 to 29 in England who have not yet had a Covid vaccine will be able to book their first dose from Tuesday.\nThe move brings the UK a step closer to meeting the target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said vaccines were breaking the link between infections, hospitalisations and deaths.\nBut he said it was too soon to decide the next steps of unlocking.\nThat's because Covid cases are rising again, linked to a new variant first found in India, also known as B.1.617.2 or Delta. \nIt is now the dominant type in circulation and surge testing is taking place to try to stop it spreading further.\nUnder the government's proposed timetable remaining restrictions are due to removed on 21 June - the so-called step four of the road map back to normality.\nMr Hancock told MPs: \"It is too early to make decisions on step four, the road map has always been guided by the data.\n\"So we'll assess the data and announce the outcome a week today on 14 June.\"\nHe said jabs were still working though, \"breaking the link between infections, hospitalisations and deaths, a link that was rock solid back in the autumn\".\n\"Despite the rise in cases, hospitalisations have been broadly flat. The majority of people in hospital with Covid appear to be those who haven't had the vaccine at all.\"\nOf the 12,383 new cases as of 3 June, 464 went on to present at emergency care and 126 were admitted to hospital.\nOf those, 83 were unvaccinated, 28 had one dose of vaccine and three had both doses, he said.\nHe also urged secondary school children to continue to take twice-weekly lateral flow tests, stressing cases were rising fastest among older schoolchildren. \nIn England, people aged 25 and older can go online or call 119 to book.\nIn Scotland, people aged 30 and over are eligible for a vaccine. Wales is six weeks ahead of schedule and is vaccinating over 18s. In Northern Ireland, people 18 and over are invited to book.\nNHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said: \"Getting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do, with NHS staff vaccinating at over 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship, sport stadiums and other convenient locations. \n\"So, when you get that text, book your appointment and join the millions who are already protected.\"\nPeople aged 39 and under who are eligible and pregnant women will be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, in line with guidance.\nA total of 40,460,576 people in the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, while 27,921,294 have received both.\nMeanwhile, the UK has recorded more than 5,000 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours.\nThere have been a further 154 hospital admissions, and there are currently 932 people being treated for Covid in hospital."

      "tags": "Siberia,Russia",
      "text": "A microscopic multi-celled organism has returned to life after being frozen for 24,000 years in Siberia, according to new research.\nScientists dug up the animal known as a bdelloid rotifer from the Alayeza River in the Russian Arctic.\nOnce thawed, it was able to reproduce asexually, after spending millennia in a state of frozen animation known as crytobiosis.\nPrevious research said they could survive frozen for up to 10 years.\nBut the new study, published in Current Biology on Monday, suggested they could last for thousands of years, if not indefinitely. \n\"The takeaway is that a multicellular organism can be frozen and stored as such for thousands of years and then return back to life - a dream of many fiction writers,\" Stas Malavin, of Russia's Institute of Physicochemical and Biological Problems in Soil Science, told the Press Association.\nHe said more research was needed to see how it achieved the feat. The scientists in the study froze and thawed dozens of the animals in a laboratory to examine the process.\nRadiocarbon dating aged the bdelloid rotifer specimen at between 23,960 and 24,485 years old.\nBdelloid rotifers are a class of rotifer found in freshwater environments around the world. The name rotifer comes from the Latin meaning \"wheel bearer\".\nThe creatures are known for their ability to withstand extremes. They are one of the Earth's most radioactive-resistant animals, according to the New York Times, which reports they can also withstand low oxygen, starvation, high acidity and years of dehydration.\nThere are reports of other multi-celled organisms coming back to life after thousands of years, including a nematode worm, as well as some plants and mosses.

      "title": "Covid vaccine tracker: How\u2019s my country and the rest of the world doing?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "When it comes to the coronavirus vaccine there is one question most people are asking - when will I get it? A handful of countries have set very specific vaccination targets, but for the rest of the world the picture is less clear. \nGetting the world vaccinated against Covid-19 is a matter of life and death, involving complicated scientific processes, multinational corporations, government promises and backroom deals. So figuring out when and how everyone in the world will get the vaccine is not easy.\nAgathe Demarais is the director of global forecasting at the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has done some of the most comprehensive research on the topic. She has looked at the world's production capacity, along with the healthcare facilities needed to get vaccines into people's arms, the number of people a country has to contend with, and what they can afford. \nMany of the findings seem to fall along predictable lines of rich v poor. The UK and the US are both well supplied with vaccines right now because they could afford to invest a lot of money into vaccine development and put themselves at the front of the queue.\nRich countries that didn't do that, like Canada or those in the EU bloc, are a little further behind. Canada was criticised at the end of last year for buying up five times the supply it needs to cover its population, but it seems it wasn't positioned for priority delivery. \nThat's partly because the country decided to invest in vaccines from European factories, afraid that the US under Donald Trump would issue export bans. It turned out to be a bad bet. European factories are struggling with supply and recently it has been the EU, not the US, that has been threatening export bans.\n\"As long as the European market doesn't have enough vaccines, I think that big imports to Canada are going to remain off the cards,\" says Ms Demarais. Most low-income countries haven't started vaccinating yet. But some countries in the middle are doing better than expected.\nSerbia is eighth in the world in terms of the percentage of its population vaccinated, ahead of any country in the EU.\nIts success is partly down to an efficient roll-out but it's also benefitting from vaccine diplomacy - a battle between Russia and China for influence in eastern Europe. It's one of the few places where the Russian vaccine Sputnik V and the Chinese vaccine SinoPharm are already available.\nOn paper, Serbians are given a choice of what vaccine they would prefer - Pfizer, Sputnik or SinoPharm. In reality, most people end up being given SinoPharm.\nAnd the influence China is exerting here is likely to be long-term. Countries giving a first and second dose of one of the Chinese vaccines are also likely to look to Beijing for booster doses if needed.\nThe United Arab Emirates is also relying heavily on the SinoPharm vaccine - it makes up 80% of the doses being administered there right now. And the UAE is building a SinoPharm production facility.\n\"China is coming with production facilities, trained workers, so it's going to give long-term influence to China,\" says Ms Demarais. \"And it will make it very, very tricky for recipient governments to say no to China for anything in the future.\"\nBeing a global vaccine superpower, however, doesn't mean your population will be vaccinated first. The EIU's research predicts two of the world's vaccine production powerhouses, China and India, may not be sufficiently vaccinated until the end of 2022. That's because they have huge populations to contend with, as well as a shortage of health workers.\nIn India, the country's success as a Covid vaccine producer is largely down to one man, Adar Poonawalla. He's chief executive of the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine producer.\nLast year, his family started to think he has lost his mind when he began betting hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money on vaccines that he didn't know would work.\nIn January, the first of those vaccines, developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca, was delivered to the Indian government. Now he's producing 2.4 million doses a day. He's one of two main suppliers to the Indian government - and is also supplying Brazil, Morocco, Bangladesh and South Africa.\n\"I thought the pressure and all the madness would end now that we've made the product,\" he says. \"But the real challenge is trying to keep everybody happy.\n\"I thought there'd be so many other manufacturers who would be able to supply. But sadly, at the moment at least, in the first quarter, and perhaps even the second quarter of 2021, we're not going to see a substantial increase in supply.\"\nHe says production cannot be ramped up overnight. \"It takes time,\" Mr Ponnawalla adds. \"People think that the Serum Institute has got a magic sauce. Yes, we're good at what we do but it's not a magic wand.\" He currently has an edge because he started building facilities in March last year, as well as stockpiling things like chemicals and glass vials in August.\nFor manufacturers starting production now, it will take months to produce vaccines. And the same applies to any boosters that might be needed to tackle new variants.\nMr Ponnawalla says he is committed to supplying India and then Africa through a scheme called the Covax facility.\nCovax, an initiative led by the WHO and other health organisations, aims to get affordable vaccines to every country in the world. Countries that can't afford vaccines will get them for free through a special fund. The rest will pay. But the theory is that they will get a better price by negotiating through the bloc than if they had done so on their own.\nCovax is planning to start delivering vaccines this month. But the plan is being undermined by the fact many countries involved are also negotiating their own deals on the side. \nMr Poonawalla says almost every leader in Africa has been in touch with him to access vaccines independently. Last week, Uganda announced it had secured 18 million doses from the Serum Institute at $7 a jab - much more than the $4 being paid by Covax. The institute says it is in talks with Uganda but denies this deal was ever signed.\nIn total, Mr Poonawalla's firm is due to supply 200m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Covax and has promised 900m more doses in the future. \nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has since advised against rollout of the vaccine in countries where the South African strain is present. He says he is still committed to the scheme, but admits it faces problems. It's dealing with too many different vaccine producers, he says, each offering varying prices and timelines for delivery.\nMs Demarais and the EIU are not overly optimistic about what Covax can achieve either. The timelines for delivery of vaccines are still not clear and even if things go according to plan, the scheme only aims to cover 20-27% of a country's population this year. \"It's going to make a small marginal difference, but not a game-changer,\" she says.\nIn her forecast, some countries may not get widespread coverage even by 2023. Some may never be fully covered. Vaccination may not be a priority for every country, especially one that has a young population and is not seeing huge numbers of people getting sick.\nThe problem with that scenario is as long as the virus can prosper somewhere it will be able to mutate and migrate. Vaccine-resistant variants will continue to evolve.\nIt's not all bad news. Vaccines are being produced faster than ever but the scale of the task - inoculating 7.8 billion people around the world - is gigantic. And it's never been attempted before. \nMs Demarais believes governments should level with their people on what is possible. \"It's very difficult for a government to say, 'No, we're not going to achieve widespread immunisation coverage before several years.' Nobody wants to say that.\"\nData journalism by Becky Dale and Nassos Stylianou."

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Two of Scotland's education authorities are to be reformed amid criticism of the plans put in place to replace school exams.\nThe Scottish government said the role, remit and purpose of Education Scotland and the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) would be examined. \nThe announcement was made by Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville. \nShe had earlier said she would take \"full responsibility\" for the new system.\nThe SQA is responsible for delivering the exam diet for older pupils in Scottish schools every year, while Education Scotland is tasked with improving the quality of the country's education system.\nThe SQA in particular has faced heavy criticism, with some opposition politicians calling for it to be scrapped and replaced. \nIts chief executive, Fiona Robertson, said the organisation would play a full part in the review and remained focused on \"working with the whole education system to support our young people to get the qualifications they deserve this year\". \nSpeaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday afternoon, Ms Somerville said reforms to the two education bodies would form part of \"wide-ranging plans for education recovery\" over the next 100 days and beyond. \nAnd she said the announcement showed \"our determination to deliver improvements with pace and urgency\".\nShe added: \"I am open to considering what further reform is necessary, with the clear purpose of doing all we can to improve outcomes for children. \n\"This includes reducing variability in the outcomes children and young people achieve across the country\".\nThe announcement came shortly after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisted she had full confidence in the SQA while admitting that the system that had been drawn up was \"not perfect\".\nMuch of the anger has centred on the appeals process for pupils unhappy with their grades, which could see their final results revised down as well as up.\nOpposition parties have said this would make decisions on whether to appeal or not a \"perverse gamble\" for pupils.\nThe alternative qualifications model was introduced after formal exams were cancelled for a second year running to the Covid pandemic.\nGrades are to be awarded on the basis of \"teacher judgement of evidence of learner attainment\".\nBut the second national lockdown at the start of the year meant most of the assessment work done by teachers has come in the final weeks of term.\nThis led to claims that the system was effectively \"exams by another name\" which were being conducted with less preparation and often in a more intensive time period.\nSome pupils have said that going through the new system was more stressful than the traditional exam process.\nThe Scottish government was forced to U-turn last year and upgrade the results of tens of thousands of pupils after an outcry over how the grades had been awarded.\nThe Scottish Conservatives' education spokesman Oliver Mundell said the SQA \"isn't fit for purpose and must be axed\".\n \"The SNP can't have it both ways. Nicola Sturgeon said she had full confidence in the SQA, yet a couple of hours later her education secretary announces that she wants to reform the SQA after its continued failures.\n\"That will hardly inspire confidence among pupils, parents and teachers who the SNP have continually let down.\"\nUntil this afternoon, the SNP government was alone in supporting the SQA and Education Scotland as they stand.\nEvery other political party has been calling for them to be reformed. Parliament passed a motion saying they were not fit for purpose back in February. \nIn an interview this morning, the education secretary said she had full confidence in the SQA and during First Minister's Questions at lunchtime, Nicola Sturgeon said the same.\nTwo hours later, plans were announced to reform both organisations.\nShirley-Anne Somerville is now walking the line between saying the assessment process overseen by both of these institutions is credible and fair - and at the same time saying they need to be fundamentally changed.\nScottish Labour accused the government of \"sticking their head in the sand over the ongoing exams crisis\", and said that a \"vague commitment\" to a future review of the SQA does not go far enough. \nThe Scottish Greens tabled an amendment in the Scottish Parliament - which was defeated by 60 votes to 59 - urging MSPS to acknowledge the \"additional stress and anxiety felt by students, teachers, parents and carers as a result of the 2021 alternative certification model\".\nThe party says this year's model should adopt a no-detriment policy - meaning grades cannot be lowered - and has criticised the \"repeated underperformance of the SQA\".\nThe National Union of Students (NUS) Scotland backed those calls \"to ensure no student is left academically disadvantaged by an appeal, and that exceptional circumstances are taken into consideration\".\nThe EIS teaching union's general secretary, Larry Flanagan, welcomed the review, and said Education Scotland should be \"free to challenge government, rather than being an extension of the civil service\".\nHe added: \"Our members have often found the SQA to be too remote from classroom practice and a significant generator of additional workload for teachers.\"\nThe NASUWT union said the reforms must be \"more than a cosmetic exercise\" while NSPCC Scotland called for more focus on children's emotional wellbeing and mental health.\nSpeaking about the appeals process, an SQA spokesman said:  \"We have listened to the views of young people in developing this year's appeals service. For the first time young people have a free and direct right of appeal on a broad range of grounds. \n\"Representatives from the Scottish Youth Parliament have been at every meeting of the NQ Group 2021 over the last six months. The Scottish Youth Parliament also runs our Learner Panel, which gathers the views of learners from across Scotland. \n\"All communication from the NQ Group 2021, including those directly for learners, are agreed with the Scottish Youth Parliament and they have been instrumental in the communications from the NQ Group to learners.\"\nCameron Garrett, convenor of the education committee on the Scottish Youth Parliament, is the only young person on the NQ21 group. \nHe told Radio Scotland he did not feel listened to, and that his voice was \"drowned out\". He said the views of young people had to be considered more. "

      "text": "Police in Norway have said a body found on the country's coast earlier this year is that of a missing 15 month old who died in the English Channel.\nThe child, named Artin, died along with four family members when the boat they were travelling in sank in October.\nThe Kurdish-Iranian family had been attempting to reach the UK from France.\nRelatives of the family have spoken of their grief and confusion as they waited to hear what had happened to Artin.\nNow the child's remains will be flown back to Iran to be buried.\nOn Monday, police in Norway said the body had been found on the country's south-western shore near Karmoy by two officers on New Year's Day.\n\"We didn't have a missing baby reported in Norway, and no family had contacted the police,\" Camilla Tjelle Waage, the head of police investigations, told the BBC.\n\"The blue overall wasn't a Norwegian brand either [and] that indicated the baby was not from Norway,\" she added.\nA DNA profile was then obtained and the family were notified that it was in fact Artin.\n\"Skilled professionals in the department of forensic sciences at Oslo University Hospital managed to retrieve matching DNA profiles,\" the police statement said.\nThe boat carrying the family sank in the Channel on 27 October. Rasoul Iran-Nejad, 35, Shiva Mohammad Panahi, 35, Anita, nine, and Armin, six, all died.\nThe family were from the city of Sardasht in western Iran, near to the border with Iraq.\nFifteen other migrants were taken to hospital and an investigation into the sinking was opened in Dunkirk by the French public prosecutor.\nNihayat, the second aunt of Artin, was the first relative Norwegian police spoke to. \"I'm both happy and sad,\" she told the BBC on Monday. \"Happy that Artin's remains were eventually found, and sad that he left us for good.\"\nShavin, the child's aunt who lives in Switzerland, said she wanted Artin to be \"reunited with the rest of his family\". She said they would complete the required paperwork so Artin's remains could be returned to Sardasht.\nShortly after the sinking, the BBC saw a series of text messages believed to have been sent by Ms Mohammad Panahi, including one that acknowledged the danger of crossing the Channel by boat but concluded \"we have no choice\".\n\"If we want to go with a lorry we might need more money that we don't have,\" a second message read.\nAnother said: \"I have a thousand sorrows in my heart and now that I have left Iran I would like to forget my past.\"\nAt a camp in Dunkirk, another refugee, Bilal Gaf, said the family stayed close to his tent for three or four days before they left, and described Artin as \"famous\" among those staying there.\n\"He was a very happy baby,\" he said, showing photographs of himself with the child, taken around 10 days earlier.\n\"People are sad, but what can we do? Nothing. Just cry.\"\nThousands of Iranian-Kurdish refugees put the lives of their families in the hands of smugglers and go to Europe every year.\nThe Kurdish region in Iran has faced both political persecution and vast economic disparity. \nBetween 25 and 35 million Kurds inhabit a mountainous region straddling the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia.\nThey make up the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East, but they have never obtained a permanent nation state."
