      "title": "Water companies illegally dumping sewage in England and Wales' rivers",
      "tags": "Pollution,Rivers,Environment,Environment Agency",
      "text": "Water companies have been illegally dumping untreated sewage into rivers in England and Wales, an investigation by BBC Panorama has found.\nData analysed by the programme showed some companies have regularly breached the conditions in their permits.\nTreatment works are only allowed to put sewage into waterways after wet weather and when they are close to capacity.\nThe water industry says it will invest more than a billion pounds over five years to reduce discharges into rivers.\nTreatment works are allowed to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather, such as torrential rain, and when they are operating close to full capacity.\nThis protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes.\nThe untreated sewage is normally screened and passed through storage tanks before it is dumped.\nDischarge permits issued by the Environment Agency specify the level of sewage each works has to treat before it can dump untreated sewage.\nBut Panorama's investigation found one water company was discharging sewage without a permit and evidence that another company had given the Environment Agency incorrect information about the sewage it was dumping in the river.\nRecent figures published by the Environment Agency reveal untreated sewage, including human waste, wet wipes and condoms, was released into waterways for more than three million hours last year.\nPanorama gathered detailed data from 10 water companies in England and Wales through environmental information requests. They were each asked for information on a handful of sewage works.\nThe data suggests seven of the 10 companies had treatment works that were breaching their permits by dumping sewage before they were treating the specified volumes.\nOne of the worst offenders was the not-for-profit company, Welsh Water. The data shows three of its treatment works were in breach of their permits.\nIts Aberbaiden plant illegally dumped untreated sewage into the River Usk on 12 consecutive days in December.\nThe Usk is supposed to be a protected river, as it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation.\nAngela Jones, who swims in the river every day, was shocked by the programme's findings: \"I know so many people who swim up that area, you know. It's just appalling, absolutely appalling. \n\"We can see clearly that they are releasing sewage into the water when they're not allowed to.\"\nOpen water swimmers, kayakers, paddlers and dog walkers have been asked to avoid contact with the water during and after sewage spills. \nThe Rivers Trust, an organisation which campaigns to protect rivers in England and Wales, has compiled a map of where water companies release treated sewage and overflows of untreated sewage into rivers.\nIt advises people not to enter the water immediately downstream of where treated sewage is released, and to avoid the overflow areas, especially after wet weather.\nPanorama also discovered Welsh Water has been using a sewage overflow pipe on the River Usk that doesn't have a permit.\nThe company has been illegally dumping untreated sewage through the pipe, sometimes on several occasions a day.\nWelsh Water told the programme it hoped to have a permit for the overflow pipe by July and it doesn't accept its sites are operating illegally. \nThe company said it works closely with regulators and works hard to comply with all environmental regulations. \n\"We continue to invest significantly in our network so that we minimise the impact of our activities on the environment. However, these solutions and processes can sometimes take many years to resolve in order to fully investigate, design solutions, and secure funding.\"\nAdditional data about an eleventh water company, Thames Water, was shared with the programme by the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.\nIt showed the company's giant Mogden treatment works in south-west London has been illegally dumping billions of litres of untreated sewage.\nThe data revealed Mogden - which deals with waste from more than two million people in the city - breached its permit on 43 days last year.\nAnother Thames Water site, Stanton Harcourt in Oxfordshire, dumped sewage almost continuously for three consecutive months at the start of last year.\nThames Water said the sewage is partially treated because it is screened and settled in storage tanks. \nIt said a small number of its sewage works have struggled following periods of heavy rainfall and it is investing heavily to improve the sites.\n\"Putting untreated sewage into rivers is unacceptable to us, to our customers and to the environment, even when legally permitted,\" the company said. \"We absolutely want to go further, invest more, and play our part in helping the environment to thrive.\"\nPanorama also investigated the Wetherby treatment works run by Yorkshire Water.\nFootage shot by local campaigner Mark Barrow shows the works dumped untreated sewage into the River Wharfe on several occasions last year.\nBut the programme found Yorkshire Water failed to report any of these spills to the Environment Agency.\nIts annual filing showed no sewage dumping at all at Wetherby.\nYorkshire Water said: \"We have not misled the Environment Agency, this is a single data anomaly within a very large set of data and we will certainly investigate what has happened here. There is a process for correcting submitted data with the Environment Agency and if it is found that there has been an unreported discharge we will report this in due course.\"\nPanorama: The river pollution scandal will be on BBC One at 19:40 BST and later on the BBC iPlayer."

      "tags": "David Cameron,UK government,Greensill Capital",
      "text": "The government has announced a review covering David Cameron's efforts to lobby ministers on behalf of finance firm Greensill Capital.\nThe former prime minister has been criticised for contacting ministers via text on behalf of the company, which collapsed in March.\nDowning Street said the probe would be led by lawyer Nigel Boardman on behalf of the Cabinet Office. \nLabour says the government's response is \"inadequate\". \nMr Cameron has said he has not broken any codes of conduct or lobbying rules.\nBut in a statement on Sunday weeks after reports of his lobbying emerged, the former Tory leader said that he should have contacted ministers through \"formal\" channels.\nA spokesman for the former PM told the BBC: \"David Cameron welcomes the inquiry and will be glad to take part.\" \nMr Cameron began working as an adviser to Greensill Capital in August 2018, two years after he stepped down as prime minister.\nIn recent weeks, newspaper reports have revealed he texted Chancellor Rishi Sunak and other Treasury ministers on behalf of the company. \nMr Cameron said he had been trying to involve the company in a government-backed emergency loans scheme for firms hit by the Covid pandemic. \nThe government went on to reject his plans to involve Greensill in the so-called Covid Corporate Financing Facility.\nIt has also been revealed that Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a \"private drink\" in 2019 to discuss a payment scheme for the NHS. \nAn ally of Mr Hancock said he had \"acted in entirely the correct way\".\nIf you hope that the review that is meant to clear up what happened in this instance will propose some big crackdown, forget it.  Just like the organisation that provides rules for former ministers, it has no power of sanction, no statutory, or legal force. \nSources suggests its remit is to find out narrowly what happened with Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill, not to start a conversation about the rights and wrongs of lobbying, let alone to propose a new system. \nThat is not to cast aspersions either on the ability of the senior lawyer who will carry out the work, who may well turn up more interesting nuggets. \nHe'll report by the end of June, and has been promised access to the information he needs.  But the remit is tightly drawn, suggesting little appetite in government for a big rethink of the landscape.\nDowning Street insists the prime minster understands the significant public interest and wants to look at the issues raised and get more details.\nWhile there is no love lost between Boris Johnson and David Cameron, and it is pretty much impossible to think of a similar case where a serving PM commissions an investigation into one of his predecessors, Labour is already warning that it could be a \"Conservative cover-up\". \nDespite that rather dramatic language, do not forget there are questions that remain for current government figures about conversations they had with Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill. \nRead more here\nA Cabinet Office spokesperson said the review would look into \"the decisions taken around the development and use of supply chain finance (and associated schemes) in government, especially the role of Lex Greensill and Greensill Capital\".\n\"Mr Boardman will have access to all necessary government information required to conduct the review and will engage with those involved at the time when decisions were made.\"\nThe spokesperson also said that Mr Boardman would report his findings to the prime minister \"no later than the end of June 2021\" and that he will pause his work as a non-executive director of the Business Department while the review is carried out.\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg says it is understood the review will not have legal powers, and is likely to come up with findings rather than recommendations. \nAnd Mr Boardman has not been asked to suggest ways of tightening up the lobbying system, but has been given a limited remit to ascertain how decisions about Greensill Capital were made. \nThe shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said what the government has announced \"doesn't go far enough\". \n\"There is a real risk that the government are attempting to brush under the carpet or cover up this scandal of cronyism, of contracts and of involvement of the former prime minister in lobbying current ministers\" she said. \n\"It is essential that everybody involved in this scandal comes before parliament and answers serious and important questions about possible wrongdoing\" she added. \nMr Cameron's predecessor at No 10, Gordon Brown, welcomed an inquiry, adding: \"it's important to get to the bottom of this\".\nThe ex-Labour leader told BBC News: \"I don't really think former ministers and prime ministers should be engaged in lobbying for particular commercial companies, when they are lobbying their successors whom they know very well and could have privileged access to.\n\"Lobbying in this commercial way could also be a stain on our democracy, and therefore an inquiry is completely appropriate.\"\nFormer ministers and senior civil servants are banned from lobbying for two years after they leave government, a rule Mr Cameron followed.\nMr Brown had suggested earlier on Monday the ban should be extended to five years if existing rules prove inadequate.

      "text": "Secondary and primary pupils in six Scottish councils have returned to full-time, in-class lessons following the Easter break.\nThe return of pupils in Aberdeen, Fife, Dumfries and Galloway, Moray, Shetland and the Western Isles marks the end of distance learning for many.\nPupils will no longer have to follow strict physical distancing rules, but will still need to wear face coverings.\nThe majority of Scotland's pupils are due to return to school on 19 April.\nHowever, pupils in Edinburgh and Midlothian councils will return on 20 April.\nMinisters have said that schools will need to adopt enhanced safety precautions, such as improved ventilation and Covid testing, to mitigate the relaxation of physical distancing measures.\nPrimary schools had already resumed full-time teaching before the Easter holidays, but a part-time blended learning system had been in place in secondary schools.\nAlison Murison, head teacher at Aberdeen Grammar School, was among those who welcomed back pupils after the Easter holiday. \n\"The staff and pupils have worked so hard to keep learning going but they know that nothing replicates being in the classroom,\" she said. \"That's what they are looking forward to.\"\nShe said the return to school was the \"big prize\" they had been waiting for. \nIn addition to measures introduced in August, they now have regular lateral flow testing, and pupils and staff would wear masks inside buildings at all times.  \n\"It is so, so important that we adhere to those,\" Ms Murison said. \"I am confident because the pupils, the staff, the parents have all been right behind me from the start in making sure that we follow these mitigations. They have been hugely supportive. \" \nThe only exception to pupils returning will be those in the shielding category.\nThe first minister has said that pupils who were shielding should stay at home until 26 April, in line with advice from the chief medical officer.\nIt comes after this year's National 5s, Highers and Advanced Highers were cancelled because of disruption caused by the pandemic.\nGrades will instead be based on \"teacher judgement\" backed up by evidence gathered in tests.\nHowever, the approach across schools varies - with some spreading the tests over class lesson times while others will do them in one go, with invigilators on hand to ensure strict exam conditions are met.\nHugh McCulloch, head teacher of Elgin High School in Moray, said it had been a \"challenging time for young people\" but staff had been involved in consultations over what the new assessments would look like. \n\"They are slimmed down and will take account of what the student's learning has been over the broken down year that they have had,\" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland. \nHe added: \"You've got a lot of teacher professional judgement as well which will contribute to that.\n\"I do believe we will be able to support them to get the results that they are worthy of with these assessment diets.\""

I think they need to show more compassion to new parents. \n\"It's very tiring having a new child. I wouldn't want to have someone sat on the jury who was exhausted or couldn't pay full attention.\n\"If anyone's on parental leave they should be exempt from it. It's precious time and should be protected, and the court should recognise that.\"\nHer appeal is due to be considered by a judge at Winchester Crown Court. \nHM Courts and Tribunals Service said: \"Crown court practice is to defer new mums that are breastfeeding.

      "text": "Tear gas has been fired and a curfew imposed amid angry protests after police fatally shot a black man in a traffic stop in the US city of Brooklyn Center, just north of Minneapolis.\nThe man has been identified by relatives as 20-year-old Daunte Wright.\nPolice Chief Tim Gannon has told media the shooting was accidental.\n\"It is my belief the officer meant to deploy their Taser but shot him with a single bullet,\" he said on Monday morning.\nThe officer is now on administrative leave while an investigation is carried out.\nBrooklyn Center's mayor issued a curfew that lasted until 06:00 (11:00 GMT), telling people to \"be safe, go home\".\nTensions in Minneapolis are high as the trial of a former officer accused of killing George Floyd takes place.\nA courtroom just 10 miles (16km) from the latest unrest will resume proceedings on Monday, with the prosecution expected to wrap up its case and the defence of the ex-officer, Derek Chauvin, to begin.\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to hold a news conference Monday afternoon.\nHundreds of protesters chanting Daunte Wright's name gathered late on Sunday outside the police headquarters in Brooklyn Center.\nTensions rose as police donned riot gear, and two police vehicles were pelted with stones and jumped on, Reuters news agency reported.\nProtesters wrote with chalk on pavements and lit candles, but police later ordered the protesters to disperse, with footage showing tear gas and stun grenades being fired by officers.\nAbout 20 businesses in a nearby shopping centre were later broken into, the StarTribune reported, with sporadic looting spreading to other areas of Minneapolis.\nBrooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott announced on Twitter he was issuing a curfew until 06:00.\nIn an early-morning video post on the death of Daunte Wright, Mayor Elliott said \"our hearts are with his family\" and pledged \"we are going to make sure that everything is done in our power to ensure justice\".\nHe urged people protesting to do so peacefully.\nMembers of the Minnesota National Guard, already deployed for the murder trial of Derek Chauvin over the death of George Floyd, were sent to Brooklyn Center.\nSome remained on the streets after the curfew ended, but by that time the crowds had mainly dispersed.\nBrooklyn Center has closed all school buildings, programmes and activities for Monday, local media report.\nThe BBC's Samantha Granville at the scene in Brooklyn Center\nPolice officers stood shoulder-to-shoulder, creating a human barricade outside the Brooklyn Center Police Department.\nThey stood with helmets, shields and other riot gear, adamant about keeping the building safe.\nHundreds of protesters tried to inch forward, chanting: \"If we don't get no justice, they don't get no peace.\"\nSome kneeled in front of the police with their hands on their heads. Others stood silently with signs that listed names of African Americans who had been killed by the police. \nAmong the crowd were some of Daunte Wright's friends and relatives. Throughout the standoff, the police would fire off smoke and flash bombs if they thought protesters were getting too close, or if the crowd seemed it was getting too big and unmanageable.\nIt was an all-too-familiar scene for communities still reeling from the riots during the summer of 2020 in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd.\nAs the verdict in the trial over his death looms, Sunday's events show just how much those communities are on edge.\nIn a statement, the Brooklyn Center Police Department said officers had pulled a man over for a traffic violation on Sunday afternoon and determined that he had an outstanding arrest warrant.\nThey said that when police tried to arrest him, he re-entered the vehicle.\nAn officer then shot the driver, who drove on for several blocks before he crashed into another vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\nA female passenger in the vehicle suffered non-life-threatening injuries.\nPolice said the officers involved were wearing body cameras, and dash cameras had also been activated.\nMr Wright's mother, Katie, said her son had called her during the traffic stop and he said he had been pulled over because of \"air fresheners hanging from his rear-view mirror\". She said she then heard scuffling and the phone line was cut.\n\"A minute later, I called and his girlfriend answered, who was the passenger in the car, and said that he'd been shot... and my son was laying there lifeless.\"\nShe said her son's body had been left on the ground by officers, adding: \"Nobody will tell us anything. Nobody will talk to us... I said please take my son off the ground.\"\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz said he was \"closely monitoring the situation\" and praying for Mr Wright's family.\n\"Our state mourns another life of a black man taken by law enforcement,\" he said.\nThe murder trial of Derek Chauvin over the death of George Floyd has been under way in the city for two weeks now.\nMr Chauvin was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest operation in Minneapolis last May.\nThe footage of the incident sparked global protests against racism.\nThe trial is expected to last at least one month and law enforcement officials have already been bracing for possible unrest once the jury reaches a verdict.\nGeorge Floyd's death sparked waves of protests around the city, many peaceful but some violent with hundreds of buildings damaged."

Footage of Mr Chauvin, a white man, kneeling on the neck of Mr Floyd, a black man, sparked global protests against racism and policing in the US.\nPhilonise Floyd took to the stand as a \"spark of life\" witness, a circumstance by which the prosecution in a Minnesota trial can humanise the victim for the jury.\nMr Floyd, 39, remembered his brother as \"a big mama's boy\" and \"a leader to us in the household\" as the court was shown old photos from their childhood.\nHe mused about their competitiveness as siblings: \"Me and George played video games all the time. I finally beat him in a game and I was just so happy thinking about that.\"\nThrough tears, the younger Floyd recounted how his brother had cried at their mother's funeral and \"didn't want to leave the casket\" because \"he loved her so dearly\".\n\"I miss both of them,\" he said.\nTwo expert witnesses testified on behalf of the prosecution about their independent reviews of the Floyd arrest.\nDr Jonathan Rich, a Chicago-based cardiologist, told the court that, in his professional opinion, George Floyd did not die of a heart attack or drug overdose.\nHe noted his review of Mr Floyd's medical records since 2018 indicated problems with hypertension, high blood pressure and struggles with drug addiction, but turned up no evidence of a previous or oncoming heart attack. He added the deceased had \"an exceptionally strong heart\".\nHe said the footage made it clear that Mr Floyd died \"gradually and slowly\" because he was restrained \"in a life-threatening manner\" and then lay on the ground \"pulseless without any CPR\" for too long.\nUse of force expert Seth Stoughton, a law school professor with prior law enforcement training, said the force used by Mr Chauvin and the other officers apprehending Mr Floyd was \"unreasonable, excessive and contrary to generally accepted police practice\".\n\"The sanctity of human life is the highest priority in policing,\" said Mr Stoughton.\nHe added that \"the duty to assist and render aid\" whenever possible was the second priority, observing that officers failed to do so.\nThe defence suggested an op-ed written by Mr Stoughton a few days after the incident suggested he had already made up his mind long before he testified on Monday.\nThe witness retorted: \"I think it's fair to say that I formed the opinion that putting your knee across someone's neck - except in unbelievably rare circumstances - is generally an inappropriate use of force.\""

Witnesses said some threw fireworks and bottles at officers who responded with tear gas and stun grenades.\nTensions in nearby Minneapolis are high as the trial of an ex-officer accused of killing George Floyd continues.\nDaunte Wright was pulled over on Sunday for a traffic violation, but there was a struggle when he tried to get back into his car.\nAt a news conference on Monday, Chief Gannon played a short video from the body camera worn by a policewoman, which shows Mr Wright trying to get back into his car as officers attempt to handcuff him on the side of the road.\nAn officer can then be heard saying \"Taser, Taser, Taser\" - normal police procedure before firing one of the stun guns. Mr Wright is seen to get into his car and drive away, while the same officer says: \"Holy shit, I just shot him\".\nFatally wounded, Mr Wright crashed a few streets away.\n\"It is my belief the officer meant to deploy their Taser but shot him with a single bullet,\" Chief Gannon said, adding: \"There's nothing I can say to lessen the pain.\"\nThe officer has been placed on administrative leave - meaning she is paid while investigations take place.\nAt the same news conference, Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said he would do everything in his power to \"ensure justice is done for Daunte Wright\".\n\"Our hearts are aching right now, we are in pain right now. We recognise this couldn't have happened at a worse time. This is happening at a time that all of our community, all of America, indeed all of the world is watching,\" he said.\nAngry protests erupted in Brooklyn Center on Sunday night as news of Mr Wright's death spread.\nHundreds of protesters chanting his name gathered late outside the police headquarters.\nAbout 20 businesses in a nearby shopping centre were later broken into, the StarTribune reported, with sporadic looting spreading to parts of Minneapolis.\nIt prompted authorities to enforce an overnight curfew on Sunday night, and on Monday, the mayors of Minneapolis and neighbouring St Paul declared a local state of emergency. Another curfew is in place from 19:00 to 06:00 local time across the two cities. \nAs darkness fell on Monday, riot police ordered protesters to disperse but the crowd remained, CBS reported. Police then began deploying gas canisters and stun grenades, reporters at the scene said.\nMembers of the Minnesota National Guard, already deployed for the trial on murder charges of Derek Chauvin, have also been sent to Brooklyn Center.\nNational ice hockey, basketball and baseball games that were due to take place on Monday night were postponed.\nBarbara Plett-Usher, BBC News\nOne sign at the protest captured the mood: \"During the trial!!?\" it read in bright orange letters. \n\"It's ridiculous,\" said the young man carrying it. \"They know they have a delicate relationship with the black community right now and they should look to be making amends, not this.\" \nCity officials had said the shooting could not have happened at a worse time, with tensions high over the George Floyd case. \nSome protesters threw bottles and shot fireworks toward police lines. They vented their rage as officers in riot gear stood impassively. \"You took his life, for what?\" screamed a young woman. \n\"He was a son, he was a father, he was a black man that deserved to live.\" \"Do you know the difference between a gun and a taser?\" shouted someone else. \"Hell yeah,\" roared the crowd, scorning the police chief's belief that the shooting was a tragic mistake. \n\"There's no room for accidents,\" said one man. \"The fact is that we lost another young black male to a police officer.' \nMr Wright's mother, Katie, said her heart had been \"broken in a thousand pieces... I miss him so much\".\n\"He was my life, he was my son and I can never get that back,\" she said on Monday. \"Because of a mistake? Because of an accident?\"\nEarlier, she told how her son had called her during the traffic stop. He said he had been pulled over because of \"air fresheners hanging from his rear-view mirror\". She said she then heard scuffling and the phone line was cut.\n\"A minute later, I called and his girlfriend answered, who was the passenger in the car, and said that he'd been shot... and my son was laying there lifeless.\"\nThe trial of Derek Chauvin over the death of George Floyd has been under way in the city for two weeks now.\nMr Chauvin was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest operation in Minneapolis last May.\nThe footage of the incident sparked global protests against racism.\nThe trial is now into its third week and law enforcement officials have been bracing for possible unrest once the jury reaches a verdict.\nGeorge Floyd's death sparked waves of protests around the city, many peaceful but some violent with hundreds of buildings damaged."

      "text": "Shoppers rushed back to the High Street on Monday as non-essential retailers in England and Wales reopened after more than three months. \nAs of 5pm, High Street footfall had nearly doubled from a week earlier, as queues formed outside branches of Primark, JD Sports and TK Maxx and retailers extended their opening hours.\nBeauty salons, barbers and pub gardens also reported a surge in bookings. \nBut it is unclear if the demand will last as shops try to recoup lost sales. \nShoppers began queuing at 7am at Primark shops in London's Oxford Street and Birmingham as the fashion retailer reopened 161 stores across the country. \nLike others it is extending its open hours from 7am to 10pm to help prevent crowding in stores. \nPrimark boss Paul Marchant said: \"We have been working really hard to get our stores ready to open safely; we are fully stocked with everything our customers have been waiting for.\n\"We ask our customers to continue supporting us and be mindful of our in-store measures, in particular if queuing outside and in-store.\"\nThere were also queues outside Selfridges in London and Birmingham, TK Maxx in Cardiff and JD Sports in Newcastle. \nAmanda Philips, retail manager of the Moor shopping area in Sheffield, said it had been so busy it was like \"an old fashioned Saturday in 2019\".\n\"The sun is shining which always brings people out. We've been desperate to get outside and get a bit of retail therapy. The kids are still off school, it's half term,\" she told the BBC.\nHospitality venues, including restaurants, museums, theme parks and zoos, have also been welcoming people back, as well as gyms, swimming pools and spas. \nAt pubs such as the Oak Inn, in Coventry, drinkers queued up outside before midnight on Sunday to buy their first pints when outdoor service resumed.  \nBlink Brow Bar, a beauty salon chain with 21 outlets, said it had seen lots of \"pent-up demand\" ahead of Monday. \n\"We've had 1,000 clients on our waiting list from February. As soon as the appointments were up, we became fully-booked very quickly for the next few weeks,\" boss Vanita Parti told the BBC.\n\"That's a really exciting sign that people are so ready to step out of the house and indulge in a little self-care.\"\nJulian Metcalf, chief executive of sushi chain Itsu, said he was hopeful demand would pick up as people returned to the High Street but said he felt \"a bit nervous\". \n\"It's scary,\" he told the BBC. \"But there's a lot to be grateful for; the vaccination programme in our country is little short of remarkable, so there's no reason that we can't come back with real strength and positivity.\"\nJohn Edgar, the boss of department store chain Fenwicks, warned cold weather in some parts of England and Wales could affect demand on Monday. He also said some shoppers would remain wary of heading back to the High Street for health reasons. \n\"It remains to be seen how many people choose to stay away in the short-term because of nervousness, but we believe that most retailers are offering a very safe environment to go shopping,\" he told the BBC. \nThe British Retail Consortium says businesses have spent hundreds of millions of pounds to make shops Covid-secure. Some, including John Lewis, will have \"customer service hosts\" to manage customer numbers, while Ikea has planned a staggered entry system and more frequent cleaning routines.\nAccording to the latest figures from analyst Springboard, by 5pm footfall across all UK shopping destinations was up 146% from a week ago, and 481% higher compared with last year.  \nHowever, footfall was still 16.2% lower than the level seen on the comparable day in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic.\nDr Gordon Fletcher, retail expert from the University of Salford, said: \"When the shoppers return to the High Street there will invariably be a surge of foot traffic as the built up tensions of lockdown need to vented. \n\"The biggest risk for the old and new independent High Street retailers is that any surge will only be temporary as many shoppers quickly return to their increasingly refined ecommerce habits built up over the past 12 months.\" "

      "text": "Shoppers have been eagerly queuing in Wales' high streets as the next phase of easing the coronavirus lockdown begins.\nCovid rules have been relaxed to allow non-essential retail and close-contact services to resume and travel to other parts of the UK.\nSchool pupils and post-16 students are returning to classes and university students will see a mix of face-to-face and online lessons.\nDriving lessons are also resuming.\nQueues formed outside fashion stores TK Maxx and Primark in Cardiff city centre and elsewhere, from 07:00 BST.\nRetail consultants Springboard said that while thousands hit high streets across Wales, footfall was 16% lower than on the same date in 2019, before the pandemic hit.\nCovid case rates have fallen substantially in Wales since January and now stand at 17.6 per 100,000 people.\nAnd 49% of the population has been vaccinated with a first jab, according to data published by Public Health Wales on Sunday.\n\"We haven't been able to do any shopping for the kids since actually December,\" said one man, queuing outside St David's shopping centre in Cardiff.\nAnother said it was \"good to see everyone out supporting the local shops\".\n\"We got some things to take back from Christmas,\" she added.\nA third said she was \"absolutely thrilled\" that all shops could reopen and she was looking for \"bargains\".\n\"It's getting back to normality and, hopefully, people getting back to what they used to do,\" she said.\nJames Waugh, director at St David's, said: \"We're following government guidelines, we hope people are going to be kind, maintain social distancing, we've got capacity management, so there may be occasions where we have to ask people to queue outside, but we're expecting steady progress and people to come back.\"\nWith the lockdown easing for many businesses for the first time since December, shoppers have been asked to stay safe and respect staff, after a rise in reports of abuse.\nHannah Burson, who owns a shop in Hay-on-Wye, Powys, said the past year had been \"awful\", having to close and reopen the business and furlough most of her 10 staff.\n\"We did have a busy summer, which was great but it was short-lived,\" she said.\nShe branched out into online sales, but added \"it isn't exactly keeping the business going\".\n\"It's kept people noticing us and remembering that we're here and that we will be reopening. But in terms of sales, nothing like when we're open. \nWith bills mounting and a government loan to repay, she is hoping to capitalise on tourism from England.\n\"I really hope we'll have a mad rush, it'll be great. We really need to sell some stock so we're hoping it will be busy yet safe,\" she said.\nMany retailers with bricks and mortar stores have been in crisis since before the pandemic.\nIncreased online shopping, high costs of rent and rates and rising wage bills have put pressure on those companies that have a heavy presence on high streets.\nCovid-19 has added to their woes with stores being closed for months at a time often during traditionally peak trading periods.\nSome of the biggest names in the industry have faced serious challenges, including John Lewis, Topshop, House of Fraser and Peacocks.\nDebenhams is reopening - but only for a closing down sale, bringing an end to more than 200 years of trading on the high street. The brand will continue online.\nThe latest British Retail Consortium figures show Wales had the sharpest decline in footfall of any UK nation or region compared with 2019.\nBefore the pandemic, 23,000 jobs were lost in Welsh retail and wholesale between 2009 and 2019.\nThe restrictions put in place due to Covid have magnified the challenges ahead for an industry that was already facing significant transformation.\nAneeka Hearn, sales manager at a jewellers in Swansea, said: \"People are getting married still, engaged, people are still having birthdays and special occasions and a lot of people haven't been able to go on their cruises and holidays, so they want to spend their money on something nice to treat themselves and have something to look forward to.\"\nThere is some concern there could be a reluctance in shoppers to return to Wales' high streets, after a year of buying things online.\nIn the Vale of Glamorgan, the Shop Local Penarth campaign is encouraging residents to support their local traders, who have faced tough times.\nA new virtual marketplace for the town's independent shops and businesses has been launched to give shoppers the opportunity to buy from their favourite local traders online in one place.\nChair of the Penarth Business Group, Angelina Hall, said: \"The increase of online shopping has accelerated, and our high streets need to understand that a new blended way of shopping is now being demanded.\"\nAnna Knight, who owns a lifestyle and homeware shop in Cardiff, said that after a \"really difficult three months\" she was confident that shoppers would come back.\n\"Our shop has always been about the experience... you want to browse around,\" she said.\nSarah Bruton, who runs Captiva Spa and Lounge in Caerphilly, said it was an \"emotional day\" being able to see clients for beauty treatments for the first time in months.\n\"Every stage has been a battle in terms of the local lockdown, we couldn't bring our clients from outside the local area - that had a huge impact, and campaigning for funding for the beauty industry, which hasn't always been in place,\" she said.\n\"So it's really just being here today is such a huge relief.\"\nNicole Gooding, salon manager at Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty, Cardiff, said changes had been made to adhere to Covid rules and \"make sure everyone is as safe as possible\".\n\"I'm just so excited to catch up with everyone... just to see all our lovely clients' faces again,\" she said.\nNick Ireland, divisional officer of shop workers' union Usdaw, said those who have been furloughed are looking forward to being back at work and \"to get a sense of normality and certainty in their lives\".\nBut he reminded customers: \"We're still in a pandemic. It's about shopping safely, keep that 2m distance, wear a face covering, make sure you wash your hands, pay with a card if you can.\n\"Be polite to shop workers. You're in somebody's workplace, treat them as you would expect to be treated in your own workplace and be patient.\"\nWith people allowed to travel over the border into England, many will be able to see friends of family outside after months of being unable to see them.\nCarl Cowlinshaw, who runs a narrowboat hire company which has about 120 boats in England and Wales, said it had been a \"very busy day\".\nMr Cowlinshaw said many people wanted to travel to enjoy \"some of the Welsh wonders\" from the Llangollen canal, but people were still being cautious.\n\"They'll be zipping all over the place from today,\" he said.\nMonday sees a full return to schools and further education and university campuses will be able to provided blended face-to-face and online learning for students, according to Welsh government Covid regulations.\nHuw Powell, headteacher of Mary Immaculate High School in Cardiff, said the plan was to \"maintain some kind of normality\".\n\"Schools are about keeping pupils safe,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"Education is at the heart of what we do, and that has got to continue, and that social opportunities come under that umbrella of mental health - this is something that we have focused on quite strongly.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives have previously accused the Welsh government of a U-turn over the reopening of non-essential shops.\nTheir leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said a decision to allow shops to open on the same day as England could have been made earlier.\nHe said this had caused \"frustration in the sectors worst hit by the pandemic and will put more Welsh jobs at risk\".\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price has described a \"lack of a level playing field for small non-essential retail\" during the pandemic.\nHe accused the Welsh government of \"badly failing Welsh business and the workers and communities that depend on them\".\nJane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, had accused the Welsh government of \"throwing many small shops and high streets under a bus\".\n\"The Welsh Labour government has treated the High Street with complete contempt,\" she said.\nThe Welsh government defended its plan for reopening retail, saying: \"We recognise everyone wants certainty to be able to plan for the future and that businesses want to be open and trading. That's why the first minister has set out a plan to bring Wales out of alert level four lockdown.\n\"We cannot move directly and fully into alert level three in one step,\" a spokesperson said."

      "tags": "Hinduism,Asia,India coronavirus lockdown,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Several million Hindus have gathered to take a dip in the Ganges river as a deadly second Covid-19 wave continues to sweep India.\nThe devotees are marking an auspicious bathing day on Monday at the Kumbh Mela religious festival in Haridwar city in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand.\nOfficials say they are struggling to impose safety norms due to huge crowds.\nHindus believe the river is holy and bathing in it will cleanse them of their sins and bring salvation.\nThe Kumbh Mela takes place every 12 years and the venue is chosen from amongst four cities, including Allahabad (also called Prayagraj), Haridwar, Nasik and Ujjain.\nHaridwar's turn to host the gathering came amid a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus infections, with India consistently reporting more than 100,000 cases daily in the past few weeks. \nOn Monday, India logged more than 168,000 new cases, overtaking Brazil to become the country with the second-highest number of cases globally. \nWith the total case tally of more than 13.5 million cases, India is now only behind the United States which has reported more than 31 million cases. With 13.4 million cases, Brazil is now at number three.\nHealth experts had appealed for the Kumbh Mela festival to be cancelled, but the government went ahead saying safety rules would be followed.\nA senior police official told ANI news agency that it was very difficult to ensure social distancing on the river banks.\n\"We are continuously appealing to people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. But due to the huge crowd, it is practically not possible to issue challans [fines],\" inspector general of police Sanjay Gunjyal said. \nHe said that a \"stampede-like situation\" could arise if the police tried to enforce social distancing on the river banks.\nOfficials said by Monday evening more than 3.1 million devotees had bathed in the river, with many more expected to follow suit. Monday - Somvati Amavasya - marks the biggest bathing day during the two-month-long festival.\nThe government had earlier said that only people with Covid negative reports would be allowed at the festival and strict measures like social distancing would be followed.\nBut a number of people, including top saints, have already tested positive. \nThis has given rise to fears that Monday's bathing day will help the infection spread faster among the devotees and that some of them could also take the virus back to their cities and villages in other parts of the country.\nThe second wave is wreaking havoc across India. Reports of a shortage of hospital beds and life-saving drugs have started coming in from different parts of the country.\nThe state of Maharashtra is particularly affected - accounting for an average of almost 30-40% of daily cases. Measures like night curfews and limited lockdowns have been taken but the green light given to the Kumbh Mela festival has baffled experts.\nSome of them say that the worst is yet to come unless strict, urgent measures are taken, and that includes ramping up vaccinations. \nIndia has given more than 100 million doses so far but the pace needs to further pick up to halt the spread of the virus, experts say.

The government had previously offered \u20ac7bn ($8.3bn, \u00a36bn) in loans to help the airline weather the pandemic, although France's economy minister said at the time the funding was dependent on the airline scrapping some of its domestic flights.\nThis is not the first time similar measures have been introduced.\nLast year, Austrian Airlines replaced a flight route between the capital Vienna and the city of Salzburg with an increased train service, after receiving a government bailout with provisions to cut its carbon footprint."

      "text": "For the first time in months, pub gardens, shops and hairdressers have reopened in England, as rules were also eased in the rest of the UK.\nShoppers flocked to the High Street, with long queues seen outside some retailers. Other people took advantage of England's gyms and zoos reopening.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to \"behave responsibly\".\nNorthern Ireland's \"stay-at-home\" order is ending and some rules are being eased in Scotland and Wales.\nThe PM had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that has been postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday.\nSnow showers and chilly temperatures in parts of southern England appeared to do little to dampen enthusiasm for outdoor pints.\nScott Westlake, landlord of the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, said the pub had received 5,000 bookings over the next month for his new outside eating and drinking area.\nMr Westlake said: \"If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited.\n\"Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything - and they'll sit in a blizzard for the first few days at least.\"\nNicholas Hair, landlord and owner of the Kentish Belle pub in Bexleyheath, south-east London, said there was a \"sense of celebration\" in the early hours of Monday as it opened to midnight customers. \n\"I'm hoping that this is a sort of rebirth, and that we are reopen for the foreseeable,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, a town in Lincolnshire has introduced its own European-style pavement cafes to help boost trade.\nSeveral hospitality venues in the market town of Louth have been allowed to put seating and tables outside to serve people during the day.\nLewis Phillips, general manager of the Masons Arms, which is one of the venues involved in the Louth scheme, said: \"We don't have a lovely big beer garden. So what we've got out the front here is absolutely brilliant.\"\nThe prime minister had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that was postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. \nHowever, Downing Street confirmed that Mr Johnson did have a haircut before he paid tribute to the duke in the House of Commons.\nMarika Smith, general manager of Hough End Leisure Centre, Withington, Manchester, said all of their swimming times were already fully booked on Monday.\nKelly Boad, owner of the Hair & Beauty Gallery in Warwick, opened her salon at midnight for a symbolic \"first cut\" of 2021, adding she is fully booked for the first few weeks.\nShoppers rushed back to the High Street, as queues formed outside branches of Primark, JD Sports and TK Maxx and retailers extended their opening hours.\nAnother business that reopened in England was Secret Spa, which offers at-home salon and spa treatments in London, Manchester and Brighton.\nCo-owner Emily Ewart-Perks said it had \"been such a long time coming\", saying: \"Everyone has really missed the social contact of the day-to-day job and making clients happy.\"\nThe rule changes in England from Monday include:\nBut the British Beer and Pub Association has estimated that only 40% of licensed premises have the space to reopen for outdoor service.\nIn Northern Ireland, the remaining school year groups 8-11 returned to the classroom. The stay-at-home message has been lifted and up to 10 people from two households can meet in a private garden.\nIn Scotland, pupils at schools in six council areas went back to school but not everyone returned on Monday because differing term times mean some schools are still closed for the Easter holidays.\nAfter a drop in Covid cases prompted the Welsh Government to bring forward some dates for reopening, all students returned to face-to-face teaching on Monday. \nNon-essential shops can also reopen, close-contact services can resume, driving lessons can restart and travel in and out of Wales from the rest of the UK is allowed.\nShoppers, gym fans, domestic holiday makers, outdoor drinkers and diners, plus those in need of a haircut will share the government's hope that Monday is an irreversible step towards old and cherished freedoms. \nSo will the business owners who will be welcoming them back. \nBut this significant easing of lockdown is also an important test. \nWill customers want or be able to return in sufficient numbers for firms to break even and if they don't, what will it take to make the economy work again? \nOnly two in five hospitality venues have any outdoor space and the rules over future inside opening are still unclear. \nThe government and the opposition have distanced themselves from requiring Covid certificates for day-to-day life but the government has also hinted individual businesses may require them if they wish.\nHospitality chiefs have told the BBC they fear having to choose between two different ways to lose money - half-empty venues without certificates or full ones with extra staff and hassle to check Covid status. \nDemand may vary by sector. \nHairdressers are booked solid, retailers are hopeful of high footfall and are welcoming longer opening hours but some holiday parks are reporting subdued bookings as many of their public amenities remain closed. \nIt is a test for everyone - but a welcome one for most. \nIn a statement, the prime minister said the rule relaxations are \"a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom\".\n\"I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed,\" he added.\n\"I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme.\"\nThe rule changes in England marks the third easing since the country's third national lockdown began on 6 January.\nThere is a gap of at least five weeks between each step on the government's \"roadmap\" out of lockdown, to allow the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed.\nThe next significant date is 17 May, when up to six people from different households could be allowed to socialise indoors. \nMore than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine and of those 7.6m have had their second dose, according to the latest government data.\nMeanwhile, 189,665 second doses were administered on Sunday - along with 69,223 first doses.\nSaturday marked a record total for second doses, with 475,230 given, while 111,109 were first doses.\nA further 13 people are reported to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there have been 3,568 new infections.\nThere can be a lag in reporting coronavirus statistics during weekends.\nMeanwhile, surge coronavirus testing is being rolled out in areas of Wandsworth and Lambeth in south London, where cases of the South Africa variant were found. \nAll identified cases are self-isolating or have completed their isolation, and their contacts have been traced and asked to self-isolate."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,Ecuador",
      "text": "A conservative former banker, Guillermo Lasso, has won Ecuador's presidential election following a run-off vote.\nHis opponent, the left-wing economist Andr\u00e9s Arauz, conceded defeat hours after polls closed on Sunday.\nWith almost all the ballots counted, Mr Lasso had won 52.4% of the vote compared to Mr Arauz's 47.6%.\nMr Lasso, a 65-year-old three-time presidential candidate, told supporters he accepted the \"challenge of changing our country's destiny\".\n\"It's a day on which all Ecuadoreans have decided their future,\" he said. \"They have used their vote to express the need for change and the desire for better days.\"\nMr Lasso's rival, Andr\u00e9s Arauz, congratulated the winner: \"I will show him our democratic convictions,\" he said at a rally. \nThe 36-year-old had won the first round on 7 February by a 10-percentage-point margin and until recently had been the favourite to become president. But polls suggested Mr Lasso started to catch up with him late on in the campaign.\nMr Arauz called the result \"an electoral stumble, but not a political or moral defeat\". He said it was now time to \"move on, build bridges and create consensus\".\nMr Arauz's mentor, ex-President Rafael Correa, wished Mr Lasso \"lots of luck\". Mr Correa, who defeated Mr Lasso in the 2013 election, could not run for office this time after he was sentenced in absentia last year for corruption.\nMr Lasso, who finished second in the 2013 and 2017 presidential elections, will assume office on 24 May.\nThe former banker has vowed to break away from the leftist policies of past administrations that he says have dragged Ecuador down.\n\"Ecuadoreans used their right to vote to choose a new course, very different to that of the past 14 years,\" he said. \n\"On 24 May, we will face the challenge of changing our homeland's destiny with responsibility to achieve an Ecuador which offers the opportunities and prosperity we all crave.\" \nMr Lasso has pledged to attract increased foreign investment, create two million new jobs and increase oil production.\nHe has also proposed to raise the minimum monthly wage as well as introduce tax cuts for small businesses and to create a fund to stimulate entrepreneurship.\nWhile Mr Lasso is seen as representing the country's business sector, in his victory speech he tried to appeal to wider sectors of society and said he wanted his administration to listen to \"all Ecuadoreans\".\nHe said he would \"work non-stop\" to defend the rights of women, including single mothers and pregnant teenagers, and that he would aim to end discrimination against LGBT people. \n\"Let's build a fairer and more prosperous country for all,\" he said. \nMr Lasso will be taking over the presidency from Len\u00edn Moreno, who saw his popularity drop from 77% shortly after he was elected in 2017 to 7% in February 2020.\nThe new president will have to deal with the twin challenges of tackling Ecuador's economic and health crises. \nAccording to Ecuador's central bank, the economy shrunk by 7.8% in 2020, and data from the National Statistics and Census Institute (INEC) showed that some half a million people remained unemployed as of January 2021. \nIn addition to the economic turmoil, corruption accusations inside the health ministry led to an almost two-month delay in designing a national Covid-19 vaccination plan.\nThe country is on its sixth health minister in four years after the fifth one was sacked last week. \nMauro Falconi was dismissed after delays in vaccine distribution saw elderly people queuing for hours despite having been given appointments. \nMr Lasso has vowed to vaccinate nine million Ecuadoreans in the first 100 days of his administration, and promised to lead \"better\" direct negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies producing the jabs.\nThe new president will also have to woo voters who are disillusioned with Ecuadorean politics. Voting is compulsory in Ecuador, but 16.3% spoiled their ballot while another 1.6% left them blank.\nOne of those who spoiled their ballot was indigenous leader Yaku P\u00e9rez, who had narrowly lost out on a place in the run-off election.\nMr P\u00e9rez had refused to back either Mr Lasso or Mr Arauz in the second round. \nMr P\u00e9rez's Pachakutik indigenous movement and the UNES coalition, led by former President Rafael Correa who backed Mr Arauz, are expected to act as a powerful counterweight in the National Assembly to Mr Lasso's executive.

      "text": "Shared grief over the death of the Duke of Edinburgh is an \"ideal opportunity\" to mend any rifts within the Royal Family, ex-PM Sir John Major has said.\nSir John, who was guardian to Princes William and Harry following their mother's death, said he hoped it would end any \"friction\" between the pair.\nHe also said the Queen needed time to grieve for her husband.\nHis comments came as the Archbishop of Canterbury paid tribute to the duke in a remembrance service.\nThe Queen has described the death of her husband as \"having left a huge void in her life\", the Duke of York has said.\nDuring a service at Canterbury Cathedral earlier, which was also streamed online, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said that \"for the Royal Family, as for every other, no words can reach into the depth of sorrow that goes into bereavement\".\nThe archbishop is also expected to lead the duke's funeral on Saturday, which Princes William and Harry are both due to attend.\nThe Duke of Sussex will fly from the US for the service, though it is not clear when.\nHis wife the Duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant, will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors.\nMembers of the Royal Family will walk behind the coffin ahead of the funeral at Windsor Castle.\nCardinal Vincent Nichols, the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, has suggested that coming together for Philip's funeral could help to heal any tensions.\nSir John, who was appointed a special guardian to the princes after their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, died in 1997, told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: \"The friction that we are told has arisen is a friction better ended as speedily as possible.\"\nHe added: \"They shared emotion. They share grief at the present time because of the death of their grandfather. I think [this] is an ideal opportunity.\n\"I hope very much that it is possible to mend any rifts that may exist.\"\nHarry and Meghan, who have stepped back from frontline royal duties, gave an interview to US broadcaster Oprah Winfrey last month.\nIn it, Harry said of his older brother: \"The relationship is 'space' at the moment. And time heals all things, hopefully.\"\nSir John also told Andrew Marr the Duke of Edinburgh would \"still be there in [the Queen's] memory\" and that she would \"hear his voice\".\nBeing head of state was a \"lonely position in many ways\" for the Queen, and the duke was \"the person to whom she could unburden herself\", he added.\nA period of national mourning will end after 17 April, when Prince Philip's funeral takes place at Windsor Castle's St George's Chapel.\nA national minute's silence will be held to coincide with the start of the service at 15:00 BST.\nPrince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday, aged 99.\nIn an interview at a service in Windsor, Prince Andrew said he loved his father, who was \"always somebody you could go to\" - and that his death was a \"terrible loss\".\nHe added: \"We've lost the grandfather of the nation.\"\nMembers of the public have continued laying flowers outside the castle, although the new government guidance asks the public to refrain from doing so and give to charity instead.\nA spokesman for Windsor Great Park said on Saturday that tributes would be removed \"respectfully\" and displayed within the castle grounds.\nRoyal household staff were photographed on Sunday placing bouquets on the ground outside St George's Chapel.\nJoanna Lumley was among those to pay their respects to Prince Philip on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

I see shops reopening and close contact services reopening in tiny shops... it's frustrating. \n\"I've been closed [for] four months now. It's annoying that Welsh government are making changes all the time.\"\nMichaela Breeze, a Commonwealth Games weightlifting champion who owns her own gym in Swansea, said the news was \"fantastic\" but she was \"pulling my hair out in despair\" because she had already spent money planning to open on the previous date.\n\"That decision has cost me several thousands of pounds,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We are trying to run businesses here - it requires time, it requires practice and it requires planning to notify members.\"\nDylan Allsopp, a personal trainer in Treforest, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said: \"It's great we have been given the opportunity to open early, but realistically we are still back of the queue with no data to back it up.\n\"When you look at the data and you see gyms contribute to two cases in 100,000 visits, you wonder why you aren't being allowed to open.\"\nAlthough she admitted to not being an avid user of gyms, molecular epidemiologist Dr Helen Wimalarathna said there was a risk to reopening them, but this needed to be balanced against the benefit to people's health.\n\"It's a question of ventilation and how much people exhale in a gym environment,\" she said.\n\"Getting hot and sweaty and breathing out over the equipment, then there's a high degree of sanitisation that needs to take place afterwards before it is safe for someone else to use that space.\n\"But obviously exercise is really important for people, physically and mentally, and we know that physical health and underlying factors like obesity have really contributed to the worst of this pandemic, so it is good to give people the opportunity to keep in shape.\"\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmed that lockdown changes which had been planned for 12 April would go ahead. \nThis means, from Monday, all remaining children will return to school for face-to-face learning, non-essential shops will reopen, and close-contact services, such as beauticians, will be allowed to reopen. \nNon-essential retailers have been closed since Wales went into lockdown on 20 December. \nTravel across the border between Wales and England will also be permitted from Monday. \nWales' \"stay local\" rule was removed on 27 March, allowing people to travel anywhere within its borders, but the changes will allow travel across the whole of the UK. \nThe decision follows a rapid drop in the number of new coronavirus cases in Wales. \nDates for the reopening of the hospitality industry in Wales have not changed, despite the other alterations to lockdown easing dates. \nPubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to open outdoors from 26 April and indoor service could be allowed from the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. \nPubs in England can reopen outdoors from Monday. \nWales' case rate, which measures the number of infections per 100,000 people over a seven-day period, stands at 21, compared to 37 last week.\nConfirmed cases in hospital beds are 26% lower than last Thursday, the lowest number since 22 September.\nMr Drakeford said: \"Last week, we set out our programme to further reopen the economy and relax the restrictions we have lived with for so long, as part of our careful, step-by-step approach to keeping everyone safe. \n\"This week, because of the improvements we continue to see, we can bring forward some of our plans. This is only possible because of the efforts everyone is making to protect themselves and their loved ones.\"\nAny of the changes proposed after 6 May could depend on the outcome of the Senedd elections and which party is in power.\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: \"Plaid Cymru has been pressing the case for gyms to reopen as quickly and as safely as is possible because they are crucial for people's mental health and well-being. This new date, whilst welcome, is still not early enough. \n\"The scenes of unregulated drinking over recent days has been a serious cause of concern and many will question the Labour government's decision not to move the reopening of outdoor hospitality forward. A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option.\"\nAndrew RT Davies, the Senedd leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: \"The great British vaccination programme protects more and more lives every day and gives us the ability to restore freedoms in a safe but accelerated manner.\n\"Pressure from the public and Welsh Conservatives have forced Labour ministers to act, but there is still more they can do in accelerating the roadmap with the safe resumption of activities such as outdoor hospitality and gyms.\"\nJane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: \"This is welcome news. Gyms and fitness centres play an important part in both the physical and mental health of so many people across Wales. Everyone who has abided by the rules has played a part in bringing this announcement forward.\n\"The public must remember however that the virus has not gone away and they need to stick to the rules including with regard to social distancing.\""

similar to what has been set out in Scotland.\nAnd dear to many people's hearts, the whole issue of close-contact services - hairdressers, beauty salons, when they might get the nod for reopening -  I wouldn't be surprised if that happened before 26 April, given that it is already up and running in other parts of the UK.\nPaul Kee, director of Maiden City Soccer Academy in Londonderry, told BBC Radio Foyle the return of formalised training was \"vitally important\".\n\"The kids have suffered over this pandemic in particular, sport has suffered,\" he said. \"It has taken away their natural way to get out and exercise and play.\n\"The most important thing is the activity, the child is out there playing, keeping active and keeping fit and being social as well.\"\nHowever, many restrictions will remain in place, including: \nNew guidance for people identified as being clinically extremely vulnerable has also come into effect.\nFrom Monday anyone who has been shielding and who cannot work from home is permitted to return to their workplace provided appropriate public safety measures are in place.\nFurther updates for those shielding are expected to be announced as part of a wider lifting of restrictions.  \nThe next formal review of Northern Ireland's lockdown restrictions is due to happen on Thursday.\nThe executive will meet to consider proposals from Stormont ministers aimed at providing reopening dates for a number of sectors including retail, close-contact services such as hairdressers, tourism and hospitality. \nOn Monday, First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped the executive would be able to provide an \"indicative timeframe\" on Thursday \"because there are lots of people for business reasons, for well-being reasons, who will want that information\". \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was \"hopeful\".\n\"I wouldn't want to pre-empt the executive decision on Thursday but it's fair to say we're increasingly confident in our ability to be able to make more progress,\" she said.\n\"We have the headroom to be able to move - the vaccination programme being very strong, the ICU [intensive care unit] numbers coming down, the number of positive cases coming down, so that all leads to a very encouraging situation.\"\nOne date believed to be under consideration for reopening non-essential retail is 26 April, but it will require the support of the whole executive.\nNorthern Ireland has moved at a slower pace than other parts of the UK in easing its lockdown, which began on 26 December.\nBut ministers have said the virus has moved at a different rate and they want to ensure the lifting of restrictions is managed carefully so Northern Ireland does not have to re-enter lockdown.\nThe health and education ministers thanked the public for their \"collective effort\", but stressed the importance of continuing to follow public health advice.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann urged caution, \"so we do not undo the hard-won progress we have made\". \n\"It's vital the safety measures put in place are adhered to,\" he said.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir said the full return to school represented \"a significant milestone\", but added \"the priority must be to keep our schools safe and ensure they remain open\". \n\"Parents and guardians can play their part by wearing a mask when they are picking up or dropping off their child and not congregating around the school gates,\" he added. \nMore than one million Covid-19 vaccines have now been administered by officials running the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, according to the Department of Health.\nCurrently, anyone aged 40 or over can book their vaccine appointments at the regional centres.\nThe health minister said that \"every jab takes us further down the pathway towards a better and safer future\" and urged those eligible to book their appointment as soon as possible."

      "title": "Covid-19: 'Behave responsibly' as lockdown eases and China 'vaccine efficacy low'",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson warns people to continue to take steps to \"suppress Covid\" as the latest stage of lockdown easing comes into effect. Pub gardens, indoor gyms and hairdressers are among the businesses that can now reopen in England as part of the third stage of the government's \"roadmap\" out of this lockdown. There's a five-week gap between each step so infection rates and hospital admissions can been assessed. With that in mind, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to \"behave responsibly\" as he welcomed the \"major\" step towards normality. He had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but it has been postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. England isn't the only nation in the UK where lockdown rules are changing, Northern Ireland's remaining school year groups 8-11 will return to the classroom and some rules are also being relaxed in Scotland and Wales. \nChina's top disease control official has said the efficacy of the country's Covid vaccines is low, in a rare admission of weakness. In a press conference, Gao Fu added that China was considering mixing vaccines as a way of boosting efficacy. China has developed four different vaccines approved for public use, though some trials abroad had suggested efficacy as low as 50%. Mr Gao later said his comments had been misinterpreted. More than 100 million people in China have received at least one shot of the vaccine. Beijing insists the jabs are effective and said it will grant visas only to foreigners with a Chinese shot.\nThe G7 group of wealthy nations must lead a \"Herculean mobilisation\" to push for global mass vaccination against Covid, former PM Gordon Brown says. Writing in the Guardian, Mr Brown said \u00a322bn was needed to ensure yearly vaccinations for lower income countries until Covid no longer claims lives. The next G7 summit is due to take place in the UK in June. The UK government said millions of doses had been sent to developing countries under the Covax scheme.\n\"It's hard to explain to someone who isn't a twin,\" says Aneira. \"We call it the twin-ection.\" For 28-year-old Aneira Hayward, who lives in Gateshead, the pandemic and successive lockdowns have meant prolonged separation from her twin sister Anwen who's in Cardiff. She says many people with siblings who aren't twins \"don't understand\" how lonely it can feel. See how they and other twins have found lockdown.\nA beauty therapist is returning to her job in a salon after a year of working in a pop-up shop in a converted horsebox. Sarah Byrd set up the mobile grocery shop when coronavirus restrictions stopped her from carrying out treatments. The mother-of-two, from Derbyshire, says the shop helped bring communities together but she won't have time to continue running the store when she returns to work as a therapist. Closing the pop-up shop the 35-year-old says it's \"the end of an era\". \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWith lockdown rules easing, have a read of this to find out when you can go on holiday abroad or in the UK.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Former Neighbours actress Nicola Charles has claimed two of her cast mates once tried to get her deported back to the UK.\nCharles, who played Sarah Beaumont in the soap for two stints in the 1990s and 2010s, alleges she was targeted for \"taking a job from an Australian\".\nHer character was best known for having an affair with Dr Karl Kennedy.\nCharles made the claim in her forthcoming memoir, Soap Star, which has been previewed in The Herald Sun.\nFremantle Media, which produces the long-running Australian soap, has been contacted by the BBC for a comment. \nIn her book, Charles alleges that she found a handwritten letter sent to the immigration department shortly after her six-month probation period on Neighbours ended in 1996, just as her contract was about to be extended. \nShe does not name the two cast members in question. \n\"I did know who they were, the individuals who did it, but I thought - who goes to that length, and what have I done to be disliked that much?\" she wrote, in an excerpt published in Australia on Monday.\n\"That experience coloured my relationships with everyone on the cast and crew, because I kind of felt nervous about trusting anyone after that.\"\nShe added: \"Then my immigration lawyer told me the letter complained that a British actor had been given a full-time role on the show, thus taking a job away from an Australian.\n\"But the show employed me as a British actor. I was written into the show,\" she explained.\nCharles was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. She moved to London as a teenager and then to Australia.\nHer autobiography is published on Friday. She also had a fictional novel published last year, titled The Witches of Toorak. \nLast week, two Aboriginal-Australian TV stars alleged they witnessed racist incidents while working on the set of Neighbours.\nShareena Clanton alleged \"multiple racist traumas\" during her time on the show in an Instagram post.\nA day later, former Neighbours actor Meyne Wyatt said he too had experienced racism on set in a tweet.\nIn response to Ms Clanton's allegations, Fremantle Media said it would do more to promote inclusion.\n\"Neighbours strives to be a platform for diversity and inclusion on-screen and off-screen,\" a spokesperson for Fremantle Media told the BBC. \"Our quest is always to continue to grow and develop in this area and we acknowledge that this is an evolving process.\""

      "tags": "Germany,Angela Merkel",
      "text": "The race to replace German Chancellor Angela Merkel is heating up after both leaders of the two parties that make up her conservative alliance put themselves forwards. \nMrs Merkel, leader since 2005, is set to stand down at September's election. \nMarkus S\u00f6der, who is Bavaria's premier, said on Sunday he was prepared to be the candidate if he had the support of the conservatives elsewhere in Germany.\nHis rival is Armin Laschet who had already said he would stand.\nMr Laschet is the recently elected leader of Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and current premier of Germany's most populous state.\nMr S\u00f6der heads the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU.\nMr S\u00f6der's announcement came as the two conservative parties, who work together in federal politics, met on Sunday for talks on the issue. A decision on the CDU/CSU joint nominee is expected soon.\nSpeaking at a joint news conference, Mr Laschet, 60, said: \"Markus S\u00f6der and I had a long conversation before today. We declared our willingness to run for the chancellorship.\" \nMr S\u00f6der, 54, said they were both suited for the role and willing to take it up. \n\"What is important is that we do this with respect for each other. And I will say this: whoever is chosen in the end we will both work very well together. \n\"It is not about our individual ambitions - it is about the good of the party and above all, the good of the country,\" he said. \nMore commonly a leader of the CDU, the larger party, would be expected to become the two parties' candidate. But at present, polls suggest Mr S\u00f6der would be the more electable choice.\nA candidate from the Bavarian sister party has never won the federal election before. Two previous attempts by CSU leaders failed in 1980 and 2002. \nMrs Merkel has not publicly expressed a preference for either potential candidate.\nThe conservative alliance is facing a decline in popularity following the coronavirus pandemic, slipping to about 27% in polls. \nSo far Mr S\u00f6der has proved popular in the crisis, even though Bavaria's Covid figures are no better than those of most other German states.\nThe Social Democrats have already announced their candidate for chancellor, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, while the Green party will announce their nominee next week.

      "title": "Prince Philip: The Vanuatu tribes mourning the death of their 'god'",
      "tags": "Vanuatu,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh",
      "text": "As Britons mourn the death of Prince Philip, they are joined by a tribal community on a Pacific island half a world away.\nFor decades, two villages on the Vanuatuan island of Tanna have revered the Duke of Edinburgh as a god-like spiritual figure.\nA formal period of mourning is now under way.\nOn Monday, scores of tribespeople gathered in a ceremony to remember Prince Philip.\n\"The connection between the people on the island of Tanna and the English people is very strong... We are sending condolence messages to the Royal Family and the people of England,\" said tribal leader Chief Yapa, according to Reuters news agency. \nFor the next few weeks, villagers will periodically meet to conduct rites for the duke, who is seen as a \"recycled descendant of a very powerful spirit or god that lives on one of their mountains\", says anthropologist Kirk Huffman who has studied the tribes since the 1970s. \nThey will likely conduct ritualistic dance, hold a procession, and display memorabilia of Prince Philip, while the men will drink kava, a ceremonial drink made from the roots of the kava plant.\nThis will culminate with a \"significant gathering\" as a final act of mourning. \"There will be a great deal of wealth on display\" which would mean yams and kava plants, says Vanuatu-based journalist Dan McGarry.\n\"And also pigs, because they are a primary source of protein. I would expect numerous pigs to be killed for the ceremonial event.\"\nMonday's meeting saw a couple of hundred people gather under giant banyan trees, according to Mr McGarry who is on Tanna. \nThere were speeches remembering Prince Philip, but also discussion about a possible successor. At sunset the men drank kava.\nThe BBC understands that a private message to Queen Elizabeth has been given to journalists at the scene, who will convey it to British officials.\nFor half a century, the Prince Philip Movement thrived in the villages of Yakel and Yaohnanen - at its height, it had several thousand followers, though numbers are thought to have dwindled to a few hundred.\nThe villagers live in Tanna's jungles and continue to practise their ancestral customs. Wearing traditional dress is still common, and while they maintain strong links with society, money and modern technology such as mobile phones are seldom used within their own community.\nThough they live only several kilometres from the nearest airport, \"they just made an active choice to disavow the modern world. It's not a physical distance, it's a metaphysical distance. They're just 3,000 years away,\" says Mr McGarry, who has frequently met the villagers.\nThe villagers' centuries-old \"kastom\", or culture and way of life, sees Tanna as the origin of the world and aims to promote peace - and this is where Prince Philip has played a central role.\nOver time, the villagers have come to believe he is one of them - the fulfilment of a prophecy of a tribesman who has \"left the island, in his original spiritual form, to find a powerful wife overseas\", says Mr Huffman.\n\"Ruling the UK with the help of the Queen, he was trying to bring peace and respect for tradition to England and other parts of the world. If he was successful, then he could return to Tanna - though one thing preventing him was, as they saw it, white people's stupidity, jealousy, greed and perpetual fighting.\"\nWith his \"mission to literally plant the seed of Tanna kastom at the heart of the Commonwealth and empire\", the duke was thus seen as the living embodiment of their culture, says Mr McGarry.\n\"It's a hero's journey, a person who sets off on a quest and literally wins the princess and the kingdom.\"\nNobody is sure exactly how or why the movement began, though there are various theories. \nOne idea, according to Mr Huffman, is that villagers may have seen his picture along with the Queen's on the walls of British colonial outposts when Vanuatu was still known as New Hebrides, a colony administered jointly by Britain and France. \nAnother interpretation is that it emerged as a \"reaction to colonial presence, a way of re-appropriating and taking back colonial power by associating themselves with someone who sits at the right hand of the ruler of the Commonwealth\", says Mr McGarry, pointing to the sometimes violent colonial history of Vanuatu.\nBut experts are certain that by the 1970s, the Prince Philip Movement already existed, cemented by the royal couple's visit in 1974 to New Hebrides where the duke reportedly took part in kava-drinking rituals.\nWhat did Prince Philip make of it all? Publicly, he appeared to accept their reverence, sending several letters and photographs of himself to the tribesmen, who in turn have plied him with traditional gifts over the years.\nOne of their first presents was a ceremonial club called a nal-nal, given at a 1978 meeting convened by villagers to ask for more information about Prince Philip, which Mr Huffman attended.\n\"So the British resident commissioner went down, made a presentation of photos of Prince Philip. Hundreds of these people were just waiting around, sitting or standing under the bushes. It was so quiet, we could hear a pin drop,\" says Mr Huffman.\n\"One of the chiefs then gave a club to pass to Prince Philip, and wanted proof that he received it.\" \nIt was sent all the way to the UK, where pictures of the duke holding the club were taken and sent back to the villagers. Those photos, among other memorabilia, are still treasured by the villagers to this day.\nIn 2007, several tribesmen met the duke in person. Flown to the UK for the Channel 4 reality television series Meet the Natives, five tribal leaders had an off-screen meeting with the duke at Windsor Castle where they presented gifts and asked when he would return to Tanna. \nHis reply, as reported by the tribesmen later, was cryptic - \"when it turns warm, I will send a message\" - but appeared to please them.\nThough Prince Philip was known for his frankness and has been criticised in the past for being culturally insensitive, on Tanna \"he is seen as very supportive and sensitive\", says Mr Huffman.\nHis connection with the tribes has continued through Prince Charles, who visited Vanuatu in 2018 and drank the same kava his father did decades ago. He also received a walking stick on behalf of the duke from a Yaohnanen tribesman. \nThe duke's death has now inevitably opened up the tricky question of who will take his place in the tribes' spiritual pantheon.\nDiscussions are already under way, and it may take some time before they decide on his successor.\nBut for observers familiar with Vanuatu, where tribal custom usually dictates that the title of chief is inherited by male descendants, the answer is obvious. \"They might say, he has left it to Charles to continue his mission,\" says Mr Huffman.\nEven if Prince Charles becomes the latest incarnation of their deity, Prince Philip will not be forgotten any time soon. Mr Huffman says the movement are likely to keep its name, and one tribesman has told him they are even considering starting a political party.\nBut more importantly, \"there has always been the idea that Prince Philip would return some day, either in person or in spiritual form\", says Mr Huffman, who adds that some may think his death will finally trigger this eventuality.\nAnd so, while the Duke of Edinburgh lies in rest in Windsor Castle, there is the belief that his soul is making its final journey across the waves of the Pacific Ocean to its spiritual home, the island of Tanna - to reside with those who have loved and revered him from afar all these years."

      "tags": "Lockerbie,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Hospitality industry,Restaurants,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Hospitality and tourism leaders have criticised the Covid restrictions which prevent the sectors' reopening. \nThey were speaking as England's lockdown rules eased further, with pub gardens and restaurants among the places able to reopen. \nWaiting two weeks before reopening will come at a cost to Scotland's economy of \u00a320 million, they warned. \nRepresentatives of the sectors agreed that public health had to be a priority but insisted they were safe to reopen. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has linked the decision to \"significantly\" ease restrictions to the rollout of the Covid vaccine. \nWith everyone in all nine priority groups expected to have received their first jab by mid-April, she said the government would have \"confidence\" to begin opening up hospitality from 26 April. \nOne publican in Dumfries and Galloway said he expected people would travel to England to visit hospitality venues there. \nIt is currently against the law to travel across the border except for essential reasons. \nStephen Montgomery, who owns the Townhead Hotel in Lockerbie and is a spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, said he would \"love to be opening up at the same time as our colleagues down south\".\n\"We're going to be seeing people jump the border... for that long awaited pint of cold beer while we still remain closed,\" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland.\n\"Scotland's always been behind in the way we've been operating for the last year. So it's going to be no different this time.\n\"We are at a disadvantage.\"\nHe also said the rules were not being made clear far enough in advance. \nOn the next review date of 20 April, it will be decided if hospitality venues are allowed to open up inside from 26 April, and what the restrictions will be. \n\"We haven't got the regulations and we're less than two weeks to opening here,\" Mr Montgomery said.  \n\"We've had this all year where our guidance has been last minute, and that cannot go on.\n\"Business operators and suppliers... need advance warning.\"\nFiona Campbell, the chief executive of the Association of Scotland's Self Caterers, said she was concerned that uncertainty about the rules would lead to prospective customers taking their business elsewhere. \n\"It's really difficult to deal with... seeing people literally across the border opening up. Our colleagues down south have been able to but we're not able to,\" she said.  \nShe added that research commissioned by the sector last year suggested that opening two weeks late represented a \u00a320m loss to the Scottish economy. \nMs Campbell acknowledged that public health had to be protected, but said some businesses - including self-catering accommodation - could safely reopen. \nShe added that a lack of clarity over when certain restrictions - like how many households could share self-catering accommodation - were difficult to explain to prospective customers. \nScotland's lockdown is expected to ease further from 26 April, with the Scottish government expected to give more details on how this will happen in the weeks ahead.\nThis will bring a return to the \"levels\" system of local restrictions, with the whole country in level three \"if the data allows\". \nCafes, pubs and restaurants are expected to be allowed to open until 20:00 indoors (although no alcohol will be permitted) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). \nShops and gyms are also due to open, and more people will be allowed to meet up outdoors."

      "tags": "David Cameron,UK government,Greensill Capital,Rishi Sunak,Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Lobbying,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "David Cameron has said he should have contacted the government \u201cthrough only the most formal of channels\" when lobbying for a financial firm.\nThe former prime minister has faced criticism for contacting ministers on behalf of Greensill Capital.\nIn his first statement on the issue, he said he should have left \"no room for misinterpretation\".\nBut Mr Cameron reiterated that he had broken no codes of conduct or government rules on lobbying.\nHe added: \"However, I have reflected on this at length. There are important lessons to be learnt.\"\nThe Labour Party said Mr Cameron's statement had left \"many serious questions\" unanswered, and called for him to answer them before Parliament.\nIt was revealed earlier that Health Secretary Matt Hancock had met Mr Cameron and financier Lex Greensill for a \"private drink\" in 2019 to discuss a new payment scheme for the NHS.\nAn ally of Mr Hancock said he had \"acted in entirely the correct way\".\nThe meeting is the latest in a series of Sunday Times disclosures about Mr Cameron's lobbying work since leaving office, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak - whom he texted - among the ministers contacted.\nFor three weeks the headlines kept coming. For three weeks David Cameron said nothing.\nAnd now this - the former prime minister admits he made a dud judgement call.\nForget the rules; this is about the sniff test. Does it smell bad? Does it feel right?\nPlenty had been saying no it doesn't, and now David Cameron appears to agree.\nIt's a lengthy statement from him, worthy of detailed examination.\nBut it boils down to this: he acknowledges texting and ringing the chancellor and going for a private drink with the health secretary, as part of his paid work for a private company, was a bad idea.\nThere's another point worth making too: journalism matters.\nThe work of the Financial Times and the Sunday Times, ferreting out awkward truths, is what has prompted this.\nMr Greensill, an Australian, worked as an unpaid adviser to Mr Cameron's government, and the former prime minister went on to be employed by his company - Greensill Capital - in 2018, two years after leaving Downing Street.\nIn his statement, Mr Cameron said: \"In my representations to government, I was breaking no codes of conduct and no government rules.\n\"Ultimately, the outcome of the discussions I encouraged about how Greensill's proposals might be included in the government's CCFF (Covid Corporate Financing Facility) initiative - and help in the wake of the coronavirus crisis - was that they were not taken up.\n\"So, I complied with the rules and my interventions did not lead to a change in the government's approach to the CCFF.\"\nHe added: \"As a former prime minister, I accept that communications with government need to be done through only the most formal of channels, so there can be no room for misinterpretation.\"\nMr Cameron added that he had worked for Greensill Capital in the belief that there \"would be a material benefit for UK businesses at a challenging time\".\n\"That was, in large part, my reason for working for Greensill in the first place,\" he said.\nThe company recently collapsed, with the loss of 440 jobs.\nMr Cameron said: \"I completely understand the public interest in this issue, given the impact of Greensill's collapse on the hundreds of people who worked for the company and on other businesses and livelihoods. I feel desperately sorry for those affected.\"\nHe added that Mr Greensill had been brought in as a government adviser by then-Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, in 2011.\n\"He was not a political appointee,\" Mr Cameron said, \"but part of the Civil Service drive to improve government efficiency.\"\nHe continued: \"The false impression has been created that Lex Greensill was a close member of my team, meeting with me on a regular basis.\n\"The truth is, I had very little to do with Lex Greensill at this stage - as I recall, I met him twice at most in the entirety of my time as prime minister.\"\nMr Cameron - who was in Downing Street from 2010 to 2016 - is reported to have told friends he was set to earn as much as \u00a360m from shareholdings in Greensill Capital prior to its collapse, although this has since been disputed.\nShadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Rachel Reeves said: \"The events unfolding over the last few weeks stretch across government and affect thousands of people.\n\"Transparency and accountability are crucial and that requires the utmost openness from government to establish the full facts behind this scandal.\""

      "text": "Shoppers have been eagerly queuing in Wales' high streets as the next phase of easing the coronavirus lockdown begins.\nCovid rules have been relaxed to allow non-essential retail and close-contact services to resume and travel to other parts of the UK.\nSchool pupils and post-16 students are returning to classes and university students will see a mix of face-to-face and online lessons.\nDriving lessons are also resuming.\nQueues formed outside fashion stores TK Maxx and Primark in Cardiff city centre and elsewhere, from 07:00 BST.\nRetail consultants Springboard said that while thousands hit high streets across Wales, footfall was 16% lower than on the same date in 2019, before the pandemic hit.\nCovid case rates have fallen substantially in Wales since January and now stand at 17.6 per 100,000 people.\nAnd 49% of the population has been vaccinated with a first jab, according to data published by Public Health Wales on Sunday.\n\"We haven't been able to do any shopping for the kids since actually December,\" said one man, queuing outside St David's shopping centre in Cardiff.\nAnother said it was \"good to see everyone out supporting the local shops\".\n\"We got some things to take back from Christmas,\" she added.\nA third said she was \"absolutely thrilled\" that all shops could reopen and she was looking for \"bargains\".\n\"It's getting back to normality and, hopefully, people getting back to what they used to do,\" she said.\nJames Waugh, director at St David's, said: \"We're following government guidelines, we hope people are going to be kind, maintain social distancing, we've got capacity management, so there may be occasions where we have to ask people to queue outside, but we're expecting steady progress and people to come back.\"\nWith the lockdown easing for many businesses for the first time since December, shoppers have been asked to stay safe and respect staff, after a rise in reports of abuse.\nHannah Burson, who owns a shop in Hay-on-Wye, Powys, said the past year had been \"awful\", having to close and reopen the business and furlough most of her 10 staff.\n\"We did have a busy summer, which was great but it was short-lived,\" she said.\nShe branched out into online sales, but added \"it isn't exactly keeping the business going\".\n\"It's kept people noticing us and remembering that we're here and that we will be reopening. But in terms of sales, nothing like when we're open. \nWith bills mounting and a government loan to repay, she is hoping to capitalise on tourism from England.\n\"I really hope we'll have a mad rush, it'll be great. We really need to sell some stock so we're hoping it will be busy yet safe,\" she said.\nMany retailers with bricks and mortar stores have been in crisis since before the pandemic.\nIncreased online shopping, high costs of rent and rates and rising wage bills have put pressure on those companies that have a heavy presence on high streets.\nCovid-19 has added to their woes with stores being closed for months at a time often during traditionally peak trading periods.\nSome of the biggest names in the industry have faced serious challenges, including John Lewis, Topshop, House of Fraser and Peacocks.\nDebenhams is reopening - but only for a closing down sale, bringing an end to more than 200 years of trading on the high street. The brand will continue online.\nThe latest British Retail Consortium figures show Wales had the sharpest decline in footfall of any UK nation or region compared with 2019.\nBefore the pandemic, 23,000 jobs were lost in Welsh retail and wholesale between 2009 and 2019.\nThe restrictions put in place due to Covid have magnified the challenges ahead for an industry that was already facing significant transformation.\nAneeka Hearn, sales manager at a jewellers in Swansea, said: \"People are getting married still, engaged, people are still having birthdays and special occasions and a lot of people haven't been able to go on their cruises and holidays, so they want to spend their money on something nice to treat themselves and have something to look forward to.\"\nThere is some concern there could be a reluctance in shoppers to return to Wales' high streets, after a year of buying things online.\nIn the Vale of Glamorgan, the Shop Local Penarth campaign is encouraging residents to support their local traders, who have faced tough times.\nA new virtual marketplace for the town's independent shops and businesses has been launched to give shoppers the opportunity to buy from their favourite local traders online in one place.\nChair of the Penarth Business Group, Angelina Hall, said: \"The increase of online shopping has accelerated, and our high streets need to understand that a new blended way of shopping is now being demanded.\"\nAnna Knight, who owns a lifestyle and homeware shop in Cardiff, said that after a \"really difficult three months\" she was confident that shoppers would come back.\n\"Our shop has always been about the experience... you want to browse around,\" she said.\nSarah Bruton, who runs Captiva Spa and Lounge in Caerphilly, said it was an \"emotional day\" being able to see clients for beauty treatments for the first time in months.\n\"Every stage has been a battle in terms of the local lockdown, we couldn't bring our clients from outside the local area - that had a huge impact, and campaigning for funding for the beauty industry, which hasn't always been in place,\" she said.\n\"So it's really just being here today is such a huge relief.\"\nNicole Gooding, salon manager at Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty, Cardiff, said changes had been made to adhere to Covid rules and \"make sure everyone is as safe as possible\".\n\"I'm just so excited to catch up with everyone... just to see all our lovely clients' faces again,\" she said.\nNick Ireland, divisional officer of shop workers' union Usdaw, said those who have been furloughed are looking forward to being back at work and \"to get a sense of normality and certainty in their lives\".\nBut he reminded customers: \"We're still in a pandemic. It's about shopping safely, keep that 2m distance, wear a face covering, make sure you wash your hands, pay with a card if you can.\n\"Be polite to shop workers. You're in somebody's workplace, treat them as you would expect to be treated in your own workplace and be patient.\"\nWith people allowed to travel over the border into England, many will be able to see friends of family outside after months of being unable to see them.\nCarl Cowlinshaw, who runs a narrowboat hire company which has about 120 boats in England and Wales, said it had been a \"very busy day\".\nMr Cowlinshaw said many people wanted to travel to enjoy \"some of the Welsh wonders\" from the Llangollen canal, but people were still being cautious.\n\"They'll be zipping all over the place from today,\" he said.\nMonday sees a full return to schools and further education and university campuses will be able to provided blended face-to-face and online learning for students, according to Welsh government Covid regulations.\nHuw Powell, headteacher of Mary Immaculate High School in Cardiff, said the plan was to \"maintain some kind of normality\".\n\"Schools are about keeping pupils safe,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"Education is at the heart of what we do, and that has got to continue, and that social opportunities come under that umbrella of mental health - this is something that we have focused on quite strongly.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives have previously accused the Welsh government of a U-turn over the reopening of non-essential shops.\nTheir leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said a decision to allow shops to open on the same day as England could have been made earlier.\nHe said this had caused \"frustration in the sectors worst hit by the pandemic and will put more Welsh jobs at risk\".\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price has described a \"lack of a level playing field for small non-essential retail\" during the pandemic.\nHe accused the Welsh government of \"badly failing Welsh business and the workers and communities that depend on them\".\nJane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, had accused the Welsh government of \"throwing many small shops and high streets under a bus\".\n\"The Welsh Labour government has treated the High Street with complete contempt,\" she said.\nThe Welsh government defended its plan for reopening retail, saying: \"We recognise everyone wants certainty to be able to plan for the future and that businesses want to be open and trading. That's why the first minister has set out a plan to bring Wales out of alert level four lockdown.\n\"We cannot move directly and fully into alert level three in one step,\" a spokesperson said."

He was told by a police officer: \"Because you're not co-operating.\" \nHe was later released without charge.\nEarlier this week Lt Nazario filed a lawsuit at the US District Court of Norfolk, Virginia, against the two Windsor Police Department officers. \nAccording to the lawsuit, Lt Nazario was pepper sprayed and knocked to the ground by the officers. Bodycam footage shows the officers pointing their guns at the lieutenant.\nThe suit alleges violations to his constitutional rights, and includes assault, illegal search and illegal detention.\nThe lawsuit comes at a time of increased scrutiny over alleged police brutality towards minorities and racial justice.\nEx-police officer Derek Chauvin is currently on trial for the murder of George Floyd. The footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on African-American Mr Floyd's neck during an arrest sparked global protests against racism.\nLt Nazario, who is Black and Latino, was in uniform and driving with a temporary paper licence plate on his back window on 5 December, when he was told to pull over in the town of Windsor. \nHe then stopped at a petrol station and kept his hands outside the window, while asking the policemen why he was being stopped.\nAttorney Jonathan Arthur, who is representing Lt Nazario in the lawsuit, said that the army officer knew it was vital he kept his hands on show.\n\"To unbuckle his seatbelt, to do anything, any misstep - he was afraid that they were going to kill him,\" Mr Arthur told CBS.\nThe suit filed by Lt Nazario says that Mr Gutierrez acknowledged why the army officer had waited to pull over in a lighted area. \n\"I get it, the media spewing race relations between law enforcement and minorities. I get it,\" the policeman said, according to the suit. "

      "text": "All 350,000 pupils in Northern Ireland return to school on Monday.\nFor many of those in post-primary years eight to 11, it will be their first time in the classroom in 2021.\nPrimary and pre-school pupils and those in years 12-14 made a phased return to school in March before the Easter break.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann and Education Minister Peter Weir welcomed the return, but said safety measures should continue to be followed.\nThe full return to school follows a decision taken by the Northern Ireland Executive on 1 April.\nAll school staff and pupils in years 12,13 and 14 are being asked to take twice-weekly lateral flow device (LFD) tests.\nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) has said that is to reduce the risk of the virus being transmitted in schools.\nPost-primary pupils will also be required to wear face coverings in classrooms unless they have an exemption.\nSchools have a number of other safety measures in place, including class \"bubbles\" to limit pupils mixing and ventilating classrooms.\nThey have also been told by the Department of Education (DE) that breakfast clubs, sports fixtures between schools and other extra-curricular or after-school clubs should not take place yet.\nRita Moore, principal of St Mary's in Limavady told BBC's Good Morning Ulster her staff were \"looking forward\" to welcoming children back through the gates. \n\"What I would call on Minister Weir to do, is let us know what the arrangements are going to be for next year,\" she added. \n\"We can't leave the end of this term without teachers knowing exactly what they have to prepare their children for in the coming academic year.\"\nDr Michelle Rainey, principal of Ballyclare High School, said it was important to reassure children.\n\"We're controlling what we can, bringing them in and creating that safe environment for them,\" she said.\nSome experts have called for pupils to be given time to settle back in after what has been, for many, a long period learning from home.\nThe mental health champion Prof Siobhan O'Neill, for example, has previously said there should initially be a curriculum \"designed to address children's worries about the pandemic and the virus.\"\".\nThere have also been concerns that some pupils in years 12 -14 will face multiple exams as schools gather evidence to award them GCSE, AS and A-level grades.\nAs summer exams have been cancelled for a second year, teachers and schools will calculate the grades to be awarded to their pupils.\nOn Monday, Mr Weir said it was \"important schools do not over test\" those pupils in exam years. \nHe reiterated that tests, which the Northern Ireland exams board CCEA sent to schools for pupils to sit when they returned to school, were not compulsory.\n\"But the balance needs to be struck to make sure an assessment is being done,\" he said.\n\"I know work is being done to try and ease them back in and particularly a focus on trying to make sure their mental health is protected, but there will need to be some level of assessment.\"\nA few grammar schools have also already said they would not use transfer tests in 2021 to select pupils due to the disruption to the education of children currently in Primary Six."

      "text": "The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex have paid tribute to their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. \nIn separate statements, Prince William described him as an \"extraordinary man\", while Prince Harry said he was \"a man of service, honour and great humour\" and the \"legend of banter\". \n\"I will miss my Grandpa, but I know he would want us to get on with the job,\" Prince William added. \nPrince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday aged 99.\nIt comes as parliaments across the UK were recalled to remember the duke. \n\"My grandfather's century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family,\" Prince William said in a statement.\n\"I feel lucky to have not just had his example to guide me, but his enduring presence well into my own adult life - both through good times and the hardest days.\n\"I will always be grateful that my wife had so many years to get to know my grandfather and for the kindness he showed her. \n\"I will never take for granted the special memories my children will always have of their great-grandpa coming to collect them in his carriage and seeing for themselves his infectious sense of adventure as well as his mischievous sense of humour!\"\nHe added that he and his wife, Catherine, would \"continue to do what he would have wanted and will support the Queen in the years ahead\". \nPaying tribute to his grandfather, Prince Harry said: \"He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next.\n\"He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the monarch, a decorated serviceman, a prince and a duke. \n\"But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end.\"\nBy Jonny Dymond, Royal correspondent\nHe walked next to them on the hardest public day of their lives, in the public procession behind their mother's coffin. And now the brothers pay tribute in their own style, with tenderness and with love.\nHarry, you may have noticed, now lives in California. His message is more informal, with memories of family outings, the back and forth of conversation, of a grandfather never short of a quip or an impatient snort.  \nWilliam writes as a grandson who has lost a guide and support; but also as a father who saw the mutual delight of grandfather and son together.\nBoth men flesh out in the few words they write the man they, and the nation, have said farewell to.  There was clearly a lot of laughter. There was clearly a lot of fun. \nOnce more the gruff caricature we were left with of the duke is re-drawn, and filled out.\nPrince Harry described Prince Philip as \"a rock\" for the Queen \"with unparalleled devotion\". \n\"While I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'\" he said. \n\"So, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself.\"\nPrince Harry signed off his message with the words \"Per Mare, Per Terram\", meaning \"By Sea, By Land\" in Latin - the motto of the Royal Marines, of which Prince Philip and Prince Harry were both Captain General.\nPhilip held the role for 64 years before retiring in 2017. Harry succeeded him briefly before stepping down as a working royal last year when he moved to the US.\nMeanwhile, MPs began proceedings in the House of Commons by observing a minute's silence to remember the duke's life. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said Prince Philip had \"touched the lives of millions\", including through the Duke of Edinburgh's Award schemes.\n\"By his tireless, unstinting service to the Queen, the Commonwealth, the armed forces, the environment, to millions of young people and not-so-young people around the world, and to countless other causes, he gave us and he gives us all a model of selflessness and of putting others before ourselves,\" he said. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the duke's life \"shaped modern Britain and provided much-needed stability to our national story\". \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon led the tributes in Holyrood, describing the duke and the Queen as a \"true partnership\". \nIn the Welsh Senedd, First Minister Mark Drakeford said Prince Philip led a \"remarkable\" life and had championed a \"broad diversity\" of causes in Wales.\nAnd in the Northern Ireland Assembly, First Minister Arlene Foster described the duke as a \"true intergenerational legacy to our youth, our United Kingdom and the world's environment\".\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there had been \"significant interventions\" by the Royal Family to \"assist in the building of relationships between Britain and Ireland\", which should be recognised. \nIn the Lords, former children's television presenter Baroness Benjamin said Prince Philip had made a \"gigantic contribution\" to Britain and the Commonwealth and they had kept up a correspondence over the years, including him writing to congratulate her on receiving her OBE and damehood.\nA ceremonial royal funeral, which will be televised, will be held for the duke at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on 17 April.\nHis children and grandchildren are expected to attend and Prince Harry has arrived in the UK from the US for the service. His wife, Meghan, who is pregnant, will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors.\nA spokesman for the Duke of Sussex said he was at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, his former residence, observing coronavirus regulations. \nIt will be the first time Prince William and Prince Harry will meet face to face since the Sussexes aired criticisms of the Royal Family in an interview to US broadcaster Oprah Winfrey last month.\nOn Sunday, former prime minister Sir John Major, who was appointed a special guardian to the brothers after their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales died in 1997, said the \"shared grief\" over the death of Prince Philip is an \"ideal opportunity\" to mend any rifts in the Royal Family.\nOver the weekend, Prince Philip's children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - also paid tribute to their father, with Prince Andrew saying the Queen had described his death as \"having left a huge void in her life\". \nby Duncan Kennedy, BBC News\nWindsor is now a town with twin-sided attentions: the crowd-less castle side, sealed-off and busy preparing for a royal funeral, alongside the energised shop side, resurfacing from lockdown.\nAt the entrance to the castle, the glistening steel barriers of the media enclosure are packed with cameras trained on the ancient grey walls. They look out on a scene of perpetual preparation: forklift trucks, catering vans and council vehicles enter, leave, turn and reverse.\nScaffolding, chairs, flowers and boxes are disgorged. And miles of cables are being unfurled from vast drums like never-ending electrical snakes by the television, radio and lighting professionals who will bring the funeral to the world.\nPolice have replaced pedestrians in this cordoned-off unit of determined workflows: on foot, on bicycles and in their cars, their blacked-out windows gliding past the castle's famous black-cloaked wardens, lined up across the entrance.\nThe paper plans of countless committees across endless decades are coming to a melancholy fruition, to give His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, a fitting send-off."

      "text": "The Scottish government has announced a further easing of the Covid rules.\nGuidance urging people to work from home wherever possible is to be relaxed in favour of a \"hybrid\" system of office and remote working from Monday 31 January.\nRestrictions on large outdoor events came to an end on 17 January, then rules on indoor events and venues, including the need for table service in hospitality premises, were lifted on 24 January.\nNew guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday 31 January.\nThis will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.\nBusinesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.\nThe requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be reduced from 2m to 1m from 31 January.\nAnd face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.\nFrom Friday 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland.\nThose who are not fully vaccinated will still have to take a pre-departure test no more than two days before they travel, then take a PCR test on or before day two after their arrival.\nA raft of new measures introduced in December in response to the spread of the Omicron variant have already been removed.\nThese included limits on the number of people who could attend large public events; restrictions in pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places; and the closure of nightclubs.\nAdults and children aged 12 and over still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as before, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport.\nBusinesses are legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid, including physical distancing and screens.\nIn hospitality, face coverings can be removed while dancing, drinking and dining. Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "text": "Funeral preparations are under way for Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband, who died on Friday 9 April aged 99. \nThis is what we know about the event.\nThe ceremonial royal funeral will be held at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on Saturday 17 April. \nPrince Philip's body is now resting in the inner hall at Windsor Castle after being moved from its private chapel.\nThe duke is reported to have requested a funeral of minimal fuss and has not lain in state - where members of the public would have been able to view his coffin. \nThe procession and service will be televised - details below.\nCoronavirus restrictions in England mean only 30 people, socially distanced, are allowed to attend funerals. \nThe guest list includes members of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's families, including three of his German relatives.\nPrince Harry will attend but his wife Meghan, who is pregnant, will not make the trip from the US, on medical advice. It is the first time the Duke of Sussex has returned to the UK since stepping down as a senior royal last year.\nAttendees are expected to wear masks in line with government advice. The pallbearers and clergy are not included in the number of attendees.\nThe duke will have a ceremonial funeral, rather than a state funeral. There is a subtle difference - state funerals are usually reserved for monarchs, although wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill was given a state funeral. The Queen Mother had a ceremonial funeral in 2002, as did Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. \nOn the day of the funeral, the coffin will be moved from the private chapel to the State Entrance of Windsor Castle. It will be placed on a modified Land Rover, that the duke himself helped design, to be carried the short distance to St George's Chapel.\nCoronavirus restrictions on crowds and numbers attending funerals mean the duke's ceremonial funeral will be much lower key than if it had happened in other times - although the Palace says this very much \"reflects the duke's wishes\" and it will still \"celebrate and reflect\" a life of service.\nLive online coverage of the procession and funeral begins on the BBC News website and app at 07:00 BST and the service will be streamed in the UK and internationally. \nTelevision coverage in the UK starts at 12:30 BST on Saturday on BBC One, the BBC News Channel and on BBC iPlayer.\nOn the radio, you can follow the day's events between 14:00 BST and 16:10 BST on Radio 4 and Radio 5 Live, and simulcast on BBC World Service English, BBC Radio Scotland, and BBC Radio Ulster. \nBBC Radio Wales and BBC local radio will also cover the event, with start times to be confirmed.\nBy 14:15 BST, the Quadrangle in Windsor Castle will be lined by the Household Cavalry and the Foot Guards, along with military detachments from units that had special connections with Prince Philip on the grass.\nFrom 14:20 BST, those members of the Royal Family and The Duke of Edinburgh's family not taking part in the procession leave Windsor Castle by car for St George's Chapel.\nAt 14:40 BST, the bands in the Quadrangle stop playing and the coffin will be carried out and placed onto the Land Rover.\nMembers of the Royal Family walking in the procession will leave the State Entrance after the coffin and take up their positions.\nBehind the Land Rover will be Princes Charles, Andrew, Edward and Princess Anne, as well as grandsons Princes William and Harry. They are joined by Princess Anne's son Peter Phillips, her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon. Members of the duke's staff will follow behind them, including his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller Bakewell, a personal protection officer, two pages and two valets.\nAt 14:45 BST, the procession begins. Led by the band of the Grenadier Guards, the procession will move from the Quadrangle to Horseshoe Cloister. The band is followed by the Major General's party and military chiefs of staff. The Land Rover follows, flanked by pallbearers from the Royal Marines and other regiments and corps associated with the duke. The Royal Family members and staff follow behind.\nThe Queen will travel at the rear of the procession in the State Bentley and will enter St George's chapel through the Galilee porch.\nThe procession route will be lined by personnel from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, The Highlanders, 4th Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Royal Air Force.\nGuns will be fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery from the East Lawn throughout, as a bell tolls in the Curfew Tower, at the west end of the castle. \nAt 14:53 BST, the Land Rover will arrive at West Steps of St George's Chapel, and be met by a guard of honour and band from the Rifles Regiment, who will play the national anthem.\nMembers of the Household Cavalry will line the West Steps and a Royal Navy \"piping party\" will pipe a nautical call known as \"the Still\" as the coffin is carried up the steps to the chapel.\nThe coffin, draped with the duke's standard, with a wreath and the duke's naval cap and sword on top, will be met by the dean of Windsor, together with the Archbishop of Canterbury, for the service.\nOnly the members of the Royal Family will enter the chapel - the rest of the procession will remain outside. \nAt 15:00 BST, a minute's silence will be held nationwide, in memory of the duke. \nThe start and end of the Silence will be signalled by a gun fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.\nInside the chapel, the funeral service will begin as the coffin is carried to the Quire, and placed on a platform called a catafalque. \nA small choir of four singers, who will be in the nave of the chapel, will sing pieces of music chosen by the duke.\nAfter the service, the duke will be interred in the royal vault.\nThe duke's coffin is draped in his personal flag, his standard. The flag represents elements of his life, from his Greek heritage to his British titles. \nWhen the duke got engaged to the then Princess Elizabeth in 1946, he renounced his Greek title and became a British citizen, taking his mother's anglicised name, Mountbatten.\nThe Mountbatten family is therefore also represented on the standard, alongside the castle from the arms of the City of Edinburgh - he became Duke of Edinburgh when he married.\nA number of objects personally selected by the duke will be displayed on cushions on the altar in St George's Chapel.\nThese include the duke's insignia - medals and decorations awarded to him by the UK and Commonwealth countries - his field marshal's baton, Royal Air Force wings and insignia from Denmark and Greece \nMembers of the public have been asked not to attend any of the funeral events, in line with public health advice.\nOn the Royal Family website, members of the public are asked to consider making a donation to a charity instead of leaving floral tributes in memory of the duke. An online book of condolence is also available for the public to post their personal tributes.\nThe period of national mourning ends on the day of the funeral.\nThe Royal Family will continue to observe mourning for another week - but members will attend engagements wearing black mourning bands where appropriate."

      "tags": "Chloe Zhao,Bafta Awards,Frances McDormand,Nomadland,Film,The  Father,Emerald Fennell",
      "text": "Nomadland, a drama about a woman who lives in a van in the American West after the financial crash, has taken top honours at the Bafta Film Awards.\nIt scooped four prizes including best film, best actress for its star Frances McDormand and best director.\nThat made Chloe Zhao only the second woman to win best director in the 53 years of the category's history.\nMeanwhile, Sir Anthony Hopkins won best actor for The Father, 27 years after his last competitive Bafta win.\nThe 83-year-old, who won for playing a man losing his grip on reality, is the oldest ever winner of the award. But he was not watching Sunday's ceremony and later said he only found out he'd won when he heard cheering from the next room.\n\"I was sitting here painting, and I heard this cheer go off next door,\" he said after the ceremony. \"I thought, what the hell's happened? I thought they were watching a football match. And they came in and said I'd won.\"\nMost winners were watching live and delivered acceptance speeches remotely, with none of the nominees at the Royal Albert Hall in person.\nZhao, who was born in China and is based in the US, referred to her education in the UK when she told the ceremony: \"I think I just made my teacher at Brighton College very proud.\"\nHer win comes 11 years after Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win best director for The Hurt Locker, and Zhao's victory means she is the first woman of colour to pick up the prize. Nomadland will be released in the UK on Disney+ on 30 April.\nBritish star Daniel Kaluuya was named best supporting actor for playing Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah.\nThe supporting actress trophy went to South Korea's Yuh-Jung Youn for playing a grandmother in Korean-American drama Minari. Giving her speech in broken English, the 73-year-old said the award meant a lot because Brits were \"snobbish\" people.\n\"Every award is meaningful, but this one especially recognised by British people, known as very snobbish people, and they approved me as a good actor so I'm very, very privileged,\" she said.\nThe prize for best British film went to Promising Young Woman, a revenge thriller about a woman, played by Carey Mulligan, who pretends to be blind drunk when men pick her up in bars and clubs.\nIts writer and director Emerald Fennell also won best original screenplay. She joked that everyone involved in the film had made it for \"a packet of crisps\", and said the experience was \"the greatest thing in my life\".\nFennell is best known to viewers for her acting as Patsy in BBC drama Call the Midwife and for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles in Netflix's The Crown.\nOther Bafta winners included Bukky Bakray. The 18-year-old was named rising star following her first ever acting role in Rocks, in which she played a teenage schoolgirl abandoned by her mother.\nThe low-budget film, set in east London, was the joint highest nominee along with Nomadland, with seven nominations each. Rocks also won the casting award for finding its group of largely novice young stars.\nOther films to win two prizes included Disney/Pixar's animated hit Soul; Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, adapted from August Wilson's play about a 1920s blues band; and Sound of Metal, which stars Riz Ahmed as a rock drummer who loses his hearing.\nThis year's shortlists included a diverse line-up of talent, following an outcry last year when voters only nominated white actors.\nThis time 16 of the 24 acting contenders came from minority ethnic backgrounds, while 21 were first-time nominees.\nMore on the winning films:\nThe night began with a tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, who was Bafta's first president between 1959 and 1966. \nCo-host Edith Bowman said Prince Philip \"occupies a very special place in Bafta's history, and our thoughts are with the Royal Family\".\nThe Duke of Cambridge had been due to appear in a pre-recorded segment, but pulled out following the death of his grandfather.\nThis year's Baftas were delayed by two months because of the pandemic, and come two weeks before the awards season reaches its climax with the Academy Awards.\nUnlike the Baftas, Oscars organisers want nominees to appear in person and will have a London venue for the first time for UK-based contenders.\nSir Anthony, however, said he would stay in Wales, where he is having \"a quiet time\", rather than travelling to take part in the Oscar ceremony.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

      "tags": "Sheep farming,Dogs,Animals",
      "text": "A sheepdog given up to the RSPCA when she lost her hearing and was unable to work on a farm, has been taught a form of sign language enabling her to \"get back to the job she loved\".\nPeggy, a collie, was adopted in 2018 by a member of the charity's staff, whose husband is a shepherd in Norfolk.\nTogether they began the \"long process\" of teaching her how to herd using hand signals rather than voice commands.\nPeggy, 10, is now working part-time with the couple's other two dogs.\nPeggy was a \"bright and efficient sheepdog\" but as she had lost her hearing, she had lost her communication skills with her handler, the RSPCA said.\nA farmer handed the dog, then aged eight, to the charity's Mid Norfolk and North Suffolk branch, where Chloe Shorten, an animal welfare manager, worked.\nWith no room in the kennels just before Christmas, Peggy went home to stay with the Shortens and their other two working sheepdogs.\n\"We knew Peggy wanted to be working, so we started the long process of teaching her how to herd and work with a shepherd without relying on voice commands,\" said Mrs Shorten. \n\"We started by teaching her to look at us for hand signals. \n\"We used repetitive and positive reinforcement and instead of pairing a verbal command with an action, we'd use a physical hand gesture.\"\nWith the help of a sheepdog trainer, Peggy came to understand hand signals and body language.\nThe process took time, Mrs Shorten said, and it also took time for Peggy to \"learn that we love her - and understand our praise\".\nA thumbs up means \"good girl\", she said.\nWhile the collie is \"generally retired\" she still goes out to work from time to time with Mrs Shorten's husband. When it comes to time to play, Peggy has to wear a GPS tracker as she runs around so enthusiastically and cannot hear her owners calling her back.\n\"It's amazing to see her with this new lease of life, and enjoying her life with us,\" said Mrs Shorten.\n\"She's proof that you can teach an old dog new tricks, and is a wonderful example of the capability of a dog - even if they do lose a sense.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nFor the first time in months, pub gardens, non-essential shops and hairdressers are reopening in England. Some pubs and salons opened at midnight, with one landlord saying there was a \"sense of celebration\", and shoppers queued outside branches of Primark, JD Sports and TK Maxx. Non-essential shops and close-contact services have also reopened in Wales, while travel to other parts of the UK is allowed again. And in Northern Ireland, a stay-at-home order has been lifted, with people instead being asked to \"stay local\". \nMeanwhile, the hospitality and tourism industry in Scotland has criticised restrictions that prevent venues from reopening there. Scotland's lockdown is expected to ease further from 26 April, with shops and gyms due to reopen and pubs and restaurants likely to be able to open until 20:00 indoors, with no alcohol permitted, and 22:00 outdoors. But industry leaders warned that waiting two weeks before reopening would cost the economy \u00a320m. \nAll pupils in Northern Ireland have returned to school today, with children in years eight to 11 back in classrooms for the first time this year. The phased reopening of schools in Northern Ireland began in March, before the Easter break. Staff and pupils in years 12 to 14 are being asked to take rapid lateral flow tests twice a week to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading and post-primary school children will also be required to wear face coverings in classrooms unless they have an exemption. In Scotland, secondary and primary pupils in six Scottish councils have also returned to the classroom full-time, marking the end of remote learning for many. \nAn update to England and Wales's contact tracing app has been blocked for breaking the terms of an agreement made with Apple and Google. The plan had been to ask users to upload logs of venue check-ins - carried out via poster barcode scans - if they tested positive for the virus. This could be used to warn others. The update had been timed to coincide with the relaxation of lockdown rules. But the two firms had explicitly banned collecting any location data via the software. \nFor many, the most anticipated post-lockdown activity is the opportunity to get a haircut, with many salons fully booked for weeks. Jeanette Braddy was the first customer through the door at Divas Hair Salon in Colchester. She says she missed going there, describing haircuts as a \"social thing as well\". \"I come on a regular basis, so to come back is amazing,\" she adds. You can read more from customers and stylists at the salon here.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nAnd if you're heading to the pub this evening, check out our guide to see what new rules to expect.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

The day's scheduled business will be put back to Wednesday.\nThe Scottish Parliament and Sennedd, both of which were not due to be sitting ahead of May's elections, will be recalled for members to pay tribute from 11:00.\nAnd the Northern Ireland Assembly will meet from 12:00.\nThe tributes come during a period of national mourning which will end on the day of Prince Philip's funeral at Windsor Castle's St George's Chapel.\nA national minute's silence will be held to coincide with the start of the service at 15:00.\nThe Duke of Sussex will attend the service, without his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant and will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors.\nMembers of the Royal Family will walk behind the coffin ahead of the funeral."

      "tags": "Israel,Iran,Iran nuclear deal",
      "text": "The Iranian foreign minister has said his country will \"take revenge\" for an attack on an underground nuclear site, for which it has blamed Israel.\nIranian officials said the Natanz uranium enrichment plant was the target of \"nuclear terrorism\" on Sunday, after initially reporting a power failure.\nNew advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium had just been activated there.\nIsrael has not commented, but public radio cited intelligence sources as saying it was a Mossad cyber operation.\nThey said it had caused more extensive damage than Iran had reported. \nUS intelligence officials told the New York Times that a large explosion had completely destroyed the independent internal power system that supplied the centrifuges inside the underground facility. They estimated it could take at least nine months to resume enrichment there.\nIran's Nour News agency, which is affiliated to the Supreme National Security Council, cited an intelligence ministry source as saying the \"main perpetrator\" had been identified and an operation was under way to arrest them. \nIsrael has recently stepped up its warnings about its arch-foe's nuclear programme amid efforts to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that was abandoned by former US President Donald Trump. \nHis successor, Joe Biden, has said he wants to return to the landmark accord. But Iran and the five other world powers still party to it - China, France, Germany, Russia and the UK - need to find a way for him to lift US sanctions and for Iran to return to the agreed limits on its nuclear programme.\nUS and Iranian officials are holding indirect talks in the Austrian capital, Vienna, to try to break the impasse, with European officials acting as intermediaries.\nThe European Union said it still needed to clarify the facts about the Natanz incident, but that it rejected \"any attempts to undermine or weaken diplomatic efforts on the nuclear agreement\".\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is visiting Israel, said he was aware of the reports about Natanz and that the Biden administration's diplomatic efforts to re-engage with Iran diplomatically would continue. \n\"The Zionists want to take revenge because of our progress in the way to lift sanctions,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted by state media as saying on Monday.\n\"They have publicly said that they will not allow this. But we will take our revenge from the Zionists.\"\nIran does not recognise Israel's right to exist and often refers to it as the \"Zionist state\".\nForeign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh later told a news conference in the capital, Tehran, that Israel was \"of course\" behind the attack on Natanz.\n\"This incident, fortunately, did not cause any damage to human lives or the environment. However, it could have been a catastrophe. This is a crime against humanity and carrying out such actions is in line with the essence of the Zionist regime,\" he said.\nMr Khatibzadeh said only the least efficient \"IR-1\" centrifuges were damaged in the incident, and that they would be replaced with advanced ones.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not mention the incident at a later joint news conference with the US defence secretary. \nBut he stated: \"My policy... is clear: I will never allow Iran to obtain the nuclear capability to carry out its genocidal goal of eliminating Israel. And Israel will continue to defend itself against Iran's aggression and terrorism.\"\nThe undeclared \"near war\" between Iran and Israel is heating up. \nThe latest damage done to Iran's nuclear programme, for which Iran has vowed to take revenge, follows a series of tit-for-tat actions around the Middle East. \nThere have been mysterious explosions on ships' hulls, blamed variously on both countries, and most significantly last November, there was the assassination in broad daylight near Tehran of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the man suspected of leading Iran's military nuclear programme. The Israeli air force has also carried out numerous air strikes against missile bases in Syria and other sites where Iranian advisers have been providing assistance to units of Hezbollah, the Shia Islamist militant group. \nIsrael sees Iran's nuclear programme as a potential threat to its existence and is determined to delay or stop it. It does not see any point in current efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal, believing it to be ineffective. \nThe attack on Natanz is likely to strengthen the hand of Iran's hardliners and complicate any future negotiations. \nEnriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235.\nThe nuclear deal only allows Iran to use IR-1 centrifuges to produce limited quantities of uranium enriched up to 3.67% concentration, which can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Uranium that is enriched to 90% or more can be used to make nuclear weapons.\nIran, which insists it does not want nuclear weapons, has retaliated against the sanctions reinstated by the Trump administration by rolling back key commitments under the accord.\nThese have included operating advanced centrifuges, resuming enrichment to 20% concentration, and building a stockpile of that material.\nOn Saturday, when Iran marked National Nuclear Technology Day, President Hassan Rouhani inaugurated a cascade (or cluster) of 164 advanced IR-6 centrifuges at Natanz. He also launched tests on new IR-9 centrifuges, which officials said could enrich uranium 50 times faster than the IR-1.\nThis is not the first time that Natanz has been the target of sabotage.\nLast July, an above-ground centrifuge assembly plant was badly damaged by what Iranian officials said was a fire. In response, Iran began building a new structure underneath nearby mountains.\nEnrichment at the plant was previously disrupted by the Stuxnet computer virus, widely believed to have been created by the US and Israel. The virus, which was discovered in 2010, changed the speeds at which the centrifuges spun and reportedly ruined almost 1,000 of them.\nIran also accused Israel of being behind the assassination of its top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, last November. Israel neither confirmed nor denied any involvement.\nAnd in recent months the countries have accused each other of being behind explosions that have damaged Israeli and Iranian commercial vessels.\n11 April : Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment plant reportedly seriously damaged in sabotage attack; Iran blames Israel\n6 April: Iranian cargo ship Saviz, allegedly used for spying, damaged by blast in Red Sea off coast of Eritrea; New York Times says Israel informed US that it carried out attack\n25 March: Israeli cargo ship Lori hit by missile in Arabian Sea; Israeli security officials say Iran suspected\n10 March: Iranian cargo ship Shahr-e Kord hit by blast in Mediterranean Sea; Iranian media say Israel to blame\n26 February: Israeli vehicle carrier MV Helios Ray hit by explosion in Gulf of Oman; Israel blames Iran\n27 November 2020: Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh assassinated, reportedly by satellite-controlled machine gun, outside Tehran; Iran accuses Israel\n2 July 2020: Natanz centrifuge assembly plant hit by blasts, reportedly causing extensive damage; Iran blames sabotage\nJune-July 2020: Series of mysterious fires and explosions hit industrial, power, medical and nuclear sites across Iran; Western intelligence sources say Israel suspected of involvement\n9 May 2020: Israel reportedly behind cyber-attack on Shahid Rajaee port in Iran\n24 April 2020: Israel accuses Iran of cyber-attack on water pumping station"

Other people took advantage of England's gyms and zoos reopening.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to \"behave responsibly\".\nNorthern Ireland's \"stay-at-home\" order is ending and some rules are being eased in Scotland and Wales.\nThe PM had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that has been postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday.\nSnow showers and chilly temperatures in parts of southern England appeared to do little to dampen enthusiasm for outdoor pints.\nScott Westlake, landlord of the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, said the pub had received 5,000 bookings over the next month for his new outside eating and drinking area.\nMr Westlake said: \"If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited.\n\"Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything - and they'll sit in a blizzard for the first few days at least.\"\nNicholas Hair, landlord and owner of the Kentish Belle pub in Bexleyheath, south-east London, said there was a \"sense of celebration\" in the early hours of Monday as it opened to midnight customers. \n\"I'm hoping that this is a sort of rebirth, and that we are reopen for the foreseeable,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, a town in Lincolnshire has introduced its own European-style pavement cafes to help boost trade.\nSeveral hospitality venues in the market town of Louth have been allowed to put seating and tables outside to serve people during the day.\nLewis Phillips, general manager of the Masons Arms, which is one of the venues involved in the Louth scheme, said: \"We don't have a lovely big beer garden. So what we've got out the front here is absolutely brilliant.\"\nThe prime minister had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that was postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. \nHowever, Downing Street confirmed that Mr Johnson did have a haircut before he paid tribute to the duke in the House of Commons.\nMarika Smith, general manager of Hough End Leisure Centre, Withington, Manchester, said all of their swimming times were already fully booked on Monday.\nKelly Boad, owner of the Hair & Beauty Gallery in Warwick, opened her salon at midnight for a symbolic \"first cut\" of 2021, adding she is fully booked for the first few weeks.\nShoppers rushed back to the High Street, as queues formed outside branches of Primark, JD Sports and TK Maxx and retailers extended their opening hours.\nAnother business that reopened in England was Secret Spa, which offers at-home salon and spa treatments in London, Manchester and Brighton.\nCo-owner Emily Ewart-Perks said it had \"been such a long time coming\", saying: \"Everyone has really missed the social contact of the day-to-day job and making clients happy.\"\nThe rule changes in England from Monday include:\nBut the British Beer and Pub Association has estimated that only 40% of licensed premises have the space to reopen for outdoor service.\nIn Northern Ireland, the remaining school year groups 8-11 returned to the classroom. The stay-at-home message has been lifted and up to 10 people from two households can meet in a private garden.\nIn Scotland, pupils at schools in six council areas went back to school but not everyone returned on Monday because differing term times mean some schools are still closed for the Easter holidays.\nAfter a drop in Covid cases prompted the Welsh Government to bring forward some dates for reopening, all students returned to face-to-face teaching on Monday. \nNon-essential shops can also reopen, close-contact services can resume, driving lessons can restart and travel in and out of Wales from the rest of the UK is allowed.\nShoppers, gym fans, domestic holiday makers, outdoor drinkers and diners, plus those in need of a haircut will share the government's hope that Monday is an irreversible step towards old and cherished freedoms. \nSo will the business owners who will be welcoming them back. \nBut this significant easing of lockdown is also an important test. \nWill customers want or be able to return in sufficient numbers for firms to break even and if they don't, what will it take to make the economy work again? \nOnly two in five hospitality venues have any outdoor space and the rules over future inside opening are still unclear. \nThe government and the opposition have distanced themselves from requiring Covid certificates for day-to-day life but the government has also hinted individual businesses may require them if they wish.\nHospitality chiefs have told the BBC they fear having to choose between two different ways to lose money - half-empty venues without certificates or full ones with extra staff and hassle to check Covid status. \nDemand may vary by sector. \nHairdressers are booked solid, retailers are hopeful of high footfall and are welcoming longer opening hours but some holiday parks are reporting subdued bookings as many of their public amenities remain closed. \nIt is a test for everyone - but a welcome one for most. \nIn a statement, the prime minister said the rule relaxations are \"a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom\".\n\"I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed,\" he added.\n\"I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme.\"\nThe rule changes in England marks the third easing since the country's third national lockdown began on 6 January.\nThere is a gap of at least five weeks between each step on the government's \"roadmap\" out of lockdown, to allow the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed.\nThe next significant date is 17 May, when up to six people from different households could be allowed to socialise indoors. \nMore than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine and of those 7.6m have had their second dose, according to the latest government data.\nMeanwhile, 189,665 second doses were administered on Sunday - along with 69,223 first doses.\nSaturday marked a record total for second doses, with 475,230 given, while 111,109 were first doses.\nA further 13 people are reported to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there have been 3,568 new infections.\nThere can be a lag in reporting coronavirus statistics during weekends.\nMeanwhile, surge coronavirus testing is being rolled out in areas of Wandsworth and Lambeth in south London, where cases of the South Africa variant were found. \nAll identified cases are self-isolating or have completed their isolation, and their contacts have been traced and asked to self-isolate."

      "text": "All over-50s and those in high-risk groups in the UK have now been offered a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, the government has announced. \nIt means ministers have met their target of offering a first dose to the top nine priority groups by 15 April. \nThe government said it was on track to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July, with those in their late 40s expected to be next in England. \nMore than 32 million people in the UK have had their first dose. \nAnd on Saturday a record 475,230 second doses were given out, with more than 7.6 million people now fully vaccinated.\nUnder-50s in Northern Ireland have already been asked to book appointments, and more people in the age group in other parts of the UK are now set to get their invitations.\nIt comes as England joins Wales and Scotland in giving out its first doses of the Moderna jab, the third Covid-19 vaccine to be administered in the UK.\nAll under-30s in the UK are to be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described hitting the vaccination target as \"another hugely significant milestone in our vaccine programme\". \n\"We will now move forward with completing essential second doses and making progress towards our target of offering all adults a vaccine by the end of July.\"\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"I'm delighted the team have done such an amazing job to hit yet another target early.\n\"The tide of this pandemic is turning in every part of the UK, as every day more and more people are being given the safety of a Covid-19 vaccine.\" \nGiven how quickly the vaccination programme has been rolled out in the UK, hitting the target of all priority groups by mid-April is not unexpected. \nAnd remember, there is no published data on the number of people offered jabs, as opposed to those who have actually been vaccinated. However, NHS England has made clear that across the nine groups, 95% have actually had their first doses - that is an average, with take-up rates varying in different groups.\nThe key question is: where next? Pending the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, ministers seem set to give the all-clear for invitations to go out to people in their late 40s.  \nBut what's not known is to what extent supplies of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will fill the gap caused this month by supply problems with the AstraZeneca doses. \nThe government is sticking to the line that the programme is on track to offer every adult a first dose by late July. \nBut officials qualify it by saying this is \"subject to supply\" - and that is a key variable.\nUrging those who are eligible to come forward for the jab, Mr Hancock added: \"Vaccines are safe and effective and have already saved more than 10,000 lives. \n\"The vaccine programme has had a significant impact on reducing the pressure on hospitals, helping us to gradually ease restrictions.\"\nOn reaching the milestone, Professor Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told BBC Breakfast: \"It's obviously great news, but we're only halfway up the hill.\n\"We mustn't take our eye off the task and we've got to keep working to get to the top.\"\nProf Finn said people over 50 who have not been invited for a first dose of the vaccine should make a \"gentle enquiry\" with their GP.\nSir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said it was an \"incredible achievement\" to have vaccinated 19 out of 20 people aged over-50 with a first dose.\nHe said the vaccination programme was \"without a doubt the most successful in our history\", adding: \"It's one of our tickets out of this pandemic and offers real hope for the future.\"\nThe announcement came on the day lockdown restrictions were further eased across the UK.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, representing NHS Trusts, urged people offered a vaccine to take it up, saying: \"As we return to pub gardens and sports activities and make our way back to non-essential shops, we must continue do all that we can to prevent the spread of infection and ensure this lockdown will be the last.\"\nThe top nine priority groups include all over-50s, over-16s with underlying health conditions, unpaid carers for the elderly and disabled and health and social care workers. It covers 99% of those at high risk of dying with Covid-19.\nThe vaccination roll-out will move on to focus on those aged 40-49.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments, is expected to publish its final advice on how the government should vaccinate under-50s, and the next phase of the programme is expected to begin this week.\nNHS organisations in the four nations, in collaboration with devolved administrations, will decide how to carry out the JCVI advice. \nOn Monday, the UK recorded 3,568 new coronavirus cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nIt comes after pub gardens, non-essential shops and hairdressers reopened in England. \nNorthern Ireland's \"stay at home\" order also ended on Monday, while in Wales non-essential shops and close-contact services reopened. \nIn Scotland, non-essential shops and hospitality are not due to open until 26 April. \nMeanwhile, surge testing has been implemented in the Wandsworth and Lambeth areas of south London after a cluster of the South African Covid-19 variant was found. \nThe Department of Health and Social Care called it the \"largest surge testing operation to date\" following the identification of 44 confirmed and 30 probable cases."

I would have thought that when we opened the door, that there would be nothing around us except that roof,\" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\"We are a small town. Half of it has been flattened.\"\nWeather authorities said Cyclone Seroja had maintained \"uncommon\" pace and strength throughout Sunday night, as it moved from Kalbarri and Geraldton on the coast, and inland across the state's Wheat Belt. \nEmergency services said about 70% of structures in Kalbarri, which is home to about 1,500 people, were damaged by the cyclone. Several towns in the state's south-east remain under \"red alert\" on Monday, meaning residents were advised to take shelter, and thousands of homes were left without power.\nOne Kalbarri resident told the West Australian newspaper that he was forced to hide in a pantry with his pregnant wife and their dog.\n\"I heard a few windows smash and some loud bangs. I went upstairs to check and felt that it was raining. I didn't look up but I am guessing I have lost some of my roof,\" Jason Regan said.\nDarius Winterfield, a reporter for Channel 9 news in Kalbarri, lost the roof to his balcony and said the storm would be \"devastating for many come first light\". \nEmergency services received 175 calls for help on Monday, a Department of Fire and Emergency Services spokeswoman told the BBC.\nGovernment emergency funding is being offered to affected residents.\nBefore the storm hit, state Premier Mark McGowan warned that the cyclone was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades\". The Bureau of Meteorology said it was the first cyclone to hit some affected areas since 1956.\nLast month, areas of eastern Australia were evacuated as rivers and dams overflowed in the worst floods in decades, with around 18,000 people displaced."

      "text": "The Caribbean island of St Vincent is likely to see further volcanic eruptions and ash fall over the coming days, experts have warned. \nThe La Soufri\u00e8re volcano first erupted on Friday, blanketing the island in a layer of ash and forcing more than 16,000 people to evacuate their homes.\nSmaller explosions continued over the weekend, causing power cuts and disrupting water supplies.\nEmergency officials have described the landscape as a \"battle zone\".\n\"The volcano continues to erupt explosively with the production of copious amounts of ash,\" the University of the West Indies' Seismic Research Center said. \n\"Explosions and accompanying ash fall, of similar or larger magnitude, are likely to continue to occur over the next few days impacting St Vincent and neighbouring islands,\" it warned.\nJune Shipley, who is visiting her family on the island, told the BBC there were widespread fears a larger eruption could be imminent.\n\"We do hear the rumblings of the volcano and we do see the smoke,\" she said. \nWhite-coloured dust has covered buildings and roads around the island, including in its capital Kingstown.\nThe warning to expect further activity at La Soufri\u00e8re followed what officials described as an \"explosive event\" on Sunday.\nThe emergency management organisation Nemo tweeted: \"Massive power outage following another explosive event at La Soufriere Volcano. Lightning, thunder and rumblings.\"\nIt later spoke of \"possible destruction and devastation of communities close to the volcano\", and compared the eruption to that of 1902, the worst in St Vincent's history when more than 1,000 people were killed. \nRhiannon West, who is originally from England, lives in the south-east of St Vincent with her partner and six-month-old baby. She told the BBC about her experience:\nWe stood outside our home on Saturday and watched as the volcano erupted and a huge billowing cloud of ash was sent into the air. It was incredible but also terrifying.\nSince then we've been sheltering indoors with everything closed. \nIt's scary thinking about what we can do to protect the baby from the ash. We've put sheets around the bottom of the doors to make sure none of it gets in.\nWe keep losing electricity, and we've had no running water since Thursday. Our local shop has run out of bottled water, and it's very scary to think we could run out ourselves.\nThis could go on for weeks and neither of us can work because of the power supply issues.\nThe atmosphere is just very eerie. Everything is grey with a thick layer of ash and people are scared that these eruptions could get worse.\nMore people fled their homes on Sunday amid fears of further volcanic activity and ash fall.\nMore than 3,000 people have been staying at government-run shelters around the island. Cruise ships have also been readied to take evacuees to nearby islands.\nSt Lucia, Antigua and Grenada have all offered to open their borders to evacuees. A group of 130 people have already been taken to St Lucia.\nMeanwhile, Nemo urged those remaining on the island to \"be careful on the roads, which have become treacherous as a result of the ash flow\". \nAsh has hardened on the ground after rain showers and many homes are without water and electricity, emergency officials said early on Sunday.\nSome residents said power had been restored later in the day, but several areas are still in the dark.\nPrime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said water supplies to most of the island had been cut off and its airspace closed because of the smoke and thick plumes of volcanic ash moving through the atmosphere. \nHe earlier said that a lot of volcanic ash had fallen over the sea. \"We don't know how much more is going to come out... so far, we have done well in that nobody got injured, nobody is dead.\"\nThe Barbados Defence Force has been deployed to provide humanitarian assistance, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency said.\nThe ash has also spread beyond St Vincent, reaching as far as Barbados which is 120 miles (190 km) to the east. People there have been urged to stay indoors and told to avoid breathing in the ash.\n\"This is to protect yourselves and your family,\" said Chief Medical Officer Kenneth George. \nPeople on the island of St Lucia, which is around 47 miles north of St Vincent, have been warned to expect air quality to be affected, with harmful gases potentially making it harder to breathe for people with conditions such as asthma.\nOne resident of St Lucia, Olivia, told the BBC that she was worried about a possible change in wind direction and ash being carried northwards.\n\"I am terrified of all the effects that are unknown at this point, ash in the middle of a pandemic - no-one is prepared for that,\" she said.\n\"Victoria Hospital has been transformed to become the Respiratory Hospital, and is treating Covid patients\" she said, adding: \"So technically, persons suffering from the effects of ash inhalation would be on the wards with Covid patients.\" \nThe volcano had been dormant since 1979, but in late 2020 it started spewing steam and smoke and making rumbling noises.\nThe first sign that an eruption was imminent came on Thursday evening, when a lava dome became visible on La Soufri\u00e8re.\nJust before 09:00 on Friday (13:00 GMT), seismologists from the University of the West Indies confirmed that an \"explosive eruption\" was under way.\nHow have you been affected by the volcano eruptions?

      "text": "A cheap drug, commonly used to treat asthma, can help people at home recover more quickly from Covid-19, a UK trial has found.\nTwo puffs of budesonide twice a day could benefit many over-50s with early symptoms around the world, said the University of Oxford research team.\nThere are also early signs the drug could reduce hospital admissions.\nThe NHS says it can now be prescribed by GPs to treat Covid on a case-by-case basis.\nAt present, there are few options for treating people with Covid who are not in hospital, apart from paracetamol.\nThis widely-available asthma drug works in the lungs, where coronavirus can do serious damage, and could improve the recovery of at-risk patients who are unwell with Covid at home. \nProf Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said he was \"delighted\" by the trial results so far and added that GPs could prescribe it after \"a shared decision conversation\" with patients.\nProf Mona Bafadhel, a respiratory doctor who was involved in the Oxford-led Principle trial, said the results were \"something we should be excited about\".\n\"We are helping the patient as much as possible, as early as possible - in the community,\" she said.\nEarly in the pandemic, asthma patients were under-represented in severely-ill hospital patients with Covid - and the drugs they took to treat their condition were thought to be the reason.\nThe trial involved more than 1,700 people at high risk of becoming severely ill with Covid-19 - all aged over 50, either with an underlying health condition or aged over 65 with no health problems.\nDuring the first two weeks of experiencing symptoms at home, 751 were given an inhaler containing budesonide to use twice a day.\nThis group recovered from Covid on average three days sooner than another group given normal care, which is advice to rest and take paracetamol, the trial data showed.\nAnd a third of those taking inhaled budesonide recovered within the first 14 days of using it, compared to less than a quarter of those in the other group. \nThere were also early signs that slightly fewer people on the drug were admitted to hospital with Covid (8.5% compared to 10.3%) - but more data is needed before this, or any reduction in deaths from Covid, can be confirmed, the researchers said.\nThese are interim results from the trial up to the end of March, which have not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal.\nFinal results from the trial, which are likely to include more data, are expected at the end of April.\nBudesonide, like other coricosteroids which are breathed into the lungs using an inhaler, \"work at the site of the virus where it is likely to be causing the biggest effect and is widely known to reduce inflammation\", Prof Bafadhel said.\nLab tests suggest the drug also reduces viral replication of the virus.\nAssociate Prof Gail Hayward, a GP and investigator on the trial, said patients at higher risk could be offered the inhaler as part of their treatment on the NHS. One inhaler is thought to cost about \u00a314.\n\"We now have the evidence to treat my patients at home,\" she said.\nA smaller, earlier-stage trial on the drug in February also reported promising results.\nThe Oxford-led Principle trial is the latest UK trial to release positive results in the search for Covid treatments. Last year, a steroid called dexamethasone was found to save lives among the most seriously-ill patients in hospital and a number of other drugs and treatments have also shown promise."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "Scotland's political leaders have paid tribute to Prince Philip after Holyrood was recalled in a special session.\nMSPs held a minute's silence in remembrance of the Duke of Edinburgh, who died on Friday aged 99.\nCampaigning for the Holyrood election on 6 May was suspended, but will resume in full on Tuesday.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the duke had \"led a life of distinction\", offering the \"deepest sympathies\" of the parliament to the Queen.\nFlags outside Holyrood have been flying at half-mast as a mark of respect, while a special session to pay tribute is also being held in the House of Commons.\nScotland's parties were approaching the end of the second full week of campaigning ahead of the election, with several scheduled to launch their manifestos. \nHowever, after campaigns were put on hold, Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh decided to recall MSPs to pay tribute to the duke.\nThis was possible because the parliament was not dissolved for the election as usual, but put into recess so that members could be recalled in the event of any Covid-19 emergency.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs that she had witnesses the strength of the \"true partnership\" between the Queen and Prince Philip while visiting them at Balmoral, and said she \"always enjoyed\" her conversations with the duke.\nShe said: \"I was struck by how different he was in private to the way he was sometimes characterised in public.\n\"He was a thoughtful man, deeply interesting and fiercely intelligent. He was also a serious bookworm, which I am too, so talking about the books we were reading was often for me a real highlight of our conversations.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson added: \"It was clear that not only was he a man of huge practical ability - a decorated and talented naval officer, a qualified pilot, a natural sailor and horseman - he also  had interests and passions that he wanted to use his position to drive forward. \n\"He focused on engineering, research, youth, the outdoors and conservation.\n\"In a life that could so easily have been one shallow wave, a ribbon cut, a couple of public remarks before on to the next engagement, he demonstrated huge commitment to the organisations that he championed.\"\nThis is the sixth time Holyrood has been recalled in its short history but the first occasion MSPs have been brought back during an election campaign. \nThat is only possible because of special pandemic arrangements that mean parliament has not been formally stood down in the usual way and MSPs continue in their roles until 5 May. \nThere were similar tributes from Scottish party leaders when the Queen Mother died in 2002. \nThe Duke of Edinburgh was a regular visitor to Holyrood, attending the royal openings of each session with the Queen whose royal palace is next door to parliament. \nElection campaigning has been suspended since Friday ahead of an important week in which postal voting begins. Labour has put back its manifesto launch by a week. \nThere was a more prolonged interruption to campaigning in the devolution referendum that set up the Scottish Parliament in 1997 following the death of Princess Diana. \nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said Prince Philip was an \"extraordinary public servant\", paying particular tribute to the impact of the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.\nHe added: \"This is hard for anyone, no matter how many years have been shared - the Queen has lost her beloved husband after spending more than 70 years together.\n\"I can't even begin to imagine how that must feel, and my thoughts and prayers are with her majesty.\"\nScottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said his party had considered whether to take part in the event, given they want to replace the monarchy with an elected head of state.\nHowever, he said \"respect and compassion\" were due in times of loss, offering his \"sincere condolences\" to the duke's family.\nAnd Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Prince Philip had \"left lasting impressions with so many\", with many \"fun and memorable\" memories.\nHe added: \"For so many he has been part of a family that has provided comfort and stability in what can be a turbulent and intimidating world.\""

      "title": "Baroness Shirley Williams: Former cabinet minister dies aged 90",
      "text": "Veteran politician and Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Shirley Williams has died at the age of 90, the party has announced.\nShe was hailed as a \"Liberal lion and a true trailblazer\" by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey.\nOriginally a Labour MP, she was part of the \"Gang of Four\" who quit the party to found the Social Democratic Party.\nShe was a leading member of the 1970s Labour government and one of the first women cabinet ministers.\nShe later went on to support the SDP's merger with the Liberal Party, which led to the creation of the Liberal Democrats in the late 1980s. \nHer career in politics spanned more than 50 years, after she first entered Parliament as the Labour MP for Hitchin in 1964. \nShe retired from political life in 2016, after leading the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords. \nThe Lib Dems said she died peacefully in the early hours of Monday. \nSir Ed said she had been an \"inspiration to millions,\" and news of her death was \"heartbreaking for me and for our whole Liberal Democrat family\".\n\"Political life will be poorer without her intellect, her wisdom and her generosity,\" he added. \n\"Shirley had a limitless empathy only too rare in politics today; she connected with people, cared about their lives and saw politics as a crucial tool to change lives for the better.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described her as \"a kind and thoughtful member of the once radical centre left\". \n\"Even when we disagreed - as we often did - she had the gift of sounding so completely reasonable at all times.\n\"I spent many happy hours sparring with her on Question Time. She will be much missed.\" \nBaroness Williams served in several ministerial roles under the premiership of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, before landing her first cabinet job in 1974 as the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection. \nWhen Wilson resigned as Labour leader in 1976 his successor, Jim Callaghan, made her Secretary of State for Education and Science.\nShe lost her seat in the 1979 election when Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher came to power following the so-called Winter of Discontent.\nAfter this, she found herself increasingly out of step with the Labour Party on issues including defence and her support for the UK's membership of the European Union.\nShe later quit the party in 1981 - and with leading Labour lights Bill Rodgers, Roy Jenkins and David Owen formed the \"Gang of Four\" which founded the Social Democratic Party.\nWith growing support, the SDP went on to secure 25% of the vote at the 1983 general election, as part of an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party. \nThis only delivered 23 MPs for the fledgling alliance, but then-Labour leader Michael Foot blamed it for reducing his party's share of the vote and giving Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives another term in government.\nThe Alliance fought the 1987 election, but failed to boost its representation in the Commons - with almost 23% of the vote amounting to just 22 MPs.\nLord Steel, who led the Liberal Party during the Alliance, said Baroness Williams was a \"key figure\" in helping it come close to breaking the two-party mould in British politics. \n\"She was a very, very popular person - much more popular than any of the rest of us,\" he told BBC News. \nHe added that she was a \"tremendous public inspirer and communicator, and a real humanitarian\". \nIt was decided in 1988 that the SDP and the Liberal Party should merge, leading to the formation of the Liberal Democrats in October 1989.\nSir Nick Clegg, who stood down as Lib Dem leader after the 2015 election, said he would \"forever be grateful for the support, candid advice and generosity\" Baroness Williams showed him during his time in charge of the party. \n\"Her warmth, commitment to progressive ideals and, above all, her wisdom were a constant inspiration down the years to so many,\" he added.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Baroness Williams had been \"widely respected across politics and was a tireless champion for the causes she believed in\"."

      "tags": "The Troubles,Northern Ireland Assembly",
      "text": "Stormont's Executive Office has formally pledged to pay for a Troubles pension scheme, a court has been told.\nThe Department of Finance will make the necessary funding available to ensure eligible victims and survivors receive compensation.\nThe move was expected after agreement was reached earlier this month on this coming year's budget.\nThe estimated outlay for the scheme, over the next 20 years, could be up to \u00a31.2bn.\nBelfast High Court had been hearing a case brought by Brian Turley, one of those known as the Hooded Men, who were detained and subjected to special interrogation methods by the British military in the early 1970s.\nHe brought the case seeking a judgement to ensure a financial package was put in place.\nIn correspondence to the High Court, the Department of Finance has guaranteed payments will be made.\nA letter sent on behalf of the Executive Office stated that \"the payment is an entitlement as indicated by the court, and regardless of whether it comes from Westminster or from our block grant, it will be paid when it is due\". \nIt added that First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Finance Minister Conor Murphy \"undertake on behalf of their respective departments that payments will be made to successful applicants\".\nWhen the Department of Justice requests funding, the Executive Office is to be provided with the required money by the Department of Finance \"without delay\".\n\"The Executive Office will then, on receipt of such funding, make the necessary grants to the Department of Justice in response to its requests for funding,\" the letter stated.\nDiscussions between Stormont and the Northern Ireland Office are continuing over whether there will be any additional funding from London to help foot costs.\nThe letter added: \"Ministers will continue to progress financial discussions with the Northern Ireland Office on the basis that it remains their shared view that the scheme should be funded by the Westminster government as an addition to the block grant, and in a manner consistent with the Statement of Funding Policy.\"\nLord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan agreed that a \"satisfactory\" undertaking had been received by the court.\nFormer NI secretary Julian Smith described the move as \"very good news\" and said the executive \"ultimately took the right decision\".\nThe court undertaking provides certainty to the thousands who will apply for a pension.\nThere was inevitability about what has just happened because earlier this year the court ruled that Stormont was liable for the scheme,\nPolitical agreement of the 2021-22 Stormont budget also paved the way for Monday's undertaking.\nBut it does not settle a behind-the-scenes dispute between Belfast and London.\nSome NI ministers have questioned the pension's affordability without extra cash coming from the British government.\nNegotiations continue over Stormont's request for additional cash outside the block grant to help foot the bill.\nThousands of people who were physically or mentally injured on a permanent basis will apply for sums of up to \u00a310,000 a year.\nThe Troubles claimed more than 3,500 lives and the Northern Ireland Office has estimated another 40,000 people were injured.\nThe pensions scheme was drawn up in 2019 by the UK government, when the Stormont assembly was not functioning.\nThe scheme aims to provide pension-like payments to victims of the Troubles, every year for the rest of their lives, with payments ranging from \u00a32,000 to \u00a310,000.\nUpon their death, a spouse or carer will get the payments for a further 10 years.\nVictims will be eligible to apply if they were injured in an incident at any point between 1 January 1966 and 12 April 2010, the date that responsibility for policing and justice was devolved to Stormont.\nThat can be physical injury, such as a loss of limbs, or psychological, caused by being present at a bombing, for example.\nThe scheme will also be open to those injured in incidents that took place outside Northern Ireland.\nThe pensions will be backdated to 2014 - the date when they were first agreed, in principle, by the Stormont parties under the Fresh Start Agreement.\nOlder victims, over the age of 60, may opt to receive a lump sum rather than annual payments.\nA judge-led board will decide who qualifies for the scheme, with the government insisting it would only apply to people who were injured \"through no fault of their own\".\nAlan McBride of the Wave Trauma Centre, whose wife Sharon was killed in the 1993 IRA Shankill bomb, said the campaign for the pension started 13 years ago. \n\"The uncertainty that surrounded this pension was increasing the trauma for people that have been campaigning for this,\" he said.\n\"We've lost about four or five members in that time through ill health and old age, so to have this over the line is a really, really good news story.\"\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said it was a \"very welcome day\" for those set to benefit from the pension, adding that \"the uncertainty for victims is now over\".\n\"It has been a deeply frustrating journey towards this point, but I welcome that we have finally achieved agreement to confirm that the pension will be paid when it falls due to recipients,\" she said. \nUlster Unionist Doug Beattie said the negotiations for extra cash may continue but \"injured victims should not be punished any longer\".  \n\"The executive must move immediately to provide certainty around application and payment dates, as well as how those who have waited longest might be prioritised within the scheme,\" he said. \nSDLP MLA Dolores Kelly welcomed the news but said that there would be many victims and survivors who \"will be wary of accepting the words of politicians\".\n\"People who have suffered severe physical and mental injury over the course of conflict here have waited for far too long for recognition and redress,\" she said, adding that the first and deputy first ministers must now set out what will happen next."

      "tags": "Asia,China,Alibaba",
      "text": "Chinese tech giant Alibaba said on Monday that it accepted a record penalty imposed by the country's anti-monopoly regulator. \nRegulators slapped a $2.8bn fine after a probe determined that it had abused its market position for years. \nThe fine amounts to about 4% of the company's 2019 domestic revenue.\nAlibaba Group's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai indicated that regulators have taken an interest in platforms like Alibaba as they grow in importance.\n\"We're happy to get the matter behind us, but the tendency is that regulators will be keen to look at some of the areas where you might have unfair competition,\" he told an investor call on Monday. \nThe company added that it was not aware of any further anti-monopoly investigations by Chinese regulators, though it signalled that Alibaba and its competitors would remain under review in China over mergers and acquisitions.\nThe main issue for regulators was that Alibaba restricted merchants from doing business or running promotions on rival platforms. \nThe company said it would introduce measures to lower entry barriers and business costs faced by merchants on e-commerce platforms. \n\"With this penalty decision we've received good guidance on some of the specific issues under the anti-monopoly law,\" Mr Tsai said.  \nThe group does not expect any material impact on its business from the change of exclusivity arrangements imposed by regulators.\nThe message from Alibaba today in its investor call was: we may be the biggest and the first Chinese tech firm to attract regulators' attention - but we are by no means the last. \nAlibaba executives sought to reassure investors that they are playing ball with the regulators. They're going to make it cheaper for businesses to sell on their platform, and not force them to pick and choose between platforms - a practice seen by some in the industry as a case of \"it's my way or the highway\". \nSo far, Alibaba says, the discussions with regulators have been amicable, and the statement from the firm on accepting the penalty is markedly contrite. \nIt may also be heaving a sigh of relief. The 4% of 2019 revenue penalty is a record fine, but for Alibaba, which has a huge war chest, it's a drop in the ocean. \nBut there will be more oversight and scrutiny of it and other firms. \nThe e-commerce giant indicated that while for now Alibaba is in the clear in terms of future investigations, the same could not be said for other firms in this sector. \nChinese tech firms are a powerful force in the country, and Beijing is keen to regulate them. Alibaba's experience is a sign of more of the same to come.\nThe penalty is the latest in a chain of events targeting the company that kicked off last October, after its co-founder Jack Ma criticised regulators, suggesting they were stifling innovation. \nShortly after the speech, Chinese regulators scuppered the share market launch of Ant Group, which is Alibaba's sister company and China's biggest electronic payments provider. \nHowever, some commentators noted that regulators had legitimate concerns about Ant Group's consumer finance arm. \nAnt Group was expected to be last year's biggest share market launch on the Hong Kong exchange. \nBut Alibaba isn't the only Chinese company to come under scrutiny by China's increasingly assertive regulators. \nLast month, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it had fined 12 companies over 10 deals that violated anti-monopoly rules.\nThe companies included Tencent, Baidu and Didi Chuxing - which are among China's largest tech companies.

      "tags": "Department of Health & Social Care,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "An update to England and Wales's contact tracing app has been blocked for breaking the terms of an agreement made with Apple and Google.\nThe plan had been to ask users to upload logs of venue check-ins - carried out via poster barcode scans - if they tested positive for the virus. This could be used to warn others.\nThe update had been timed to coincide with the relaxation of lockdown rules.\nBut the two firms had explicitly banned such a function from the start.\nUnder the terms that all health authorities signed up to in order to use Apple and Google's privacy-centric contact-tracing tech, they had to agree not to collect any location data via the software. \nAs a result, Apple and Google refused to make the update available for download from their app stores last week, and have instead kept the old version live.\nWhen questioned, the Department of Health declined to discuss how this misstep had occurred.\nScotland has avoided this pitfall because it released a separate product - Check In Scotland - to share venue histories, rather than trying to build the functionality into its Protect Scotland contact-tracing app.\nNHS Covid-19's users have long been able to scan a QR code when entering a shop, restaurant or other venue to log within the app the fact that they had visited.\nBut this data has never been accessible to others.\nInstead, it has only come into use if local authorities have identified a location as being a virus hotspot by other means, and flagged the fact to a central database.\nSince each phone regularly checks the database for a match, it can alert the owner if they need to take action as a consequence, without sharing the information with others.\nHowever, this facility has rarely been used, in part because prior to the most recent lockdown, many local authorities were confused about what they were supposed to do.\nBefore shops reopened in England and Wales on Monday, along with outdoor hospitality venues in England, the intention had been to automate the process.\nThis would have involved users who had tested positive being asked if they were willing to upload their logs.\nDepending on the thresholds set - for example, how many infected users registered having visited the same place on the same day - other app users would then have  been told to either monitor their symptoms or immediately get a test, whether they felt ill or not.\nThe Department of Health had described this as being a \"privacy-protecting\" approach.\nBut despite being opt-in, it was still a clear breach of the terms that health chiefs had agreed to when they switched to adopting Apple and Google's contact tracing API (application programming interface) in June 2020. This was after their original effort was found to miss too many potential cases of contagion.\nThe tech firms' Exposure Notifications System FAQ states that apps involved must \"not share location data from the user's device with the public health authority, Apple, or Google\".\nAnd a separate document covering the terms and conditions in more detail says that \"a contact tracing app may not use location-based APIs... and may not collect any device information to identify the precise location of users\".\nHad Apple and Google made an exception for England and Wales in this case, it could have set a precedent for other countries to have sought changes of their own.\nThe team behind the app was told not to disclose why the update had failed to be released on schedule.\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Health told the BBC: \"The deployment of the functionality of the NHS Covid-19 app to enable users to upload their venue history has been delayed.\n\"This does not impact the functionality of the app and we remain in discussions with our partners to provide beneficial updates to the app which protect the public.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Welsh government said it had nothing to add.\nApple has indicated it wants to work out a solution.\nJust a week ago, the Department of Health seemed to think this update to the app would go through without problems. \nIt's hard to understand why. After all, the rules for using the Apple-Google Exposure Notification System were clear -  collecting any location data was a no-no. \nThe app team knew that when they switched to it last summer, having discovered that going it alone with their own system was just not practical. \nBut they may have assumed that, because the sharing of locations by users was optional, the tech giants might show some flexibility. \nInstead, Apple and Google have insisted that rules are rules. \nWhat this underlines is that governments around the world have been forced to frame part of their response to the global pandemic according to rules set down by giant unelected corporations.  \nAt a time when the power of the tech giants is under the microscope as never before, that will leave many people feeling uncomfortable."

To protect their ability to legislate/act in ways that breach children's rights in Scotland.\n\"Politically catastrophic, but also morally repugnant.\"\nBut a UK government source said: \"This delay to the legislation could easily have been avoided. \n\"Sadly, it appears the Scottish government are more interested in stirring a constitutional row than getting the UNCRC bill into law at the first opportunity.\"\nA UK government spokesman said: \"The UK government law officers' concerns are not about the substance of the legislation, rather whether parts are outwith the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament.\"\nTo challenge the scope of Holyrood's law-making powers in the middle of an election campaign is a politically explosive decision by the UK government.\nThe timing was not entirely in their gift because the Scottish Parliament's decision to pass the two bills last month created a four-week window for them to consider action.\nOne UK government source told me the legal challenge was \"regrettable\" but \"avoidable\" if the Scottish government had listened to their concerns and made some changes.\nThe UK government insists it has no objection to the policy content of the bills, only to their potential to limit UK decision making in Scotland - which would be beyond Holyrood's powers. \nAn SNP source said changes were not required because the bills had passed the scrutiny of both Scottish government and Scottish Parliament lawyers.\nEach side accuses the other of picking this fight. It will now be for the UK Supreme Court to settle - a process that will put the legislation on hold and fuel the constitutional debate in the Holyrood election campaign. "

      "text": "Will Smith's slavery film Emancipation has pulled out of filming in Georgia over what the star has called the US state's new \"regressive voting laws\".\nIn a statement issued to Deadline by Smith and director Antoine Fuqua, the pair said they felt \"compelled\" to act. \n\"We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access.\"\nSome feel the new law will restrict voting by disadvantaged groups.\nDeadline said the move by the Emancipation producers comes after weeks of discussions between the filmmakers, film officials and Georgia political leaders, including voting rights activist Stacey Abrams. \nIt is the first film to pull out of the state since the new laws came into effect - but others could follow suit.\nDirector James Mangold, who will helm the new Indiana Jones movie, recently said he would not make any new movies in Georgia because of the new law.\n\"Georgia has been using cash to steal movie jobs from other states that allow people to vote,\" he tweeted. \"I don't want to play there\".\nStar Wars actor Mark Hamill endorsed Mangold's tweet with hashtag #NoMoreFilminginGeorgia. \nAccording to Georgia's film commission, more top-grossing movies are shot there \"than anywhere else in the world\" - with recent productions including Deadpool, Avengers: Endgame, Wandavision, Stranger Things and The Walking Dead. \nFilm and TV production now generates more than $10bn (\u00a37,2bn) for the state each year - and Abrams, who opposes the new laws, has urged Hollywood not to move away en masse.\nMartin Luther King Jr's daughter, Bernice King, has also asked film-makers to reconsider. \"Please stop the #BoycottGeorgia talk,\" she said. \"That would hurt middle class workers and people grappling with poverty. And it would increase the harm of both racism and classism.\"\nIn future elections, ID will be required for anyone requesting a mail-in ballot. \nProponents of the bill say this method will make postal voting more secure, but critics argue the new measures are likely to disproportionately affect black Americans, who are less likely than white Americans to have voter identification \nThe law also prohibits anyone except poll workers from handing out food or water to people queuing outside polling stations - and there will be a limit on the number of \"drop boxes\" in which people can place their absentee votes, meaning many will have to travel further. \nThe early voting period for all run-off elections - in Georgia, no candidate can advance through a primary or a general election system without first earning more than 50 percent of the votes - will also be shortened.\nPresident Joe Biden has described the move as an \"atrocity\", saying it disproportionately targeted black Americans.\nThe president called the law \"Jim Crow in the 21st Century\" and \"a blatant attack on the Constitution\".\nJim Crow refers to the 19th and 20th Century laws that enforced racial segregation in the South.\nBut Republicans say they are streamlining voting procedures and trying to restore confidence in the election system.\nEmancipation sees Smith playing Peter, a slave who flees a plantation in Louisiana after being subjected to terrible abuse. \nHe takes the treacherous journey north and joins the Union army during the American Civil War.\nThe film is based on a true story - a photo of Peter's back was taken during an army medical examination and showed his whipping scars. \nThe photo was published in 1863 and was seen around the world, giving impetus to abolitionists and prompting many free black people to join the Union army.  \nFilming was due to start in June."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,China",
      "text": "China's top disease control official has said the efficacy of the country's Covid vaccines is low, in a rare admission of weakness. \nIn a press conference, Gao Fu added that China was considering mixing vaccines as a way of boosting efficacy. \nChina has developed four different vaccines approved for public use, though some trials abroad had suggested efficacy as low as 50%. \nMr Gao later said his comments had been misinterpreted. \nMore than 100 million people in China have received at least one shot of the vaccine. \nBeijing has insisted the jabs are effective and said in March that obtaining visas would be easier for foreigners who have received a Chinese vaccine. \nGao Fu, head of the Chinese Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, on Saturday said at a conference the current vaccines \"don't have very high rates of protection\".\nHe suggested that the China was considering mixing Covid-19 vaccines, as a way of boosting efficacy. \nMr Gao explained that steps to \"optimise\" the vaccine process could include changing the number of doses and the length of time. He also suggested combining different vaccines for the immunisation process. \nBut he later appeared to backtrack on his comments, telling state media Global Times that \"protection rates of all vaccines in the world are sometimes high, and sometimes low\". \n\"How to improve their efficacy is a question that needs to be considered by scientists around the world,\" he told the paper. \nHe added that his earlier admission that Chinese vaccines had a low protection rate were a \"complete misunderstanding\". \nMr Gao's original and later comments have been largely unreported by Chinese media. \nHis original comments however, attracted some criticism on social media site Weibo, with commenters suggesting that he should \"stop talking\". \nWith little data released internationally, the effectiveness of the various Chinese vaccines has long been uncertain. \nBrazilian trials of the Sinovac vaccine CoronaVac for instance, showed an efficacy rate of around 50.4%, which is barely over the 50% threshold needed for regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO). \nInterim results from late-stage trials in Turkey and Indonesia however, had suggested the efficacy rate of the Sinovac shot to be between 91% and 65%. \nWestern vaccines like the ones by BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna have an efficacy rate of around 90% or higher while the UK's AstraZeneca jab is thought to be around 76%.\nSo far, Sinovac's CoronaVac jab has only been fully authorised for use by China.\nBut Beijing is also offering its vaccines around the world and has already shipped millions of doses to a number of countries.\nIn Asia, the biggest takers are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan, while in the Americas, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador have also ordered millions of shot. \nIn Europe, Turkey and Ukraine have signed large contracts for CoronaVac. \nThe vaccine is thought to be particularly important for African countries where so far Zimbabwe, Somalia, Djibouti, Benin and Tunisia have received vaccines from China. \nChina's vaccines though differ significantly from some vaccines, especially those developed by Pfizer and Moderna. \nDeveloped in a more traditional way, they are so-called inactivated vaccines which means they use killed viral particles to expose the immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response.\nBy comparison, the BioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus' genetic code is injected into the body, training the immune system how to respond.\nThe UK's AstraZeneca vaccine is yet another type of vaccine where a version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees is modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus. Once injected, it teaches the immune system how to fight the real virus.\nOne significant advantage of the Chinese vaccines is that they can be stored in standard refrigerators at 2-8 degrees Celsius. Moderna's vaccine needs to be stored at -20C and Pfizer's vaccine at -70C.\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine though can also be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures."

I want all children to have the same chances.\"\nCowell said that pre-pandemic, literacy was \"already a huge problem\" with disadvantaged children being 11 months behind at school.\n\"Post-pandemic, that figure is set to get worse,\" she added.\nIn a statement, Cowell wrote: \"How can a child become a reader for pleasure if their parents or carers cannot afford books, and their primary school has no library, or that library is woefully insufficient?\"\nEarlier this month, Boris Johnson spoke about his concern for thousands of children in the UK who have fallen behind because of lost learning during the pandemic. \nCowell's flagship project during her two-year tenure as Children's Laureate is called \"Life-changing Libraries\".\nOver the course of a year, six primary schools across England - all of which have at least 25% of pupils eligible for free school meals - will be helped to develop a reading for pleasure culture, with the support of Cowell and the charity BookTrust.\nEach school will have a bespoke library space built, with building work set to begin in April ahead of officially opening in June 2021.\nProfessional training will be offered to school staff, and books and other resources will be given including furniture and wall art.\nThe project will monitor the impact on pupils' engagement, attitudes and reading behaviour across 12 months - collecting qualitative stories and case studies.\nCowell said these libraries would be \"like a gold standard... the library that I would really love every school in the country to have\".\nThe schools involved in the project are as follows:\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The mother of a Cambridge graduate killed in a terror attack in central London in 2019 has told an inquest that her son's death \"was a tragedy, but his life was a triumph\".\nConvicted terrorist Usman Khan stabbed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones at a prisoner rehabilitation conference at Fishmongers' Hall on 29 November.\nHe injured two others before he was shot dead by police on London Bridge.\nThe inquest at London's Guildhall is due to last nine weeks.\nAfter a jury was sworn in, Anne Merritt said her 25-year-old son was a \"force for good in the world\" and had a \"strong moral compass\".\nFriends from Cambridge University, where he worked for the criminal justice charity Learning Together, said he was \"absorbingly intelligent\" and \"fiercely loyal\".\nShe told jurors: \"Jack Merritt was a good person. Jack was a force for good in the world, someone who made other people's lives better for knowing him.\n\"We are hugely proud of who Jack was and what he stood for. His death was a tragedy but his life was a triumph.\"\nShe read tributes from friends and family, who described him as a \"true visionary\", a \"very cool brother\" and a \"fiercely loyal\" friend who \"championed the underdog\".\nFriends from Manchester University, where Mr Merritt studied, said: \"It was clear that Jack was intelligent, but when we started to study miscarriages of justice in further detail, it became clear how strongly Jack felt about criminal justice.\"\nThe family of Ms Jones, from Stratford-upon-Avon, described her as someone with a \"private nature\".\nIn a statement read by Henry Pitchers QC, the family said they chose not to provide a full portrait of the 23-year-old at the inquest.\n\"They believe that she would wish the focus of the coroner and the jury to be on the facts and evidence before them and for the emphasis to be on a thorough investigation as to how she came to lose her life,\" the statement continued.\n\"It would be her hope that no other family is devastated and heartbroken again in similar circumstances.\n\"It is very important to the family that Saskia's legacy should not solely be based on her work with Learning Together as she was about so much more than just that. \n\"She should be defined as someone who battled to improve the lives of others in several spheres and was driven to make real changes in the world.\"\nThe family statement said Ms Jones did \"incredible research in the field of sexual violence and Rape Crisis\".\n\"Her passion in this area enabled her to finally find her career path with the hope of becoming a detective in victim support within a police force,\" the family added.\n\"The grief and loss that the family and friends of Saskia continue to endure is personal to them and it is their wish that it remains so.\"\nAs the inquest got under way Det Ch Insp Dan Brown chronicled the attack in a series of photographs and videos.\nFootage from shortly before midday showed 28-year-old Khan talking \"animatedly\" with Ms Jones at a table, even though they had not known each other.\nA 13:56 GMT he launched his attack in the men's toilets at Fishmongers' Hall, strapping two knives on to his hands, leaving a bag containing a third blade in a cubicle and dropping a prayer book on the floor.\nHe came across Mr Merritt, stabbing him multiple times, causing 12 injuries including a fatal wound to the chest, the court heard.\nKhan made his way to the cloakroom area, where he gestured to a member of staff \"as if to be quiet\",  Det Ch Insp Brown said.\nMs Jones was stabbed once in the neck and staggered up a few steps before she collapsed, jurors heard.\nKhan went on to injure Stephanie Szczotko and Isobel Rowbotham before he was confronted by a number of attendees with makeshift weapons, including an ornamental pike taken from the wall.\nThe attacker approached a member of staff, held a knife to his chest and asked him to open the door, which he did, the court was told.\nKhan was pursued on to London Bridge by John Crilly, Steven Gallant and Darryn Frost at 14:01, jurors were told.\nMr Crilly sprayed a fire extinguisher at him and Mr Frost jabbed at him with a narwhal tusk before they all tackled Khan to the ground with other members of the public.\nPolice had been called at 13:58 and armed City of London Police officers arrived at 14:02.\nDet Ch Insp Brown said Khan appeared to be wearing an improvised explosive device (IED) strapped around his midriff and people were told stand clear.\nKhan was then shot and Tasered by police but still appeared to present a threat as he writhed on the floor wearing the suspected IED, Mr Brown said.\nBy 14:12 Khan was dead.\nAn examination of the device later revealed it was not genuine, the court heard.\nThe hearing is expected to be followed by a separate jury inquest into the death of Khan."

      "text": "The G7 group of wealthy nations must lead a \"Herculean mobilisation\" to push for global mass vaccination against Covid, former PM Gordon Brown has said.\nWriting in the Guardian, Mr Brown said \u00a322bn was needed to ensure yearly vaccinations for lower income countries until Covid no longer claims lives.\nThe next G7 summit is due to take place in the UK in June.\nThe UK government said millions of doses had been sent to developing countries under the Covax scheme.\nThe Covax programme, run by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international groups, aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor.\nThe scheme is expected to provide enough jabs to cover more than a quarter of the developing world by the end of this year, but less than 1% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa has been immunised so far, Mr Brown said.\n\"Immunising the west but only a fraction of the developing world is already fuelling allegations of 'vaccine apartheid', and will leave Covid-19 spreading, mutating and threatening the lives and livelihoods of us all for years to come,\" he wrote.\nThe G7 is made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and the European Union.\nMr Brown said there was an urgent need for greater action and warned against \"unpredictable funding\" and \"erratic patterns of giving\".\n\"We need to spend now to save lives, and we need to spend tomorrow to carry on vaccinating each year until the disease no longer claims lives,\" the former Labour leader said.\nDeliveries of vaccine supplies under the Covax programme started in February, but there have been criticisms that it has not moved quickly enough.\nSo far, more than 38 million doses have been delivered to around 100 countries under the scheme.\nThe WHO has criticised the \"shocking imbalance\" in the distribution of coronavirus vaccines between wealthier and poorer nations.\nMr Brown said if G7 members commit to funding 60% of the vaccination fund, other wealthy countries will likely follow.\nThe money needed is a \"fraction of the trillions\" the pandemic is costing, Mr Brown added.\nHe said that if wealthy nations could mobilise the same moral force and urgency that inspired Live Aid in the 1980s and Make Poverty History in 2005, \"we can end our reliance on the begging bowl\" and establish global systems to deal with the pandemic.\nHowever, international aid commitments have been cut in the last year as economies struggle to recover from the impact of the pandemic.\nThe UK government has come under fire for its decision to reduce foreign aid from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% - a move that would save about \u00a34bn a year.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We recognise this is a global crisis requiring global solutions, which is why the UK has been a leading donor to the Covax procurement pool for vaccines. \n\"Millions of doses have been sent to developing countries through the Covax scheme already. With our G7 partners, we will intensify our cooperation on the health response to Covid-19, including the acceleration of global vaccine development and deployment.\""

Current ministers should not be entertaining such lobbying.\" \n\"It simply brings public service into disrepute,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nHe suggested that if the existing rules cannot be made to work, new laws should be passed to stop former ministers lobbying for five years after leaving office.\nLabour has said \"many serious questions remain unanswered\" after Mr Cameron's statement and he should be quizzed in Parliament. \nIt follows a series of newspaper reports over Mr Cameron's lobbying on behalf of Greensill Capital, where he began working as an adviser in August 2018, two years after he left No 10. \nThe firm was founded by Australian financier Lex Greensill, who worked as an unpaid adviser to Mr Cameron's government. \nThe reports revealed that Mr Cameron had texted Chancellor Rishi Sunak and other Treasury ministers over access to government-backed emergency loans during the Covid pandemic. \nMr Cameron said he had been trying to involve Greensill Capital in the government's CCFF (Covid Corporate Financing Facility) initiative, launched at the start of the crisis. \nMr Cameron rejected calls to comment on the affair until Sunday, when he released a statement to the media.\nIn it, Mr Cameron said he believed it had been \"right\" for him to contact government on behalf of Greensill Capital, as it was \"involved in financing a large number of UK firms\" at a time of \"crisis for the UK economy\".\nBut he said he understood the \"concern\" caused by how he had chosen to make contact with government figures. \n\"There are important lessons to be learnt,\" he added. \n\"As a former prime minister, I accept that communications with government need to be done through only the most formal of channels, so there can be no room for misinterpretation.\"\nFor three weeks the headlines kept coming. For three weeks David Cameron said nothing.\nAnd now this - the former prime minister admits he made a dud judgement call.\nForget the rules; this is about the sniff test. Does it smell bad? Does it feel right?\nPlenty had been saying no it doesn't, and now David Cameron appears to agree.\nIt's a lengthy statement from him, worthy of detailed examination.\nBut it boils down to this: he acknowledges texting and ringing the chancellor and going for a private drink with the health secretary, as part of his paid work for a private company, was a bad idea.\nThere's another point worth making too: journalism matters.\nThe work of the Financial Times and the Sunday Times, ferreting out awkward truths, is what has prompted this.\nIn his statement, Mr Cameron added: \"In my representations to government, I was breaking no codes of conduct and no government rules.\"\nHe said that his suggestions about Greensill and the CCFF scheme were ultimately \"not taken up\". \nHe also said he had had \"very little to do\" with Lex Greensill during the financier's time working as a government adviser. \nHe added that Mr Greensill had been brought in as a government adviser by then-Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, in 2011.\n\"As I recall, I met him twice at most in the entirety of my time as prime minister,\" he added. \n\"The idea of my working for Greensill was never raised, or considered by me, until well after I left office,\" he added. \nThe company recently collapsed, with the loss of 440 jobs.\nSenior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs Parliament's Liaison Committee, said the lobbying row had revealed a \"very casual\" culture in the relationship between those at the top of government and business.\n\"This is pretty devastating, this is pretty corrosive,\" he told the Today programme. \nHe added: \"I am not going to pass judgment on David Cameron, I think in some respects it's a distraction.\n\"What is more important is not who is lobbying, and even if you have a five-year ban as suggested by Gordon Brown, is it OK for an ex-prime minister to start lobbying after six years?\n\"You can't make laws stretch far into the future to bind people to previous employment, it just doesn't work.\"\nLabour's Rachel Reeves said: \"The events unfolding over the last few weeks stretch across government and affect thousands of people.\n\"Transparency and accountability are crucial and that requires the utmost openness from government to establish the full facts behind this scandal.\""

The footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on African-American Mr Floyd's neck during an arrest sparked global protests against racism.\nLt Nazario, who is Black and Latino, was in uniform and driving with a temporary paper licence plate on his back window on 5 December, when he was told to pull over in the town of Windsor. He then stopped at a petrol station and kept his hands outside the window, while asking the policemen why he was being stopped.\nAttorney Jonathan Arthur, who is representing Lt Nazario in the lawsuit, said that the army officer knew it was vital he kept his hands on show.\n\"To unbuckle his seatbelt, to do anything, any misstep - he was afraid that they were going to kill him,\" Mr Arthur told CBS.\nThe suit filed by Lt Nazario says that Mr Gutierrez acknowledged why the army officer had waited to pull over in a lighted area. \n\"I get it, the media spewing race relations between law enforcement and minorities. I get it,\" the policeman said, according to the suit. "

      "tags": "Israel,Iran,Iran nuclear deal",
      "text": "A nuclear facility in Iran was hit by \"sabotage\" a day after it unveiled new uranium enrichment equipment, the country's top nuclear official says.\nAli Akbar Salehi did not say who was to blame for the \"terrorist act\", which caused a power failure at the Natanz complex south of Tehran on Sunday.\nIsraeli public media, however, cited intelligence sources who said it was the result of an Israeli cyber-attack.\nIsrael has not commented on the incident directly.\nBut in recent days it has ramped up its warnings about Iran's nuclear programme. \nThe latest incident comes as diplomatic efforts to revive a 2015 nuclear deal - abandoned by the US under the Trump administration in 2018 - have resumed.\nOn Saturday, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani inaugurated new centrifuges at the Natanz site in a ceremony that was broadcast live on television. Centrifuges are devices needed to produce enriched uranium, which can be used to make reactor fuel as well as nuclear weapons.\nIt represented another breach of the country's undertakings in the 2015 deal, which only permits Iran to produce and store limited quantities of enriched uranium to be used to produce fuel for commercial power plants.\nOn Sunday, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI), Behrouz Kamalvandi, said an \"incident\" had occurred in the morning involving the nuclear facility's power network. \nMr Kamalvandi did not provide further details but told Iran's Fars news agency there there had been \"no casualties or leaks\". \nLater state TV read out a statement by AEOI head Ali Akbar Salehi, in which he described the incident as \"sabotage\" and \"nuclear terrorism\".\n\"Condemning this despicable move, the Islamic Republic of Iran emphasises the need for the international community and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to deal with this nuclear terrorism,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\"Iran reserves the right to take action against the perpetrators,\" he added.\nThe IAEA said it was aware of the reports of an incident but would not comment.\nLast July, sabotage was blamed for a fire at the Natanz site which hit a central centrifuge assembly workshop.\nIsraeli public broadcaster Kan, citing unnamed intelligence sources, said the apparent power cut at the facility was caused by an Israeli cyber operation. \nThe Haaretz newspaper also said the incident could be assumed to be an Israeli cyber-attack.\nRon Ben-Yishai, a defence analyst at the Ynet news website, said that with Iran progressing towards nuclear weapons capability it was \"reasonable to assume that the problem... might not have been caused by an accident, but by deliberate sabotage intended to slow the nuclear race accelerated by the negotiations with the US on removing sanctions\".\nLater on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \"the struggle against Iran and its proxies and the Iranian armament efforts is a huge mission\". \n\"The situation that exists today will not necessarily be the situation that will exist tomorrow,\" he added, without referencing the Iran incident directly. \nThe Iranian nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has been in intensive care since Donald Trump pulled the US out of it.\nUnder the Biden administration diplomatic efforts have been redoubled to revive it.\nBut Mr Netanyahu has warned against a return to the deal, and declared last week that Israel would not be bound by a new agreement with Tehran.\nThe nuclear deal only allows Iran to produce and store limited quantities of uranium enriched up to 3.67% concentration. Uranium enriched to 90% or more can be used to make nuclear weapons.\nMr Trump said the accord was based on \"a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy programme\" and reinstated crippling economic sanctions in an attempt to compel Iran to negotiate a replacement.\nIran, which insists it does not want nuclear weapons, refused to do so and retaliated by rolling back a number of key commitments under the accord.\nIt has since accelerated the breaches in an attempt to increase pressure on the US. They have included operating advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, resuming enrichment to 20% concentration of the most fissile U-235 isotope, and building a stockpile of that material."

      "text": "Northern Ireland's stay-at-home order has been lifted after being in place for more than three months, as further Covid lockdown restrictions ease.\nPeople have been told to \"stay local\" and continue to work from home where they can.\nTen people from two households can meet up in private gardens and non-essential shops can resume click-and-collect.\nAll pupils in Northern Ireland also returned to school on Monday for the first time since Christmas. \nNorthern Ireland is the last part of the UK to lift its stay-at-home rule, which came into effect in January, in a bid to suppress a large rise in cases of coronavirus.\nOther relaxations from Monday allow the reopening of outdoor retail, including:\nThe limit on the number of people allowed to attend a wedding, civil partnership or funeral has also been removed.\nVenues instead will again have to assess how many people they can safely accommodate in line with a risk assessment.\nThe new rules allow a maximum of four people at a time to view a wedding venue, such as a hotel.\nThere are also further changes to the number of people allowed to play sport outdoors together from Monday, with groups of up to 15 people, including coaches, allowed to train together.\nThe Department for Communities has said five-a-side football training can take place \"if organised by a club affiliated to a recognised governing body and with the appropriate protocols and mitigations in place\".\nThere is a big announcement coming on Thursday \nIt's been well flagged up by the first and deputy first ministers that they expect dates to be laid out.\nThe data is now in the right place, hence we will now get a timeline on Thursday for what we can expect.\nThe smart money seems to suggest that 26 April will be the date that they will aim towards in terms of reopening non-essential retail and also hospitality reopening on that date in some form.\nIt might be outdoor hospitality only, it might be a combination of outdoor hospitality with limits on serving alcohol indoors - similar to what has been set out in Scotland.\nAnd dear to many people's hearts, the whole issue of close-contact services - hairdressers, beauty salons, when they might get the nod for reopening -  I wouldn't be surprised if that happened before 26 April, given that it is already up and running in other parts of the UK.\nPaul Kee, director of Maiden City Soccer Academy in Londonderry, told BBC Radio Foyle the return of formalised training was \"vitally important\".\n\"The kids have suffered over this pandemic in particular, sport has suffered,\" he said. \"It has taken away their natural way to get out and exercise and play.\n\"The most important thing is the activity, the child is out there playing, keeping active and keeping fit and being social as well.\"\nHowever, many restrictions will remain in place, including: \nNew guidance for people identified as being clinically extremely vulnerable has also come into effect.\nFrom Monday anyone who has been shielding and who cannot work from home is permitted to return to their workplace provided appropriate public safety measures are in place.\nFurther updates for those shielding are expected to be announced as part of a wider lifting of restrictions.  \nThe next formal review of Northern Ireland's lockdown restrictions is due to happen on Thursday.\nThe executive will meet to consider proposals from Stormont ministers aimed at providing reopening dates for a number of sectors including retail, close-contact services such as hairdressers, tourism and hospitality. \nOn Monday, First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped the executive would be able to provide an \"indicative timeframe\" on Thursday \"because there are lots of people for business reasons, for well-being reasons, who will want that information\". \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was \"hopeful\".\n\"I wouldn't want to pre-empt the executive decision on Thursday but it's fair to say we're increasingly confident in our ability to be able to make more progress,\" she said.\n\"We have the headroom to be able to move - the vaccination programme being very strong, the ICU [intensive care unit] numbers coming down, the number of positive cases coming down, so that all leads to a very encouraging situation.\"\nOne date believed to be under consideration for reopening non-essential retail is 26 April, but it will require the support of the whole executive.\nNorthern Ireland has moved at a slower pace than other parts of the UK in easing its lockdown, which began on 26 December.\nBut ministers have said the virus has moved at a different rate and they want to ensure the lifting of restrictions is managed carefully so Northern Ireland does not have to re-enter lockdown.\nThe health and education ministers thanked the public for their \"collective effort\", but stressed the importance of continuing to follow public health advice.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann urged caution, \"so we do not undo the hard-won progress we have made\". \n\"It's vital the safety measures put in place are adhered to,\" he said.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir said the full return to school represented \"a significant milestone\", but added \"the priority must be to keep our schools safe and ensure they remain open\". \n\"Parents and guardians can play their part by wearing a mask when they are picking up or dropping off their child and not congregating around the school gates,\" he added. \nMore than one million Covid-19 vaccines have now been administered by officials running the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, according to the Department of Health.\nCurrently, anyone aged 40 or over can book their vaccine appointments at the regional centres.\nThe health minister said that \"every jab takes us further down the pathway towards a better and safer future\" and urged those eligible to book their appointment as soon as possible."
