      "text": "The business secretary has denied that individuals will bear the cost of changing to greener ways of living.\nKwasi Kwarteng said it was \"not true\" to say that the move to more environmentally friendly transport and energy production would \"cost us\".\nThe government plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050.\nThe Treasury has hinted tax rises may be necessary as revenues from fossil fuel-related activity dry up.\nAchieving net zero means the UK will no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without action on climate change, the world faces a hotter planet, rising sea levels and extreme weather.\nThe Treasury said hitting the target would put pressure on public spending, but added \"the biggest impact\" came from \"the erosion of tax revenues from fossil fuel-related activity\".\nLast year, \u00a337bn was raised through fuel duty and vehicle excise duty, but is believed the transition to electric vehicles could create a temporary tax vacuum by the 2040s, meaning new revenue-raising measures would be needed.\nA net-zero report by the Treasury said future governments \"may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue\" rather than relying on higher borrowing.\nIt also warned policies to support the adoption of electric vehicles \"may disproportionately benefit\" richer people, with those on lower incomes potentially bearing the brunt of increased costs.\n\"As higher income households drive more and are likely to adopt EVs [electric vehicles] earlier, the costs and benefits of EV adoption are likely to fall on higher income households first,\" the Treasury report said.\n\"Conversely, any changes to the cost of running an internal combustion engine vehicle will fall disproportionately on lower-income households, so there could be a trade-off in some instances.\"\nAsked on the BBC's Today programme if there was a danger that poorer people could lead to \"subsiding the green guilt of the rich\", Mr Kwarteng replied: \"No, I don't accept that at all.\"\nHe added that the transition to electric vehicles was \"successful and we should be doing it more rapidly\", but admitted there was still \"range anxiety\" over how far such vehicles could travel.\nMr Kwarteng said up to \u00a390bn by 2030 of private investment would help the country to source more energy from renewables, with \"evidence\" for such forecasts based on previous investments of \u00a3100bn being ploughed into offshore wind farms since 2012.\n\"It's not a heroic assumption to say that by 2030, we would have attracted an additional \u00a390bn,\" he said.\nAs well as plans to encourage more people to drive electric cars, the government is also going to offer subsidies of \u00a35,000 from next April for people to switch from gas boilers to low-carbon heat pumps. \nHeat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse - and are powered by electricity. An air-source heat pump costs between \u00a36,000 and \u00a318,000, depending on the type installed and the size of a property.\nAlthough up to 25 million UK homes have gas boilers, the government's grants will fund just 90,000 pumps over three years. Critics have said the plans do not go far enough.\nMr Kwarteng added the cost of heat pumps could \"come down\" as more companies began manufacturing them, which would see more people \"adopt them\".\n\"People will have seen that in their own lives. A few years ago with things like iPhones, at the beginning they were very, very expensive. Of course, the unit cost, as the private sector invests in producing these things, comes down,\" he said.\nThe recently released iPhone 13 handset is currently priced at \u00a3779 on Apple's website.\nMr Kwarteng admitted it was a \"lot of money\" to install a heat pump, adding: \"No-one is saying we are imposing heat pumps on anybody.\n\"What we are trying to do is encourage behaviour.\"\nThe government's net-zero plans come as global leaders prepare to meet in Glasgow to negotiate how to curb climate change."

      "text": "FBI agents are sweeping properties in the US linked to Russian billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \nMr Deripaska, who has close ties to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, was placed under US sanctions in 2018.\nThe oligarch's spokesman told Reuters news agency the FBI is searching two homes owned by relatives of Mr Deripaska under court warrants related to those sanctions.\nImages showed agents carrying boxes out of a Washington DC home.\nOthers stood guard outside behind yellow crime scene tape.\nThe representative said another property in New York was also being searched. \nSo far it is unclear exactly why the searches are taking place. A spokesperson for the FBI told NBC News the agency was conducting \"law enforcement activity\" at the Washington DC property, without giving any further details. \nMr Deripaska, 53, made his fortune in the 1990s as a metals broker. In 1997 he founded the industrial group Basic Element, one of Russia's largest, which he still owns. \nThe US Treasury placed Mr Deripaska under sanctions in 2018 along with six other Russian oligarchs, as well as a number of companies they own and senior Russian government officials.\nSteve Mnuchin, then Treasury secretary, said the move was a response to Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, which Moscow denies.\n\"The Russian government engages in a range of malign activity around the globe,\" a statement released at the time said. \"Russian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their government's destabilizing activities.\"\nA year later US President Donald Trump lifted sanctions on three firms linked to Mr Deripaska after he ceded control, a move criticised by Democrat politicians. Sanctions remained on the magnate himself, however.\nMr Deripaska also has links with Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager for President Trump, who was convicted of fraud before his pardon by Mr Trump in December 2020.\nIn 2016 the Guardian newspaper reported that Mr Manafort had worked with Mr Deripaska on investment deals in Ukraine."

      "title": "Covid: Why are UK cases so high?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "Health leaders in England have called for Covid restrictions to be re-introduced ahead of winter, as cases rise.\nThanks to the vaccine, getting infected is now much less likely to land you in hospital. But soaring cases - which are outstripping some European nations - are still proving a cause for concern.\nThe more virus there is about, the more chances there are for it to break through the defences of vaccines, reach vulnerable people and put pressure on health services. \nThe number of people testing positive for Covid in the UK has been rising in recent days to more than 50,000 cases in one day.\nOver the past three months there have been roughly as many cases as there were over three months last winter, which allows us to compare the two time periods.\nBetween July and October this year, there were just over three million cases, with 79,000 people ending up in hospital. \nBetween October and January last year, there were just over 2.7 million cases, but more than 185,000 people needed hospital treatment. This was before vaccines were widely available.\nThese two charts show us the effect of the removal of restrictions and the rise of the Delta variant on the one hand in driving up cases, and the vaccination programme on the other in pushing down admissions.\nIn England, unvaccinated people were at least three times as likely to need hospital care as vaccinated people, according to the most recent Public Health England figures for the previous three weeks. \nIn the oldest group - the over-80s - 141 people in every 100,000 unvaccinated people ended up in hospital with Covid compared with 54 in every 100,000 vaccinated people. In the youngest - the under-18s - four unvaccinated people in every 100,000 needed overnight hospital treatment compared with zero in the vaccinated group. \nDeaths are also being kept at a much lower level than when cases were previously this high. \nSo what do we know about what's driving the rise in cases?\nUK residents were significantly more likely than people in Germany, France, Spain and Italy to say they no longer wear a face mask or covering.\nCovid cases are higher in the UK than in any of those countries - but we can't necessarily say that one is causing the other.\nStudy after study has shown face masks can help stop the virus from being passed between people. When it comes to measuring how much mask wearing reduces an outbreak, though, it's a lot more difficult to pin down. \nThat's because it's hard to untangle it from all the other things going on at the same time, like how much people choose to mix with each other. \nPeople in Sweden and the Netherlands were more likely than the UK to say they never wore a mask, according to a survey by Imperial College London. But these countries have fewer confirmed Covid cases than the UK.  \nWithin the UK, Scottish rules still require masks in most indoors places, while English ones don't. And people in Scotland - asked by the Office for National Statistics - were a bit more likely to say they had worn a face covering in the previous seven days. Yet the nation also saw a spike in hospital admissions in recent weeks. \nThe UK relaxed many restrictions sooner than most of the rest of Western Europe. People in England, Wales and Scotland have been able to go to nightclubs and attend gatherings of unlimited numbers of people since the summer, unlike in many other countries.\nImperial College survey data suggests people in the UK are slightly more likely than some of their nearest European neighbours to take public transport, and less likely to avoid going out.\nThe latest survey of contacts and mixing in the UK found that there had been relatively little change in recent weeks, with contact rates for children similar to those at the start of term. \nThere has been a gradual increase in the number of employees going to work in person, although it's still quite low, with only about half of employees going into their workplace if it was open. \nThe UK surged ahead in its rollout of the vaccine. That's undoubtedly saved many lives by preventing severe cases of Covid, but this early progress could give a clue as to why the country is facing higher cases now. \nA study - of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app - suggested the vaccine's protection against catching the virus wanes significantly after five or six months. \nIn Israel, which originally led the world in terms of population vaccinated, scientists analysing their data said a spike in cases was down to falling protection from the jab. And cases levelled off once enough older people had been given a booster dose. \nWhat Israel tells us about the way out of Covid\nBoosters are now being given to older people in the UK - 3.7 million doses had been administered in England by 17 October.\nImportantly, protection against severe disease seems to remain high six months after vaccination. \nIt's true that the more infections are circulating, the higher the risk some people will end up seriously ill, even when most have been vaccinated. That's probably why hospital admissions in the UK are higher now than they were early in the summer when cases were lower. \nBut when you look at the overall numbers, we are seeing far fewer hospital admissions now than when cases were last this high and most people weren't vaccinated. \nThe UK's quick start in its vaccination rollout has stalled in recent months. Its rate of fully-vaccinated people no longer ranks in the top 10 countries with a population of at least one million.\nIn the first two weeks of October, the proportion of the British public aged 12 and over who had received at least one dose of the vaccine barely moved.  \nA government spokesperson said: \"The vaccination programme has significantly weakened the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths, and will continue to be our first line of defence against Covid-19.\n\"We encourage those who are eligible for a booster jab to come forward to ensure they have this vital extra protection as we approach winter.\"\nVaccinating children - how the UK compares \nThe UK's vaccination rate is slightly skewed by the low uptake of doses by children. Vaccines for 12-15-year-olds in the UK started on 20 September. So far, 15% of 12-15-year-olds in England have received one shot. This is compared to Israel, where more than half of 12-15-year-olds have had at least one shot. \nMost other European countries are now vaccinating over-12s, including France, which started rolling it out in June.

That amount has climbed to \u00a378.54.\nHowever, 18 months after the coronavirus crisis started, visits are now less than twice a month.\nThat means the total average amount each month withdrawn per person has fallen \u00a344, from \u00a3200.97 to \u00a3157.08.\nThe total value of Link ATM withdrawals is currently running at around \u00a31.6bn a week, compared with around \u00a32.2bn in 2019.\nMeanwhile the amount people can spend on a contactless card rocketed to \u00a3100 earlier this month, after climbing to \u00a345 in April 2020.\n\"Crucially, even though we're withdrawing almost \u00a3100m less per day, millions still rely on cash, especially in the most deprived areas of the country,\" said Mr Quin.\n\"It is important we continue to protect access to cash across the country.\"\nThe latest Financial Lives survey from the Financial Conduct Authority showed that more than five million people rely on cash every day.\nLink's new figures suggest that some wealthier parts of Edinburgh and London have shown a fall in cash machine use by as much as 60%.\nBut there remains a greater reliance on cash in areas such as Liverpool, Bradford and Birmingham where the fall in ATM usage is considerably smaller.\nLink said it heard from more 400 communities this year wanting better cash access.\nIt has installed more than 70 machines across the country in response to those requests and a further 30 in areas identified as lacking cash access.\nIt said it is encouraging people to speak up if they find it difficult to access cash free of charge.\n\"It is important we continue to protect access to cash across the country,\" said Mr Quin.\nLink said the number of ATMs has not dropped as quickly as cash usage. \nSince the beginning of the pandemic, the number of free-to-use ATMs has dropped 9% from 45,000 to 41,000.\nIn July the Financial Conduct Authority warned that people living in rural areas are having to travel further to find somewhere to withdraw and deposit cash free of charge.\nThe City watchdog said almost every urban resident has access to a bank, building society, post office or ATM within two kilometres of their home, but only three-quarters of the UK rural population has similar access.\nIt is considering stronger requirements of the sector to ensure the millions of people who rely on notes and coins have access to it.\nMeanwhile the charity Age UK said that people required the same guarantee of access to cash as they did for running water, electricity and the post.\nAbout 2.4 million people aged 65-and-over rely on cash in their daily lives, it said.\nThe charity warned that many would face being excluded from society if they could not get hold of notes and coins.\nConstituency areas with the smallest percentage declines in the volume of cash withdrawals:\n* based on figures from Link comparing August 2019 with August 2021\nConstituency areas with the biggest percentage declines in the volume of cash withdrawals:\n* based on figures from Link comparing August 2019 with August 2021"

      "tags": "Companies,BrewDog,Advertising",
      "text": "A Brewdog promotion which said customers could win \"solid gold\" beer cans was misleading, the advertising watchdog has found.\nThe Scottish brewer offered shoppers the chance to find a gold can hidden in cases sold from its online store.\nBut some winners complained to the Advertising Standards Authority after they discovered the cans were not solid gold, but were gold-plated instead.\nThe ASA upheld the complaints and said three adverts were misleading.\nIn response to the ASA's ruling, James Watt, co-founder and chief executive at Brewdog, said: \"We hold our hands up, we got the first gold can campaign wrong.\" \nThe ruling comes amid heavy criticism of Brewdog in recent months, with a letter from ex-workers stating former staff had \"suffered mental illness\" as a result of working for the craft beer brewer.\nIt made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns.\nThe ASA said it received 25 complaints in relation to three social media adverts stating its can prize was made from \"solid gold\".\nIn its ruling, the watchdog said it \"understood the prize consisted of 24 carat gold-plated replica cans\", but added \"because the ads stated that the prize included a solid gold can when that was not the case, we concluded the ads were misleading\".\nThe ASA said it had told Brewdog not to state or imply that consumers would receive a solid gold can when it was not the case.\nOne of the competition winners, Mark Craig, still contests the value of the gold-plated can that he won and believes it is \"not worth anything\".\nMr Craig, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, told the BBC: \"They are meant to be there for the little guy and this is two fingers to their customers who are the ones who were taken by this.\"\nHe criticised the company's apology, which he said appeared to be encouraging people to buy more beer in a \"new competition run correctly this time\".\nBrewdog said its social media posts which contained the words \"solid gold\" did so in error and repeated that mistakes were a result of miscommunication between its marketing and social media teams.\nAs well as complaints over the prize's authenticity, some winners questioned how much the can was worth. Brewdog claimed it was valued at \u00a315,000.\nMr Watt said the company stood by its valuation which it previously said was based on several factors, including the manufacturing price, metal and quality of the product.\nThe ASA said Brewdog told investigators that a single 330ml can, made with the equivalent 330ml of pure gold, would have a gold value of about $500,000 (\u00a3363,000).\nThe ASA said it considered a general audience \"was unlikely to be aware of the price of gold, how that would translate into the price of a gold can, and whether that was inconsistent with the valuation as stated in the ad\".\nThe brewer has been heavily criticised in recent months with allegations being made about its culture, which has led to an independent review of the organisation.\nSo far, more than 100 interviews with former staff have \"either taken place or are scheduled for the coming weeks\" as part of the review, according the firm's website.\nMr Watt has previously apologised to former staff and said their complaints would help make him a better chief executive.\nHowever, in a recent interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said the brewer \"should have been clearer about the high-performance culture\" and suggested there was a \"mismatch of expectations\" among certain employees.\nThe BBC previously reported that a note from Mr Watt to staff said it was \"fair to say that this type of fast-paced and intense environment is definitely not for everyone, but many of our fantastic long-term team members have thrived in our culture\".\nAs well as the ruling on Brewdog, the ASA also upheld a complaint against an advert by plant-drink maker Alpro on the side of a bus.\nThe complainant believed commercial almond farming caused environmental damage and challenged whether the product was \"good for the planet\" as stated.\nThe ASA said there was \"no qualification\" to the claim and \"little context provided\" in the ad to interpret it.\nIt added that Alpro revealed the almonds used in its almond drink were cultivated in a sustainable way and not sourced from regions with environmentally damaging processes."

He has also performed \"extreme planking\" (when you hold a plank position for hours at a time) and been \"buried alive\" for entertainment purposes.\nLast year, Goodwin, who has performed in London's West End as one of The Illusionists, was also a semi-finalist on America's Got Talent.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

He was due to fly my sister on a trip and was going to be piloting himself.\n\"I found out after the event that he was unavailable and had asked David Ibbotson to fly instead of him.\"\n\"He allowed that to happen without my permission,\" she added.\nAsked by defence counsel Stephen Spence QC if she had warned Henderson not to hire Mr Ibbotson again, she said: \"No. As far as I was concerned I had made my feelings clear that he shouldn't be flying the aircraft.\"\nIn an text message exchange from August 2018, that was read to the jury, Mr Henderson had a conversation with someone who had flown with Mr Ibbotson. \nIt said: \"The Ibbotson experience was interesting! He was all over the place. Had to help him out coming into White Waltham [airfield].\"\nMr Henderson replied: \"His handling OK? Takes a lot to try and knock these new guys into shape.\"\n\"He's just not very quick and not thinking ahead,\" was the reply. \nIn another text message, found on Mr Henderson's phone from July 2018, Mr Ibbotson explained he had \"messed up a couple of times\" during a flight. \nJurors also heard that, hours after the night-time crash, Mr Henderson had messaged aircraft engineer David Smith telling him to \"keep very quiet\", adding \"need to be very careful. Opens up a whole can of worms\".\nThe court has already heard that Mr Ibbotson did not hold a commercial pilot's licence, was not allowed to fly at night, and that his rating to fly the Piper Malibu had expired.\nDespite this, when Mr Henderson was unavailable to fly the plane carrying Sala between Nantes and Cardiff in January because he was away with his wife in Paris, he hired Mr Ibbotson again.\nMr Smith, an employee of aircraft maintenance company Eastern Air Executive, said he had become aware of some issues with the aircraft on January 21 before it was due to fly back from France to the UK and insisted it was checked by a French engineer. \nThe trial is expected to last until the end of next week.

For that reason, our Net Zero Strategy published yesterday contained no such plans,\" it said.\nThe Behavioural Insights Unit, also known as the Nudge Unit, wrote the document.\nThe unit is most known for its role in the design of the sugar levy and early comments on the pandemic \"herd immunity\" strategy.\nThe document was swiftly deleted and has been replaced with a note saying it was published in error, but BBC News obtained a copy.\nIt was also later put online by Alex Chapman, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation.\nThe Behavioural Insights Unit made a recommendation, following the example of the sugar levy, with a tax on producers or retailers of \"high-carbon foods\" to incentivise plant-based and local food diets.\nIt suggests \"building support for a bold policy\", such as a tax on producers of sheep and cattle meat.\nHowever, it states that an \"unsophisticated meat tax would be highly regressive\".\nThe research paper also says the government can begin to get people used to the idea of plant-based food through its spending at hospitals, schools, prisons, courts and military facilities.\nIt also states a \"timely moment to intervene\" in changing diets could be to target people attending university or first-time renters.\nThe document recognises that \"asking people to directly eat less meat and dairy is a major political challenge\", although a positive portrayal and \"smaller asks\" may be possible - for example, people learning one new recipe.\nWhen talking about flights, the paper suggests \"much stronger carbon taxes\".\nOne possibility discussed in the paper is trying to \"shift social norms\" to make in-person business meetings needing international flights a sign of \"immoral indulgence or embarrassment\" rather than a sign of \"importance\". \nMeanwhile, it says domestic tourism should be promoted to lessen consumer demand for international flights."

I woke up and saw a bus on fire, which came to a halt after hitting the sidewalk,\" Abu Ahmed, a fruit vendor at a market near the bridge, told AFP news agency. \"I later heard the sound of a second explosion, but this one was not as strong as the first one.\"\nVideo from the scene showed the charred remains of the bus, with smoke billowing from its broken windows as firefighters put out the flames. \nSana said military engineers defused a third explosive device that had fallen from the vehicle.\nInterior Minister Mohammed al-Rahman told state TV that security forces would \"pursue the terrorists who committed this heinous crime wherever they are\". \nNo group has yet said it was behind the bombing, but suspicion will fall on IS, which has attacked military vehicles in the east of the country this year.\nFour children and a female teacher were among the 10 people killed in the town of Ariha, in the north-western province of Idlib, according to the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets.\nAnother 20 people were wounded, some of them critically, when shells struck main roads and a busy market while children were heading to school at the start of the day, the organisation said, blaming pro-government forces.\n\"When we arrived at the school and the students were there, the shelling and air strikes started,\" a local teacher told Save the Children. \"The students were horrified, they started screaming, we didn't know what to do. We were worried the students would get injured as the buildings are not protected.\"\nThe UN children's agency said Wednesday's violence was \"yet another reminder that the war in Syria has not come to an end\".\n\"Civilians, among them many children, keep bearing the brunt of a brutal decade-long conflict,\" it added.\nNorth-western Syria has seen sporadic violence since a ceasefire brokered in March 2020 by Turkey and Russia ended a government offensive. \nTurkey, which backs the opposition, and Russia, a key ally of Mr Assad, have deployed troops to the region in an attempt to prevent a major escalation."

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Twenty-four children in Northern Ireland with confirmed or suspected cancers had to wait over a year for a first appointment, a review has found.\nThe figure, for April, is in a review of waiting lists by the NI Commissioner for Children and Young People. \nMore than 17,000 children were waiting more than a year to see a hospital consultant for the first time.  \nThe health minster later said that by September there were no \"red flag\" paediatric patients waiting that long.\nThe review examined official waiting list data for children's health services not published as part of the Department of Health's statistical bulletins.\nThe commissioner said the waiting times were \"terrifying\".\nKoulla Yiasouma said that waiting for any health service treatment can and does have a \"profound impact on a child's health outcomes, emotional and mental well-being\".\nShe said it was \"shocking not only for the child but their families too\".\n\"Each and every single one of them is a child and each and every single one of them is a child whose life has almost been put on hold, and a family whose life has been put on hold, because they are not getting the most fundamental right of healthcare that they deserve,\" she said.\nDr Ray Nethercott, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said he was shocked by the cancer figures.\n\"It is outrageous and there are probably many other words that spring to the minds of parents who are worried and concerned and colleagues who are facing into this,\" he said.\n\"Some of the answer will be about embracing and delivering that reform, delivering innovation, delivering different ways of managing children as close to home as possible.\n\"To be able to do that, it's not all about the workforce, but it's actually about giving some due care and attention to child health services as a distinct entity.\n\"I can't say that there's any way to do it immediately - I've got lots of ideas as do many of my colleagues.\n\"But really children and children's voices and people that work with children have a very small voice in our health system.\"\nThe review, called More Than Just a Number, examined the number of children and young people on waiting lists, and the length of time they wait to access first or review appointments with consultants for treatment in hospitals and also for services based in the community. \nIt found that in April 2021, one in five children and young people in Northern Ireland were waiting for a first or review appointment with a consultant. \nIt also found 17,194 children and young people were waiting more than one year and 510 more than four years.\nThe conditions affected included scoliosis, speech and language therapy and autism.    \nMandy O'Connor has two daughters waiting for reviews. \nHer eldest daughter had an operation in Turkey for scoliosis in 2018 that cost them \u00a335,000 for the operation alone, otherwise she would have been waiting 18 months for surgery in Northern Ireland.\nShe has not been seen in Northern Ireland since that operation and the family is travelling to Turkey on Wednesday for a follow-up appointment. \nHer second daughter doesn't know if she has scoliosis which means time is of the essence to find out so they can tackle it early. \n\"From when Tasha [her eldest daughter] was diagnosed she was in extreme pain for the 16 weeks while we were fundraising,\" Mrs O'Connor said. \n\"To think what she would have been like for 18 months on that waiting list and even for the referral it was 16 weeks.\n\"It was marked urgent at the time - Tasha wasn't seen for a referral. The referral went in on July 2018, she wasn't seen until November 2018.\"\nShe said her second daughter had to wait 12 months for a first referral.\n\"That was in August 2019. She wasn't seen until August 2020 and as yet she hasn't been seen since.\"\nAs well as looking at hospital waits, it also raises other issues including the \"complete absence\" of regional monitoring or reporting of waiting times for child health services in the community. \nThe absence of such critical information according to the commissioner makes it impossible to get a clear understanding of the number of children who are waiting for these services. \nIt found that at least 26,818 children in Northern Ireland were waiting for a community-based health service but it is thought the figure is much higher. \nThe report makes 17 recommendations.\nThese include:\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said he was grateful to the commissioner for the \"detailed review\".\n\"My department and the wider HSC (Health and Social Care) system will carefully consider the report and recommendations from the commissioner as part of our ongoing work to transform and rebuild services,\" he said.\n\"Waiting times were clearly unacceptable prior to Covid-19 and have been exacerbated by the devastating impact of the pandemic across all aspects of service provision including, unfortunately, across children's services. \n\"Addressing these waiting lists is a top priority for me... it will require systemic change and long-term investment.\"\nMs Yiasouma said she welcomed the health minister's commitment to improve waiting lists and to address the \"underlying issues which drive them\".\n\"Waiting times are one of the clearest indicators of a system under immense strain and unable to meet the needs of its population,\" she added.\n\"We must strive to get to a point where all children and young people can get access to the right care, at the right time and the right place and no child ls left waiting months or years in a queue to access services.\"\nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the waiting times figures for children with cancer were \"utterly appalling\".\n\"I think we should see somebody very senior in the Department of Health appointed as a deputy chief medical officer to oversee children's health in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \n\"I think we need to invest more in children's health.\n\"I think children should have a degree of priority when it comes to such services.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " Covid has severely affected healthcare staff and may have killed between 80,000 and 180,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. \nHealthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs.\nThe deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year. \nEarlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year. \nThere are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally. \n\"Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, two in five healthcare workers globally are fully vaccinated,\" Dr Tedros said. \n\"But of course, that average masks huge differences across regions and economic groupings.\"\nFewer than one in 10 healthcare workers were fully vaccinated in Africa, he said, compared with eight in 10 in high-income countries. \nA failure to provide poorer countries with enough vaccines was highlighted earlier by Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, who said it meant the Covid crisis could \"easily drag on deep into 2022\".\nLess than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared with 40% on most other continents.\nThe vast majority of Covid vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally. \nThe original idea behind Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly, was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones, writes BBC Global Affairs correspondent Naomi Grimley. \nBut most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies.\nDr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead.\nHe said wealthy countries needed to \"stocktake\" where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer.  \n\"I can tell you we're not on track,\" he said. \"We really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to.\"\nThe People's Vaccine - an alliance of charities - has released new figures suggesting just one in seven of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries. \nThe alliance, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax. \nOfficial figures show that earlier this year the UK received 539,370 Pfizer doses from Covax while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses. \nOxfam's Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still \"morally indefensible\" given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements. \nThe UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had \"kick-started\" Covax last year with a donation of \u00a3548m. \nThe UK has also delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need, and has pledged a total of 100 million.\nThe Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now stopped using Covax vaccines. \nThe country's International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: \"As soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries.\" \nCovax originally aimed to deliver two billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year, but so far it has shipped 371m doses."

      "text": "Plans by governments to extract fossil fuels up to 2030 are incompatible with keeping global temperatures to safe levels, says the UN.\nThe UNEP production gap report says countries will drill or mine more than double the levels needed  to keep the 1.5C threshold alive. \nOil and gas recovery is set to rise sharply with only a modest decrease in coal. \nThere has been little change since the first report was published in 2019.\nWith the COP26 climate conference just over a week away, there is already a huge focus on the carbon-cutting ambitions of the biggest emitters. \nBut despite the flurry of net zero emission goals and the increased pledges of many countries, some of the biggest oil, gas and coal producers have not set out plans for the rapid reductions in fossil fuels that scientists say are necessary to limit temperatures in coming years. \nEarlier this year, researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned of the dangers for humanity of allowing temperatures to rise by more than 1.5C this century. To keep under this threshold will require cuts in carbon emissions of around 45% by 2030 based on 2010 levels.  \nBut instead of curbing carbon, many of the biggest emitting countries are also planning to significantly increase their production of fossil fuels, according to the UN. \nThe production gap report finds that countries plan to produce around 110% more fossil fuel than would be compatible with a 1.5C temperature rise by the end of this century. The plans are around 45% more than what's needed to keep the temperature rise to 2C. \nAccording to the study, coal production will drop but gas will increase the most over the next 20 years, to levels that are simply incompatible with the Paris agreement. \nThe report profiles 15 major production countries including Australia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the US and UK. \nMost governments continue to provide significant policy support for fossil fuel production, the authors say.\n\"The research is clear: global coal, oil, and gas production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to 1.5C,\" says Ploy Achakulwisut, a lead author on the report from the Stockholm Environment Institute. \n\"However, governments continue to plan for and support levels of fossil fuel production that are vastly in excess of what we can safely burn.\"\nWhile countries have devoted far more of their recovery spending after the Covid pandemic towards fossil fuel activities, there are some positives when it comes to financing. \nFunding for oil, coal and gas from multilateral banks has decreased significantly in recent years - and also from some of the richer nations. \n\"This report shows, once again, a simple but powerful truth: we need to stop pumping oil and gas from the ground if we are to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement,\" said Andrea Meza, Costa Rica's minister for environment and energy. \n\"We must cut with both hands of the scissors, addressing demand and supply of fossil fuels simultaneously. That is why, together with Denmark, we are leading the creation of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance to put an end to the expansion of fossil fuel extraction, plan a just transition for workers and start winding down existing production in a managed way.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.

      "text": "Dozens of Afghan families staying in hotels as part of a scheme to resettle them are declaring themselves homeless.\nMore than 200 families have asked councils in London for emergency accommodation.\nThey are concerned that the Home Office scheme they are currently part of could see them moved to anywhere in the UK and away from family and friends.\nLondon Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs, says people should stay with the government scheme.\nThe organisation found 89% of the 204 families who have registered as homeless were unsure whether they are on the resettlement scheme.\nIt said if they leave the scheme and sign on with the councils, they would lose all support provided by the Home Office and could still be placed in temporary accommodation outside of their chosen area.  \nDarren Rodwell of London Councils is urging all families in hotels to wait for clarification. \n\"The last thing we want is vulnerable people placed in more vulnerable communities,\" he said.\nBut some refugees believe they may not qualify for the scheme because a family member holds a British passport. \nThey think leaving the scheme is a safer option because they can sign on to council lists sooner, and even if they are moved temporarily away by councils, they could ultimately be moved back to the capital once a permanent place is found.\nThe city is already facing a housing crisis with about 165,000 people living in temporary accommodation organised by their borough.\nThe Home Office Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme's policy states families can be placed anywhere in the UK. If families leave their hotels, they will lose Home Office support. \nRefugees have also said they are frustrated with the slow pace of the scheme and a lack of communication.\nSaid Shinwari, who is a British citizen after previously working in the UK for more than 20 years, returned with his wife and eight children when the Taliban took control of their town. \nHe has been staying in hotels for nearly two months and is grateful for the help he has received. However, he is considering registering as homeless in the hope of accessing emergency accommodation. \nAs he worked in London for 20 years and has family in the capital, he wants to be housed there.\n\"I am concerned about my family and children because they are just inside the room. They need to go to school,\" he said.\nMr Shinwari says he has had very little communication from the government despite numerous attempts to contact officials. \nHarrow Council has received 10 applications and has moved five families into emergency accommodation. \nCouncillor Peymana Assad, also an Afghan refugee, said the applications were putting pressure on the council, which has very little housing stock available. \nMs Assad said she believes the problem is only going to get worse. \n\"We have such a large Afghan community already. We understand that we're going to have more cases come to us with more families leaving hotels,\" she said.\n\"We need the Home Office to communicate with Afghan refugees to give them clarity as to how the process is actually going to work. The council needs this too.\"\nThe Home Office said the Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities (DLUHC) was responsible for British nationals. \nIn a statement the DLUHC said: \"Through the effort and support of local councils, thousands of people were swiftly evacuated by our Armed Forces and have now been warmly welcomed to the UK and are being provided with permanent homes as quickly as possible.\"\n\"Those resettling here have access to essential provision, healthcare, education, and Universal Credit, while we arrange further wrap around support to enable these families to build a successful life in the UK.\""

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Another big push towards electric vehicles is being made in the UK government's latest strategy to make the great shift to a virtually zero-carbon economy.\nMinisters are investing \u00a3620m in grants for electric vehicles and street charging points.\nCar makers will be mandated to sell a proportion of clean vehicles each year.\nAn extra \u00a3350m is promised to help the automotive supply chain move to electric.\nThe new plan set out by the government is supposed to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050.\nThe announcement comes 12 days before global leaders meet in Glasgow to negotiate how to curb climate change.\nAchieving\u00a0net zero means the\u00a0UK will\u00a0no longer be\u00a0adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nWithout action on climate change, the world faces a hotter planet, rising sea levels and extreme weather that threaten many forms of life.\nThe UK has already made progress in cutting emissions compared to the levels released in 1990. In 2019, the country released 40% less than in 1990. \nOn Tuesday the government also announced a strategy to address emissions from the UK's 30 million buildings.\nHomeowners will be able to apply for grants of up to \u00a35,000 to install low-carbon heat pumps to replace gas boilers.\nThe Labour party's Ed Miliband responded to the strategy, saying the \"plans falls short on delivery\" adding \"we've waited months for a heat and buildings strategy, it's a massive let-down\".\nProf Lord Nicholas Stern, Chair of LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said the plan will require \"strong investment and innovation\" and would generate a \"new and attractive form of growth\". But he warned that low-income households will need support.\nAnd Prof Dan Lunt, Professor of Climate Science at University of Bristol, called the strategy's approach to flying weak and unambitious. \nEnvironmental group Friends of the Earth criticised the strategy as \"riddled with holes and omissions\".\n\"The rapid electrification of new vehicles is certainly welcome, but many of the carbon savings this could bring will be wiped out by the government's \u00a327 billion road programme,\" it said.  \nIt also offers a further \u00a3120m to develop SMRs - small \"modular\" nuclear reactors that can be factory-built. These might go to the Wylfa site in Wales, although that's not certain.\nThese mini-reactors are being promoted heavily by Rolls Royce, although critics say the technology won't be mature in time to meet the UK's carbon targets.\nOn large nuclear: there's been much speculation about a go-ahead for Sizewell C in Suffolk. But funding has been a key sticking point and it seems an announcement has been put off until the Chancellor's spending review next week.\nThere will be an extra \u00a3625m for tree-planting and peat restoration, too - even though the current schedule is running way behind its targets.\nThe government is committing \u00a3140m to two clusters promoting carbon capture and storage to produce hydrogen. The hubs will be the North-West of England and North Wales, with Teesside and Humberside - the government has previously promised \u00a31bn to support CCS. \nHeavy industries in these areas will be fuelled by hydrogen split from natural gas. The resulting CO2 emissions will be pumped into undersea rocks for storage.\nThis will be controversial because environmentalists believe hydrogen should be obtained instead through electrolysis - using surplus wind energy. \nIt looks unlikely that there will be much hydrogen left over to heat people's homes, which is why the government is postponing any decision about hydrogen boilers until 2026.\nThe Treasury has hinted tax rises may be necessary to fund the government's net zero strategy.\nIn a review exploring the economic impact of decarbonising, the Treasury said: \"There will be demands on public spending, but the biggest impact comes from the erosion of tax revenues from fossil fuel-related activity.\"\nIt said future governments \"may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue\" rather than relying on higher borrowing.\nMinisters are keen to stress their intention that the so-called net zero transition will be led by business.\nThey say it will create 440,000 jobs and draw in up to 90bn of private investment by 2030.\nThe government says since the Prime Minister announced his 10-point plan for the climate a year ago, it has invested \u00a326bn of public funds into the low-carbon revolution.\nPart of that portfolio will be an extra \u00a3500m fund for low carbon innovation.\nEnvironmentalists will be scrutinising the numbers to see if various recent policy announcements will add up to the policy portfolio needed to present a plausible plan for decarbonising the economy by 2050.\nSo what's missing from the strategy? Well, there's no reference to eating less meat - which the government's advisers say is needed. And the aviation strategy - putting no constraint on flying - runs counter to advisers' opinions. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

No-one chooses to become an addict. But it can happen to any one of us. None of us are immune.\n\"Yet it's all too rarely discussed as a serious mental health condition.

      "text": "The UK has agreed a free trade deal with New Zealand which it says will benefit consumers and businesses.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the deal will cut costs for exporters and open up New Zealand's job market to UK professionals.\nThe government hopes it is a step towards joining a trade club with the likes of Canada and Japan.\nThe New Zealand deal itself is unlikely to boost UK growth, according to the government's own estimates.\nOverall, only a tiny proportion of UK trade is done with New Zealand, less than 0.2%.\nLabour and the National Farmers Union (NFU) said the deal could hurt UK farmers and lower food standards.\nBut International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said it \"affords opportunities in both directions for great sharing of produce\" and British farmers should not be worried.\nMr Johnson and New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, agreed the pact in a video call on Wednesday after 16 months of negotiations.\nTariffs will be removed on UK goods including clothing, ships and bulldozers, and on New Zealand goods including wine, honey and kiwi fruits.\nProfessionals such as lawyers and architects will be able to work in New Zealand more easily, the government said.\nHowever, the deal is not likely to increase UK economic growth - or GDP - according to the UK government's own assessments. New Zealand will fare slightly better as it may be able to sell more lamb to the UK.\nBut, like the trade deal recently struck with Australia, the UK hopes this is a step towards joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) - a trade bloc that includes Australasia, Canada, Mexico and Japan among others.\nThe UK already has deals with many of the members, rolled over from when it was in the EU. But CPTPP membership would give it more access in terms of services and digital trade.\nIn a video of the deal being struck, Mr Johnson said: \"We've scrummed down, we've packed tight, and together we've got the ball over the line and we have a deal. And I think it's a great deal.\"\nMs Ardern said: \"I loved your use of rugby metaphors, but if we were going to continue that on, then naturally it would conclude with the All Blacks winning.\n\"And I know that New Zealand feels that way with this free trade agreement, but actually, it's good for both of us, as it happens.\"\nThe NFU said the deal, like the one with Australia, could have a \"huge downside\", especially for UK dairy and meat farmers.\nIts president, Minette Batters, said the Australia and New Zealand deals mean \"we will be opening our doors to significant extra volumes of imported food - whether or not produced to our own high standards - while securing almost nothing in return for UK farmers\".\n\"The fact is that UK farm businesses face significantly higher costs of production than farmers in New Zealand and Australia, and it's worth remembering that margins are already tight here due to ongoing labour shortages and rising costs on farm,\" she said. \n\"The government is now asking British farmers to go toe-to-toe with some of the most export-orientated farmers in the world, without the serious, long-term and properly funded investment in UK agriculture that can enable us to do so.\nEmily Thornberry, shadow trade secretary, said the government's own figures showed the deal would \"cut employment in our farming communities, produce zero additional growth, and generate just \u00a3112m in additional exports for UK firms compared to pre-pandemic levels\".\nShe added that the only winners were \"the mega-corporations who run New Zealand's meat and dairy farms\".\n\"As our economy recovers from the pandemic, we need trade deals that will boost jobs and growth, open up big new markets for UK exporters, and support our objectives to buy, make and sell more in Britain. This trade deal with New Zealand fails on every count,\" she said.\nThe international trade secretary said British farmers should not be concerned about increased lamb imports because the lambing seasons were different in the UK and New Zealand.\nAnne-Marie Trevelyan said: \"I'm very comfortable it's a complimentary - because of the seasons\u2026 consumers will have more choice.\" \nShe said trade with New Zealand was currently worth \u00a32.3bn a year but had the potential to increase by up to 30% by 2030.\nAnalysis: Ramzan Karmali, BBC Business reporter\nA bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc could cost 20p less as a result of this trade deal and other products like Manuka honey and kiwi fruits could also cost less.\nIn terms of overall trade, even by the UK government's own analysis a tariff free trade deal will make no difference at all to the country's GDP - the total value of the goods and services the UK produces. \nOverall the trade between the two countries is less than 0.2% of the UK total and in fact in 2018 New Zealand ranked as only our 53rd biggest trading partner.\nSo why does this deal matter?\nThe UK signed its first big post-Brexit deal with Japan last year and in June it also signed a draft agreement for a trade deal with Australia.\nBoth countries, as well as New Zealand, are members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership or CPTPP. \nThe combined GDP for the 11 nations that form the CPTPP in 2020 was \u00a38.4trn - one of the key reasons given by the UK government when it formally applied earlier this year. \nThis deal is the first agreed during the tenure of Britain's new Secretary of State for International Trade, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who took over from Liz Truss last month.\nShe believes that by getting this deal done the UK's application to the CPTPP will be looked upon more favourably.\nThat being said, the trade deal the UK really wants is with the US.\nBut with the recent change in administration in the White House that seems further away."

      "tags": "Social media,Competition and Markets Authority,Facebook",
      "text": "Facebook has been fined \u00a350.5m ($70m) by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which accuses it of deliberately breaking rules.\nThe case related to Facebook's 2020 acquisition of Gif-sharing service Giphy, which is under investigation.\nThe CMA said Facebook had not provided information, ignored many warnings, and committed a \"major breach\". The firm denies deliberately breaking rules.\nThere are also reports that its parent company might change its name. \nTech news site The Verge revealed the news about the firm - which owns the Facebook service itself, as well as WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus VR, and other brands.\nThe \u00a350m fine the CMA handed Facebook is more than 150 times higher than the previous record handed down for similar offences, at \u00a3325,000.\nSpeaking about its decision to fine the social media giant, the CMA said in a statement: \"This is the first time a company has been found by the CMA to have breached an [order] by consciously refusing to report all the required information.\"\nGiphy is widely used by Facebook's competitors to power animated Gif images used in social media apps, on mobile keyboards, and elsewhere online. That led to potential competition concerns. \nThe CMA issued something called an \"initial enforcement order\", which limits how companies that are merging, but under investigation, operate. It is designed to keep the entities semi-separate and in competition with each other until the investigation is over.\nFacebook is obliged to provide updates and information to make clear how it is complying with the order.\n\"Given the multiple warnings it gave Facebook, the CMA considers that Facebook's failure to comply was deliberate,\" the CMA said.\nThat \"fundamentally undermined its ability to prevent, monitor and put right any issues\".\nThe fine for that offence is \u00a350m. Separately, the CMA announced a \u00a3500,000 fine for Facebook changing its chief compliance officer - twice - \"without seeking consent first\".\nFacebook refutes the allegation that it deliberately broke rules, saying it had complied with the main obligations, and the row is instead about the details of how it did so.\n\"We strongly disagree with the CMA's unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. We will review the CMA's decision and consider our options,\" a spokesperson said.\nThe Verge's report saying that Facebook plans to rebrand next week suggested that the new name will reflect Facebook's ambition to build the metaverse - the next version of the internet - rather than its traditional social media site roots.\nEarlier this week, the company announced it plans to hire 10,000 employees in the European Union to do just that.\nThe company's annual Connect conference, scheduled for 28 October, may provide the backdrop for such an announcement.\nIt also comes after weeks of news stories about Facebook's alleged shortcomings, fuelled by internal leaks by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who gave evidence to the US Congress.\nAsked about the potential name change, a Facebook spokesperson said: \"We don't comment on rumour or speculation.\"\nA Facebook name change would actually make a lot of sense.\nWhen Facebook started out, there was no real distinction between Facebook the platform and Facebook the company.\nBut as Facebook has snapped up companies like Instagram and WhatsApp, the name has become confusing.\nAnd with the number of people who actually use Facebook declining in many countries in the West, it's likely the name will become increasingly divorced from the growth areas of the company.\nThat said, it's hard to fathom why Facebook would think now is a good time to change its name.\nFacebook is currently in a whirlwind of negative press attention over leaks from whistleblower Frances Haugen.\nRather than simply apologise, as Facebook often does, it has adopted a different media strategy.\nThe social network has come out guns blazing, rejecting Ms Haugen's testimony, and claiming both her and the media have misrepresented the documents she leaked.\nChanging the company's name, at this point, would seem like it is doing so because the brand is toxic.\nPerhaps Facebook has decided to change tack, or this was something planned for a while, or they feel they've been left with little option?\nPerhaps the story isn't true?\nWhatever the truth, by not denying this story, Facebook has fuelled speculation that the company is in crisis mode."

      "text": "The elder brother of the Manchester Arena suicide bomber has left the UK ahead of an appearance at a public inquiry he had been ordered to attend.\nIsmail Abedi, 28, has always refused to answer questions from the inquiry in case he incriminates himself.\nIts chairman, Sir John Saunders, had rejected Ismail Abedi's position and demanded he appear as a witness.\nThe BBC found him in Manchester, where he still lived, last year and asked him why he was refusing to participate.\nAbedi left the UK some weeks ago on a flight to the Middle East, the BBC understands.\nHe asked for immunity from prosecution before he would agree to give evidence, but Sir John refused his request. \nTwenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017.\nHis younger brother Hashem Abedi was jailed last year after being convicted of murdering all those who died.\nPaul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, said Ismail Abedi was \"not currently in the country and there is no indication as to when he will return\".\nMr Greaney suggested Sir John may want to use his powers to compel attendance and urged Ismail Abedi to comply.\n\"As he surely must understand, the public may infer he has something to hide and so, sir, may you\", Mr Greaney said.\nIsmail Abedi was arrested the morning after the bombing and interviewed extensively by counter-terrorism police for nearly a fortnight but was later released without charge.\nHe denied any involvement in or knowledge of the bombing and stated he had played no part in the radicalisation of his younger brother.\nWhile he initially answered police questions, he subsequently gave \"no comment\" answers during the majority of his 25 interviews.\nThe inquiry was also told he was stopped by police after arriving at Heathrow Airport in 2015 and his mobile phone had contained recruitment videos and literature produced by the Islamic State group.\nThe hearing heard authorities viewed his Facebook account, which included a picture of him holding a machine gun with the Islamic State group logo imprinted on the image. \nEvidence presented during Hashem Abedi's trial also related to his brother Ismail.\nHis name was used to buy car insurance for Salman and Hashem Abedi, neither of whom had a driving licence, for a car they bought to transport materials around Manchester during the preparations before the attack. \nA bank card in the name of the brothers' mother Samia - which received more than \u00a31,000 in benefits each month despite her being in Libya - was used by Salman and Hashem Abedi to buy relevant items during their attack preparations.\nThe card was found in Ismail's possessions when he was arrested following the bombing.\nThe inquiry previously heard the police investigation remains open and there would be further attempts to speak to him.\nThe Abedi brothers' father Ramadan and mother, both suspects over the attack, are in Libya. Neither has engaged with the inquiry.\nMeanwhile, the inquiry has also heard Ahmed Taghdi, another witness due to give evidence this week, was stopped from leaving the UK on Monday.\nCurrently in custody, he is expected to appear before the inquiry as a witness on Thursday.\nThe hearing was told he was able to provide evidence of a return ticket to the UK on 20 October. His original destination was not disclosed.\nLast week, the inquiry chairman went to the High Court in order to compel the 29-year-old to attend.\nMr Taghdi, a childhood friend of Salman Abedi, was arrested during the police investigation into the atrocity. \nThe inquiry has previously heard how he accompanied Salman Abedi on a visit to jailed terrorist Abdalraouf Abdallah, who experts believe \"groomed\" the bomber and helped buy a car that was used to store explosives.\nMr Taghdi, who was a prosecution witness in the trial of Hashem Abedi, has denied any involvement in or knowledge of the attack when questioned by police and was later released without charge.\nHe is now due to give evidence on Thursday, while Abdallah, currently in custody, is due to give evidence on Wednesday, both in person.\nThe inquiry has been told that both are key witnesses as the hearings turn to why and how Salman and Hashem Abedi became radicalised. \nMr Greaney said: \"This is without question one of the most difficult and troubling questions for the inquiry to grapple with.\n\"It is very difficult to comprehend why a person with any shred of decency could ever think of detonating a suicide bomb in the midst of a crowd, killing or maiming many innocent victims.\"\nOn Tuesday the inquiry heard evidence from radicalisation expert Dr Matthew Wilkinson, who detailed his general overview report of Islamist extremism.\nHe will return to give evidence later this year on matters relating to Salman Abedi.\nThe inquiry will also hear evidence about Salman Abedi's family, his friends and associates, his internet and social media use, his educational background and the mosques which he and other family members attended.\nThe inquiry continues. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

That amount has climbed to \u00a378.54.\nHowever, 18 months after the coronavirus crisis started, visits are now less than twice a month.\nThat means the total average amount each month withdrawn per person has fallen \u00a344, from \u00a3200.97 to \u00a3157.08.\nThe total value of Link ATM withdrawals is currently running at around \u00a31.6bn a week, compared with around \u00a32.2bn in 2019.\nMeanwhile the amount people can spend on a contactless card rocketed to \u00a3100 earlier this month, after climbing to \u00a345 in April 2020.\n\"Crucially, even though we're withdrawing almost \u00a3100m less per day, millions still rely on cash, especially in the most deprived areas of the country,\" said Mr Quin.\n\"It is important we continue to protect access to cash across the country.\"\nThe latest Financial Lives survey from the Financial Conduct Authority showed that more than five million people rely on cash every day.\nLink's new figures suggest that some wealthier parts of Edinburgh and London have shown a fall in cash machine use by as much as 60%.\nBut there remains a greater reliance on cash in areas such as Liverpool, Bradford and Birmingham where the fall in ATM usage is considerably smaller.\nLink said it heard from more 400 communities this year wanting better cash access.\nIt has installed more than 70 machines across the country in response to those requests and a further 30 in areas identified as lacking cash access.\nIt said it is encouraging people to speak up if they find it difficult to access cash free of charge.\n\"It is important we continue to protect access to cash across the country,\" said Mr Quin.\nLink said the number of ATMs has not dropped as quickly as cash usage. \nSince the beginning of the pandemic, the number of free-to-use ATMs has dropped 9% from 45,000 to 41,000.\nIn July the Financial Conduct Authority warned that people living in rural areas are having to travel further to find somewhere to withdraw and deposit cash free of charge.\nThe City watchdog said almost every urban resident has access to a bank, building society, post office or ATM within two kilometres of their home, but only three-quarters of the UK rural population has similar access.\nIt is considering stronger requirements of the sector to ensure the millions of people who rely on notes and coins have access to it.\nMeanwhile the charity Age UK said that people required the same guarantee of access to cash as they did for running water, electricity and the post.\nAbout 2.4 million people aged 65-and-over rely on cash in their daily lives, it said.\nThe charity warned that many would face being excluded from society if they could not get hold of notes and coins.\nConstituency areas with the smallest percentage declines in the volume of cash withdrawals:\n* based on figures from Link comparing August 2019 with August 2021\nConstituency areas with the biggest percentage declines in the volume of cash withdrawals:\n* based on figures from Link comparing August 2019 with August 2021"

      "tags": "David Amess death,Priti Patel,Counter-terrorism",
      "text": "The terror threat level currently facing MPs has been raised from \"moderate\" to \"substantial\" following a review, the government has announced.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel told the Commons that police and intelligence services would \"properly\" reflect the change in their security arrangements.\nBut she added there was no information on \"any credible or specific threat\".\nThe announcement comes after Conservative MP Sir David Amess was killed in his constituency on Friday.\nHis stabbing, while meeting constituents at a church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, came five years after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox.\nA 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after the attack on Sir David and police are treating the killing as a terrorist incident.\nFollowing a security review by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, Ms Patel told the Commons: \"While we do not see any information or intelligence which points to any credible or specific or imminent threat, I must update the House that the threat level facing Members of Parliament is now deemed to be substantial.\"\nShe added: \"I can assure the House that our world-class intelligence and security agencies and counter-terror police will now ensure that this change is properly reflected in the operational posture.\" \nThe terror threat for the UK as a whole is currently also deemed to be \"substantial\", meaning an attack is \"likely\". At the \"moderate\" level, this is judged to be \"possible but not likely\".\nThe terror threat level is best understood as a shorthand that serves two purposes. \nFirst, it gives the public an insight into what security chiefs think. So while not as remotely revealing as local crime statistics - it gives us a bit of a clue as to the national picture and, in theory, helps keep the public aware. \nSecondly, it should help keep the UK's security and emergency agencies on their toes by making sure they have got the right plans and resources in place to minimise the likelihood or impact of an attack.\nFor 11 years, the level has been broken down publicly into three parts: The threat from international terrorism, the threat from Northern Ireland paramilitaries inside Northern Ireland - and the threat from those paramilitary groups to the rest of the UK. \nMy understanding is that until Wednesday there was not a formal assessment of the threat to Parliamentarians which had been kept secret.\nThe Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre - the body that analyses and assesses all available intelligence to come up with the rating would regularly discuss the safety of MPs in a similar way to how it would debate the threats to other potential targets in society. \nThat broad-brush assessment has now been formalised into an official rating of its own.\nAddressing the Commons, Ms Patel also called social media a \"cruel space\", saying: \"It has become far too permissive for too much cruelty and harm and it's not just levelled and leveraged towards elected Members of Parliament.\n\"We see children, different people of different races, religious groups being targeted and affected by some of the most awful, barbaric statements. That is what has to stop and change.\"\nFor Labour, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on the the government to outline what would be done to protect the staff of MPs.\nHe added: \"In order to stand firm in the face of these threats, we must do everything possible to guard against these violent positions, not least as we hear, as the home secretary has set out, that the threat level to MPs has been raised to substantial, and we accept the assessment made by the joint terrorism assessment centre that the threat has increased.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Some Covid restrictions must immediately be reintroduced if England is to avoid \"stumbling into a winter crisis\", health leaders have warned.\nThe NHS Confederation said a back-up strategy, or Plan B, which includes mandatory face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces, should be implemented.\nUK cases have been rising sharply but deaths are well below the winter peak. \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said it was not time for Plan B yet and urged greater uptake of booster jabs.\nHe said he did not want further lockdowns or to jeopardise the \"hard-won gains\" of reopening the economy.\n\"I don't want to inject any hint of complacency but I think so far our approach is working\" he said, pointing to lower rates of hospital admissions and deaths than in earlier waves of infection.\nDaily Covid cases have been above 40,000 for eight days in a row, with 49,139 new infections reported on Wednesday, and, as of Tuesday, there were 7,891 patients in hospital.\nAnother 179 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid.\nDowning Street said on Wednesday that there were no plans to activate Plan B for winter, saying that they would continue to monitor the data but that vaccination had broken the link between cases, hospital admissions and deaths. \n\"Our focus remains on ensuring we get boosters out to those who are eligible,\" a No 10 spokesman said.\nUnder the government's Plan A for dealing with Covid in England this winter, which is currently in place, booster jabs are being offered to about 30 million people, a single dose of a vaccine is available for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds and people are advised to wear face coverings in crowded places.\nIf these measures are not enough to prevent \"unsustainable pressure\" on the NHS, then steps like making face coverings mandatory in some settings, asking people to work from home and introducing vaccine passports could be considered as part of Plan B.\nMatthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, which represents health service organisations, urged the government to roll out Plan B to avoid hospitals becoming overwhelmed.\n\"The health service is right at the edge,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nThe pressures would only grow worse and the nation had to make a decision to take pre-emptive action, he said, adding: \"Or do we stumble into a crisis once again, despite the evidence?\"\n\ufeffIt is not surprising that NHS leaders are warning about a very challenging time ahead with the risk of a \"winter crisis\". \nSome may feel it is a familiar refrain and that the health service often raises concerns ahead of winter.  \nBut the significance of this intervention by the NHS Confederation is that it came just hours after Downing Street had ruled out Plan B at this stage and said it had not been discussed by the cabinet. \nThe confederation is, in effect, taking issue with ministers by suggesting the key government test for implementing Plan B in England - the likelihood of the NHS coming under unsustainable pressure - has already been met. \nConcerns about the pace of the rollout of the vaccine booster programme and a steady increase in Covid cases and hospital numbers have left some amber lights flashing. \nMinisters will argue more time is needed to assess data before taking big decisions on restrictions affecting everyday lives. \nBut they have acknowledged they will now be keeping \"a very close eye\" on case numbers.\nThe NHS Confederation has also called for a package of further measures to support frontline services - what it terms as a \"Plan B plus\". This could include encouraging people to get vaccinated, turn up to appointments on time and even volunteer to support the NHS.\nAs the UK's early vaccine rollout means some people may be at risk of waning immunity, there has been criticism over the pace of the booster jab programme. \nAbout 4.8 million people had their second dose more than six months ago, but have not yet received the top-up - a gap that is growing each week.\nBut NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard told MPs on Tuesday that \"there is no delay\" in sending out invitations for booster jabs. Instead she put it down to people being slow to coming forward for their third dose.\nProf Adam Finn from the University of Bristol, one of the members of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), urged the government to encourage greater voluntary measures now that we had a higher level of infections than at any point in the pandemic.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \"Relying on the vaccine programme to take care of the problem is not going to be a solution, I'm afraid.\"\nProf Andrew Pollard, chair of the JCVI, said Covid hospital admissions tended now to be elderly people with other health conditions, who don't have severe symptoms and are staying for a shorter period of time before being discharged.\n\"The biggest pressure is still the unvaccinated, from an intensive care perspective,\" he told the Today programme. \"The boosters don't have an impact on that, that's where we really need to have people who are unvaccinated to be vaccinated.\"\nOn Tuesday Northern Ireland announced its own autumn and winter plan, which will see face coverings remain a legal requirement in crowded indoor spaces. \nThe Welsh government has previously set out its plans for winter, with First Minister Mark Drakeford saying Christmas this year was likely to be more normal. \nScotland has set out a winter vaccination strategy and already has measures in place such as the requirement of proof of vaccination status at nightclubs and face masks in schools.\nMeanwhile, officials say they are monitoring a new descendant of the Delta variant of Covid, which is causing a growing number of infections.\nDowning Street said there was \"no evidence to suggest it is more easily spread\"."

      "tags": "Climate change",
      "text": "Imagine your future home as an energy hub storing electricity from the grid when clean wind power is plentiful, and then selling it back - at a profit - when demand surges elsewhere.\nFor Sussex grandmother Kate Giammatteo, that future is happening right now.\nShe has batteries bolted to the front of her Worthing flat that do just that, and they are forecast to cut her energy bill by \u00a3173 a year.\nAnd what's good for Kate will be good for the country, because as the UK shifts to electric heating and electric cars to meet its climate goals, the demand for electricity is expected to double by 2050.\nAlready the sector is under pressure to ramp up renewables, because Prime Minister Boris Johnson has mandated that all electricity must come from zero-carbon sources by 2035.\nMuch of the extra energy will be generated by wind power, which is clean and cheap - but - of course - dependent on the wind.\nThat leaves an intermittent hole in supplies. This can be by increasing energy storage using batteries or other technologies - but experts say part of the gap can be filled by enabling consumers to use electricity more flexibly.\nThat's where Kate fits in. The tale of her giant battery offers a glimpse of an energy future in which appliances will use power when it's plentiful, and conserve it when it's scarce.\nSo, you could allow your freezer to turn off for a short time to save power, and your washing machine to switch itself on in the afternoon to use cheap power.\nKhalid Abdulla, an engineer from Edinburgh, has a hot water tank from a firm called Mixergy that's automatically switched on by his energy supplier's computer when power is cheapest (it can be overruled manually).\nThe tank's insulation ensures the water remains hot whenever Khalid's ready for a shower. In effect, he's storing energy in hot water.\nIt will save Khalid money. And the technology has brought a bonus - the new system has allowed him to dispense with his second water tank, and free up storage for the paraphernalia that accompanies a new baby.\nBut this energy revolution stretches beyond the home, because more and more businesses are being paid by electricity suppliers to use the grid differently.\nWhen supplies are plentiful, big refrigeration plants can utilise the power to chill their freezers even harder. Then when there's a surge in demand, they can power down as the freezer temperatures slip back to normal.\nThey are paid in effect for storing energy through cold. Some hotels do the same with their air conditioning. Some asphalt plants are super-heating the asphalt when power is cheap - then allowing the temperature to drop as demand peaks. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nBig prices are charged by firms volunteering to turn off their power for a spell when it's needed elsewhere. The steel giant Corus has offered to switch off its supply from time to time for \u00a345,000 per Megawatt. One estimate suggests the value of the flex-elecs market by 2030 will be \u00a32.4bn a year.\nOne firm involved in a UK government trial, Geo, claimed it showed a DSR system could save 49% on utility bills for homes with electrical heating and electric cars. There would be CO2 savings, too.\n\"They are pretty amazing figures, but they are achievable in the majority of homes as time goes on,\" its CEO, Steve Cunningham, told me.\nWhat's more, those savings were achieved using only major contributors such as home heating and hot water. Even more cash would have been saved, he said, if appliances such as freezers and washing machines were fitted with smart plugs so they could also be controlled individually from afar.\nHe said smart thermostats costing \u00a325 could save gas heating by learning how fast a house heats up and cools down, and adjusting boiler use accordingly. \"It's tragic that people who most need tech like this can't afford to access it,\" he said.\nSo how big a role can reducing demand play in smoothing the peaks of electricity use? Sara Walker, reader in energy at Newcastle University, says it needs a big push from policy-makers. \nShe told me: \"There's great potential but there appears little attention on the subject at government level. We really need a strong policy signal - and we're not getting it.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Science policy,Chancellor's Autumn Statement,Greg Clark",
      "text": "One of the scientists behind the Oxford Covid vaccine has said that our lives depend on future investment in science.\nProf Sir Andrew Pollard told BBC News that other nations will overtake the UK unless the Chancellor sticks to his commitment to double science spending.\nScientific leaders have been making representations to the Treasury ahead of next week's Autumn Budget.\nThere is concern that a pledge to increase funding to \u00a322bn by 2024 will not be met.\nProf Pollard told BBC News: \"Our very lives depend on our investment in science because so much of what we aspire to in our society requires a strong scientific base. We absolutely have to invest in science otherwise we will fall behind other countries over the months and years ahead.\"\nThose lobbying the Treasury to stick to its commitment have highlighted the key role UK science played in developing vaccines, drugs and providing invaluable scientific advice to the public and ministers throughout the pandemic.\nAnd the chair of the Commons Science and Technology Committee, Greg Clark, said a failure to keep to the pledge could threaten the UK's economic growth: \"As we prepare to compete as a country in the future, it is unquestionable that one of our strongest assets is our science and technology base.\n\"The world is becoming scientifically more intensive. For us to go backwards would be to opt out of future prosperity.\"\nTwo British Nobel prize winners gave evidence to Mr Clark's committee this morning. One, Prof Sir Paul Nurse, said: \"We have to have a country that thrives on brains and skills and that is driven by science and research.\"\nThe other, Prof Sir Peter Ratcliffe, told MPs that the UK government failing to invest in science would be like New Zealand not investing in rugby.\n\"We are good at it. Why wouldn't you invest behind strength,\" he said.\n\"You might get away with slightly smaller investment than other countries for a while, but that's not going to last.\"\nIn November 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to double the amount the government spends on scientific research. That pledge was reinforced by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak in March 2020, when he committed the government to the \u00a322bn increase.\nThe spending hike was to keep up with the UK's economic competitors, which have been investing heavily in research. British science is seen as among the best in the world, but successive governments have been spending a smaller proportion of GDP on research and development (R&D) compared with other advanced economies.\nThe UK's increase in R&D spending as a proportion of GDP between 1999 and 2019 has been 0.1%, considerably less than many of its economic competitors.\nThe ambitious spending boost announced by the Chancellor last year was to help the government meet another of its objectives: for private and public spending on research in the UK to reach 2.4% of GDP by 2027. But even that target is a relatively modest aim as it would still leave the UK behind Germany, Japan, Korea and the US.\nAn analysis by the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) indicates that if the government puts off increasing annual research spending to \u00a322bn by 2024 by three years it will lose \u00a311bn of investment from the private sector and so fail to reach its target of 2.4% of GDP.\nProf Sarah Main, who is the campaign's executive director, said that without the investment that has been promised, the UK could lose jobs and economic growth in the process: \"While the UK target is ambitious, it is the least ambitious target of all the G7 countries,\" she told BBC News.\n\"Across the world, other countries are pushing fast and hard on their science and innovation capability. The risk is that ideas, talented people and opportunities for investment ad partnerships will move overseas.\"\nThose close to negotiations with the Treasury told BBC News they received \"strong signals\" last week that, while the government would maintain its target of increasing annual science spending to \u00a322bn, it would not commit to do so by 2024. \nThere was also concern that the chancellor would give the appearance of an increase by adding existing spending to the science budget - but the reality could be flat cash for several more years.\nWith a week to go before the chancellor's Autumn budget, all the submissions have been made. The Treasury has produced its calculations and come up with its plan. \nThe proposed budgets for each part of government are now in a political phase and simply put, it is now up to Boris Johnson whether to exert pressure on the Treasury to deliver on the promise he made to transform the UK economy into a \"science superpower\".\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"

      "tags": "Lord Janner,Child abuse,Leicester,Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse",
      "text": "Police investigations into allegations of child abuse against a former MP were marred by \"a series of failings\", a report has found.\nThe Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said Leicestershire Police officers \"shut down\" investigations into Lord Janner \"without pursuing all inquiries\".\nIt also criticised Leicestershire County Council's \"sorry record of failures\" over abuse.\nThe former MP died in December 2015.\nProfessor Alexis Jay, chairman of the inquiry, said police and prosecutors \"appeared reluctant to fully investigate\" claims against Lord Janner despite \"numerous serious allegations\".\n\"On multiple occasions police put too little emphasis on looking for supporting evidence and shut down investigations without pursuing all outstanding inquiries,\" she said.\n\"This inquiry has brought up themes we are now extremely familiar with, such as deference to powerful individuals, the barriers to reporting faced by children and the need for institutions to have clear policies and procedures setting out how to respond to allegations of child sexual abuse.\"\nLord Janner's family has always maintained his innocence.\nHis son Daniel said the inquiry \"fails to challenge our late father's innocence\" and \"offers no proof whatsoever of guilt\".\nThe inquiry heard accounts from 33 complainants, with allegations of abuse stretching across three decades.\nIn 1999, Leicestershire Police's Operation Magnolia looked into allegations made against the politician, but the inquiry found it \"seemingly involved a deliberate decision by [the force] to withhold key statements\" from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which it described as \"serious and inexcusable\".\nOperation Dauntless was set up in May 2006 following further claims from another alleged victim, with the report criticising police and CPS decisions not to carry on the investigation as \"unsound and strategically flawed\".\nIn 2012 a further police probe, named Operation Enamel, was set up to look at evidence that may not have been considered in earlier investigations.\nAfter further evidence and more complainants came forward, Lord Janner was charged with 22 offences, including indecent assault and buggery, which dated from the 1960s to the 1980s.\nAt the time of his death, Lord Janner was due to face a trial over claims made by nine complainants, with the prosecution seeking to add further charges.\nIn October 2020, the inquiry heard evidence from Lord Janner's alleged victims.\nNone of the complainants were called to give evidence in person, due to it focusing solely on the state responses to their allegations, rather than the authenticity of the claims.\nChristopher Jacobs, who represented some of the complainants, described the case of Tracey Taylor - who has waived her right to anonymity - who was put into care as a 14-year-old in the 1970s.\n\"She said she was raped by a man who said his name was Greville Janner, he said he was an MP and that he could make her the next prime minister's wife,\" Mr Jacobs told the inquiry.\n\"She has told the police about the abuse, but she has never been believed due to her mental health problems. On some occasions, police mocked her statements, calling her Crazy Tracey.\" \nTim Betteridge, another complainant to waive his anonymity, said he was sexually abused by Lord Janner on two occasions, including once in an allotment and once in a mobile unit.\nThe inquiry heard Mr Betteridge raised the alarm but was told by care home staff \"nobody would believe him because he was just a brat in care\".\nBy Tom Symonds, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent\nThis report did not find evidence of a conspiracy to protect a local MP, but its officials believe what they discovered was actually more serious. \nAdults who had grown up in children's homes weren't taken seriously when they came forward to make allegations, because of their backgrounds. \nThe claims of one accuser were rejected because he may have had a history of mental illness. However, later police inquiries looked at his medical records and concluded that wasn't the case. \nThis investigation isn't the only one where the inquiry has seen evidence that alleged crimes against children have been dismissed prematurely. \nIts final report will have to come up with recommendations to prevent it happening again. \nThe inquiry also heard \"a number\" of staff at Leicestershire County Council had concerns over Lord Janner's association with a child in care.\nThe report stated \"undue deference\" was shown to the politician, who had \"unrestricted access\" to the child, with \"little if any thought given to any child protection issues\".\nNo inquiries were made into staff concerns, and the council has accepted it \"failed to take adequate steps in response\" to them.\nThe inquiry also examined the Labour Party's response to the allegations, saying it was not enough for it to leave it to the police and CPS due to Lord Janner's \"privileged and powerful position\".\nDavid Evans, the current general secretary, told the inquiry new systems were now in place should any allegations be made against a sitting MP.\nThe inquiry also said Lord Janner should have been subject to scrutiny when he was nominated for a peerage by then-prime minister Tony Blair, weeks after sweeping to power in 1997.\nMr Blair previously told the inquiry he was aware of the allegations but they were not a \"bar\" as Lord Janner had denied them, and there had not been any charges.\nLeicestershire Police said the force would study the report \"scrupulously and examine it for any actions or improvements\".\nChief Constable Simon Cole said: \"I would like to reiterate the wholehearted apology I gave in February 2020 to any complainant whose allegations during earlier police investigations into Lord Janner were not responded to as they should have been.\n\"It is fair and correct to say that the allegations could and should have been investigated more thoroughly, and Lord Janner could and should have faced prosecution earlier than 2015.\"\nLeicestershire County Council leader Nick Rushton said the authority accepted the report's findings.\n\"The council at the time simply did not do enough to keep the children in its care safe and for that, I am sorry,\" Mr Rushton said.\nA spokesperson for the CPS added: \"The CPS has acknowledged past failings in the way allegations made against Lord Janner were handled. It remains a matter of sincere regret that opportunities were missed to put these allegations before a jury.\"\nRichard Scorer, a lawyer at Slater and Gordon - which represented 14 complainants at the inquiry - said: \"Had investigations been conducted properly, it is clear that Lord Janner could have been prosecuted in his lifetime.\n\"Sadly the clock cannot be rolled back and the criminal trial of Lord Janner which could and should have taken place will never be possible.\"\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by this story please visit the BBC Action Line."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Some Covid restrictions must immediately be reintroduced if England is to avoid \"stumbling into a winter crisis\", health leaders have warned.\nThe NHS Confederation said a back-up strategy, or Plan B, which includes mandatory face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces, should be implemented.\nUK cases have been rising sharply but deaths are well below the winter peak. \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said it was not time for Plan B yet and urged greater uptake of booster jabs.\nHe said he did not want further lockdowns or to jeopardise the \"hard-won gains\" of reopening the economy.\n\"I don't want to inject any hint of complacency but I think so far our approach is working\" he said, pointing to lower rates of hospital admissions and deaths than in earlier waves of infection.\nDaily Covid cases have been above 40,000 for eight days in a row, with 49,139 new infections reported on Wednesday, and, as of Tuesday, there were 7,891 patients in hospital.\nAnother 179 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid.\nDowning Street said on Wednesday that there were no plans to activate Plan B for winter, saying that they would continue to monitor the data but that vaccination had broken the link between cases, hospital admissions and deaths. \n\"Our focus remains on ensuring we get boosters out to those who are eligible,\" a No 10 spokesman said.\nUnder the government's Plan A for dealing with Covid in England this winter, which is currently in place, booster jabs are being offered to about 30 million people, a single dose of a vaccine is available for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds and people are advised to wear face coverings in crowded places.\nIf these measures are not enough to prevent \"unsustainable pressure\" on the NHS, then steps like making face coverings mandatory in some settings, asking people to work from home and introducing vaccine passports could be considered as part of Plan B.\nMatthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, which represents health service organisations, urged the government to roll out Plan B to avoid hospitals becoming overwhelmed.\n\"The health service is right at the edge,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nThe pressures would only grow worse and the nation had to make a decision to take pre-emptive action, he said, adding: \"Or do we stumble into a crisis once again, despite the evidence?\"\n\ufeffIt is not surprising that NHS leaders are warning about a very challenging time ahead with the risk of a \"winter crisis\". \nSome may feel it is a familiar refrain and that the health service often raises concerns ahead of winter.  \nBut the significance of this intervention by the NHS Confederation is that it came just hours after Downing Street had ruled out Plan B at this stage and said it had not been discussed by the cabinet. \nThe confederation is, in effect, taking issue with ministers by suggesting the key government test for implementing Plan B in England - the likelihood of the NHS coming under unsustainable pressure - has already been met. \nConcerns about the pace of the rollout of the vaccine booster programme and a steady increase in Covid cases and hospital numbers have left some amber lights flashing. \nMinisters will argue more time is needed to assess data before taking big decisions on restrictions affecting everyday lives. \nBut they have acknowledged they will now be keeping \"a very close eye\" on case numbers.\nThe NHS Confederation has also called for a package of further measures to support frontline services - what it terms as a \"Plan B plus\". This could include encouraging people to get vaccinated, turn up to appointments on time and even volunteer to support the NHS.\nAs the UK's early vaccine rollout means some people may be at risk of waning immunity, there has been criticism over the pace of the booster jab programme. \nAbout 4.8 million people had their second dose more than six months ago, but have not yet received the top-up - a gap that is growing each week.\nBut NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard told MPs on Tuesday that \"there is no delay\" in sending out invitations for booster jabs. Instead she put it down to people being slow to coming forward for their third dose.\nProf Adam Finn from the University of Bristol, one of the members of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), urged the government to encourage greater voluntary measures now that we had a higher level of infections than at any point in the pandemic.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \"Relying on the vaccine programme to take care of the problem is not going to be a solution, I'm afraid.\"\nProf Andrew Pollard, chair of the JCVI, said Covid hospital admissions tended now to be elderly people with other health conditions, who don't have severe symptoms and are staying for a shorter period of time before being discharged.\n\"The biggest pressure is still the unvaccinated, from an intensive care perspective,\" he told the Today programme. \"The boosters don't have an impact on that, that's where we really need to have people who are unvaccinated to be vaccinated.\"\nOn Tuesday Northern Ireland announced its own autumn and winter plan, which will see face coverings remain a legal requirement in crowded indoor spaces. \nThe Welsh government has previously set out its plans for winter, with First Minister Mark Drakeford saying Christmas this year was likely to be more normal. \nScotland has set out a winter vaccination strategy and already has measures in place such as the requirement of proof of vaccination status at nightclubs and face masks in schools.\nMeanwhile, officials say they are monitoring a new descendant of the Delta variant of Covid, which is causing a growing number of infections.\nDowning Street said there was \"no evidence to suggest it is more easily spread\"."

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer is demanding urgent government action to \"clean out the cesspit\" of online extremism.\nThe Labour leader offered to work with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to fast track new online safety laws.\nMr Johnson promised to get the first stage of the long-awaited Online Safety Bill through the Commons by Christmas.\nHe said it would include criminal sanctions for those allowing \"foul content\" - but did not confirm whether that would include company directors. \nLabour is calling for the directors of internet firms to be held liable for the content of messages posted on their sites.\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said it was now three years since the government had promised a crackdown on online extremism and hate speech but the proposals had yet to begin their passage into law.\n\"Meanwhile, the damage caused by harmful content online is worse than ever,\" he told MPs.\nHe criticised \"dangerous algorithms\" on Facebook and Instagram - and said he had been shown examples of \"violent Islamism and far-right propaganda\" on TikTok, a social media site popular with teenagers.\nBut he added: \"Telegram has been described as the app of choice for extremists.\"\nTelegram, which has half-a-billion users, is a messaging app, which also has \"channels\" allowing individuals to broadcast to an unlimited audience.\nTelegram has risen to global prominence as an app of choice to co-ordinate global protest movements; but has also been accused of not doing enough to purge extremist channels run by those involved with the so-called Islamic State group and the Capitol Hill riots.\nCampaign group Hope Not Hate and the Board of Deputies of British Jews had both said the free-to-use encrypted messaging service had \"facilitated and nurtured a sub-culture that cheerleads terrorists\", Sir Keir said.\nThe messages shown to Sir Keir by Hope Not Hate, posted by anonymous Telegram users, include threats to \"kill all women\", \"kill politicians\" as well as homophobic, Islamophobic and racist abuse.\nSir Keir said \"tough sanctions\" were needed - but the government's proposed legislation did not include criminal sanctions against the directors of online platforms.\nMr Johnson said the government would look at ways to \"toughen up\" the law and promised to \"come down hard on those who irresponsibly allow dangerous and extremist content to permeate the internet\".\nHe added: \"What we hope for also, is that no matter how tough the proposals we produce, that the opposition will support it.\"\nRegulator Ofcom would have the power to levy fines of up to \u00a318m or 10% of global profits, whichever is higher, on social media platforms which fail to comply with the new online safety laws.\nThe regulator would also be given the power to block services from the UK if they are deemed to present a risk of significant harm to UK citizens.\nThe bill also includes an option to introduce a new criminal offence for senior managers if further action is needed to ensure compliance - something Labour has been calling for.\nAsked if Mr Johnson was now backing criminal sanctions, a Downing Street spokesperson said the government was \"alive\" to the issue, adding: \"We will continue to listen and work with the companies involved.\"\nConservative MP and chairman of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport committee Julian Knight said a quicker timetable for the bill risked undermining scrutiny of it.\n\"We find ourselves in an unworkable situation where, at the whim of the prime minister at the despatch box, the process of scrutiny of this important piece of legislation to tackle online harms will be undermined. We need urgent clarity on this matter,\" said Mr Knight.\nBy Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed that the messaging app Telegram is \"the app of choice\" for extremists. But is he right?\nExtremist content has been largely forced off mainstream social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and terror groups have moved elsewhere in attempts to spread their ideologies.\nTelegram has half a billion users, the vast majority using the service in the way it was designed - to exchange messages, images and video with friends, family, and people with shared interests. \nIn countries like Iran, it's one of the few platforms where people can speak freely about social issues and politics without fear of persecution.\nHowever, there are significant numbers who use Telegram to share extremist content and illegal pornography. \nAttracted by the platform's secret chats with end-to-end encryption and its seemingly relaxed content moderation policies, Telegram became a haven for jihadist groups, earning it the name \"Terrorgram\". Working with international law enforcement agencies, Telegram has been successful in eliminating most jihadist content.\nBut other extreme content, including what might be defined as \"terrorist\" is still present. It's easy to find racism, sexist and homophobic abuse, anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism, violent imagery, and encouragement of criminal activity on Telegram from users in the UK and around the world.\nTelegram told the BBC that it was \"surprised\" by Sir Keir's statement, saying that \"calls for violence are expressly forbidden on Telegram\". \n\"Our moderators routinely remove content that violates this rule using a combination of proactive monitoring of public spaces and user reports,\" the Telegram statement concluded."

      "text": "Shareholders in the supermarket chain Morrisons have approved a multi-billion pound takeover offer from a US private equity group. \nClayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) can now continue to take over the UK's fourth-largest supermarket group.\nMorrisons said 99.2% of shareholders voted in favour of the \u00a37bn ($9.7bn) deal.\nThe takeover had been the subject of fierce competition from two US-based investment groups.\nThe CD&R private equity group won the auction early in October with an offer of 287p per Morrisons ordinary share, against a rival bid from Fortress, for 286p per share.\nCD&R's auction offer was slightly higher than the 285p-a-share offer that was recommended by Morrisons' board in August.\nIn July, Morrisons turned down an offer worth \u00a35.5bn from CD&R, saying it significantly undervalued the business.\nThe takeover marks a return to the UK grocery sector for Sir Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, who is a senior adviser to CD&R.\nMorrisons chair Andrew Higginson said: \"We thank shareholders for the strong support received at today's meetings.\n\"We remain confident that CD&R will be a responsible, thoughtful and careful owner of Morrisons and we will now move forward with the remaining steps in the acquisition process.\"\nThere has been speculation that Sir Terry could be appointed as chair of Morrisons.\nOn Tuesday, Sir Terry said: \"We are very pleased to have received the approval of shareholders and are excited at the opportunity that lies ahead.\n\"The particular heritage, culture and operating model of Morrisons are key features of the company and we will be very mindful of these during our tenure as owners.\n\"We very much look forward to working with the Morrisons team, not just to preserve the company's many strengths - but to build on these, with innovation, capital and new technology - helping the business realise its full potential and delivering for all of its stakeholders.\"\nThe deal is expected to complete on 27 October.\nMorrisons has been involved in a legal dispute over equal pay since 2019.\nLast month Leeds Employment Tribunal found that Morrisons' shop floor workers, who are mostly female, could compare their pay with the supermarket's mostly male warehouse workers. \nShop floor staff are hoping to claim up to \u00a3100m in missed pay. \nLaw firms Leigh Day and Roscoe Reid have been representing about 2,300 Morrisons workers. \nEmma Satyamurti, a Leigh Day partner, said the takeover deal shows that employees are the \"backbone of the company and so it makes sense that the supermarket should invest in them\".\n\"We hope the new owners feel the same and bring an end to the equal pay dispute by paying shop floor workers what they are worth.\"\nMorrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The group has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff.\nThe son of founder William Morrison's, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for 50 years.\nPreviously, CD&R said it recognised Morrisons' \"history and culture, and considers that this strong heritage is core to Morrisons and its approach to grocery retailing\".\nThe private equity firm said it would help Morrisons to build on its strengths, including its close relationships with suppliers and its property portfolio.\nMorrisons chairman Andrew Higginson and chief operating officer Trevor Strain both previously worked with Sir Terry at Tesco."

Another 17 people were wounded.\nThe case will now head to a penalty trial in which jurors must determine whether Mr Cruz is spared the death penalty to face life without parole. \nJudge Elizabeth Scherer has said she hopes that the case - for which thousands of jurors will have to be screened - can begin in January. \nIn court on Wednesday, Judge Scherer asked Mr Cruz how he pleaded to each murder. \nFollowing the plea, Mr Cruz tearfully addressed the judge and the victims' families. \n\"I am very sorry for what I did and have to live with it every day,\" he said. \"If I were to get a second chance, I would do everything in my power to help others.\" \nMr Cruz added that he has \"nightmares\" about his crime and \"can't live with\" himself.  He also said that he believes that the US would \"do better if everyone would stop smoking marijuana\".\nLawyers representing Mr Cruz had repeatedly said that he would plead guilty if the death penalty was not considered. Last week, his attorney, David Wheeler, told the judge that Mr Cruz's lawyers were asking the court to impose 17 consecutive life sentences for the massacre. \nThe offer had been rejected by prosecutors, who in earlier court documents said they would seek his execution and prove that the crime \"was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel\".\nFollowing the hearing, Tony Montalto - whose 14-year-old daughter Gina was killed in the shooting - told the Associated Press that Mr Cruz's guilty pleas \"are the first step in the judicial process\".\n\"But there is no change for my family,\" he added. \"Our bright, beautiful and beloved daughter Gina is gone while her killer still enjoys the blessing of life in prison.\"\nMarch for Our Lives, a gun law reform organisation started by Parkland survivors in the wake of the shooting, said in a statement that it has \"no comment\" on Mr Cruz and \"a guilty plea will not erase the past, and it will not bring us peace\".  \n\"What is clear is that gun violence is a systemic crisis and a uniquely American epidemic,\" the statement said. \nThe organisation added that it is \"appalled and disgusted that policymakers continue to waffle and play games\" rather than implement reforms. \"We are not at peace, we are as angry and determined as ever.\"\nLast week, Mr Cruz pleaded guilty to a separate charge of attempted aggravated battery and three other felony charges stemming from an attack on a jail guard nine months after the shooting. \nOn Wednesday, Judge Scherer sentenced Mr Cruz to 26 years in prison for the jailhouse assault. \nIn a hearing on Friday, he acknowledged that his conviction in the jailhouse assault could become an \"aggravating factor\" in determining whether he will be executed. \nAhead of Mr Cruz's guilty plea, Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed in the shooting, told CBS News that he hoped that Mr Cruz would pay for his crimes \"with his life\".\n\"My daughter should be living the best years of her life. My son heard his sister get shot and his life is forever impacted. My wife and I had two children that killer took this from us.\"\nMr Cruz had been expelled from the school in 2017. Students and staff later described him as an \"outcast\" and troublemaker.\nHe had previously been investigated by local police and the Department of Children and Family Services after posting evidence of self-harm on the Snapchat app.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later admitted it did not properly follow up on a tip-off about Mr Cruz the month before the shooting.\nMany of the shooting's survivors went on to become prominent advocates for gun legislation reform and have demanded that action be taken to prevent similar incidents.\nIn an event marking the third anniversary of the shooting in February, US President Joe Biden called for Congress to pass gun law reforms, including a ban on assault weapons and an end to legal immunity for gun manufacturers.\n\"We owe it to all those we've lost and to all those left behind to grieve to make a change,\" Mr Biden said. \"The time to act is now.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "If not enough people get vaccinated, it is more likely restrictions will be reintroduced in England, the health secretary has said. \nSajid Javid said the government would not be bringing in its Plan B measures, which include mandatory face coverings and working from home, \"at this point\". \nHe added that he did not believe the current pressures on the NHS were unsustainable. \nBut he warned cases could rise to 100,000 a day. \nDaily Covid cases have been above 40,000 for eight days in a row, with 49,139 new infections reported on Wednesday. \nNHS leaders have said some restrictions must immediately be reintroduced if England is to avoid \"stumbling into a winter crisis\".\nUnder the government's plan for tackling Covid in England over the winter, restrictions will only be reintroduced if the NHS comes under \"unsustainable pressure\". \nPlan B also includes introducing mandatory Covid passports. \nMr Javid told a Downing Street news conference: \"If not enough people get their booster jabs, if not enough of those people that were eligible for the original offer... if they don't come forward, if people don't wear masks when they really should in a really crowded place with lots of people that they don't normally hang out with, if they're not washing their hands and stuff, it's going to hit us all.\n\"And it would of course make it more likely we're going to have more restrictions.\"\nHowever, No 10 earlier said there were no plans for another lockdown in England. \nAsked about the pressures on the NHS, Mr Javid said: \"Don't get me wrong, there are huge pressures, especially in A&E, in primary care. At this point we don't believe they're unsustainable.\"\n\"If we feel at any point it's becoming unsustainable\u2026 we won't hesitate to act,\" he added. \nProf Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said he expected the number of Covid patients in hospitals to continue to rise due to the high number of infections in the community.\n\"It undoubtedly feels exceptionally busy in the NHS and our NHS organisations are telling us that all the time,\" he said. \nProf Powis said there was \"no one number\" that the government would consider to trigger new restrictions - but it would look at factors including infection rates, vaccine effectiveness, hospital admissions, as well as flu and other viruses. \nAs of Tuesday, there were 7,891 patients in hospital. Another 179 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus on Wednesday. \nIt is important to remember that the situation is very different to 12 months ago.\nThe vaccination programme has transformed the situation, and has completely changed the calculation for ministers about the risks of coronavirus cases spreading, versus the many downsides of restrictions.\nBut there are nerves in Westminster about what might happen next. The health secretary warned the pandemic is not over, and the government's efforts to control it can't be either.\nAnd once again, at those famous three lecterns in Downing Street, ministers are asking all of us to think again about how we act.\nThe ultimate fear from the government's critics is that, in an echo of last autumn, their actions to control the disease could come too late.\nRead more from Laura.\nMr Javid also announced that people eligible for a Covid booster jab can book online if they have not received an invite from the NHS. \nBooster doses can be offered to people who are at least six months on from receiving their second dose. \nThe health secretary said boosters could be booked online if people had not been invited within a week of reaching the six month milestone.\nSeparately, around 14% of people in the UK aged 12 and over remain unvaccinated. \nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth accused Mr Javid of complacency, telling the BBC: \"The simple truth is that the so-called wall of defence we've built up with vaccination is now crumbling.\"\nHe said it was disappointing the health secretary did not give details on \"how he is going to grip this and drive up the vaccinations we need\". \nMeanwhile, the government has agreed deals for two new Covid treatments. \nThe Antivirals Taskforce has secured 480,000 courses of molnupiravir, which trials found cuts the risk of hospital admission or death by about half, as well as 250,000 courses of PF-07321332/ritonavir, which is currently undergoing clinical trials. \nIf approved by the UK's medicines regulator, the Department of Health said thousands of patients would be able to access the treatments this winter."

      "title": "Inflation: Rise in cost of living slows in September",
      "tags": "Economics,Inflation,UK economy,Bank of England",
      "text": "Price rises dipped slightly in September as the economy continued to reopen, according to official figures.\nThe increase in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, fell to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in August.\nHigher prices for transport were the biggest contributor to price rises.\nIt comes after the Bank of England warned it \"will have to act\" over rising inflation, suggesting interest rates may rise soon.\nThe inflation rate fell back slightly last month, partly due to lower prices in the hospitality sector.\nPrices in restaurants and cafes rose less this summer than the last, when the government's Eat Out to Help Out Scheme was running,the Office for National Statistics said.\nUnder the scheme, diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals up to \u00a310 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. \nMike Hardie, head of prices at the ONS, said: \"However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year.\n\"The costs of goods produced by factories rose again, with metals and machinery showing a notable price rise. Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer.\"  \nSimply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a \u00a31 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%.\nIt applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted.\nYou may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money.\nRead more about inflation here.\nAlthough price rises edged lower in September, the increase of 3.1% remains far above the Bank of England's target of 2%.\nLast month, transport costs made the biggest contribution to price increases.\nAverage petrol prices stood at 134.9 pence a litre, compared with 113.3 pence a litre in September of 2020, when travel was reduced under travel restrictions.\nThe ONS added that the September 2021 price for fuel was the highest recorded since September 2013.\nA rise in used car prices, which were 2.9% higher in September than in August, also contributed to higher transport costs.\nOther factors such as demand for oil and gas rising around the world have pushed up the price of energy.\nMeanwhile, there are shortages and bottlenecks affecting the availability of some important goods like computer chips, which are also increasing costs for businesses.\nSuren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that further price increases were expected in the coming months \"with the increase in the energy price cap, partial reversal of the VAT reductions for hospitality and tourism and persistent supply chain disruption\".\nHe warned that rising inflation could disrupt UK's economic recovery by squeezing people's spending power and companies' profit margins.\nEveryone is affected by rising costs, but if you're on a low income or don't have savings to fall back on, you're more likely to feel the impact.\nAnd if your pay isn't going up in line with price rises, you may notice a fall in the \"real value\" of your wages - what you earn buys less.\n\"We're just starting to notice the pinch a little bit,\" Ruth Holroyd told BBC Breakfast. She usually takes on the task of doing the family's weekly shop. \n\"I've noticed that the prices are higher for the overall shop, but where prices stay the same for things like grapes and strawberries that come in a punnet, the punnets have shrunk, so you don't get as much.\"\nShe is mostly worried about the impact of rising energy bills. She was previously a People's Energy customer, but the firm ceased trading earlier in September, collapsing because of rising gas prices. \nRuth expects that the family's energy bill will double from \u00a3120 to \u00a3250 per month.\nA bit of inflation is considered to be a good thing. If prices were falling, then people might delay buying non-essential items in the hope of getting them cheaper.\nBut if prices rise too quickly, it's seen as a sign that the economy is running into difficulties.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday that price rises were a \"a real cause of some concern\", adding that the government wanted inflation rates to be lower.\nHe suggested that price increases were partially due to higher demand as the economy reopens.\n\"When you see quite strong economic growth, there is always the danger you will have inflation. Now the critical question is, how long is that inflation going to last for?\" he said.\nHe added that he had recently spoken with the governor of the Bank of England and that it was \"hopeful\" price rises would be contained.\nReferring to the new figures out on Wednesday, Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC, told the BBC's Today programme: \"We can't stand down our concerns about inflation just because this number was a bit lower than expected.\n\"Since September, there's been a big rise in natural gas prices, a rise in petrol prices and global oil prices and from the Bank of England's point of view, we've also seen more people start to get worried about inflation.\"\nShe warned that the economy was not \"out of the woods yet\".\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned on Sunday that the Bank of England \"will have to act\" over rising inflation.\nThe Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4% before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid.\nThe UK's central bank can raise interest rates in a bid to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In principle, it means that when borrowing costs rises, such as when mortgages become more expensive, people spend less and prices are driven down.\nInvestors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's2% target.\nHowever, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%.\nThe governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought.\nThe slight easing of inflation in September comes more as a temporary respite in the surging cost of living than a sign that it's over. \nLast month's figures compared August with a year before, when prices in restaurants and hotels were artificially low because of the government's Eat out to Help Out scheme. This month's figures, by contrast, compare prices now with where they were in September 2020, when the scheme was no longer operating. \nThe average rise in the cost of living of 3.1% masked sharp price rises in items such as air fares, up 9.7%, or carpets, up 9.6%. \nAnd there are signs of further inflationary pressure coming down the line, with manufacturers paying 11.4% more for raw materials and prices of goods leaving the factory gate up 6.7% - the biggest rise in a decade. \nAn interest rate rise by the end of the year, with rates continuing to rise in the new year, still looks more likely than not."

      "text": "Managers of community care services supporting more than 15,000 people in England, say acute staff shortages are forcing them to turn down new clients. \nThe National Care Forum of mainly not-for-profit organisations, says care providers are having to make tough decisions about who they can help. \nLast week health bosses said the care shortage meant more patients judged fit to go home were stuck in hospital. \nThe government is promising extra money to train and recruit new care workers.\nCare providers are facing acute problems in recruiting and retaining frontline staff for a variety of reasons including burnout from the pandemic and higher pay rates being available elsewhere as the economy picks up. \nManagers told researchers many existing staff were struggling with an increased workload and wanted to quit.   \nResearchers for National Care Forum (NCF), together with the Outstanding Managers Network, questioned 340 managers and said their answers highlighted the \"stark reality\" in the care sector.\nBetween them, those questioned employ more than 21,000 staff who care for more than 15,000 people at home or in care homes. \nThe findings suggest that they have nearly a fifth of positions vacant, with backroom staff having to fill in as frontline carers. \nMore than two thirds said they were having to stop or limit services.\nThese pressures are resulting in having to say no to new clients, including those being discharged from hospital, researchers say. \nIn other instances, managers say they have had to hand home-care contracts back to councils. \nThe researchers estimate that, between them, they have turned down nearly 5,000 requests for help in the past six weeks. \nHospitals are already warning of the knock on effect this is having on them, and managers fear that with existing workers exhausted, this may be just the beginning of the staffing crisis.\nOne manager told the researchers it was \"heartbreaking, turning down 10 plus packages of care that are needed a day\". \nAnother, in the same position, said: \"Sadly, have not got enough staff to look after them safely\".\nAnother was worried about financial viability, having increased wages to compete for staff, without any increase in funding.\nA fourth was \"seriously considering having to close\".  \nNCF chief executive, Vic Rayner, said the findings were \"uncomfortable reading and offer evidence of the stark reality\".\n\"Providers are having to make very difficult decisions about who they can support, sometimes resulting in people with high or complex needs not getting access to the care and support they desperately need,\" Mr Rayner added. \nSeparate research, last week, suggested that more care jobs are unfilled than before the pandemic. \nNHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, has called the situation \"dire\" and particularly worrying with winter about to put extra pressure on services.\nA Department of Health and Social Care official said the government was providing at least \u00a3500m to support the care workforce as part of the \u00a35.4bn to reform social care.\n\"We are also working to ensure we have the right number of staff with the skills to deliver high quality care to meet increasing demands,\" said the statement.

Of course, it's still very early days and the devastation caused by this tragic event will take considerable time to rectify.\n\"We are committed to working alongside our communities and partners to support them through the aftermath of this terrible event.\"\nEarlier, the deputy leader of South Ayrshire Council, Brian McGinley, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that some residents were back in their homes, some were staying with family and friends and others were in hotels.\n\"We need to realise that this has been a very major incident, it's a very demanding and technical situation,\" he said. \n\"Clearly we're working as fast and as hard as we can to make sure everybody is safe, that everyone's needs are met. But it's going to take a long time for this community to recover.\"\nMr McGinley added: \"Volunteers are providing rest and food for local people and emergency services - they have clothes, drinks and foodstuffs available. Some people have been a bit traumatised by it so they can come down, have a cup of tea and chat to people about it.\"\nThe council also said it had been overwhelmed by donations from the public and offers of help from local businesses.\nA hub for residents affected by the incident and emergency service workers has been set up at Kincaidston Community Pavilion.\nOne community worker told the BBC that about 120 residents were initially unable to return to their homes following the explosion.\n\"[They] had to register to say what location they were in approximate to the explosion and then they could get let back in their houses,\" he said. \"We had kids in getting their evening meals.\n\"As far as I'm led to believe one of the local hotels has put some of the residents up, that was [Tuesday] afternoon - I don't know what the situation is now.\"\nHe said the centre had received donations from local businesses, including takeaways, supermarkets, bakers and butchers to support displaced people.\n\"It's been quite hectic but the emergency services are very appreciative of what we've done for them - the community has rallied round.\"\nScottish Fire and Rescue Service area commander Ian McMeekin described the aftermath of the explosion as \"extremely challenging\".\nAt its height, nine appliances responded to the explosion, which happened shortly after 19:00 on Monday, as well as urban search and rescue teams.\nMr McMeekin said: \"There is significant damage to the properties and the surrounding area.\" \nHe also thanked the local community for their \"support and understanding\".\nResidents needing support following the blast have been urged to contact 0300 123 0900.\nThe gas distribution company SGN said it would continue to work with \"expert parties\" in the coming days to establish the cause of the explosion.\nA temporary, above-ground gas pipeline has been installed for homes in Kincaidston.\nThe company said: \"We'd like to reiterate our reassurance to the local community that the gas network across the area remains safe and secure to use.\n\"Our engineers have carried out full safety checks in the area to ensure the safety of all the homes close to the damaged properties.\n\"We're aware some residents may have turned off their gas supply at the meter as a result of the incident.\n\"If this applies to you, then our engineers are available to visit your property and safely turn your gas supply back on.\""

      "tags": "Pets,Dogs",
      "text": "Northern Ireland is the gateway for a multi-million pound black market in puppies into Great Britain, according to an investigation by BBC NI's Spotlight programme.\nAnimal protection societies told the programme the illicit trade sees tens of thousands of dogs moved from the Republic of Ireland through Northern Ireland every year.\nThe demand for puppies has increased during lockdown.\nPrices have been driven up as a result.\nReporter Mandy McAuley tracked dealers moving dogs and confronted one dealer from Coalisland, County Tyrone, who sold sick and dying puppies in Scotland.\nThe high demand has also increased incentives for dealers to ship younger puppies out of the Republic of Ireland before the age of 15 weeks, when they could be legally moved.\nThe Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) told the programme that members of three large extended family networks in Northern Ireland are responsible for much of the traffic in puppies across the Irish Sea.\n\"For the puppy trade in Scotland, I would say 90% of all problems come through Belfast,\" SSPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said.\n\"Considering last year we seized over 150 pups and at least 90% of them came over from Belfast. \n\"Whether they were bred in Northern Ireland or Southern Ireland, that is the route they came through.\n\"To me it's the new drugs - if you come into Cairnryan with \u00a320,000 worth of drugs you are going to go to jail; \u00a320,000 worth of pups, you'll get a \u00a3500 fine.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, USPCA chief executive Brendan Mullan said it was a \"lucrative\" trade.\n\"We have been undertaking an undercover investigation ourselves, which helped inform the Spotlight programme, and identified the licensed pet transporters that are involved in this trade, collecting dogs from the south of Ireland, but also collecting dogs from illegal breeders in Northern Ireland and trafficking them into GB,\" he said.\n\"We are aware of 20 such transporters doing this. One them does 120 dogs a week and if you take the average price of \u00a31,875 for a pup in GB, that individual has criminal proceeds of almost \u00a316m a year.\"\nThe Spotlight team established that puppy dealer Bernard Ward, from Coalisland, had sold sick and dying puppies on at least five occasions in Scotland.\nStephanie Western, who spent thousands of pounds to keep her puppy, Thor, alive, said: \"We obviously felt so stupid, gutted that we handed over, you know, our hard-earned money to these people who are just abusing these little animals. \n\"How is it so easy for people to just hop on a ferry with a load of sick dogs and just scam people? \n\"That is something that really needs to change; that is something that needs to be addressed.\"\nMandy McAuley then went undercover to buy a puppy which was also later traced back to Mr Ward. \nBonnie, the puppy purchased by the Spotlight team, was later found to be infected with two intestinal parasites. \nThat should have made the sale a criminal offence under Scottish law. \nThe puppy was treated and then adopted by a family in Scotland.\nSpotlight confronted Bernard Ward over the phone. \nHe insisted they had phoned the wrong number, but it was the same phone he used in one of the Scottish sales. \nThey also wrote to him, but he did not respond.\nDaniella Dos Santos, a former president of the British Veterinary Association, told the programme: \"Everybody wants a dog at the moment, and it's an emotional purchase. \n\"What these people are seeing, is low-risk, high-gain opportunities here to smuggle in puppies and make quick money without any thought for the people or the animals they are harming in the process.\n\"But what they do know, [is] that even if they're caught, the consequences are so low compared [to] if they're successful, which, is quite clear they are being successful, and the financial rewards that they get for it.\"\nIn a statement to the programme, Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said it is \"not possible nor practical to stop every vehicle moving through Northern Ireland's ports\". \nHowever, he said multiple interceptions had been made in recent months, including 10 springer spaniel pups seized last month.\nHe said his department will do all it can to deter the trade in puppies and said his officials are working with local councils, the PSNI, the Harbour Police and ferry companies to identify suspect movements through the ports.\n\"No dog owner should have to see their pet suffer because it has been treated like a commodity and bred purely to line the pockets of lawbreakers,\" he said.\nThe USPCA believes that about one third of trafficked puppies will die.\n\"It is causing unthinkable suffering to thousands of dogs and that's not to mention the people at the other end of the supply chain, the unsuspecting public who have to deal with the human tragedy attached to those sick dogs they have purchased,\" said Mr Mullan.\n\"The mothers are overbred, used and abused and the pups are brought up in squalid conditions. \n\"Every single one of them has underlying health issues. They might look like they are healthy initially, but I can guarantee that they are all going to ill within weeks of purchase.\""

      "text": "A so-called \"Amess amendment\" is being proposed to ensure access for Catholic priests to administer the last rites, including at crime scenes.\nIt follows concerns a priest was unable to reach Sir David Amess, a Catholic, at the scene where he was attacked.\nLabour MP Mike Kane is seeking to add this to legislation currently going through Parliament.\nIt would give a presumption that priests could pray with a Catholic \"in the final moments of life\".\nThe intention is to add the \"Amess amendment\" to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.\nIt's understood that there are peers ready to put forward the amendment in the committee stage in the House of Lords and cross-party discussions are under way.\nIn the Catholic church the sacrament of \"anointing the sick\" is given to those who are ill or dying.\nA local priest who went to the scene of the attack on Sir David in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex did not reach him.\n\"I think it's vital that people of faith can receive the ministry and sacraments they need in the final moments of life and at the point of death,\" said Mr Kane, who spoke of Sir David's Catholic faith in a tribute in Parliament this week.\n\"There should be a presumption by the authorities whether it be a care home or a crime scene that pastors can tend to the spiritual needs of the individual concerned.\"\nThe proposal from Mr Kane would assert the right of priests to be allowed to reach those who were seriously ill or to say prayers for those who had just died.\nHe says this would have to respect safety and medical considerations, and would be decided in conjunction with authorities at the scene.\nBut the idea of allowing a priest to enter such a crime scene should be a \"non-starter\", according to Paul Millen, a former head of scientific support at Surrey Police and author of books about managing crime scenes.\nHe says that he is a Catholic himself, and recognises the importance of anointing the sick, but says this would be an unacceptable risk to forensic evidence in what should be a very controlled environment.\nMr Millen says it could disturb evidence at a crime scene, which could be DNA, fibres or footmarks, and it could \"compromise proof of guilt or innocence\".\nSpeaking on the BBC's Politics Live, Conservative MP Matt Warman said there needed to be clearer guidelines about such decisions.\n\"But the counterpoint I would make is that no one would want to see a situation where for whatever reason a trial were declared void because a crime scene had been contaminated,\" said Mr Warman. \n\"I think it's an immensely difficult decision. We all want to see justice done and there has to be a balance together.\"\nBut Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh said the importance to some people of such religious moments had to be recognised and questioned whether a trial was likely to be \"jeopardised by a priest going in to give the last rites\".\nA spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference welcomed the principle of ensuring that priests could administer the sacrament of the sick - but recognised that this could be complicated during an emergency."

      "tags": "UK government,Ben Wallace",
      "text": "All remaining investigations into allegations of abuse by British soldiers in Iraq have now finished without any prosecutions being brought.\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Service Police Legacy Investigations - which was looking at the claims - had now \"officially closed its doors\".\nThe SPLI's job was to investigate Iraqi civilians' claims of serious criminal behaviour by UK armed forces.\nSince it began, it has assessed 1,291 allegations, Mr Wallace said.\nThe SPLI was made up of Royal Navy Police and Royal Air Force Police.\nIt took charge of investigations in February 2017, after the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT) - which had been looking at them - was shut down. \nThe investigations related to the alleged behaviour of UK armed forces in Iraq during the war from 2003 to 2009.\nIn a written statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Wallace said that although 178 allegations had been formally pursued through 55 separate investigations, no soldiers had been prosecuted as a result of the SPLI's work.\nAccording to the SPLI, in 2019 five people were referred to the military prosecutor, the Service Prosecuting Authority, but no charges were brought.\n\"The vast majority of the more than 140,000 members of our armed forces who served in Iraq did so honourably,\" said Mr Wallace in his statement. \"Many sadly suffered injuries or death, with devastating consequences for them and their families.\"\nHe said while some allegations against British troops were credible, others were not.\nThe credibility of allegations had been a \"significant challenge throughout the investigations\", he said.\n\"However not all allegations and claims were spurious, otherwise investigations would not have proceeded beyond initial examination and no claims for compensation would have been paid.\"\nThe Ministry of Defence's investigations into allegations of war crimes will have satisfied few. \nThe initial investigations, under IHAT, were criticised by MPs in 2017 who said it empowered law firms to bring cases on an \"industrial scale\". One of those lawyers, Phil Shiner, was later found guilty of misconduct. \nVeterans and those still serving were swept up in long, costly and often clumsy investigations, even when some had already been cleared of wrongdoing. \nNor did IHAT satisfy those who believed that there were genuine cases to answer. \nThe MoD wanted to show it was properly investigating allegations of war crimes. But it did not want those investigations to be conducted by anyone else. \nMost importantly, the MoD did not want this to end up in the International Criminal Court in the Hague. \nIn 2020 the ICC decided not to pursue a formal investigation into alleged war crimes by British troops in Iraq. But prosecutor Fatou Bensouda still said there was clear evidence that UK forces were responsible for numerous war crimes including illegal killings, torture and rape in Iraq. \nMr Wallace added: \"It is sadly clear, from all the investigations the UK conducted, that some shocking and shameful incidents did happen in Iraq. We recognise that there were four convictions of UK military personnel for offences in Iraq including offences of assault and inhuman treatment.\n\"The government's position is clear - we deplore and condemn all such incidents.\"\nIn 2005, three British soldiers who abused Iraqi civilians were jailed and dismissed from the Army in disgrace.\nTwo years later, a soldier was jailed for a year in connection with the death of Iraqi civilian Baha Mousa in September 2003.\nIn total, the Ministry of Defence has paid out more than \u00a320 million in compensation settlements for abuse claims from Iraqi nationals."

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Twenty-four children in Northern Ireland with confirmed or suspected cancers had to wait over a year for a first appointment, a review has found.\nThe figure, for April, is in a review of waiting lists by the NI Commissioner for Children and Young People. \nMore than 17,000 children were waiting more than a year to see a hospital consultant for the first time.  \nThe health minster later said that by September there were no \"red flag\" paediatric patients waiting that long.\nThe review examined official waiting list data for children's health services not published as part of the Department of Health's statistical bulletins.\nThe commissioner said the waiting times were \"terrifying\".\nKoulla Yiasouma said that waiting for any health service treatment can and does have a \"profound impact on a child's health outcomes, emotional and mental well-being\".\nShe said it was \"shocking not only for the child but their families too\".\n\"Each and every single one of them is a child and each and every single one of them is a child whose life has almost been put on hold, and a family whose life has been put on hold, because they are not getting the most fundamental right of healthcare that they deserve,\" she said.\nDr Ray Nethercott, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said he was shocked by the cancer figures.\n\"It is outrageous and there are probably many other words that spring to the minds of parents who are worried and concerned and colleagues who are facing into this,\" he said.\n\"Some of the answer will be about embracing and delivering that reform, delivering innovation, delivering different ways of managing children as close to home as possible.\n\"To be able to do that, it's not all about the workforce, but it's actually about giving some due care and attention to child health services as a distinct entity.\n\"I can't say that there's any way to do it immediately - I've got lots of ideas as do many of my colleagues.\n\"But really children and children's voices and people that work with children have a very small voice in our health system.\"\nThe review, called More Than Just a Number, examined the number of children and young people on waiting lists, and the length of time they wait to access first or review appointments with consultants for treatment in hospitals and also for services based in the community. \nIt found that in April 2021, one in five children and young people in Northern Ireland were waiting for a first or review appointment with a consultant. \nIt also found 17,194 children and young people were waiting more than one year and 510 more than four years.\nThe conditions affected included scoliosis, speech and language therapy and autism.    \nMandy O'Connor has two daughters waiting for reviews. \nHer eldest daughter had an operation in Turkey for scoliosis in 2018 that cost them \u00a335,000 for the operation alone, otherwise she would have been waiting 18 months for surgery in Northern Ireland.\nShe has not been seen in Northern Ireland since that operation and the family is travelling to Turkey on Wednesday for a follow-up appointment. \nHer second daughter doesn't know if she has scoliosis which means time is of the essence to find out so they can tackle it early. \n\"From when Tasha [her eldest daughter] was diagnosed she was in extreme pain for the 16 weeks while we were fundraising,\" Mrs O'Connor said. \n\"To think what she would have been like for 18 months on that waiting list and even for the referral it was 16 weeks.\n\"It was marked urgent at the time - Tasha wasn't seen for a referral. The referral went in on July 2018, she wasn't seen until November 2018.\"\nShe said her second daughter had to wait 12 months for a first referral.\n\"That was in August 2019. She wasn't seen until August 2020 and as yet she hasn't been seen since.\"\nAs well as looking at hospital waits, it also raises other issues including the \"complete absence\" of regional monitoring or reporting of waiting times for child health services in the community. \nThe absence of such critical information according to the commissioner makes it impossible to get a clear understanding of the number of children who are waiting for these services. \nIt found that at least 26,818 children in Northern Ireland were waiting for a community-based health service but it is thought the figure is much higher. \nThe report makes 17 recommendations.\nThese include:\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said he was grateful to the commissioner for the \"detailed review\".\n\"My department and the wider HSC (Health and Social Care) system will carefully consider the report and recommendations from the commissioner as part of our ongoing work to transform and rebuild services,\" he said.\n\"Waiting times were clearly unacceptable prior to Covid-19 and have been exacerbated by the devastating impact of the pandemic across all aspects of service provision including, unfortunately, across children's services. \n\"Addressing these waiting lists is a top priority for me... it will require systemic change and long-term investment.\"\nMs Yiasouma said she welcomed the health minister's commitment to improve waiting lists and to address the \"underlying issues which drive them\".\n\"Waiting times are one of the clearest indicators of a system under immense strain and unable to meet the needs of its population,\" she added.\n\"We must strive to get to a point where all children and young people can get access to the right care, at the right time and the right place and no child ls left waiting months or years in a queue to access services.\"\nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the waiting times figures for children with cancer were \"utterly appalling\".\n\"I think we should see somebody very senior in the Department of Health appointed as a deputy chief medical officer to oversee children's health in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \n\"I think we need to invest more in children's health.\n\"I think children should have a degree of priority when it comes to such services.\""

      "text": "North Korea has confirmed it successfully tested a new submarine-launched ballistic missile on Tuesday.\nState news outlet KCNA said the missile had \"advanced control guidance technologies\", which could make it harder to track.\nNorth Korea has carried out a flurry of weapons tests in recent weeks, launching what it said were hypersonic and long-range weapons.\nThe UN prohibits it from testing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.\nBallistic missiles are considered more threatening than cruise missiles because they can carry more powerful payloads, have a longer range and can fly faster.\nNorth Korean state media on Wednesday said its latest missile had new \"controlling and homing\" technology which allowed it to move laterally. It was also capable of \"gliding and jumping movement\". It released pictures of the missile as well.\nIt said it was fired from the same submarine that launched an older missile in a 2016 test.\nThis missile was one of many new weapons put on display at a defence exhibition in Pyongyang last week.\nReports did not mention leader Kim Jong-un, suggesting he did not attend the test.\nOn Tuesday, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said one missile had been launched from the port of Sinpo, in the east of North Korea where Pyongyang usually bases its submarines.\nIt landed in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, and travelled about 450km (280 miles) at a maximum height of 60km. \nIn October 2019, North Korea tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile, firing a Pukguksong-3 from an underwater platform.\nAt the time, KCNA said it had been fired at a high angle to minimise the \"external threat\".\nHowever, if the missile had been launched on a standard trajectory, instead of a vertical one, it could have travelled about 1,900km. That would have put all of South Korea and Japan within range.\nBeing launched from a submarine can also make missiles harder to detect and would allow North Korea to deploy its weapons far beyond the Korean Peninsula.\nThe latest launch comes as South Korea develops its own weapons, in what observers say has turned into an arms race on the Korean peninsula.\nSeoul is holding what is said to be South Korea's largest ever defence exhibition this week. It will reportedly unveil a new fighter jet as well as guided weapons like missiles. It is also due to launch its own space rocket soon.\nNorth and South Korea technically remain at war as the Korean War, which split the peninsula into two countries and which saw the US backing the South, ended in 1953 with an armistice.\nKim Jong-un said last week that he did not wish for war to break out again. He said his country needed to continue developing weapons for self-defence against enemies, namely the US which he accused of hostility.\nMeanwhile, South Korean, Japanese and US intelligence chiefs are meeting in Seoul to discuss North Korea.\nThe US envoy to North Korea, Sung Kim, is expected to discuss how to restart dialogue with Pyongyang, including on whether there should be a formal declaration of the end of the Korean War.\nThis week he reiterated the stance of US President Joe Biden's administration that it is open to meeting with North Korea without pre-conditions. \nPrevious talks between the US and North Korea broke down due to fundamental disagreements on denuclearisation. \nThe US wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons before sanctions can be eased, but North Korea has so far refused."

Some of its measures apply only in England, or in England and Wales, but there are a number of UK-wide provisions. \nThe bill would also set up a watchdog - the Office for Environmental Protection - to monitor progress on improving the environment.\nThe Commons voted to remove a Lords amendment designed to guarantee that body's independence, but MPs did agree to a proposal to allow charges to be levied on all single-use items, rather than just those made of plastic.\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nBeccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB, accused the government of \"falling short of its pledge to leave the natural environment in a better state than it inherited it\".\nAnd campaign group Surfers Against Sewage said it was \"astonishing that, in this critical decade for the environment, the government is opting out of amendments designed to better protect the planet and all its precious inhabitants\".\nBut a Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said the \"landmark\" bill would \"transform how we protect our natural environment, make better use of our resources and clean up our air and water.\"\n\"It is vital that the bill now completes its passage into law as soon as possible, so we can meet our commitment of leaving the environment in a better state for future generations,\" they added."

Her family repeatedly appealed for her fianc\u00e9 and his family to cooperate with investigators, but he then went missing himself. \nHis parents told police they last saw him on 13 September - when he went hiking alone and never returned.\nMs Petito's body was eventually discovered in Wyoming on 19 September. A coroner ruled last week that she had been strangled to death and left for weeks before her body was found. \nMr Laundrie has not been charged with crimes relating to Ms Petito's killing, however, the FBI has issued a federal arrest warrant and charged him with fraudulently using her debit card after her death.\nA lawyer for Mr Laundrie's parents confirmed they were in the area where the items were discovered on Wednesday. \n\"Chris and Roberta Laundrie were at the reserve earlier today when human remains and some of Brian's possessions were located in an area where they had initially advised law enforcement that Brian may be,\" Steve Bertolino said.\nHe added the couple would \"wait for forensic identification of the remains\" before commenting further.\nMr Bertolino earlier told reporters that \"some articles\" had been discovered on a trail frequented by Mr Laundrie within a park where a car driven by him was earlier discovered. \nThe FBI's Tampa field office tweeted after the discovery that the nature reserve was closed to the public.\nFBI special agent Michael McPherson said that officers would likely be processing the scene for several days. \n\"I know you have a lot of questions, but we don't have all the answers yet,\" he told the media.\nThe plight of Gabby Petito has captured global attention and triggered a debate over the amount of attention accorded to missing white women compared with other missing persons.

      "tags": "Google,Artificial intelligence,Mobile phones,Android",
      "text": "Google has unveiled its latest smartphone, containing the tech giant's first self-designed computer chip. \nThe Pixel 6 contains Google's \"Tensor\" processor, which it says enables new phone features powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning.  \nIt is also the first phone in the series with a \"Pro\" model, designed to compete at the high end of the market. \n\"The whole goal when we started was to reach this point,\" said Rick Osterloh, Google's head of devices. \n\"Really, this is our original vision that we're finally able to get to after building a lot of capabilities both in technology and in product development capabilities,\" he told the BBC. \nGoogle owns and operates the Android platform, used by almost every mobile phone maker apart from Apple. But the top end of the Android market has been dominated by other smartphone brands such as Samsung, whose phones can cost more than \u00a31,000. \nGoogle's Pixel line has often been priced in the middle of the market. \nBut the new Pixel 6 will retail for \u00a3599/$599, while the Pro model will cost \u00a3849/$899.  bringing it closer to the price of competing top-end devices. \nThat is the same launch price for the base model as the Pixel 5, which had, Google said at the time, been designed for \"an economic downturn\".\n\"Obviously, there's a lot of technology and these are expensive, for sure, but we're trying to offer users good value despite the fact that these are flagships,\" Mr Osterloh said. \nBoth the Pixel 6 and Pro are standard form-factor smartphones with a striking large horizontal bar across the upper back of the phone. \nThat bar contains all the camera lenses and sensors, instead of putting them off to one side in a camera \"bump\" popular on many modern models.\nBoth versions have a 50-megapixel (MP) main camera and a 12MP ultrawide. The Pro model has an additional 48MP camera, giving it a 4x optical zoom. \nThe Pro model also has more memory, a higher-resolution screen, and a faster screen refresh rate of up to 120hz - or 120 screen refreshes a second, which can make animations and fast movements appear smoother.\nModern smartphones rely heavily on \"computational photography\" to take good, clear photos. It is what gives each phone maker their own distinctive \"look\" to photos. \n\"For a long time, Pixel has been known for awesome photography, which is truly a function of our ability to do AI-driven, machine-learning-driven improvements to the camera experience,\" Mr Osterloh said.\n\"With this new platform, with Tensor, we've literally designed the platform to to be able to support he most cutting-edge work we have in all aspects of AI.\"\nOne of those is what Google calls a \"magic eraser\" - a system where the Photos app will detect distractions in the photo such as someone walking in the background, and try to remove them. The company says it can also be used for things such as power poles or wires, and users can manually select things to remove as well as the automatic system. \nAnother new feature is \"face deblur\". \nWhen taking a photo with the rear-facing camera, it will use all available cameras and take multiple versions. So if a person is constantly moving - such as Google's example of a young child - the camera will attempt to fix a blurry face by combining all the data, and attempt to figure out what the non-blurred version should look like. \nThe new processing power in its latest chip means that technology can now be applied to videos as they are recorded, giving them the same type of style as Pixel's still cameras. \nAsked if the new features would make their way to other Android phones, Mr Osterloh said: \"Many of them will only be Pixel\".\nHe said while it is possible some might eventually be available on other devices, \"a lot of it really requires this custom architecture and therefore it's likely to be on products that run Tensor for the foreseeable future only\". \nGoogle had first teased the existence of the Pixel 6 and Pixel Pro in August - along with its Tensor processor. \nUntil now, it has used chips designed by chip firm Qualcomm. But it says the Tensor chip is up to 80% faster than the Pixel 5 from 2020, as well as being power-efficient.\nOne significant advantage to its new chip, Google says, is that it can do more on the phone itself, without being connected to the internet - particularly through Google's popular virtual assistant. \nFor example, it says that voice transcription - which now uses the Google Assistant - will be faster and more accurate. Users can say \"Hey Google, type\" instead of tapping a button, and can also use voice commands to send messages. The voice system can be used at the same time as the text keyboard. \nGoogle's recorder app also leverages the snappier processor to live-transcribe audio recordings as they're made, even when the phone is not connected to the internet. \nIt also means that Google's live translation features are snappier than before, as more of the processing is done on the machine itself. \nBut it does not mean that Google Assistant will work perfectly offline for privacy campaigners.\n\"To be really useful, you need to assume that it's going to use the cloud,\" Mr Osterloh said.\n\"The speech recognition part of that workflow will happen on the device... [and] all the dictation\".\nBut most people ask for weather, or sports scores or other kinds of information that has to be retrieved from the internet.\n\"We're moving more and more workloads from the cloud to the device, we're trying to do that... to make sure the user has the best possible performance. But certainly this indicates a direction for privacy as well.\""

      "text": "Nearly 1,500 people have been arrested in England and Wales in a week-long operation against so-called county lines drug dealing networks.\nPolice say they have started focusing on senior figures controlling phone numbers used to sell drugs.\nOfficers are also using modern slavery and human trafficking laws to prosecute gangs exploiting vulnerable children.\nSome 139 county lines were closed, and almost \u00a32m of Class A drugs, including cocaine and heroin, seized.\nCounty line gangs are urban drug dealers who sell to customers in more rural areas via dedicated phone lines.\nThey have become central to the trade in illegal substances across Britain and the way they operate is often accompanied by serious violence. \nGangs in cities operate phone lines advertised in other towns and rural areas to supply drugs, while remaining at arm's length to reduce the risk of arrest. \nBut police changed tactics two years ago and now have a strategy of identifying the \"line holder\" by analysing phone records, meaning gang leaders can often be arrested in possession of the phone, proving their involvement.\nAs a result the number of arrests has been growing during regular week-long operations in which different police forces co-ordinate their efforts. \nA total of 85% of defendants are now pleading guilty and the conviction rate is 99%, said Graham McNulty, deputy assistant commissioner of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC).\n\"We are making significant inroads into dismantling violent county lines. \n\"The figures speak for themselves. We're stopping abhorrent criminals abusing young people and lining their own pockets in the process,\" he said. \nAn assessment of county lines drug dealing produced by the NPCC suggests the number of active lines has fallen from around 2,000 in 2018 to 600. \nIn the latest police push, between 11 October and 17 October:\nPolice also visited 894 addresses used by drug gangs for their operations against the will of the resident, a practice known as \"cuckooing\". \nMost of the gangs operate from Merseyside, the West Midlands and London. \nCounty lines gangs groom children and vulnerable adults to get them moving drugs around the country, often using threatening and coercive behaviour. \nPolice are pioneering the use of \"victimless prosecutions\" which aims to reduce the need for victims to give evidence in court. \nHowever, the Children's Society, a charity that works with young people facing abuse, neglect and exploitation, wants the government to boost the law on the criminal exploitation of children by adding a definition of the offence to the new Policing Bill.\nIryna Pona, Policy Manager at The Children's Society, said: \"This should also provide clarity for professionals in identifying young victims and would be strengthened further by a national strategy, supported by funding, to ensure more children get earlier help, ending the current postcode lottery in support.\"\n\"There needs to be a relentless focus among professionals upon identifying and supporting children at risk of exploitation as early as possible.\"\nThe Children's Society runs a campaign, Look Closer, designed to help people spot signs that children and vulnerable adults are involved with county lines. \nJames Simmonds-Read, from The Children's Society's\u202f prevention programme which has worked alongside police said: \"It's vital that professionals spot instances where children have been exploited by criminals, so we are pleased that many vulnerable people - including young people - have been identified as being in need of support.\"\n\"The public can also play a crucial role in spotting signs of exploitation and reporting them to the police and Look Closer highlights how everyone from commuters to transport and shop staff can help children to escape horrific exploitation.\"\n\"Young people may not ask for help themselves because they have been manipulated into thinking they are making a choice or because they have been subjected to terrifying threats.\"\nThe British Transport Police try to stop drugs being transported on trains. \nMeanwhile, the National Crime Agency is focusing on stopping drugs getting into the country in the first place. \nRecently the NCA has charged six men with importing 2.3 tonnes of cocaine worth \u00a3190m. \nOther seizures include 5.2 tonnes of cocaine being transported by sea, and the discovery of heroin and cocaine inside a British lorry.  \nNCA Director of Investigations Nikki Holland said: \"It is a high priority for the NCA to build on the successes we have had in source countries and along the drugs supply routes, so that organised crime groups land fewer drugs in our towns and cities and prevent them being pushed further afield through county lines groups.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nIf not enough people get vaccinated, it is more likely restrictions will be reintroduced in England, the health secretary has said. At a Downing Street press conference, Sajid Javid said he did not believe the current pressures on the NHS were unsustainable and so Plan B measures, like mandatory face coverings and working from home, would not be brought in \"at this point\".  However he warned cases could rise to 100,000 a day. His comments follow NHS leaders calling for some restrictions to be reintroduced immediately if England is to avoid \"stumbling into a winter crisis\". Read more about Plan B here.\nMorocco has banned flights to and from the UK over concerns about rising case numbers. Several UK airlines and holiday companies have been told by the Moroccan government that flights will be suspended from 23:59 BST on Wednesday until further notice. Flights between Morocco and Germany and the Netherlands have also been suspended. Latest figures show Morocco's weekly rate of reported cases on 14 October stood at 10.4 per 100,000 people, compared with 445.5 per 100,000 people in the UK.\nSome Welsh schools are at tipping point and could be forced to close because of a lack of staff, the UCAC union has warned. The union says self-isolation due to Covid has exacerbated a supply teacher shortage that existed before the pandemic. Another union - the NAHT -  wants the Welsh government to review measures to reduce the spread of Covid in schools.\nManagers of community care services supporting more than 15,000 people in England, say acute staff shortages are forcing them to turn down new clients. The National Care Forum of mainly not-for-profit organisations, says care providers are having to make tough decisions about who they can help. Last week health bosses said the care shortage meant more patients judged fit to go home were stuck in hospital. The government is promising extra money to train and recruit new care workers.\nNearly 2,000 people have been prosecuted for not wearing face coverings on London's public transport, figures show. From June 2020 until July this year, everyone travelling on the transport network was required to wear a mask unless exempt, as a condition of carriage - or else face a fine from Transport for London.  If unpaid, that could lead to a prosecution. Wearing a mask is still a condition of carriage but not a legal requirement, meaning people cannot be fined.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nAs daily case numbers in the UK near 50,000, we consider why they are so high right now.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Russia's President Vladimir Putin will not attend the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday. \nNo reason was given for the decision not to attend, but a Kremlin spokesperson said climate change was an \"important\" priority for Russia. \nCOP26 takes place in Scotland's largest city from 31 October to 12 November.\nRussia's decision is seen as a blow to efforts to get leaders to negotiate a new deal to stall rising global temperatures.\n\"Unfortunately, Putin will not fly to Glasgow,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that climate change was \"one of our foreign policy's most important priorities\".\nWhen asked about Mr Putin's decision, a spokesman for Boris Johnson said the UK prime minister had previously strongly encouraged leaders to attend \"given this is a very critical moment in terms of tackling climate change\".\nMore than 120 leaders had confirmed their attendance, the spokesman said.\nMr Putin has not commented on the announcement of his non-attendance. He had previously said he would take part, but it appears now that will be virtually. \nSpeaking at an international energy forum in Moscow on 13 October, Mr Putin said the coronavirus pandemic would be a factor in his decision to travel.\nRussia has seen record levels of Covid-related deaths. On Wednesday, Mr Putin ordered a nationwide week-long paid holiday from 30 October to 7 November to try to reverse both the rising number of infections and vaccination hesitancy.\nChinese President Xi Jinping is also unlikely to attend COP26, though Chinese officials have reportedly not entirely ruled out a change of plans. \nEarlier in October, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison attracted widespread criticism for suggesting he might skip the summit, but he later announced that he would indeed attend. \nCOP26 is the biggest climate change conference since landmark talks in Paris in 2015. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, by 2030.\nReducing global warming is essential to avoid the the worst consequences of climate change.\nMany observers will be watching how Russia and other major fossil fuel producers will be willing to reduce their reliance on them.\nA new UN report says oil and gas extraction are both set to rise sharply over the next decade.\nPresident Putin's decision to absent himself from COP26 adds to the list of key leaders who are either not coming or not yet confirmed. \nIt will be harder now for the UK to make the case that world leaders are fully engaged on the question when the head of the world's fifth biggest carbon polluter fails to show up.\nWhile Russia's carbon cutting plans have been described as \"critically insufficient\" by the Climate Action Tracker there have been signs in recent days that the country was starting to take emission cuts more seriously.\nPresident Putin recently outlined a net-zero target for 2060 saying that \"the role of oil and coal will decrease.\"\nThe Russians say they will still send a strong delegation and that climate change remains a priority for the country. But it will undoubtedly be a disappointment for the UK which had hoped that Putin would be open to making progress on a number of issues, including deforestation."

      "text": "Food and drink firms are seeing \"terrifying\" price rises, a sector trade body has said, warning of a knock-on effect for consumers.\nFood and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright told MPs inflation is between 14% and 18% for hospitality firms.\nThe price rises for food firms' ingredients will lead to consumer price rises, he said, and described the situation as concerning.\nThe UK's rate of inflation was 3.2% in August and is expected to rise further.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey recently warned it \"will have to act\", suggesting that UK interest rates may soon rise from the historic low of 0.1%.\nMr Wright told MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee: \"Inflation is a bigger scourge than anything else because it discriminates against the poor.\"\nThe Office for National Statistics will publish the latest inflation figures for September on Wednesday. It is expected to rise further above the Bank of England's target of 2% for longer than previously thought.  \nMake UK, the manufacturers' organisation, said that inflation was becoming \"baked in\" among its members.\nStephen Phipson, chief executive at Make UK, told MPs that while there was a welcome rise in demand, many manufacturers are looking at 30% to 40% average increases in material costs.\n\"When people are able to get hold of materials they are passing those costs on which does imply to us that inflation is more or less baked in at this stage now,\" he said.\n\"This is not a transitory inflationary demand we are seeing really serious issues now in terms of price increases.\"\nDes Gunewardena, chief executive of high-end restaurant group D&D London, says his business has seen half of its costs rise, including surging energy prices. \nHe says staff shortages are his \"number one issue\" and has increased salaries by 10%.\nThe business has 1,700 employees across the UK and is currently 150 staff short, which he said could lead to a \"nightmare situation\" in the busier December period.\nTable covers have been reduced from 400 on a Friday night at his Quaglino's restaurant to between 300 and 350 due to staff shortages. \nHowever, he said the restaurants have seen increased customer spending, so he is stocking up on specific champagne brands ahead of time, to pre-empt possible supply problems. \n\"I think we'll have a very strong Christmas so there's no need to panic yet, but I expect further inflation in January when there won't be the same spending to offset the extra costs\". \nAmid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas, the government is taking steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers.\nThe shortage has been blamed on several factors, including Covid, Brexit and tax changes.\nThe government introduced temporary visas for 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden.\nDuncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), told the select committee that the government's visa scheme to ease driver shortages had been \"designed to fail\". \n\"Reports haven't really eased at all things are not visibly getting better at this stage,\" he said. \nRegarding the government's measures to try to ease the crisis, Mr Buchanan said \"visually on the ground that is not having an effect\". \nA survey by the RHA of its members estimated there was now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK.\n\"The consumer is really going to visualise this in terms of reduced choice. We have supply chain disruption but that doesn't mean we are going to run out of food,\" Mr Buchanan added. "

      "text": "Plans by governments to extract fossil fuels up to 2030 are incompatible with keeping global temperatures to safe levels, says the UN.\nThe UNEP production gap report says countries will drill or mine more than double the levels needed  to keep the 1.5C threshold alive. \nOil and gas recovery is set to rise sharply with only a modest decrease in coal. \nThere has been little change since the first report was published in 2019.\nWith the COP26 climate conference just over a week away, there is already a huge focus on the carbon-cutting ambitions of the biggest emitters. \nBut despite the flurry of net zero emission goals and the increased pledges of many countries, some of the biggest oil, gas and coal producers have not set out plans for the rapid reductions in fossil fuels that scientists say are necessary to limit temperatures in coming years. \nEarlier this year, researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned of the dangers for humanity of allowing temperatures to rise by more than 1.5C this century. To keep under this threshold will require cuts in carbon emissions of around 45% by 2030 based on 2010 levels.  \nBut instead of curbing carbon, many of the biggest emitting countries are also planning to significantly increase their production of fossil fuels, according to the UN. \nThe production gap report finds that countries plan to produce around 110% more fossil fuel than would be compatible with a 1.5C temperature rise by the end of this century. The plans are around 45% more than what's needed to keep the temperature rise to 2C. \nAccording to the study, coal production will drop but gas will increase the most over the next 20 years, to levels that are simply incompatible with the Paris agreement. \nThe report profiles 15 major production countries including Australia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the US and UK. \nMost governments continue to provide significant policy support for fossil fuel production, the authors say.\n\"The research is clear: global coal, oil, and gas production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to 1.5C,\" says Ploy Achakulwisut, a lead author on the report from the Stockholm Environment Institute. \n\"However, governments continue to plan for and support levels of fossil fuel production that are vastly in excess of what we can safely burn.\"\nWhile countries have devoted far more of their recovery spending after the Covid pandemic towards fossil fuel activities, there are some positives when it comes to financing. \nFunding for oil, coal and gas from multilateral banks has decreased significantly in recent years - and also from some of the richer nations. \n\"This report shows, once again, a simple but powerful truth: we need to stop pumping oil and gas from the ground if we are to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement,\" said Andrea Meza, Costa Rica's minister for environment and energy. \n\"We must cut with both hands of the scissors, addressing demand and supply of fossil fuels simultaneously. That is why, together with Denmark, we are leading the creation of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance to put an end to the expansion of fossil fuel extraction, plan a just transition for workers and start winding down existing production in a managed way.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.

You can cover your drinks but how are you going to stop someone stabbing you?\"\nAnother 19-year-old student, Zara Owen, told the BBC she blacked out shortly after arriving at a club in Nottingham and later discovered a pin prick in her leg.\nShe believes she was spiked through an injection. \nGroups from more than 30 universities around the UK have joined an online campaign calling for the boycott of nightclubs.\nCampaigners say they are seeking \"tangible\" changes to make night-time venues safer, such as covers or stoppers for drinks and better training for staff.\nLarissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students (NUS), said: \"It's absolutely disgusting that in the past few days a number of students have reported instances of women being spiked on nights out.\n\"My rage, love and solidarity goes out to all those who have been impacted.\"\nA University of Nottingham spokesperson added: \"We are working closely with Nottinghamshire Police and the city's nightlife venues to monitor, review and learn from incidents and experiences in the city centre.\n\"We have contacted them about the specific concerns raised and will continue to liaise with them.\"\nNadia Whittome, Labour MP for Nottingham East, said she had been contacted by a number of constituents who were \"terrified of going out\", including one woman who suspects she was injected.\nShe called for quicker gathering of evidence after a suspected spiking, as well as long and short-term measures to prevent it happening.\n\"It's very difficult to know what the solutions are,\" she said. \"We have an idea of what the solutions aren't.\n\"After Sarah Everard in particular, trust in police is at an all-time low, it's been shattered. Police officers in clubs is not going to reassure women.\"\nYvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, asked a police chief on Wednesday about the scale of the problem.\nSarah Crew, the temporary Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police - who also has a role on the National Police Chief's Council - said she only became aware of spiking by injection \"this morning\". \n\"I can see there are a number of police forces investigating them,\" she said. \"I think it's a fair assumption there may be a sexual motive in those, but there isn't an indication.\"\nMs Cooper said she had spoken to someone who was in A&E last night, believing she had been spiked with a needle.\nShe added Home Secretary Priti Patel had asked for a report.\nSupt Kathryn Craner, from Nottinghamshire Police, said the force was investigating an increase in reports of drinks being spiked in the city.\nShe added: \"We've also received a small number that have been associated with pain or a mark on part of their body or a scratching sensation, as though they have been physically spiked.\n\"We are taking these reports really seriously and have dedicated resources to it to understand what is happening.\"\nThe force said a 20-year-old man had been arrested \"on suspicion of possession of class A and class B and cause [to] administer poison or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve and annoy\" following an incident in Lower Parliament Street on 16 October. \nThe man has now been released on bail.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "The government has laid out its plans to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and take the UK towards being a zero carbon economy by 2050. These including more electric cars, planting trees and moving away from gas-powered central heating.\nBut what potential hazards are there ahead for ministers?\nSome in the prime minister's own party doubt the economic arguments in favour of moving towards what they consider an over-reliance on renewable energy sources.\nConservative MP John Redwood asked in the House of Commons what would happen when the sun stopped shining and the wind stopped blowing. Another, Steve Baker, said a lot of \"assumptions\" were involved and asked that ministers carry out a \"comprehensive audit\" of their plans. \nOthers are concerned about the cost to the general public, particularly those on lower incomes, and the impact that, in turn, may have on their chances at the next election. \nCraig Mackinlay said it could become \"electorally difficult\" once people realised the plans \"cost them money\" or mean \"a lifestyle that's not as convenient\".\nGiven that the Conservatives have an 80-seat majority, this is unlikely to stop any plans becoming law, but if some of Mr Johnson's backbenchers are not persuaded, there could be some political turbulence.\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband was scathing in his response to the government's announcement, saying there was nothing like \"the commitment we believe is required\", in terms of investment, to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nLabour's commitment to borrow and invest \u00a328bn per year in tackling climate change is a markedly different approach to the Conservatives. The Treasury has said borrowing heavily to cut greenhouse gases goes against the \"polluter pays\" principle and passes the costs on to future taxpayers. \nIt's not certain how this will play out in Parliament or whether this could become an important dividing line between the parties - and how it would play with voters.\nThe Treasury accepts there will be an overall cost to achieving net zero emissions in the short term, but sources stress the cost of inaction would also be significant. \nNo overall figure is given but officials admit new taxes will be needed to recoup the revenue lost from the move away from petrol and diesel fuelled cars, for example.  \nThe government raised \u00a337bn from fuel duty and vehicle excise duty in the 2019-20 financial year, or about 1.7% of GDP.\nA carbon tax could plug some of this, but the takings would dwindle as emissions fall, leaving a big shortfall.\nIn an assessment to go with the government's carbon-cutting plans, the Treasury said that \"as with all economic transitions, ultimately the costs and benefits of the transition will pass through to households through the labour market, prices and asset values\".\nThere is evidence of public support for stronger measures to tackle climate change, but if households end up having to spend a lot more money to go greener, there could be increased unease among voters that the government will not want ahead of a likely general election in the next couple of years.\nIn particular, it is feared this could go down badly in some of the former industrial areas of the the Midlands and northern England where the Conservatives made large gains from Labour in 2019.\n\"Any policies we bring in will be designed to be fair across the board,\" the PM's spokesman said.\nOne thing most governments agree on is that any effort to reduce emissions must be international if it is to succeed in limiting temperature rises.\nWith the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow fast approaching, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hope his plan prompts other countries to make similar commitments and boost the chances of the UK brokering a renewed global effort to cut greenhouse gases. \nIf the world's biggest CO2 producers - including the US, China and India - reach an agreement it could ease domestic political pressures and allow him to claim more of an environmental \"legacy\".\nUS President Jo Biden and Indian PM Narendra Modi are attending COP26, but China's Xi Jinping is not thought likely to do the same."

      "tags": "Economics,Inflation,UK economy,Bank of England",
      "text": "Price rises dipped slightly in September as the economy continued to reopen, according to official figures.\nThe increase in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, fell to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in August.\nHigher prices for transport were the biggest contributor to price rises.\nIt comes after the Bank of England warned it \"will have to act\" over rising inflation, suggesting interest rates may rise soon.\nThe inflation rate fell back slightly last month, partly due to lower prices in the hospitality sector.\nPrices in restaurants and cafes rose less this summer than the last, when the government's Eat Out to Help Out Scheme was running,the Office for National Statistics said.\nUnder the scheme, diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals up to \u00a310 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. \nMike Hardie, head of prices at the ONS, said: \"However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year.\n\"The costs of goods produced by factories rose again, with metals and machinery showing a notable price rise. Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer.\"  \nSimply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a \u00a31 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%.\nIt applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted.\nYou may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money.\nRead more about inflation here.\nAlthough price rises edged lower in September, the increase of 3.1% remains far above the Bank of England's target of 2%.\nLast month, transport costs made the biggest contribution to price increases.\nAverage petrol prices stood at 134.9 pence a litre, compared with 113.3 pence a litre in September of 2020, when travel was reduced under travel restrictions.\nThe ONS added that the September 2021 price for fuel was the highest recorded since September 2013.\nA rise in used car prices, which were 2.9% higher in September than in August, also contributed to higher transport costs.\nOther factors such as demand for oil and gas rising around the world have pushed up the price of energy.\nMeanwhile, there are shortages and bottlenecks affecting the availability of some important goods like computer chips, which are also increasing costs for businesses.\nSuren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that further price increases were expected in the coming months \"with the increase in the energy price cap, partial reversal of the VAT reductions for hospitality and tourism and persistent supply chain disruption\".\nHe warned that rising inflation could disrupt UK's economic recovery by squeezing people's spending power and companies' profit margins.\nEveryone is affected by rising costs, but if you're on a low income or don't have savings to fall back on, you're more likely to feel the impact.\nAnd if your pay isn't going up in line with price rises, you may notice a fall in the \"real value\" of your wages - what you earn buys less.\n\"We're just starting to notice the pinch a little bit,\" Ruth Holroyd told BBC Breakfast. She usually takes on the task of doing the family's weekly shop. \n\"I've noticed that the prices are higher for the overall shop, but where prices stay the same for things like grapes and strawberries that come in a punnet, the punnets have shrunk, so you don't get as much.\"\nShe is mostly worried about the impact of rising energy bills. She was previously a People's Energy customer, but the firm ceased trading earlier in September, collapsing because of rising gas prices. \nRuth expects that the family's energy bill will double from \u00a3120 to \u00a3250 per month.\nA bit of inflation is considered to be a good thing. If prices were falling, then people might delay buying non-essential items in the hope of getting them cheaper.\nBut if prices rise too quickly, it's seen as a sign that the economy is running into difficulties.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday that price rises were a \"a real cause of some concern\", adding that the government wanted inflation rates to be lower.\nHe suggested that price increases were partially due to higher demand as the economy reopens.\n\"When you see quite strong economic growth, there is always the danger you will have inflation. Now the critical question is, how long is that inflation going to last for?\" he said.\nHe added that he had recently spoken with the governor of the Bank of England and that it was \"hopeful\" price rises would be contained.\nReferring to the new figures out on Wednesday, Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC, told the BBC's Today programme: \"We can't stand down our concerns about inflation just because this number was a bit lower than expected.\n\"Since September, there's been a big rise in natural gas prices, a rise in petrol prices and global oil prices and from the Bank of England's point of view, we've also seen more people start to get worried about inflation.\"\nShe warned that the economy was not \"out of the woods yet\".\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned on Sunday that the Bank of England \"will have to act\" over rising inflation.\nThe Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4% before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid.\nThe UK's central bank can raise interest rates in a bid to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In principle, it means that when borrowing costs rises, such as when mortgages become more expensive, people spend less and prices are driven down.\nInvestors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's2% target.\nHowever, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%.\nThe governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought.\nThe slight easing of inflation in September comes more as a temporary respite in the surging cost of living than a sign that it's over. \nLast month's figures compared August with a year before, when prices in restaurants and hotels were artificially low because of the government's Eat out to Help Out scheme. This month's figures, by contrast, compare prices now with where they were in September 2020, when the scheme was no longer operating. \nThe average rise in the cost of living of 3.1% masked sharp price rises in items such as air fares, up 9.7%, or carpets, up 9.6%. \nAnd there are signs of further inflationary pressure coming down the line, with manufacturers paying 11.4% more for raw materials and prices of goods leaving the factory gate up 6.7% - the biggest rise in a decade. \nAn interest rate rise by the end of the year, with rates continuing to rise in the new year, still looks more likely than not."

      "text": "Downing Street says it is \"keeping a very close eye\" on rising Covid cases - but the cabinet has not yet discussed rolling out its Plan B to control coronavirus in England this winter.\nDaily cases have been above 40,000 for seven days in a row, with 43,738 new Covid cases reported on Tuesday.\nAnother 223 deaths have been recorded, the highest since March, although daily figures are often bigger on Tuesdays.\nPM Boris Johnson has told the cabinet the UK faces \"a difficult winter\".\nUnder the government's winter plan, if the measures currently in place are not enough to prevent \"unsustainable pressure\" on the NHS, then steps like making face coverings mandatory in some settings and introducing vaccine passports could be considered as part of Plan B.\nThe prime minister told ministers the government had \"a plan in place to steer the country through this period\" and that people should \"continue to follow the guidance and get their jabs when called upon\".\nDowning Street said Mr Johnson had stressed that the government's autumn and winter plan \"continues to keep the virus under control\".\nNo 10 said the government was \"not complacent\" about rising cases but that, due to the vaccination programme, \"the levels we are seeing in both patients admitted to hospital and deaths are far lower than we saw in previous peaks\".\nThe seven-day average of new Covid cases in the UK has risen from around 34,000 a day at the beginning of October to 44,145 cases per day.\nAnd the number of people in hospital across the UK who have Covid has risen by 10% in a week, from 7,039 on 11 October to 7,749 on Monday.\nThe number of deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test reported on Tuesday was the highest since 9 March, although due to reporting lags over the weekend daily figures are often higher on a Tuesday.\n\"Clearly we're keeping a very close eye on rising case rates,\" the prime minister's spokesman said. \nHe said there were \"no plans\" to use the Plan B contingency measures but stressed that the most important message for the public was \"the vital importance of the booster programme and indeed for those children who are eligible to come forward and get our jab\". \nChildren aged 12 to 15 in England will be able to book their jabs at vaccination centres, as well as through school, after concerns about rollout delays.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs younger teenagers would be able to book their jabs outside of school to \"make the most of half-term\".\nEarlier Prof Neil Ferguson, who is a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was \"critical\" to accelerate the booster jab programme, as well as for younger teenagers to receive a vaccine.\nHe said there was no reason to \"panic right now\" but \"people need to be aware that we have currently higher levels of infection in the community than we've almost ever had during the pandemic\".\nOn Tuesday Northern Ireland announced its own autumn and winter plan, which will see face coverings remain a legal requirement in crowded indoor spaces. \nThe Welsh government has previously set out its plans for winter, with First Minister Mark Drakeford saying Christmas this year was likely to be more normal. \nScotland has set out a winter vaccination strategy and already has measures in place such as the requirement of proof of vaccination status at nightclubs and face masks in schools.\nMeanwhile, officials say they are monitoring a new descendant of the Delta variant of Covid, which is causing a growing number of infections.\nDowning Street said that there was \"no evidence to suggest it is more easily spread\"."

He has convictions for drugs and weapon possession offences.\nHe uses mainstream social media to advertise and recruit.\nThe \"pact\", in which Hussein committed to killing women, was addressed to the \"mighty king Lucifuge Rofocale\", believed by the killer to be a powerful demon.\nKoetting promotes the idea that people can enter into pacts with the demon, telling followers that action will be required from them.\nThe BBC showed parallels between Koetting's public instructions about such pacts and what Hussein did, including what the killer requested and how the document was signed.\nHussein remained on the forum for two years, and sought advice from others on demonic pacts. \nThe BBC found that he was last active on the forum shortly before detectives raided his family home.\nSome of Koetting's written works openly discuss and encourage murder.\nOne of his texts, which he recently promoted on YouTube, advises people to study terrorist methods, quotes the moors murderer Ian Brady, and states: \"Always remember the first rule of murder: never kill a person that you have a reason to kill.\"\nThe text was written for an American Satanist group, Tempel ov Blood, whose violent material has appeared as an influence on seven young men recently convicted of neo-Nazi terror offences in a series of trials in the UK.\nPart of a larger British organisation, Order of Nine Angles, its extremist material advocates child murder and sexual violence, with members appearing at the sites of dreadful crimes to celebrate what happened.\nKoetting accepts being in the organisation. \nOne book states he \"joined with an American cell of the notorious British Order of Nine Angles\" and \"shoved himself beyond morality and humanity\".\nKoetting's pages on Facebook and Instagram, which had thousands of followers, had been left online, but the social media giant said they had now been removed for violating its \"dangerous individuals and organisations policies\". \nA spokesperson for YouTube said: \"Hate has no place on YouTube and we are deeply saddened by this terrible incident. \n\"We have strict policies to ensure that our platform is not used to incite violence and we are in the process of carefully reviewing the content against these stringent rules.\"\nKoetting has never responded directly to the BBC's questions, but following publication of our investigation he posted online saying: \"I'm bringing the battle to their doorsteps and I fly faster than the wind.\""

      "tags": "Welsh government",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that England will be heading into what's become known as a \"Plan B\" set of restrictions.\nIts in response to the emergence of Omicron, with officials increasingly concerned at the variant's transmissibility and pressure it could put on the NHS.\nIn Wales, the devolved government has a set of regulations that look very much like Mr Johnson's announcement for England.\nPeople are already asked to work from home, and Covid passes are required in more venues than in England. Mask wearing has remained mandatory in many indoor public places, barring pubs and restaurants.\nYet case rates have remained high - with seven day rates not fallen below 470 per 100,000 for months.\nBoosters are being rolled out to more people, but should officials want to slow the spread while more arms are being jabbed, there is a plan they could implement.\nIt involves a return to the restrictions on our social lives and on businesses that were axed in summer.\nMinisters, before Omicron, were at pains to stress they did not think a lockdown would be necessary again.\nNow, the picture is unclear.\nWelsh ministers have never ruled out needing to return to restrictions on businesses and our social lives, but have played down the chance of a new lockdown in the past.\nBut ministers in Cardiff face potentially difficult choices if the decisions they want to take are different to those being considered in London, and the money to support Welsh restrictions does not emerge.\nWales, in common with the rest of the UK, currently has no restrictions on social contact and all businesses are allowed to open.\nBut mask wearing is the law in indoor public spaces, including shops, public transport, hospitals and social care settings. The exception is in pubs, restaurants and nightclubs.\nThe UK government had scrapped mask rules in England during the summer, but re-introduced them after Omicron emerged.\nPeople in Wales are also legally required to obtain a NHS Covid pass if they are going to large events, a nightclub or a venue that's similar to a nightclub.\nThe law goes further than the requirement in England, with passes also now needed to go to cinemas, theatres and concert halls.\nThe pass needs to show if an individual has had a recent negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours, or two vaccinations.\nAnd it is not a legal restriction, but individuals are advised to work from home if they can.\nWhile there are no plans, the picture has become uncertain.\nMinisters had hoped expanding the NHS Covid pass system would avoid the need to take more drastic action.\nBut in recent days Welsh ministers have not been able to say what restrictions will be in place during the festive period.\nThey have instead emphasised people should take precautions - like taking a lateral flow test before meeting relatives.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has previously said he has no plans to shut businesses.\nBut he had also written a letter to the prime minister asking for financial support if he needed to implement \"more interventionist measures\".\nHe said the point of the letter was to make it clear to the UK government it they \"can't do what they did last year\", referring to a row when the Welsh government decided to go into a firebreak lockdown in October 2020 but furlough was not extended in response.\nUnder the latest Covid control plan, Wales is currently classed as being \"Covid Stable\", where there are very few restrictions.\nBut the Welsh government could move to \"Covid Urgent\", drawn up if new and unexpected Covid pressures emerge - like a new variant that does not respond to vaccines, or if there is unsustainable pressure on the NHS.\nIn that scenario, the Welsh government plans to return to the alert level lists of restrictions it had in place last year - stretching from restrictions on socialising to a Welsh lockdown.\nMinisters have given no clues what alert level they may choose in response to Omicron, or even if they will move to Covid urgent.\nThe lightest set of restrictions, classed as alert level one, would see the rule of six on social contact indoors, and nightclubs closed.\nAt alert level two, meetings with people outside your extended household in a private home would be effectively banned, and ice rinks shut.\nIn alert level three, more venues would be forced to close, and pubs and restaurants would only be able to serve outside, and outdoor gatherings limited to six.\nFinally, alert level four would reintroduce a stay-at-home lockdown like that seen in January.\nBut the rules are not set in stone. Laws on coronavirus in Wales have changed rapidly as the pandemic and they could be changed again.\nThe Alpha variant contributed to large Covid wave at the end of last year, overwhelming hospital services. Wales was badly hit.\nCinemas and other indoor entertainment venues were closed at the start of December, and alcohol was banned from sale in pubs, restaurants and cafes.\nBut the situation saw Labour ministers go further.\nThe country went into lockdown on 23 December, and plans to allow social contact indoors over the Christmas break were limited to just Christmas Day. \nMoving to Covid Urgent, combined with a ramping up of restrictions on businesses, poses real dilemmas for a devolved government that cannot summon large pots of cash.\nA long Welsh lockdown without the help the Welsh government has asked for from the UK government could leave thousands out of work and facing significant financial hardship.\nWhile the individual UK nations have pursued sometimes different lockdown policies, they did it with financial firepower from Westminster in the background - including the furlough scheme.\nFurlough ended on 30 September and as things stand there are no plans to bring it back.\nShould a situation develop where pressure on the NHS in Wales was acute, but furlough did not return, the stakes in a Wales-only lockdown where businesses shut would be high for Mark Drakeford.\nBut if the situation is bad in Wales, it may be the same in England, where Boris Johnson's government will face similar pressures."

Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the attack.\nFloral tributes to Sir David were being moved on Tuesday from outside Belfairs Methodist Church, where he was attacked, to his constituency office.\nA sign from Southend Borough Council outside the church asks those paying tribute to the MP to leave flowers at Iveagh Hall. A book of condolence is open both there and at the Civic Centre in Southend.\nOn Monday, Sir David's family, including his wife Julia, visited the church to read some of the messages left in his memory.\nLater MPs paid tribute to their colleague and Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the Queen had given her approval for Southend to be granted city status - something for which Sir David had long campaigned."

I just wish my parents were here - they're looking down and my children are quite excited.\n\"My aim is to pass on the skill that I love so much, because everybody has to cook each day. Whether it's a student or whatever it is, you've got to feed yourself so why not learn to do it well and enjoy it.\"\nAt the same ceremony, Peaky Blinders writer Steven Knight - whose latest film, Spencer, explores three days in the life of Diana, Princess of Wales - was made a CBE.\nKaren Gibson, founder and director of the Kingdom Choir that performed during the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding, was also honoured with an MBE.\nAfter studying cooking in France and the UK, Dame Mary worked for a number of food industry bodies and wrote recipe pages of Housewife magazine.\nHer first cookbook, The Hamlyn All Colour Cookbook, was published in 1970 and she has gone on to write more than 50 others, selling millions of copies around the world.\nShe became a household name to a new generation of cake lovers thanks to her role as a judge on The Great British Bake Off, alongside Paul Hollywood, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins.\n\"I thoroughly enjoyed being on Bake Off, I was there seven years.

      "tags": "Film,Musical Theatre",
      "text": "Leslie Bricusse, the prolific British songwriter behind many of cinema's biggest hits such as Candyman and Goldfinger, has died at the age of 90.\nHis friend Dame Joan Collins described him as \"one of the giant songwriters of our time\".\nPetula Clark, who sang You and I from 1968's Goodbye Mr Chips, told BBC Radio 4 he was \"extraordinary\".\nBricusse's career spanned 60 years with other credits including Talk to the Animals from Doctor Dolittle.\nHe also wrote Candyman and Pure Imagination from the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\nStage impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber released a statement, calling Bricusse \"the most underestimated British songwriter of all time\".\nJohn Berlinsgame from Variety told the Today programme that Bricusse was \"not only an artist but a lyrical genius\".\nIn his six decade career, he was constantly writing and had a catalogue of more than 1,000 songs to his name.\nHe wrote the lyrics to Shirley Bassey's classic Goldfinger, one of the most memorable Bond theme tunes, with long-time collaborator Antony Newley.\nBricusse also wrote the lyrics to You Only Live Twice, sung by Nancy Sinatra.\nOther collaborations with Newley, Dame Joan's former husband, included Feeling Good, made famous by Nina Simone.\nBricusse's agent confirmed the songwriter's death \"with a breaking heart\", saying he died in his sleep on Tuesday morning. He had been married to actress Yvonne Romain for more than 60 years.\nDame Joan said: \"One of the giant songwriters of our time, writer of Candyman, Goldfinger amongst so many other hits, and my great friend Leslie Bricusse has sadly died today. \n\"He and his beautiful Evie have been in my life for over 50 years. I will miss him terribly, as will his many friends.\"\nFilm expert Berlinsgame told the Today programme: \"He would be clever, very witty but also heartfelt and emotional.\"\nVocalist and actress Clark also told Today: \"He was a dear friend who I've known for many years. He wrote all the time, never stopped. I will miss him\u2026 he was extraordinary, I'm just beside myself.\" \nStage star Elaine Paige said on Twitter: \"Shocked & saddened by the news that the brilliant & wonderful Leslie Bricusse has died.\n\"One of our great songwriters. My first ever professional role was in Roar of the Greasepaint musical [for which Bricusse wrote Feeling Good]. We've been friends for many years.\"\nBorn in Pinner, north west London, Bricusse and Newley's fruitful partnership saw them write 1961 musical Stop the World I Want to Get Off and the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, based on Roald Dahl's popular children's book. \nDavid Walliams paid tribute to Bricusse's songwriting saying on Twitter: \"The great Gene Wilder sings Leslie Bricusse's magical Pure Imagination from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It is so beautiful it makes me weep.\"\nBricusse also wrote many other musicals including Scrooge and Hook, the latter with Hollywood composer John Williams.\nSometimes working under the pseudonym Beverley Thorn, he co-wrote skiffle singer Lonnie Donegan's 1960 hit My Old Man's a Dustman (Ballad of a Refuse Disposal Officer).\nBut it was Bricusse's contribution to musicals that defined his career. This included two Oscars for his work. Talk to the Animals won best original song in 1968, while Victor/Victoria - which he wrote with Henry Mancini - won best original song score or adaptation in 1983. \nHe won a Grammy in 1963, which he shared with Newley, for the song What Kind of Fool Am I? from Stop the World I Want to Get Off.\nAsked in 2015 how he felt about winning his Academy Awards, he said: \"The Oscars are brilliant. If the whole world was run by the Oscar committee it would be a much better place.\n\"I have nothing but admiration for them. I'm playing par - I'm 10 nominations and two wins. So if you reckon you win one in five, I'm on par,\" he said.\nAlso in 2015, he staged Pure Imagination - The Songs of Leslie Bricusse, a musical revue reflecting on his vast back catalogue.\nThe composer and lyricist was said to be adamant that his musical theatre scores should be sung traditionally, rather than jazzed up to suit a particular producer's whims.\nPresenter and former musical theatre star Philip Schofield said: \"I'm so sad to hear of the death of my friend, the brilliant Leslie Bricusse whose songs I loved singing in Dr Dolittle. My love to his family.\"\nBricusse described himself in his book Pure Imagination: A Sorta-biography as \"one of the luckiest people I know, second only perhaps to Ringo Starr\".\n\"It's not really an autobiography. It's about incidents rather than my entire life, and it's about other people as much as me. I just put down the things I remembered!\"\nBricusse stated at the outset of one of his early chapters that he would be dropping names \"like fragrant rose petals\".\nThe book was interspersed with anecdotes and quotes from some of his famous friends, including Dame Julie Andrews, Sir Elton John and Sir Michael Caine. \nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Food and drink firms are seeing \"terrifying\" price rises, a sector trade body has said, warning of a knock-on effect for consumers.\nFood and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright told MPs inflation is between 14% and 18% for hospitality firms.\nThe price rises for food firms' ingredients will lead to consumer price rises, he said, and described the situation as concerning.\nThe UK's rate of inflation was 3.2% in August and is expected to rise further.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey recently warned it \"will have to act\", suggesting that UK interest rates may soon rise from the historic low of 0.1%.\nMr Wright told MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee: \"Inflation is a bigger scourge than anything else because it discriminates against the poor.\"\nThe Office for National Statistics will publish the latest inflation figures for September on Wednesday. It is expected to rise further above the Bank of England's target of 2% for longer than previously thought.  \nMake UK, the manufacturers' organisation, said that inflation was becoming \"baked in\" among its members.\nStephen Phipson, chief executive at Make UK, told MPs that while there was a welcome rise in demand, many manufacturers are looking at 30% to 40% average increases in material costs.\n\"When people are able to get hold of materials they are passing those costs on which does imply to us that inflation is more or less baked in at this stage now,\" he said.\n\"This is not a transitory inflationary demand we are seeing really serious issues now in terms of price increases.\"\nDes Gunewardena, chief executive of high-end restaurant group D&D London, says his business has seen half of its costs rise, including surging energy prices. \nHe says staff shortages are his \"number one issue\" and has increased salaries by 10%.\nThe business has 1,700 employees across the UK and is currently 150 staff short, which he said could lead to a \"nightmare situation\" in the busier December period.\nTable covers have been reduced from 400 on a Friday night at his Quaglino's restaurant to between 300 and 350 due to staff shortages. \nHowever, he said the restaurants have seen increased customer spending, so he is stocking up on specific champagne brands ahead of time, to pre-empt possible supply problems. \n\"I think we'll have a very strong Christmas so there's no need to panic yet, but I expect further inflation in January when there won't be the same spending to offset the extra costs\". \nAmid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas, the government is taking steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers.\nThe shortage has been blamed on several factors, including Covid, Brexit and tax changes.\nThe government introduced temporary visas for 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden.\nDuncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), told the select committee that the government's visa scheme to ease driver shortages had been \"designed to fail\". \n\"Reports haven't really eased at all things are not visibly getting better at this stage,\" he said. \nRegarding the government's measures to try to ease the crisis, Mr Buchanan said \"visually on the ground that is not having an effect\". \nA survey by the RHA of its members estimated there was now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK.\n\"The consumer is really going to visualise this in terms of reduced choice. We have supply chain disruption but that doesn't mean we are going to run out of food,\" Mr Buchanan added. "

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nCoronavirus infection rates have been above 40,000 every day for the past seven days and on Tuesday the number of deaths relating to the virus was the highest since March. Although the daily figures tend to be higher on Tuesdays and deaths are well below the winter peak, the NHS Confederation, which represents health service organisations, says some Covid restrictions must be reintroduced immediately in England to avoid \"stumbling into a winter crisis\". The government's \"keeping a very close eye on rising case rates\", but there are no plans to move into Plan B. It's instead focusing on Plan A, which includes offering booster jabs and vaccinating children.\nAs the economy reopened after coronavirus restrictions lifted, prices continued to rise in September but at a slower rate than in the previous month. The increase in the cost of living, measured by Consumer Prices Index, which looks at things such as food prices and energy bills, fell to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in the year to August. Higher prices for transport were the biggest contributor to price rises. Why is the cost of living going up? Find out here.\nIt seems we're using cash machines much less but we're taking more money out of them when we do. Before the pandemic people were visiting a cash machine on average three times a month, now 18 months later people are using them less than twice a month. But the average amount being withdrawn has climbed more than \u00a310 to just under \u00a380 in the last two years.\nThe pandemic has left tens of thousands of women newly widowed in India including Taruna Arora. Her husband Rajeev contracted Covid-19 during the country's devastating second wave. \"Rajeev's death is paralysing,\" the 46-year-old says. He was the sole bread winner. Taruna is relying on their savings to support their two children and hopes to find a job but, like many other widows, she has no work experience.

      "tags": "Carbon capture and storage,Greenhouse gas emissions,COP26,Climate change,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Countries have set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.\nThey hope to achieve the target of \"net zero\" by 2050, to help slow global warming.\nNet zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nAchieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.\nGreenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.\nMeanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.\nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises \"well below\" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. \nExperts say that to achieve this, net zero must be reached by 2050. \nNot all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain have to be compensated for, or offset - for example, by planting more trees.\nAlmost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of reducing carbon, although there may not be enough space for the number required.\nCarbon capture and storage has also been suggested as another solution. \nThis involves using machinery to remove carbon from the air, then solidifying it and burying it underground.\nHowever, the technology is still emerging, very expensive and as yet unproven.\nIt won't be easy. \nReaching net zero will involve moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our power, and abandoning vehicles run on petrol and diesel, in favour of those powered by electricity and hydrogen.\nGas central heating will need to be replaced by alternative sources, such as heat pumps. \nReaching net zero could also mean flying far less in future, and eating less red meat.\nPresenting the government's net zero strategy to the House of Commons in the run up to COP26, the government pledged:\nThe government had already announced a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, and that all the UK's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035.\nAt the time, Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband called the latest announcements \"a massive let-down\".\nMore than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050.\nHowever, China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 in the world - says it's aiming for \"carbon neutrality\" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. \nRussia - the third-largest producer of oil worldwide - has also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. \nUntil recently President Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures.\nUS President Joe Biden criticised the Russian and Chinese leaders for not attending the COP26 summit. \nIndia - the world's fourth biggest emitter of CO2 after China, the US and the EU - has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070. \nSome of the world's most heavily populated countries - including Indonesia - haven't made any net zero commitment.\nBut many of the announcements which have already come out of the COP26 summit on deforestation, cutting methane and reducing coal are directly linked to helping countries hit their net zero goal.\nThere's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.\nFor instance, Country A might record lower emissions if it shuts down energy-intensive industries such as steel production. \nBut if Country A then imports steel from Country B, it's effectively handed on its carbon emissions to Country B instead of reducing the sum total of greenhouse gases.\nThere are schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. \nHowever, some climate scientists worry such arrangements could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their own fossil fuel usage. \nAnd it's hard to say that initiatives funded to offset emissions elsewhere would not have happened anyway.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

We want to see this as a platform for development for a career. We don't know yet if they'll be a new artist but if they are we want to make sure this is going to be a really positive experience.\"\nSpeaking to The Sun, Dua Lipa said: \"I'm a proud Brit whilst also being a proud Kosovan. I'm happy to lend my manager to the cause. I'll be cheering them on!\"\nDespite the lack of success in recent years the appetite for Eurovision is clearly still strong for viewers in Britain.\nThis year's Eurovision Song Contest was won by Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin, whose song Zitti E Buoni became a top 20 UK hit. Their victory was watched by an average audience of 7.8 million on BBC One, making it the most watched final since 2014.\nSpeaking of the hook-up with Tap, BBC entertainment boss Kate Phillips said that the corporation has \"grand ambitions\" for the 2022 contest, and was \"really excited to announce this collaboration that will enable us to tap into some great music talent.\"\nThe competition will take place at Turin's PalaOlimpico Arena on May 10, 12 and 14, with the final landing on the latter date.\nThe European Broadcasting Union announced on Wednesday that all 39 countries that took part last time out are set to return next year, plus two additional ones - Montenegro and Armenia.\nItaly has previously hosted the contest in Naples and Rome.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Some trainee doctors and consultants at one Welsh health board are \"scared to come to work\", a report has found.\nA report by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) described \"frightening experiences\" staff faced at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board.\nChronic understaffing and excessive workloads at the Grange hospital in Cwmbran were causing \"very serious patient safety concerns\", it added.\nThe health board said it had taken the findings of the report very seriously.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said the report made for \"very sobering reading\".\nThe report, obtained by BBC Wales, said that some trainee doctors and consultants were worried about working in case they lost their licence to practise.\nIt also said the problems had caused some consultants to feel demoralised and on the brink of leaving. \nDr Olwen Williams, Wales' vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: \"This was a difficult visit, with some powerful testimony. \n\"The new clinical model sees both the workforce and patients moving between multiple sites. Where three hospitals once struggled with recruitment, now there are four sites with rota gaps.\" \nCritical care and specialist services at the Royal Gwent and Nevill Hall hospitals, in Newport and Abergavenny respectively, were centralised at the \u00a3358m Grange University Hospital last year.\nHowever, the report noted a gap in general medicine at the hospital, meaning older patients and those with more complex general medical needs - which do not fall under specialist care - can sometimes fall between the gaps.\nThe report said the issues were not limited to care at the Grange, as the other hospitals within the health board area - the Royal Gwent, Nevill Hall and Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in Caerphilly - have minor injury units but no emergency department, leaving them with limited diagnostics and technology.\nOne trainee told the authors of the report: \"On one overnight shift, I treated a four-year-old with seizures. The ambulance took six hours.  \n\"Colleagues treated an 18-month-old with burns. Lots of kids come in with respiratory distress. Paediatric cases are not uncommon.\n\"We've treated stabbing victims. Colleagues delivered a baby earlier in the minor injuries unit. These things shouldn't happen at all.\" \nAnother trainee said: \"There's so much patient movement with [this] model. I recently sent someone from Nevill Hall to the Grange to get a scan, then to the [Royal] Gwent to get a follow-up procedure, then back to Nevill Hall. \n\"That's three bed moves, three ambulance crews and three medical people dealing with the same patient. It's extremely inefficient.\"\nAnother said: \"We've got patients who have been moved eight times between different hospitals and wards. These are 90-year-old patients with dementia.\"\nAnd another added: \"I worry about the safety of the patients coming into this hospital.\"\nThe report said \"almost all trainees\" the authors had spoken to told them they would not want to return to work at the health board.\nA number of staff said they had made repeated attempts to raise the concerns with management before the Grange was opened. \n\"Around 60 doctors wrote a letter to the chief executive, but they just weren't listening,\" said a consultant physician. \n\"There was this almighty push to open the Grange come hell or high water. It was complete madness.\"\nIn June, more than 30 consultants and about 50 trainees and physician associates joined a virtual visit by RCP members. \nConsultants have also requested private meetings with the RCP to discuss their concerns - it is claimed some fear speaking up, have been accused of whistleblowing or are on the verge of leaving the health board.  \nHowever, the RCP said it has also been told some things have begun to improve since their visit, with one trainee describing the meeting as a turning point.\nAndrew Goddard, RCP president, said: \"During our virtual visit some trainees told us that they were scared to come to work, in case they lose their GMC [General Medical Council] number.\n\"In my eight years at the Royal College of Physicians I've visited hundreds of different hospitals - and I had never heard that before.\"\nThe report referred to \"high anxiety about unsafe working and the potential for patient harm\".\nOne trainee told the report's authors: \"We were projected to cover 190 beds, but we were covering 300 and 400 medical beds. Those numbers still haven't come down.\" \nAnother said: \"I think a lot of people are afraid of losing their GMC number, because at some point, something bad is going to happen. It won't have anything to do with your abilities as a doctor, it's just your bad luck if you're on that shift.\"\nAs a university hospital, trainees are expected to attend outpatient clinics, but as those are based at other hospitals, the understaffing issue at the Grange means many say they cannot attend.\nDr James Calvert, medical director for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, said it was important to remember the report was made during the pandemic, \"which has significantly disrupted the delivery of our health services\".\nHe said the health board was working to ensure the right staff are available to deal with \"really difficult situations\" so those who are training do not have to cope with the \"significant emotional\" toll of them.\nDr Calvert said staff shortages were being addressed, adding interviews for 21 junior doctor positions would start this week.\n\"We are listening to our staff to ensure the best service to patients, whilst also maintaining the wellbeing of our clinical teams,\" he added.\nIn the Senedd on Wednesday, Ms Morgan said: \"I will be watching to make sure that what they said they're going to do is actually enacted.\"\nShe spoke in response to a topical question from Plaid Cymru MS Peredur Owen Griffiths, who described the report as \"disturbing\" and \"unacceptable\".\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said: \"For staff to feel frightened of working in Labour's flagship hospital demonstrates a devastating failure on a planning, governance, and pastoral level.\""

If it had gone ahead, this week's trip would have been her 26th visit.\nRoyal visits to Northern Ireland during its centenary year have included the first in line to the throne, Prince Charles who went to Belfast in May, and Prince William who visited Londonderry in September."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

For that reason, our Net Zero Strategy published yesterday contained no such plans,\" it said.\nThe Behavioural Insights Unit, also known as the Nudge Unit, wrote the document.\nThe unit is most known for its role in the design of the sugar levy and early comments on the pandemic \"herd immunity\" strategy.\nThe document was swiftly deleted and has been replaced with a note saying it was published in error, but BBC News obtained a copy.\nIt was also later put online by Alex Chapman, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation.\nThe Behavioural Insights Unit made a recommendation, following the example of the sugar levy, with a tax on producers or retailers of \"high-carbon foods\" to incentivise plant-based and local food diets.\nIt suggests \"building support for a bold policy\", such as a tax on producers of sheep and cattle meat.\nHowever, it states that an \"unsophisticated meat tax would be highly regressive\".\nThe research paper also says the government can begin to get people used to the idea of plant-based food through its spending at hospitals, schools, prisons, courts and military facilities.\nIt also states a \"timely moment to intervene\" in changing diets could be to target people attending university or first-time renters.\nThe document recognises that \"asking people to directly eat less meat and dairy is a major political challenge\", although a positive portrayal and \"smaller asks\" may be possible - for example, people learning one new recipe.\nWhen talking about flights, the paper suggests \"much stronger carbon taxes\".\nOne possibility discussed in the paper is trying to \"shift social norms\" to make in-person business meetings needing international flights a sign of \"immoral indulgence or embarrassment\" rather than a sign of \"importance\". \nMeanwhile, it says domestic tourism should be promoted to lessen consumer demand for international flights."

Through his lawyer, he has said that he will not cooperate until Mr Trump's executive privilege claim is resolved by a court. \nPresident Joe Biden's administration says Mr Trump has no legitimate privilege claim.\nThe boundaries of the claim will be tested on Thursday, when the House of Representatives votes on whether to uphold the contempt charge against Mr Bannon. \nIf upheld, the case will be referred to the justice department, which has the final say on bringing charges.\nThe riot on 6 January saw a mob of Mr Trump's supporters storm the Capitol building to disrupt the official certification of Joe Biden's election victory.\nMore than 670 people have since been charged with taking part. \nDemocrats argue that Mr Bannon is stalling to push back proceedings until after the midterm elections in November 2022, which may alter the balance of power in the House, which is the lower chamber of Congress.\nContempt of Congress cases are notoriously difficult to litigate - the last time such a prosecution took place was in 1983 against a Reagan administration official.\nBefore leaving office in January, Mr Trump pardoned Mr Bannon of charges that he had defrauded donors who gave money to fund construction of a southern border wall."

May the injured recover soon.\"\nWhile attributing the heavy rains to the climate crisis, experts have also cited hydro-power projects in the higher reaches of the Himalayas, and excessive and often unchecked construction on steep slopes which cause damage to the region's fragile ecology. \nExperts also say higher temperatures have meant lesser snow in the Himalayas - and this, coupled with heavy rains, is pushing large volumes of water downstream, triggering flash floods.\nThe southern coastal state of Kerala has also seen heavy rain since Friday.\nThousands of people have been moved to safety, with more than 1,600 homes destroyed or damaged."

      "text": "The business secretary has denied that individuals will bear the cost of changing to greener ways of living.\nKwasi Kwarteng said it was \"not true\" to say that the move to more environmentally friendly transport and energy production would \"cost us\".\nThe government plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050.\nThe Treasury has hinted tax rises may be necessary as revenues from fossil fuel-related activity dry up.\nAchieving net zero means the UK will no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without action on climate change, the world faces a hotter planet, rising sea levels and extreme weather.\nThe Treasury said hitting the target would put pressure on public spending, but added \"the biggest impact\" came from \"the erosion of tax revenues from fossil fuel-related activity\".\nLast year, \u00a337bn was raised through fuel duty and vehicle excise duty, but is believed the transition to electric vehicles could create a temporary tax vacuum by the 2040s, meaning new revenue-raising measures would be needed.\nA net-zero report by the Treasury said future governments \"may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue\" rather than relying on higher borrowing.\nIt also warned policies to support the adoption of electric vehicles \"may disproportionately benefit\" richer people, with those on lower incomes potentially bearing the brunt of increased costs.\n\"As higher income households drive more and are likely to adopt EVs [electric vehicles] earlier, the costs and benefits of EV adoption are likely to fall on higher income households first,\" the Treasury report said.\n\"Conversely, any changes to the cost of running an internal combustion engine vehicle will fall disproportionately on lower-income households, so there could be a trade-off in some instances.\"\nAsked on the BBC's Today programme if there was a danger that poorer people could lead to \"subsiding the green guilt of the rich\", Mr Kwarteng replied: \"No, I don't accept that at all.\"\nHe added that the transition to electric vehicles was \"successful and we should be doing it more rapidly\", but admitted there was still \"range anxiety\" over how far such vehicles could travel.\nMr Kwarteng said up to \u00a390bn by 2030 of private investment would help the country to source more energy from renewables, with \"evidence\" for such forecasts based on previous investments of \u00a3100bn being ploughed into offshore wind farms since 2012.\n\"It's not a heroic assumption to say that by 2030, we would have attracted an additional \u00a390bn,\" he said.\nAs well as plans to encourage more people to drive electric cars, the government is also going to offer subsidies of \u00a35,000 from next April for people to switch from gas boilers to low-carbon heat pumps. \nHeat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse - and are powered by electricity. An air-source heat pump costs between \u00a36,000 and \u00a318,000, depending on the type installed and the size of a property.\nAlthough up to 25 million UK homes have gas boilers, the government's grants will fund just 90,000 pumps over three years. Critics have said the plans do not go far enough.\nMr Kwarteng added the cost of heat pumps could \"come down\" as more companies began manufacturing them, which would see more people \"adopt them\".\n\"People will have seen that in their own lives. A few years ago with things like iPhones, at the beginning they were very, very expensive. Of course, the unit cost, as the private sector invests in producing these things, comes down,\" he said.\nThe recently released iPhone 13 handset is currently priced at \u00a3779 on Apple's website.\nMr Kwarteng admitted it was a \"lot of money\" to install a heat pump, adding: \"No-one is saying we are imposing heat pumps on anybody.\n\"What we are trying to do is encourage behaviour.\"\nThe government's net-zero plans come as global leaders prepare to meet in Glasgow to negotiate how to curb climate change."

You can cover your drinks but how are you going to stop someone stabbing you?\"\nNottinghamshire Police confirmed it was looking into reports of people being \"spiked physically\".\nThe University of Nottingham said it was \"extremely concerned\" by the reports and was working with police and venues to \"monitor, review and learn from incidents and experiences in the city centre\".\nOther police forces have confirmed there have been reports of injection spiking happening on nights out.\nPolice Scotland said its officers were investigating a \"small number of reports\" from Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow, which did not appear to be linked.\nAnd West Yorkshire Police said inquiries were ongoing into one report of spiking by injection in Leeds last week.\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said it was difficult to assess whether spiking by needle was becoming a national trend as only a handful of reports had been made to police.\nSarah Crew, the NPCC's lead officer for rape and adult sexual offences, said she has asked all police forces to look into the matter and offer support.\nShe added that it was a \"fair assumption\" that perpetrators of injection spiking have a \"sexual motive\", adding that general drink spiking was \"a problem\".\nMichael Kill, CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, said the organisation was \"very concerned\" about the reported increase in incidents and the industry would work with the Home Office to tackle the problem.\n\"It goes without saying that everyone should be able to enjoy a night out without fearing for their own safety, and we are saddened to hear that some don't feel this way,\" he said.\nThe call for a boycott against nightclubs across the UK comes under the name Girls' Night In and encourages people to stay away from clubs and do alternative activities instead.\nGirls' Night In Southampton's night of action is next Wednesday, one of the most popular student nights.\n\"We're calling for clubs and bars and all venues like that, to put more measures in place to protect people against spiking,\" one of the organisers, who wanted to stay anonymous, told BBC's Newsbeat.\nThey want to see covers handed out for cups, unattended drinks to be thrown out, increased surveillance and safe zones for people who may have been spiked.\nThe University of Southampton student said one of her group was spiked on a sports social last week, and taken outside by club security who thought she was drunk.\nShe was spotted by a friend who then alerted the rest of the group so they could go and look after her. She went to the hospital but did not tell the police about the incident, the student said."

      "text": "Netflix subscriptions picked up in the third quarter of 2021 as non-English language shows continued to be the streaming platform's best performers.\nThe US firm added 4.4 million users in the three months to 30 September, more than double the previous quarter.\nKorean TV series Squid Game was its biggest hit, watched by 142 million households in its first four weeks.\nIt comes as some Netflix staff prepare to walk out on Wednesday amid a backlash over comedian Dave Chappelle.\nThey accuse the star of mocking transgender people in his latest Netflix special, but the firm has defended him.\nThe strong performance for Netflix follows a sluggish start to 2021, when the surging demand for streaming  seen earlier on in the pandemic petered out. \nThe US firm - which is the world's largest streaming platform - now expects to add some 8.5 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter, above analysts' expectations.  \nIt's being driven by popular shows such as Sex Education, the Queen's Gambit and the global smash Squid Game. \nThe dystopian series - which tells the story of a group of people forced to play deadly children's games for money - has become a viral sensation and dethroned period drama Bridgerton as Netflix's most popular show to date. \nAccording to Bloomberg, the Korean series is thought to be worth some $900m to the streaming giant, after costing $21.4m to make. \nAnother non-English language show, La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist), also did well, with series five being watched by 69 million viewers in its first four weeks. \n\"We are now producing local TV and film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communities around the world,\" Netflix said in a letter to shareholders. \nThe firm expects to attract more new users in the run up to Chirstmas with returning seasons of popular shows such as \"Tiger King\" and \"Cobra Kai\".\nIt also agreed to acquire the Roald Dahl Story Company in September, pending regulatory approval, so will own the rights to titles like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda.\nThe David Chappelle special \"The Closer\" saw the boundary-pushing comic joking that \"gender is a fact\" and accuse LGBTQ people of being \"too sensitive\".\nIn one skit, Mr Chappelle, who is black, says: \"In our country you can shoot and kill [a black man], but you'd better not hurt a gay person's feelings.\"\nAhead of a rally on Wednesday at Netflix's California headquarters, a group representing trans staff told the firm to stop \"platforming hate speech\" and issued a series of demands. \n\"We want the company to adopt measures in the areas of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction, all of which are necessary to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,\" they said in a statement. \nIn a memo to staff earlier this month, Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos acknowledged some staff were \"left angry\" by Mr Chappelle's show, but defended the comic's artistic freedom and said the material had not caused \"real world harm\".\nOn Tuesday, however, Mr Sarandos told Deadline he regretted this initial response and should have done more to recognise staff's \"pain\". But he also said the firm did not plan to take down, edit or add content warnings to Mr Chappelle's show. \n\"Stand-up comedy is a pretty singular voice art form,\" he told Deadline. \"We really don't get involved and interfere with the material itself, and I think it's consistent with a brand of stand-up comedy and certainly consistent with Dave Chappelle's comedy, so I don't think a warning card or an edit would've been appropriate.\""

      "text": "Two former German soldiers have been arrested on suspicion of trying to form a terrorist mercenary force to fight in Yemen's civil war, prosecutors say.\nArend-Adolf G and Achim A face terrorism charges after police raids in southern Germany on Wednesday.\nThey allegedly planned to recruit up to 150 men for a private army made up of former police officers and soldiers.\nThey wanted to offer their services to Saudi Arabia's government for illegal missions in Yemen, prosecutors said.\nYemen has been racked by a civil war between the Saudi Arabia-backed internationally recognised government and the armed Houthi movement since 2014.\nSaudi Arabia entered the civil war in 2015 shortly after the capture of the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthis, who are supported by Iran.\nThe accused former soldiers wanted Saudi Arabia to finance their private operations in Yemen, prosecutors in Germany said. The men tried to approach Saudi Arabian government agencies but they received no response and their efforts were unsuccessful.\nIn a statement, federal prosecutors outlined extensive and serious allegations against the two \"ringleaders\", who had \"military knowledge and skills\".\nThe prosecutors allege that Arend-Adolf G and Achim A decided to set up a mercenary force under their exclusive command at the start of 2021. They planned to pay each member of their unit a wage of about \u20ac40,000 (\u00a333,700; $46,400) a month for their services, prosecutors said.\nArend-Adolf G had allegedly already tried to recruit at least seven people.\nGermany's Spiegel magazine, which first reported the arrests, said the mercenary force was supposed to attack and capture areas held by the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nArend-Adolf G and Achim A \"expected civilians to be killed and injured in connection with fighting\" in Yemen, prosecutors said. \nProsecutors also suspect the accused men wanted to advertise their military service for deployments in other conflicts.\nCiting sources, Spiegel said a tip from Germany's Military Counter-Intelligence Service (MAD) put the investigators on the trail of the men.\nOne of the accused was arrested in Munich and the other in Germany's south-western Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district. Their apartments in Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg were searched.\nThe former soldiers are expected to appear in court on Wednesday for a hearing about pre-trial detention."

They have not disclosed further details.\nNo charges have been laid and Mr Slater has not commented publicly.\nThe former batsman was part of the Australian cricket team from 1993 to 2001, playing 74 Tests.\nHe has since held prominent positions on TV but was let go last week by Australia's Channel Seven, which cited financial pressures.\nMr Slater made headlines in May when he accused Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison of having \"blood on his hands\" over his response to the pandemic.\nIt followed the government issuing a two-week ban on Australian citizens returning from India during the height of that nation's coronavirus crisis.\nThe father-of-three had been in India at the time, commentating for local networks on the Indian Premier League season."

      "text": "Morocco has banned flights to and from the UK due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nSeveral UK airlines and holiday companies have been told by the Moroccan government that flights will be suspended from 23:59 BST on Wednesday until further notice. \nFlights between Morocco and Germany and the Netherlands have also been suspended. \nThe BBC has contacted the Moroccan embassy and tourism office, as well as the UK Foreign Office for comment. \nLatest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that Morocco's weekly rate of reported coronavirus cases on 14 October stood at 10.4 per 100,000 people, compared with 445.5 per 100,000 people in the UK.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported 43,738 new Covid-19 infections, with new cases above 40,000 for seven days in a row. The number of patients in hospital rose by 10% in a week to 7,749 on Monday.\nAnother 223 deaths were recorded, the largest number since March, although daily figures are often higher on Tuesdays.\nThe UK government updated its advice on travel to Morocco to state that the Moroccan government has suspended direct flights between the UK and Morocco for an unspecified period of time. \nUK passengers are not banned from travelling from the country, but must travel via a third country to do so. \nThe advice states that UK travellers will need to provide proof that they have been fully vaccinated for at least two weeks or a negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before boarding. \nThey will also be asked to present a Public Health Passenger form to the Moroccan authorities on arrival.\nEasyJet has said that it was told this morning. It has cancelled its outbound flights from the UK, Germany and Netherlands to Morocco until 30 November. \nThe airline had two flights operating from Manchester and Gatwick to Marrakech, which it will operate as \"ferry flights\" for return customers due to travel back to the UK today.\nIt said that, ahead of receiving further guidance from the Moroccan government, it intends to fly inbound flights in the coming days as repatriation flight options. \n\"We are contacting all customers whose flights are cancelled with their options, which include a free of charge transfer, receiving a voucher or a refund,\" an EasyJet statement said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled a flight from Heathrow to the same destination, meanwhile holiday operator Tui confirmed it had also been contacted by the Moroccan government. \nTui said: \"We are contacting customers in departure date order to discuss their options, which include amending to another destination or a full refund. We would like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding during this time.\"\nThe tour operator said it currently has about 2,000 UK travellers in Morocco, but hasnot yet confirmed whether it will need to bring these passengers back early.\nThe flight ban will affect families in England and Wales who booked half-term holidays in Morocco for next week. \nMorocco's National Office of Airports said the policy will remain in place \"until further notice\".\nThe UK's Foreign Office has updated its advice on travel to Morocco to include the latest development. \nIt says that passengers returning to the UK from Morocco should contact their airline or tour operator to arrange an alternative route via a third country, such as Spain or France, where flights are operating as normal.\nAlison Sedgewick is currently on holiday in Agadir, off the south-western coast of Morocco, with her husband and son.\nOn Thursday, they were due to return from their first holiday in the two and a half years since her son was born.\n\"You couldn't write it\u2026 the one week we've chosen to go away and they've closed the borders while we're here,\" she said.\nHowever, Ms Sedgewick added she felt hopeful that because she booked a package holiday with Tui, things would get sorted out swiftly. She said she received a \"holding message\" from the tour operator, telling her she will hear more information within 24 hours.\n\"I'm hoping it'll be a bit sooner than that because the bus to the airport is supposed to be picking us at half six tomorrow evening,\" she added.\nWhile she joked that her main concern is ensuring she doesn't run out of nappies for her son, Ms Sedgewick said she did feel put off the idea of travelling during the upcoming winter months. \n\"We debated doing a city break in November or December but I don't feel confident travelling abroad over winter because things like this might become more common,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Peter Mercer, the owner of the Dar Zaman boutique hotel in Marrakech, said that several guests were \"rushing around\" and attempting to return to the UK on Wednesday before the ban came into place.\n\"It's going to have a major impact, not just from the UK but also the flights from Germany and the Netherlands,\" he said.\n\"It's not very encouraging because we're suddenly back to where we were in March 2020. In terms of our business model, it is worrying. People perhaps will lose faith in travel because restrictions can be imposed with little notice.\"\nWhile Mr Mercer said that he agrees with the Moroccan government's actions to reduce the spread of coronavirus, he hopes any restrictions on travel will be short-term."

      "text": "The US assistant secretary for health has been sworn in as the first transgender four-star officer in the country's history. \nDr Rachel Levine, 63, is now an admiral of the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.\nDr Levine, appointed by President Joe Biden, is already the highest-ranking openly transgender official in the US.\nShe described the occasion as \"momentous\" and \"historic\" during a swearing-in speech on Tuesday. \n\"May this appointment today be the first of many more to come, as we create a diverse and more inclusive future,\" she said in a speech that paid tribute to other LGBTQ individuals who came before her. \nDr Levine is a graduate of Harvard College and Tulane University School of Medicine and previously worked as a paediatrician. \nThe US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps has about 6,000 uniformed officers and is tasked with responding to health crises like the coronavirus pandemic and natural disasters. \nSecretary of Health Xavier Becerra described Dr Levine's appointment to the job as a \"giant step forward towards equality as a nation\". \nShe also served as Pennsylvania's physician general and the state's secretary of health, working on issues like responding to widespread opioid addiction.\nDr Levine was confirmed as US assistant secretary for health in a 52-48 Senate vote in March.\nDuring the confirmation process, the nominee faced questions over her handling of the coronavirus pandemic in nursing homes during her time as health secretary of Pennsylvania. \nCritics blamed the deaths of many elderly people on a state policy that required nursing homes to accept Covid patients.\nShortly after implementing that measure, Dr Levine acknowledged having moved her own mother out of a care home as virus cases rose."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Another big push towards electric vehicles is being made in the UK government's latest strategy to make the great shift to a virtually zero-carbon economy.\nMinisters are investing \u00a3620m in grants for electric vehicles and street charging points.\nCar makers will be mandated to sell a proportion of clean vehicles each year.\nAn extra \u00a3350m is promised to help the automotive supply chain move to electric.\nThe new plan set out by the government is supposed to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050.\nThe announcement comes 12 days before global leaders meet in Glasgow to negotiate how to curb climate change.\nAchieving\u00a0net zero means the\u00a0UK will\u00a0no longer be\u00a0adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nWithout action on climate change, the world faces a hotter planet, rising sea levels and extreme weather that threaten many forms of life.\nThe UK has already made progress in cutting emissions compared to the levels released in 1990. In 2019, the country released 40% less than in 1990. \nOn Tuesday the government also announced a strategy to address emissions from the UK's 30 million buildings.\nHomeowners will be able to apply for grants of up to \u00a35,000 to install low-carbon heat pumps to replace gas boilers.\nThe Labour party's Ed Miliband responded to the strategy, saying the \"plans falls short on delivery\" adding \"we've waited months for a heat and buildings strategy, it's a massive let-down\".\nProf Lord Nicholas Stern, Chair of LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said the plan will require \"strong investment and innovation\" and would generate a \"new and attractive form of growth\". But he warned that low-income households will need support.\nAnd Prof Dan Lunt, Professor of Climate Science at University of Bristol, called the strategy's approach to flying weak and unambitious. \nEnvironmental group Friends of the Earth criticised the strategy as \"riddled with holes and omissions\".\n\"The rapid electrification of new vehicles is certainly welcome, but many of the carbon savings this could bring will be wiped out by the government's \u00a327 billion road programme,\" it said.  \nIt also offers a further \u00a3120m to develop SMRs - small \"modular\" nuclear reactors that can be factory-built. These might go to the Wylfa site in Wales, although that's not certain.\nThese mini-reactors are being promoted heavily by Rolls Royce, although critics say the technology won't be mature in time to meet the UK's carbon targets.\nOn large nuclear: there's been much speculation about a go-ahead for Sizewell C in Suffolk. But funding has been a key sticking point and it seems an announcement has been put off until the Chancellor's spending review next week.\nThere will be an extra \u00a3625m for tree-planting and peat restoration, too - even though the current schedule is running way behind its targets.\nThe government is committing \u00a3140m to two clusters promoting carbon capture and storage to produce hydrogen. The hubs will be the North-West of England and North Wales, with Teesside and Humberside - the government has previously promised \u00a31bn to support CCS. \nHeavy industries in these areas will be fuelled by hydrogen split from natural gas. The resulting CO2 emissions will be pumped into undersea rocks for storage.\nThis will be controversial because environmentalists believe hydrogen should be obtained instead through electrolysis - using surplus wind energy. \nIt looks unlikely that there will be much hydrogen left over to heat people's homes, which is why the government is postponing any decision about hydrogen boilers until 2026.\nThe Treasury has hinted tax rises may be necessary to fund the government's net zero strategy.\nIn a review exploring the economic impact of decarbonising, the Treasury said: \"There will be demands on public spending, but the biggest impact comes from the erosion of tax revenues from fossil fuel-related activity.\"\nIt said future governments \"may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue\" rather than relying on higher borrowing.\nMinisters are keen to stress their intention that the so-called net zero transition will be led by business.\nThey say it will create 440,000 jobs and draw in up to 90bn of private investment by 2030.\nThe government says since the Prime Minister announced his 10-point plan for the climate a year ago, it has invested \u00a326bn of public funds into the low-carbon revolution.\nPart of that portfolio will be an extra \u00a3500m fund for low carbon innovation.\nEnvironmentalists will be scrutinising the numbers to see if various recent policy announcements will add up to the policy portfolio needed to present a plausible plan for decarbonising the economy by 2050.\nSo what's missing from the strategy? Well, there's no reference to eating less meat - which the government's advisers say is needed. And the aviation strategy - putting no constraint on flying - runs counter to advisers' opinions. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."
