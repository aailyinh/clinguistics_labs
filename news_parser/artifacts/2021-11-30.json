      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales' health minister has accused the English NHS of operating a \"free-for-all\" for boosters by operating walk-in centres.\nEluned Morgan has defended Wales' performance on booster jabs, amid criticism from the Conservatives.\nThe Tories said \"numerous\" health boards had not contacted people who are eligible.\nBut Ms Morgan said the Welsh NHS is working through the categories of people entitled to another jab.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said walk-in centres should be opened in Wales as a matter of urgency.\nThose entitled to a booster are people who had a second dose six months ago and are aged 50 and over, care home staff and residents, and frontline health and social care workers,.\nA total of 446,128 booster doses have been given in Wales.\nTory health spokesman Russell George told the Senedd that he would like to see walk-in centres for boosters adopted \"with urgency\".\n\"The guidance in Wales says that you will be contacted by the health board when you are eligible for a booster vaccine, but evidence is showing from different parts of Wales that that is not the case and health boards - not just one, but numerous health boards - are not yet contacting people who are eligible in that regard.\"\nIn response, Ms Morgan said people over 50 are in categories \"of one to nine\", which were being worked through \"in a very systematic way so that, obviously, care home residents have been some of the first to have been offered\".\n\"I'm pleased to say that about 68 per cent of care home residents have already had their booster jabs, as have about 54 per cent of care home workers and NHS workers.\"\n\"We're not going to be opening it up to a free-for-all in the way that they have in England. We'll be more systematic than that,\" she adding the NHS was following \"the kind of advice that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation gave in the first round\"."

      "tags": "Jeffrey Epstein death,New York City,Ghislaine Maxwell,Jeffrey Epstein,Sex trafficking,United States",
      "text": "British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell preyed on and groomed young girls for convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein to abuse, prosecutors have alleged.\nMs Maxwell appeared in court in New York on Monday for the first day of her trial on sex trafficking charges.\nShe denies the charges and her defence claims she is being used as a scapegoat for Epstein's crimes, following his death in prison in 2019.\nBut prosecutors argue the pair were \"partners in crime\" in sex abuse.\nMs Maxwell has been in a US jail since her arrest last year, and faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted.\nProsecutors say Ms Maxwell, who also has American and French citizenship, recruited and groomed underage girls for her long-term companion Epstein to abuse.\n\"She preyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused,\" Assistant District Attorney Lara Pomerantz said in her opening statement.\nEpstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges in a federal case. His death was ruled to be a suicide.\nProsecutors argue Ms Maxwell was \"essential\" to Epstein's abuse, while the defence said Maxwell was only on trial because they cannot bring him to justice.\n\"The charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things that Jeffrey Epstein did, but she is not Jeffrey Epstein,\" her lawyer Bobbi Sternheim argued.\nMs Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sex trafficking and other crimes.\nThe allegations at trial cover the period 1994 to 2004. Prosecutors allege Ms Maxwell was a \"right-hand\" partner for Epstein, helping to groom vulnerable teenage girls as young as 14 for abuse at his luxurious residences.\nThey described her as \"the lady of the house\" who \"helped normalise abusive sexual conduct\".\nMs Maxwell's lawyers will argue her accusers might have faulty memories caused by time and contamination \"by outside information, constant media reports and other influences\". \nBy Pratiksha Ghildial, BBC News reporter in New York\nWearing a pale jumper and glasses, Ghislaine Maxwell sat alongside two of her attorneys listening and periodically taking notes during Monday's proceedings. The prosecutor Lara Pomerantz painted a picture of her as being key to Jeffrey Epstein's alleged \"pyramid scheme of abuse\" of young girls by normalising sexual behaviour under a veneer of respectability. \nSpeaking from behind a glass screen mounted on a podium inside the courtroom, Pomerantz specifically spoke about one accuser who she said was befriended by Maxwell and Epstein on the pretext of bright future opportunities. \nMaxwell's team in turn argued that she was being punished for Epstein's crimes and that this case was about \"memory, manipulation and money\".\nIn the coming days, four alleged victims are expected to testify. The prosecution also plans to get some of Jeffrey Epstein's staff to testify, along with presenting evidence from flight logs of his private plane and Fedex records of gifts sent to the alleged victims. \nAt least a couple of other accusers of Epstein - not connected to this trial - came to listen to the opening statements. One of them told me that she was feeling \"many emotions\" and came to show solidarity to the alleged victims.\nIt's not yet clear if Ghislaine Maxwell will take the stand to testify. \nFour charges relate to the years 1994-97 when Ms Maxwell was, according to an indictment, among Epstein's closest associates and also in an \"intimate relationship\" with him. \nTwo other charges - of sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor - came in an amended indictment and relate to the period 2001 and 2004.\nSarah Ransome, one of Epstein's alleged victims, told the BBC's Panorama programme that Ms Maxwell worked closely with him.\nShe said: \"Ghislaine controlled the girls. She was like the madam. She was like the nuts and bolts of the sex trafficking operation.\"\nBorn outside Paris on Christmas Day, 1961, Ms Maxwell grew up in a country mansion, went to Oxford University and speaks several languages.\nShe is the youngest child of late media mogul Robert Maxwell.\nShe is said to have had a very close relationship with her late father, and he named his luxury yacht - the Lady Ghislaine - after her.\nSoon after her father's death in 1991, Ms Maxwell left the UK to settle in America, where she worked in real estate, and not long after met Jeffrey Epstein.\nShe sold her Manhattan townhouse in 2016, and kept a low profile until she was arrested last July at her secluded mansion in the state of New Hampshire."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nFace coverings are once again mandatory on public transport and in shops in England, as ministers try to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. With 11 cases detected across the UK and that number expected to rise, the face mask ruling brings England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. People arriving in the UK from abroad will now also have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.\nUpdated guidance is urging secondary school pupils in Wales to wear face masks in classrooms, with the Welsh government saying changes \"should come into effect in all settings as soon as possible\". The move goes further than advice given in England to wear face masks in communal areas. Secondary pupils are already advised to wear masks indoors in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nWith restaurants and bars preparing for their main money-making period of the year, the hospitality trade is concerned fears over the spread of the Omicron variant will hit business. As we discover, some businesses are already reporting cancellations.\nShopkeepers in England worry the new mask rules could have a serious impact on business, at a time when violence and verbal abuse against staff is at an all-time high. \"People are a bit frustrated,\" says Katie Pitts, co-owner of Leeds-based fashion boutique The Dressing Room. \"We're a non-essential retailer, so if they don't feel like wearing a mask, they might not come in.\"\nPeople in Northern Ireland have spent more than \u00a3100m using the High Street Spend Local cards, according to Department for the Economy figures. The deadline for using them was pushed back to 14 December, with organisers saying the scheme had given much-needed stimulus to the retail and hospitality sectors. Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann says a series of vaccination hubs will open this week to help meet demand for booster jabs.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nHere's how you can stop your glasses steaming up when you're wearing a mask.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nx\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Met Office,Thornhill,Lockerbie,Braemar,Kincardine O\u2019Neil,Storm Arwen,Severe weather",
      "text": "Thousands of people in Scotland still have no power in their homes after Storm Arwen caused \"catastrophic\" damage to the electricity network.\nResidents in parts of the rural north-east of Scotland, Perthshire, Angus and southern and central Scotland are still awaiting reconnection. \nSome have told BBC Scotland they are struggling to get reliable updates from their energy providers. \nOne man in his 80s said he and his wife felt \"completely abandoned\". \nEnergy provider SSEN said that as of 21:00 on Tuesday, power had been returned to more than 118,000 customers, but 9,500 remained without, with Aberdeenshire remaining the worst affected.\nScottish Power Energy Networks - which covers the southern part of the country - said it expected 1,000 properties to be without power overnight in the Borders after reconnecting about 1,000 Borders homes on Tuesday, along with 300 in Dumfries and Galloway.\nThe energy firms have apologised to those affected.\nFurther bad news came as the Met Office advised there was a risk of potential for wet, cold and windy conditions over the next 24 hours, including northerly winds of up to 60mph.\nIt said damage could occur where trees and property had been destabilised by the winds during Storm Arwen.\nSepa has also warned of the potential for high tides and overtopping on the east coast at high tide - around midday on Wednesday. The flood barriers in Eyemouth will be deployed as a result.\nNicola Sturgeon tweeted on Tuesday afternoon saying those facing the \"almost intolerable\" situation would receive help as soon as possible.\nKirsten Bax, who lives near Thornhill in Dumfries and Galloway, said it was the worst incident she could remember.\n\"We live in the country, we quite often get power cuts over the winter and it is usually one night or two nights,\" she said.\n\"This is now the fourth night and it is the worst I have ever had and I have been living here for 30 years, it is ridiculous.\n\"You can't get in touch with Scottish Power, or SP Energy Networks - on the fault line you get an answering machine or something.\n\"You can't speak to a person to actually say what is going on on the ground.\"\nLena Rose, 70, from Sauchen in Aberdeenshire, said: \"We've been here 40 years, it's never been as bad as this. Now it's six nights coming up.\n\"We've got the coal fire and camping stove, so we can boil water and keep ourselves warm. We're just living in the living room, you can't have a shower. It's frustrating.\"\nBrian Allanson, who lives near Lockerbie, said he was originally told power would return at 16:00 on Saturday but it has been repeatedly put back. \n\"You can't speak to a human being, the broadband's down here, we can't get any information, we are absolutely isolated,\" he said. \n\"My wife and I - we are both in our mid 80s - we feel as though we have just been completely abandoned.\"\nIn Aberdeenshire, all 170 schools remained closed on Tuesday as safety was assessed.\nRest centres were open again in Banff, Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Stonehaven, Ellon, Inverurie, Westhill, Portlethen, Huntly and Turriff.\nJane Grieve, who lives in Kincardine O'Neil, told the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland her power went off just before 18:00 on Friday. \n\"We found an old phone in our garage and plugged it into the wall, managed two calls and then it dropped out. We could have been on Mars,\" she said. \n\"A lot of people lost their water as well. We were lucky at least we had water.\n\"We went to bed four times in freezing cold, wearing a hat, pairs of socks, large jumper.\n\"We occasionally get power cuts, I think this has been the longest in my life. This is on a new scale. Hundreds of trees have gone over. It's felt a wee bit like Armageddon.\"\nSSEN said it always endeavoured to give accurate times to customers so they could plan and prepare.\n\"Given the extreme nature of Storm Arwen and the extensive damage to the electricity it has been difficult for us to give these estimates with real clarity and we'd like to apologise to customers who have seen their times pushed out,\" the firm said.\n\"As we work to restore the remaining homes without power, we now have a clearer picture of what we need to deal with and the restoration times provided now are as accurate as they can be.\"\nIt said Friday's storm had caused \"catastrophic damage\", three times greater than that caused by the Beast from the East in 2018\nSP Energy Networks said its staff were working \"tirelessly\" to reconnect power quickly and safely. \n\"We apologise to all of our customers who have continued to have been affected by the damage caused by Storm Arwen, we understand the stress and inconvenience this has caused many households and we appreciate everyone's patience whilst we continue to try to resolve the ongoing issues on the power network,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\"Storm Arwen has caused some of the worst damage we have experienced in over 15 years and far worse than the previous weather events. In many areas, the damage has been severe due to fallen trees and other wind-blown debris and engineers are also dealing road closures and access challenges making some of our repairs even harder.\n\"We are offering affected customers hot food and drinks and hotels for anyone who needs this and have fitted generators to customers most in need. We have also been visiting customers to support where individual needs are being identified. Please rest assured we are doing everything we can to reconnect those still off supply as quickly and as safely as we can.\"\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney updated the Scottish Parliament on the government's response to the storm.\nHe said: \"To give a sense of the scale of his event, Storm Arwen has been a more significant event than the Beast from the East in 2018, requiring a complexity of response that we have not seen for a number of years.\"\nHe added: \"My expectation is that most of the remaining customers' supply will be restored today.\n\"But I regret, for some of the more complex cases, supply is unlikely to be restored until later in the week.\"\nMr Swinney added that a full review of the preparations made for the storm would be undertaken in a bid to learn any lessons from the way it was handled.\nHave you been experiencing a power cut since Storm Arwen?

They are accompanied by a significant investment programme to upgrade branches to better suit customer needs. And, where it takes longer to get to the nearest branch, we will introduce more 'pop-up' services in communities.\"\nThese pop-up services, based in town halls, libraries and community centres in 10 areas, will allow customers to conduct basic banking, as well as receive digital support.\nThe government has published plans to ensure consumers and businesses have a legal right to withdraw and deposit cash within \"a reasonable distance\" of their home or premises.\nTSB recently faced a public outcry over plans to shut a museum at the site of the world's first savings bank.\nThe small cottage museum is on the site where Rev Henry Duncan set up his \"penny bank\" for parishioners in 1810.\nA deal has since been struck to transfer the site to another company in order to keep it open."

      "text": "Supermarket giant Asda said it has chartered its own cargo ship to ensure shelves are fully stocked with key festive products this year. \nIt said the move would prevent a shortage of toys, clothing and gifts during the busy Christmas period.\nAsda blamed supply chain problems that have hit other retailers and made it harder to source goods from abroad.\nJohn Lewis in the UK and Costco and Walmart in the US have all chartered ships to protect their stock.\nIt comes as Asda reported that like-for-like sales fell by 0.7% in the three months to 30 September compared with the same period last year. \n\"This is the first time Asda has chartered its own ship and we have done so to navigate the industry-wide supply chain challenges and to make sure there is enough stock on the shelves for customers this Christmas,\" a spokesman told the BBC. \nHe said the ship has 350 containers carrying a range of products including festive decorations, party and celebration supplies, toys, gifts and clothing.\nThe boat set sail from China and will arrive in the UK in early December. \nAsda has struggled with shortages of some foods this year due to the national driver shortage. But it said it was taking measures to protect its Christmas food ranges, including stocking more turkeys and pigs in blankets in store compared to last year. \nIt is also keeping extra stock in depots such as mince pies, confectionary, Christmas cakes and puddings, and has recruited 15,000 temporary staff to work during the busy Christmas period.\nIn September, John Lewis said it was chartering a fleet of extra ships, along with a number of other businesses, to make sure it has Christmas stock on time. \nBoss Sharon White blamed a shortage of shipping containers which had made it tough - and expensive - to get a space on cargo ships travelling from various parts of the world.\nAsda - which was recently bought by the billionaire Issa brothers - said the fall in quarterly sales reflected unusually high demand in the same period last year when people were eating more meals at home due to Covid curbs. \nHowever, its rivals Tesco and Sainsbury's have both reported higher sales in the third quarter. \nAsda said customer habits that emerged in the pandemic had remained, with demand for its online delivery service still 80% higher than pre-pandemic levels. \nIt added that the lockdown trend of customers treating themselves to premium own-label products had also continued.

the issue is Covid-related absences.\"\nShe said a shortage of substitute teachers made the situation \"incredibly challenging\" but she did not agree that substitute teachers were not willing to go into the school because of Covid fears.\n\"Principals have worked hard to ensure that schools are adhering to the Covid mitigations set down by the department,\" she said.\n\"I would say that schools are incredibly safe for young people.\"\nMs Montgomery opposes extended school closures.\n\"From my experience, Covid has had a significant and yet largely untold impact on young people,\" she said.\n\"There's huge amounts of increased anxiety, there's certainly a deficit in social skills.\"\nLimavady High principal Darren Mornin told Evening Extra the situation in schools was \"very difficult at the moment\".\n\"School leaders and leadership teams are working tirelessly to try and maintain safe staffing levels in school and retain face-to-face teaching,\" he said.\n\"It's important to say that all we want to do is to keep our children in school. \n\"That's the safest place for them to be and the best place for them to be because they've missed so much over the last 24 months.\"\nGerry Cushnahan, who is semi-retired and works as a substitute teacher, told the programme he knew a school principal who rang 120 substitute teachers to arrange cover about two weeks ago but no-one was available.\n\"I've been flat out since 2 September,\" he said.\n\"The impact that coronavirus has had, has been horrendous on schools.\"\nThe Department of Education said there were currently \"no plans\" to close schools early ahead of Christmas, and a decision to do so would have to be made by the executive. \nIt also said there were \"currently no plans to return to remote learning across all schools\".\n\"The department is aware of the ongoing difficulties faced by some schools in securing appropriate cover as a result of staff absence, and acknowledges that individual schools may need to consider a short period of remote learning for a class or classes, in response to local circumstances,\" the department added.\nSchools have switched to remote learning several times since the pandemic began, in a bid to help curb Covid-19 infections. \nAll students returned to school in April this year, as Northern Ireland emerged from its post-Christmas lockdown. \nSchools were also shut for five months from the first lockdown in March 2020, and for an extended half-term holiday.\nSeveral schools also voluntarily moved to remote learning in the lead-up to Christmas. \nMr McCamphill also called on the Department of Education to issue a ban on non-masked gatherings in schools.\nHe said it would be \"perfectly understandable\" if parents chose to withdraw their children from class a few days before the festive period and that \"many schools\" were already closing from 17 December, with four days of term still to go.\n\"It's not even about enjoying Christmas Day, it's about controlling the spread of the infection because people will take children to meet grandparents, households will be together and there has to be a whole executive response.\"\nNorthern Ireland recorded a further four coronavirus-linked deaths and 1,464 new cases on Monday."

the issue is Covid-related absences.\"\nShe said a shortage of substitute teachers made the situation \"incredibly challenging\" but she did not agree that substitute teachers were not willing to go into the school because of Covid fears.\n\"Principals have worked hard to ensure that schools are adhering to the Covid mitigations set down by the department,\" she said.\n\"I would say that schools are incredibly safe for young people.\"\nMs Montgomery opposes extended school closures.\n\"From my experience, Covid has had a significant and yet largely untold impact on young people,\" she said.\n\"There's huge amounts of increased anxiety, there's certainly a deficit in social skills.\"\nLimavady High principal Darren Mornin told Evening Extra the situation in schools was \"very difficult at the moment\".\n\"School leaders and leadership teams are working tirelessly to try and maintain safe staffing levels in school and retain face-to-face teaching,\" he said.\n\"It's important to say that all we want to do is to keep our children in school. \n\"That's the safest place for them to be and the best place for them to be because they've missed so much over the last 24 months.\"\nGerry Cushnahan, who is semi-retired and works as a substitute teacher, told the programme he knew a school principal who rang 120 substitute teachers to arrange cover about two weeks ago but no-one was available.\n\"I've been flat out since 2 September,\" he said.\n\"The impact that coronavirus has had, has been horrendous on schools.\"\nThe Department of Education said there were currently \"no plans\" to close schools early ahead of Christmas, and a decision to do so would have to be made by the executive. \nIt also said there were \"currently no plans to return to remote learning across all schools\".\n\"The department is aware of the ongoing difficulties faced by some schools in securing appropriate cover as a result of staff absence, and acknowledges that individual schools may need to consider a short period of remote learning for a class or classes, in response to local circumstances,\" the department added.\nSchools have switched to remote learning several times since the pandemic began, in a bid to help curb Covid-19 infections. \nAll students returned to school in April this year, as Northern Ireland emerged from its post-Christmas lockdown. \nSchools were also shut for five months from the first lockdown in March 2020, and for an extended half-term holiday.\nSeveral schools also voluntarily moved to remote learning in the lead-up to Christmas. \nMr McCamphill also called on the Department of Education to issue a ban on non-masked gatherings in schools.\nHe said it would be \"perfectly understandable\" if parents chose to withdraw their children from class a few days before the festive period and that \"many schools\" were already closing from 17 December, with four days of term still to go.\n\"It's not even about enjoying Christmas Day, it's about controlling the spread of the infection because people will take children to meet grandparents, households will be together and there has to be a whole executive response.\"\nNorthern Ireland recorded a further four coronavirus-linked deaths and 1,464 new cases on Monday."

      "text": "The Co-op has become the latest supermarket chain to say it will not enforce new mask wearing rules to avoid their staff being abused by customers.\nMask rules were brought back in on Tuesday after concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant.\nSupermarkets are taking a light touch approach with Tesco, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland not challenging customers.\nIndustry body The British Retail Consortium said it is up to police to enforce face mask rules, not retailers.\nCo-op policy director Paul Gerrard told Radio 5 Live that while Co-op would put up signs to remind people to wear masks, staff would not refuse to serve customers who were not wearing one.\n\"We have seen throughout the pandemic that the enforcement of social distancing rules has been a flashpoint for enormous levels of violence and abuse against my colleagues, and we will not put our colleagues at risk,\" he said.\nThere was a rise in violence towards shop workers before the pandemic, and that rise has continued, he said.\n\"It's not just the frequency, it's the violence and the seriousness of it,\" Mr Gerrard said. \"Every day, in the 2,600 Co-op shops, ten of my colleagues will be physically attacked.\"\n\"Five of them will be attacked with a weapon - it could be a syringe, it could be a knife, it could be a hammer - and that's not unusual to the Co-op.\"\nTesco will just be putting signs up to remind customers about face mask rules, the BBC understands.\nAldi and Lidl are also understood to have no plans for staff to challenge customers, although they will also be putting up posters.\nSainsbury's said it will have \"greeters and security guards at the front of our supermarkets\" to remind people to wear masks.\nMorrisons is expected to have staff checking face mask wearing at the front of the shops, and hand out masks to customers that have forgotten them.\nAsda has also said it will hand out masks to customers who have forgotten to bring them.\nIceland boss Richard Walker told the BBC's Radio Four Today programme on Tuesday that it supported the reintroduction of face masks, but said it would be unfair to ask staff to confront people not wearing masks.\n\"They are already working under significant pressure, especially as we hit the busiest trading month of the year.\"\n\"I won't be putting my staff at any risk of confrontation or abuse,\" he said.\nMr Walker said in the first lockdown from March to May last year, incidents of verbal abuse dropped from more than 50 incidents a week to five a week after staff were told not to challenge customers.\nFrom Tuesday, in England face coverings must now be worn in shops, shopping centres, in transport hubs and on public transport, according to government guidance.\nThere are different rules in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, but they are broadly similar.\nIn England, the Department for Transport said people should wear face coverings in \"crowded and enclosed areas where you come into contact with people you do not usually meet\".\nPeople who don't wear masks on public transport can get fined \u00a3200 and upwards, it tweeted.\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council says police forces will \"continue to enforce coronavirus regulations where it is necessary to do so\" and will support transport and retail staff in ensuring people wear face coverings.\nAssistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill says officers will respond to incidents where \"individuals are violent or abusive towards staff or members of the public\" and will be more visible in towns and shopping centres.\nThe BRC said in February this year that one retailer had reported that when reminding customers to shop alone, they were confronted and shouted at by an individual, who returned to the store later that afternoon \"brandishing an axe [and] \u2026 threatening the store team with it\". \nA shopworker at another retailer asked a couple to put on face coverings. They left the store, only to return hours later when they began \"coughing on staff, insisting they had coronavirus, which made the staff feel distressed.\"\nAnother said staff had been \"threatened with a syringe\u2026 [because a shoplifter] was stealing cheese and said if I didn't get out of the way he would stab me.\"\nIncidents of physical violence increased by two thirds at the time, the BRC said, with flashpoints mainly being around coronavirus rules."

      "tags": "Prince Andrew, Duke of York,Jeffrey Epstein death,New York City,Ghislaine Maxwell,Jeffrey Epstein,Sex trafficking,United States",
      "text": "Paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein's long-time pilot has testified at the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell that he flew VIPs to luxury locations worldwide. \nLarry Visoski, the first witness in Ms Maxwell's sex-trafficking trial, recalled flying Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Kevin Spacey. \nMs Maxwell denies the charges and says she is being used as a scapegoat for Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.\nBut prosecutors argue the pair were \"partners in crime\" in sex abuse.\nTestimony given in court on Tuesday included harrowing details of the alleged abuse. \nMs Maxwell has been in a US jail since her arrest last year, and faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted.\nProsecutors say the British socialite, who also has US and French citizenship, recruited and groomed underage girls for her long-term companion Epstein to abuse.\nAsked to describe Ms Maxwell's standing in Epstein's operations, Mr Visoski described her as \"the number two\". \n\"Epstein was the big number one,\" he told the New York court on Tuesday.  \nMr Visoski served as Epstein's pilot for over 25 years. During his testimony, prosecutors showed the jurors photographs of Epstein's properties. \nHe testified that he had never seen any sexual activity during trips, although the cockpit door was always kept closed during flights on the plane nicknamed the \"Lolita Express\".  \nHe also recalled flying Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who says she was sexually assaulted by Prince Andrew.\nThe Queen's 61-year-old second son has consistently denied the allegation.\nAsked if he remembered Ms Giuffre, Mr Visoski said: \"Yes. A shorter woman with dirty blonde hair. She didn't look young. I mean, whatever you decipher is the definition of young. But she was a woman in my category.\"\nAsked to describe Ms Maxwell's relationship to Epstein he said it was \"more personal than business\".\n\"I wouldn't characterise it as romantic,\" he added. \nAnother woman testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane\" told the court that Ms Maxwell had frequently been in the room with her when she had sexual relations with Epstein while just 14 years old. \nJane told the court she had met Epstein and Ms Maxwell while attending summer camp in Michigan 1994. He was introduced to her as a wealthy donor who offered scholarships to pupils. \nEpstein had promised to fund her education but instead abused her, prosecutors said. She testified that her father had died one year earlier from cancer and her family was struggling financially at the time. \nIn graphic detail, she described her alleged abuse and said that Ms Maxwell, who she said was present for much of it, was \"very casual\" about the encounters.\nJane said that Ms Maxwell would talk to her about sex, and that she soon began visiting Epstein's home every week or two. \nShe said her first sexual experience came when they were having a discussion about her future. \nShe said that Epstein led her from his office to his pool house, then pulled down his pants and started masturbating. \n\"I was frozen in fear, I had never seen a penis before,\" the witness said. \"I was terrified and felt gross and like I felt ashamed.\"\nIt was not long after that she had her first sexual experience with Ms Maxwell, she testified, saying it took place at Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida.\nJane said that the defendant and Epstein had her follow them to his bedroom. They took their clothes off and \"started sort of fondling each other and kind of casually giggling\", she said. \n\"I was just standing there and he asked me to take my top off and then their hands [were] everywhere and Jeffrey proceeded to masturbate and Ghislaine was rubbing him and kissing him and fondling,\" she continued.  \nShe added that she travelled with Epstein and Ms Maxwell about 10 times, mainly between his homes in New York and New Mexico while she was between the ages of 14 and 16. \nJane also described \"orgies\" with other participants, and described feeling pain during the alleged encounters. \nBoth Epstein and Ms Maxwell would brag about their connections, including the famous people that they knew, she said. \nJane is the first of four accusers expected to testify at trial. \nMs Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sex trafficking and other crimes.\nThe allegations at trial cover the period 1994 to 2004. Prosecutors allege Ms Maxwell was a \"right-hand\" partner for Epstein, helping to groom vulnerable teenage girls as young as 14 for abuse at his luxurious residences.\nThey described her as \"the lady of the house\" who \"helped normalise abusive sexual conduct\"."

      "tags": "Housing,Personal finance,Housing market",
      "text": "MPs have backed setting the cost of ground rents on new houses in England and Wales at \"one peppercorn\" a year.\nThe government-sponsored plan, if it becomes law, will effectively leave owners who buy only leases - rather than freeholds - paying nothing.\nThe move follows concerns that leaseholders are being charged exorbitant, fast-rising ground rents.\nBut Labour says ministers need to go further and completely ban the selling of houses without a freehold.\nThe Leasehold Reform Bill passed its first stage in the Commons unopposed on Monday.\nThe bill, which has already been passed by the House of Lords, will now undergo further scrutiny by MPs before it can become law.\nIt is relatively normal for someone buying part of a shared building - such as a flat in a converted house or purpose-built block - to own just a leasehold, lasting up to 999 years.\nSomeone else owns the freehold - the property as a whole and the land on which it is built. In this situation, the leaseholder pays ground rent to the freeholder.\nBut, according to research from 2018 by Propertymark, the association for letting and estate agents, the arrangement is increasingly being applied to people purchasing new-build houses. Many buyers claim they have been mis-sold a leasehold by a developer.\nIn 2018 the government consulted on capping ground rent on leasehold houses at \u00a310 a year, but the Leasehold Reform Bill stipulates setting the annual rate at \"one peppercorn\".\nHousing Minister Eddie Hughes told the House of Commons that the system had become \"a nightmare for some\" new-house buyers.\n\"Regardless of whether the ground rent is a nominal peppercorn or thousands of pounds, the fundamental issue is that no meaningful service is is provided in return,\" he added.\n\"We want to end this for new leases. That's why we're legislating, so that new residential long leases will have no financial demand for ground rent.\n\"Instead, nothing more than an actual peppercorn can be collected from the leaseholder.\"\nThe term \"peppercorn\", referring to non-existent or minuscule payments, is thought to date back to the 16th or 17th Century. \nWhile the spice itself was highly valuable in bulk, a single corn was considered to be of little worth.\nMr Hughes said that, while freeholders could \"physically\" demand this payment, they were unlikely to do so, and that this would ensure meals remained \"well-seasoned\".\nFor Labour, shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell said leases for both old and new houses should be banned.\nShe said the system was a \"scam on an industrial scale\", adding that the bill did \"nothing for those trapped\" in existing leaseholds.\nBut her party is supporting the legislation, while arguing it needs to go further.\nSomeone who owns a property outright, including the land it is built on, is a freeholder.\nWith a leasehold, the person owns a lease, which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes.\nWhen a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years - but sometimes up to 999 years. People may extend their lease or buy the freehold, but this can be complicated and expensive and involve legal fees.\nLeasehold house owners are also often charged expensive ground rent, as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell."

      "title": "Omicron: How worried should we be?",
      "tags": "Public health,South Africa,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "We're back in familiar territory - growing concern about a new variant of coronavirus.  \nIt has been named Omicron by the World Health Organization, following the pattern of Greek code-names like the Alpha and Delta variants.\nOmicron has such a long list of mutations that it was described by one scientist as \"horrific\", while another told me it was the worst variant they'd seen. \nIt has now been detected in more than 30 countries and there are signs it may be able to bypass some of our immunity. \nBut there are also claims that it could be milder than earlier versions of Covid, such as Delta.\nThere is a lot of speculation. Here's what we know. \nOmicron is the most heavily mutated version of coronavirus found so far. \nProf Tulio de Oliveira, the director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation in South Africa, said there was an \"unusual constellation of mutations\" and that it was \"very different\" to other variants that have circulated. \n\"This variant did surprise us, it has a big jump on evolution [and] many more mutations that we expected,\" he said.\nHe said there 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of most vaccines and the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. \nZooming in even further to the receptor binding domain (that's the part of the virus that makes first contact with our body's cells), it has 10 mutations compared to just two for the Delta variant that swept the world. \nIt is not certain where Omicron came from, but it is thought it evolved in a single patient who was unable to beat the virus.\nA lot of mutation doesn't automatically mean: bad. It is important to know what those mutations are actually doing.\nThe vaccines have all been based on the original form of the virus that was first detected in Wuhan, in China. The concern is Omicron is now so different to the original that vaccines may not be as effective. \nSome of the mutations have been seen before in other variants, which gives some insight into their likely role in this variant. \nFor example N501Y seems to make it easier for a coronavirus to spread. There are some in there that make it harder for antibodies to recognise the virus and might make vaccines less effective, but there are others that are completely new. \nThere have been many examples of variants that have seemed scary on paper, but came to nothing. The Beta variant was at the top of people's concerns at the beginning of the year because it was the best at escaping the immune system. But in the end it was the faster-spreading Delta that took over the world. \nScientists in South Africa have reported early evidence that Omicron can evade some of our immunity. \nThey have detected a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times, which had not been seen with previous variants. However, the scientists stressed they did not know what this meant for vaccines. \nLaboratory experiments are underway to see how effective the antibodies in people's blood are at stopping the new variant. \nProf Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, said: \"Beta was all immune escape and nothing else, Delta had infectivity and modest immune escape, this potentially has both to high degrees.\"\nThe Omicron variant is being blamed for a surge in cases in South Africa. In mid-November there were around 250 cases recorded every day. This has now topped 8,000 daily cases in a country that has already seen large waves of other variants. \nExperts have warned the same could happen around the world, including in the UK. \n\"The early signs are it will probably spread quite quickly and probably start outcompeting Delta, and become the dominant variant probably within the next weeks,\" said Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia.\nThe jury is still out on the severity of an Omicron infection. \nAnecdotal accounts from South Africa have argued symptoms tend to be mild and data on just 40 patients in one hospital hinted that fewer were becoming severely ill. However, it will take weeks to know for sure as there is a long delay between catching the virus and becoming seriously ill. South Africa also has a relatively young population and younger people tend to have milder Covid.\nAnd any difference in severity could have more to do with the amount of immunity in the country than anything the virus is inherently doing differently. \nSo, for now, we are left with a variant that raises significant concerns despite huge holes in our knowledge. It is one that needs to be watched closely and asks deep questions about what to do and when. The lesson of the pandemic is you can't always wait until you have all the answers. \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nFront-line NHS workers (with some exceptions) in England must be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job. However, ministers are meeting to decide whether or not to scrap the requirement. Around 77,000 NHS staff are unvaccinated and some argue that going ahead with mandatory vaccinations would lead to a staffing crisis.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "title": "Dutch Covid: Couple win freedom from Omicron quarantine in TB ward",
      "tags": "Self-isolation,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A couple who were moved into forced isolation in a Dutch hospital after they walked out of a Covid-19 hotel have been told they can now leave.\nCarolina Pimenta tested positive for Covid-19 after landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on a flight from South Africa on Friday. \nShe was arrested by military police on Sunday night on a plane about to take off for Spain. The couple have now been told prosecutors have decided not to pursue the case.\nMs Pimenta and her partner Andr\u00e9s Sanz were among 624 passengers who arrived in Amsterdam from South Africa hours after a Dutch ban on flights came into force linked to the discovery of the Omicron variant. Sixty-one of those travellers tested positive for Covid-19, and further sequencing has found at least 14 of them are carrying the new strain.\nIt has since emerged that the new variant was present in the Netherlands even earlier than thought, in samples taken on 19 and 23 November.\nCarolina, a Portuguese bio-chemical researcher who turns 28 in a few days, was among the 61 who tested positive, while her Spanish partner was negative. She had already had a negative PCR test before the flight.\nThey wanted to stay together so both were transferred into quarantine at the Ramada Hotel, a 10-minute drive from the terminal. But Carolina was convinced she had returned a false-positive so she asked local health authority staff for another test. \nShe told the BBC that staff from the local health authority, on duty in a room near the hotel reception, had suggested her partner borrow a bike and cycle to the supermarket to buy a lateral flow antigen test. As a close contact of a person who recently tested positive he was supposed to be isolating too.\nThe couple allege they showed the negative results to Dutch police and local health team on site, insisting they were told, \"If I were you I would go.\" They then caught a taxi back to the airport and used negative PCR tests they took before boarding their flight from South Africa to get on a plane to Spain.  \nNorth Holland police spokesman Willem Gijtenbeek told the BBC that until that specific point they had had no jurisdiction to hold or detain anyone for breaking quarantine. \"However, when the couple left the hotel, the head of Kennermerland security area took legal measures because of the threat to public health and ordered their mandatory isolation,\" he explained.\nThe local Kennemerland health authority denied the couple had been given permission to leave the hotel. The problem, a spokesperson said, was that quarantine was voluntary but the couple still had a responsibility to remain in isolation. \nAfter the couple left the hotel, the local mayor of Haarlemmermeer, Marianne Schuurmans, arranged for the couple to be held under an emergency order, and that changed the status of their quarantine to enforced.\nMilitary police promptly boarded the plane and arrested Carolina.\n\"It's shameful as a Dutch person to see how they have been treated,\" Bart Maes, the couple's lawyer, told the BBC. \nThe Netherlands imposed an extended partial lockdown at the weekend and is one of several European countries struggling to contain record numbers of coronavirus infections. Faced with a shortage of intensive care beds, the government has imposed a 17:00 closure of bars, restaurants and most shops.\nBut Mr Maes, who has also campaigned against the Dutch Corona vaccine passport, believes everyone involved in the couple's case should be ashamed. \"It's bureaucracy all over, no-one knows what anyone else is doing, everyone is blaming everyone else.\"\nMr Sanz has not tested positive. Other than the positive test on arrival, Carolina Pimenta has taken two PCR tests and two antigen tests, all of which returned negative. \nThe couple were moved to a tuberculosis hospital in the northern town of Haren, where they were told they had to remain in quarantine until five days after Carolina's positive PCR test at Schiphol on Friday.\n\"We went on a dream holiday in Africa and now we are living a nightmare. We are watching the world say we are criminals with a story that is just a lie,\" she complained.\nTheir lawyer told the BBC on Tuesday evening that the hospital had told him they were were being released. The case had been handed to the public prosecutor, who had decided not to seek an extension to their isolation, he explained.\n\"We're free!\" Carolina Pimenta said in a message to the BBC.\nThey would now travel to the Spanish consulate ahead of being flown on to Spain, her lawyer told the BBC.\nTo him it's absurd that, for someone suspected of being a super-spreader, the researcher is left to mix in a room with hundreds of passengers and then moved all over the country, meeting consular staff and lawyers.\n\"If they had Omicron then we really would be in trouble.\""

      "text": "The UK \"will throw everything\" at the expanded booster jab rollout in the wake of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, Boris Johnson has said.\nBut the PM insisted there was no need to change the overall guidance on \"how people should be living their lives\".\nEarlier Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, said people should not socialise \"when we don't particularly need to\".\nMeanwhile masks must now be worn in shops and public transport in England.\nA total of 22 cases of the new coronavirus variant have so far been confirmed in the UK. Thirteen are in England - in the East Midlands, the east of England, London and the North West.\nNine cases are in Scotland and all appear to have come from a single event on 20 November, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new variant, and reported it to the World Health Organization on 24 November.\nSpeaking outside a vaccine centre in north London earlier today, Mr Johnson said it is \"overwhelmingly likely\" booster jabs can give a \"lot of protection against all types of the virus\", adding it is crucial for everybody to get the additional dose when eligible.\nHe added: \"We've no doubt at all that the NHS, all the volunteers, the Army, everybody can rise to the challenge. Is it going to be hard work? Yes it is, but I know people can do it.\"\nBooster jabs are to be offered to all over-18s in the UK and children aged 12 to 15 will be invited for a second jab, as part of a major expansion of the vaccine programme.\nAt a No 10 press conference the prime minister announced that the aim is to offer all adults in England over 18 a booster jab by the end of January 2022, with people becoming eligible for a booster at least three months after their second dose. \nThat means 14 million more adults have now become eligible for a booster in England alone, Mr Johnson said.\nJabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacy sites and extra hospital hubs in England and some 400 military personnel will work with the \"jabs army of volunteers\", he announced.\nPeople arriving in the UK from abroad will also now have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.\nEarlier Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency - the body which replaced Public Health England - suggested people should reduce social contacts in the run up to Christmas.\nWhen asked about her comments, the prime minister said she was right and people should continue to take \"normal precautions\", but said a change in the guidance wasn't necessary\n\"We don't see anything to suggest that we need to go, for instance, to Plan B,\" he said, referring to tougher curbs in England.\nHowever, Mr Johnson added taking \"particular precautions\" against Omicron were needed until experts know \"exactly what kind of a threat it may present\".\nSome Conservative backbench MPs questioned Dr Harries' advice during a debate on face masks in the House of Commons, with some asking on whose authority she was speaking given her suggestion was not government policy.\nMeanwhile, Wales' health minister Eluned Morgan said people should take the \"threat\" of socialising indoors with others at Christmas seriously.\nThe new rules on face coverings bring England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where they are already mandatory on public transport and for many indoor areas. \nNewly-published guidance says they should be worn in locations including shops, shopping centres, posts offices, banks, hairdressers and food takeaways, as well as on public transport.\nAlthough the change does not require people in England to wear coverings in pubs and restaurants, they are required in hospitality venues elsewhere in the UK in some circumstances.\nPolice in England say they will work \"in partnership with relevant business owners and their staff\" to ensure people comply with the new face coverings rules.\nAs a last resort people can be fined \u00a3200, reduced to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days.\nAnother change, which has already come into effect, requires all contacts of suspected Omicron cases to self-isolate for 10 days, even if they are fully vaccinated."

In doing so he sends a message of unity and avoids looking like the partner that has been cast aside. But however you look at this, it is a break-up - a constitutional uncoupling.\nRepublicanism has been rumbling for some time in Barbados. Prime Minister Mia Mottley described it as a chance for the island to assert itself and show greater self-confidence. \"It was time,\" she said, \"to fully leave our colonial past behind.\"\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the BBC she said dismantling aspects of a colonial legacy were not \"antagonistic or adversarial\". She spoke of her respect for the Queen but said the time had come for a new kind of relationship with the UK where the two countries would remain close partners.\nShe also stressed her personal friendship with Prince Charles. The two recently met at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and she said she was happy he had accepted the invitation to attend the handover ceremony.\n\"We believe in him and have tremendous respect for him,\" she told the BBC. \"He is a man, as far as I'm concerned, who is ahead of his time.\"\nPrince Charles will return the compliment in a speech he makes at the handover ceremony on Monday evening. He will focus on reaffirming friendships and sharing common goals and values. \nIt is hard to imagine though that he won't feel a degree of sadness as he watches the Queen's standard lowered and that final salute. \nBeing head of state here is a largely symbolic role but symbols matter. Framed portraits of Queen Elizabeth hang in government buildings. Barbados has a Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The police, postal workers and prison officers all wear a badge on their uniform with a crown insignia.\nMuch of that will now change.\nLater on Monday, more than 400 years after an English ship arrived here and claimed the island for King James I, Queen Elizabeth II will be removed as head of state.\nDame Sandra Mason will be sworn in as president as Barbados strives to move further away from its colonial past."

      "text": "Paedophile former football coach Barry Bennell has denied abusing a number of men who have made damages claims against Manchester City.\nEight men, who are now in their 40s and 50s, are suing the Premier League club, asserting Bennell was one of their scouts when he abused them.\nBennell, who is in jail after being convicted of child sex offences, told a High Court trial he was not linked to City when the men say they were abused.\nCity denies the men's claims.\nBennell, who gave evidence via video-link from a prison near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, told the court he was a \"local scout\" for City between 1975 and 1979. \nBut he said he was not a City \"coach\" between 1979 and 1985, when the men say they were abused.\nBennell, who was the first witness called by lawyers representing the current Premier League champions, also said his junior teams had no connection with City.\n\"The reality is that I was never a MCFC [Manchester City] coach and after 1978/1979 my junior teams had no connection at all with MCFC,\" he said.\nBennell said he had used his \"previous connection\" with City as \"a draw for players to join my junior teams\".\n\"None of the teams they played for that I ran were in any way connected with MCFC,\" he also told the judge in a written witness statement.\n\"However, I can entirely understand why some of the claimants may have genuinely believed they were playing for teams connected with MCFC because I was responsible for creating that belief.\"\nBennell told the court he set up a local junior team called Senrab, later named Whitehill Juniors, which played in the Manchester junior football league.\nThe team soon attracted the attention of scouts from various professional clubs including Ken Barnes, the City chief scout at the time, he added. \nBennell said Mr Barnes \"approached me and asked me to become a local scout for MCFC with a view to recommending any players l thought were good enough to him for trials at MCFC\".\nHe told the court between about 1975 and 1978/1979, he was provided with a scout pass by MCFC.\n\"I used to show these passes to the teachers or parents of players to try to persuade them to let the player join my teams as they would naturally assume that they would have a better opportunity of getting a trial at MCFC if they were playing for a team run by one of its local scouts,\" he said.\nBennell said that after about four years he started to feel that he was \"not getting the recognition that I believed I deserved\" from City.\n\"I actually asked Ken Barnes for a full-time job at MCFC at one point, but I was told that I would have to wait at least two years before I would even be considered,\" he said.\n\"I therefore decided to stop acting as a local scout for MCFC at around this time.\"\nIn a written statement, Bennell said he was convicted at Chester Crown Court in 1998 and 2015, and at Liverpool Crown Court in 2018, of various sexual offences against \"numerous boys\".\nHe said several of those convictions related to the six of the eight men making claims against City.\nBut when questioned by barrister James Counsell QC, who is leading the eight men's legal team, he denied abusing four of the men.\nBennell maintained that, in the period from 1981 to 1984 when he returned to football coaching, he was not linked to City in any way.\nHe claimed he had borrowed kit from the club and would give it to boys in his teams to wear for their team photographs.\nBennell also said the boys and their parents only believed he was linked to City because he had falsely told them he was.\nMr Counsell also referred Bennell to an article about a player in a match programme from 1983, in which he was described as \"City scout Barry Bennell\".\nHe claimed he had recommended the player to the club's scouts at that time, but was not involved further.\nMr Counsell said: \"That is what you were being referred to in 1983 by Manchester City,\" to which Bennell replied: \"Well I recommended him, so what else can they call me, I suppose?\"\nBennell is currently serving a 34-year sentence after being convicted of sexual offences against boys on five separate occasions - four in the UK and one in the US.\nThe eight men say the 67-year-old abused them when they were playing schoolboy football for teams he coached in the north-west of England between 1979 and 1985.\nThey claim that Bennell, who became a coach at Crewe in 1985, was a scout for City during that time and argue the relationship was \"one of employment or one akin to employment\".\nBut the club said he had been a local City scout in the mid-1970s but was not employed by them between 1979 and 1985.\nThe eight men are claiming damages after suffering psychiatric injuries, while six are also claiming damages for loss of potential football earnings.\nThe trial continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan has said NI's Covid-19 certification scheme is \"divisive\", has been rushed and should not go ahead.\nThe scheme, which came into effect today, requires people to show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter some venues and events.\nHowever, there is a two-week grace period before fines are imposed on venues that fail to comply.\nThe majority of Stormont ministers agreed to the plan on 17 November.\nHowever, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ministers voted against it. \nMr Givan called for the other parties to explain why they voted in favour of the \"shambolic\" plan. \n\"They need to explain why they voted for something where there wasn't an equality impact assessment, legal opinion there in terms of humans rights implications or economic impact assessments available to other ministers when they voted,\" he told the BBC's Evening Extra programme.\nThe first minister said a reduction in hospital admissions had been achieved in the past week without the Covid passport.\nAccording to the Department of Health's Covid-19 dashboard there are 340 people in hospital today with coronavirus. Last Monday there were 378 Covid-19 inpatients. \nMr Givan said that similar measures in the Republic of Ireland had not worked and again called for the acceleration of the booster scheme rollout which he described as \"the single most effective measure we can take\".\nBusinesses have said there is a lack of clarity around the scheme and how they should enforce it.\nOn Friday, Health Minister Robin Swann said unlicensed premises like cafes would be exempt from the rule at this stage.\nThe Department of Health tweeted on Monday that the regulations had commenced, although they are due to be debated at a later date in the assembly.\nPublished on Monday afternoon, the regulations said businesses must have a system for checking people \"as soon as is reasonably practicable\" when they enter premises.\nFrom 29 November, either proof of vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or a positive PCR test for access to:\nThere will be no enforcement until 13 December to allow for the scheme to be \"bedded in\",  the Department of Health said in a statement last week (DoH).\nThe department said the phased approach followed feedback from the retail, hospitality, tourism and events sectors.\nIt said Covid certification can \"reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings\" as vaccinated people are \"less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people\".\n\"There is also evidence, from several studies worldwide, that even when people get infected, if they are vaccinated they are less likely to transmit it to others,\" it continued.\nCoffee shop owner Scott King said he believed it was \"inevitable\" that businesses like his would soon have to check Covid certification as well. \n\"It's only a matter of time before [Omicron] comes over here,\" Mr King told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"I can see more and more restrictions probably coming in place in the course of the next couple of weeks.\"\nMr King, who is based in Armagh, said Covid certification checks on entry could cost his business an extra \u00a3120 per day.\nMichael McAdam, of Movie House cinema chain, said members of the public will be asked for Covid certificates from Monday. \n\"If you're going to the cinema or going to the theatre tonight, you will be asked, and we're required by law to ask you, what your status is,\" he said. \n\"I think it's probably for the better.\"\nMr McAdam said if it drives up the number getting the Covid vaccination, \"it's probably for the better\".\nStephen Megarian, the managing director of a Belfast pub chain, said it felt \"unfair\" that licensed venues had been \"put in the front line\".\n\"It's just an added difficulty at a very difficult time,\" Mr Magorrian told Good Morning Ulster.\nHe said his business could not afford to face fines for not implementing Covid certification checks.\n\"We've used up our reserves we had in place already,\" he said.\n\"We can't afford to put our licence in jeopardy.\"\nMr Magorrian said his customers were confused about what was required of them, adding: \"We're going to have to be advising and telling them, if they turn up with the wrong stuff, what they need.\"\nDeclan Jordan, manager of a pub and restaurant in Londonderry, said he was frustrated with Stormont's messaging around the Covid vaccine passport. \n\"I'm very annoyed that they [the NI Executive] are just telling us that we have to start enforcing this today, not legally until another two weeks, but they can't tell us exactly what we have to do.\n\"We are trying to operate a business and we are trying to stay open, but we may need to take another employee in to just look after the Covid vaccine passport,\" Mr Jordan told BBC Radio Foyle. \n\"I am so angry, we just need to know what we have to do so we can put things in place.\""

      "text": "Face coverings have become mandatory again on public transport and shops in England in an effort to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.\nPeople arriving in the UK from abroad will now also have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.\nIt comes after 14 cases of the new variant were detected in the UK.\nBoris Johnson is expected to set out plans for the booster jab programme in England at a news conference later.\nOn Monday the government announced a major expansion of the booster jab rollout as part of efforts to help stop a potential wave of infections. They are to be offered to all over-18s in the UK, with children aged 12 to 15 invited for a second jab.\nMore local pharmacies could be used as part of the rollout and it is likely that there will be some prioritisation to ensure the vulnerable get their top-up shots first - as with the original scheme.\nThree more Omicron cases have been found in Scotland and Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said it is expected cases of the new variant will continue to rise.\nEarly evidence suggests Omicron - first found in southern Africa - has a higher re-infection risk. But scientists say it will take about three weeks before it is known how the variant impacts on the effectiveness of vaccines.\nMr Johnson said the new mask and testing measures would \"buy us time in the face of this new variant\".\nRichard Walker, managing director of the Iceland grocery chain, told the BBC his company supported compulsory mask wearing but he would not be asking staff to police those who refused to do so.\nCare Minister Gillian Keegan told BBC Breakfast that it was \"down to individuals\" to do the right thing, calling on the public to be \"sensible\", and said she understood Mr Walker's position.\nWhile it is still unclear the impact the new variant could have she said people should continue with their Christmas plans but be \"cautious\".\nPolice in England say they will work \"in partnership with relevant business owners and their staff\" to ensure people comply with the new face coverings rules.\nAssistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said officers would engage with people not wearing face coverings and encourage them to do so.\nAs a last resort people can be fined \u00a3200, reduced to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days.\nThe changes will be reviewed in three weeks' time and the health secretary told MPs they would be given a chance to vote on them.\nScientists are agreed accelerating the booster programme is key to combatting Omicron if the worst fears are realised.\nThat job though now lies in the hands of the NHS.\nAnd the challenge that it faces is that the infrastructure that was so successful in delivering the jabs in the first half of the year has been scaled back.\nThree-quarters of vaccinations were delivered by GP-led teams. But many of those GP and staff have now returned to their day jobs, focussing on the flu vaccine rollout and their patients.\nAround 50 mass vaccination centres have also been shut down.\nRestarting any of that will not be immediate so in the short-term the easiest solution is to extend the opening hours of the remaining big centres and providing more support to high street pharmacists who are also heavily involved.\nCurrently around 2.5m booster jabs are being given each week - at that rate it could take around three months to provide boosters to everyone.\nHalving that would give the UK the best possible chance of combatting any Omicron wave.\nMr Javid said if it emerged that the variant was \"no more dangerous than the Delta variant\" then measures would not be kept in place \"for a day longer than necessary\".\nThe new rules on face coverings bring England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where they are already mandatory on public transport and for many indoor areas. \nNewly-published guidance says they should be worn in locations including shops, shopping centres, posts offices, banks, hairdressers and food takeaways, as well as on public transport.\nAlthough the change does not require people in England to wear coverings in pubs and restaurants, they are required in hospitality venues elsewhere in the UK in some circumstances.\nLabour's shadow health minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan said the government should not have stopped asking the public in England to wear masks.\nAnother change, which has already come into effect, requires all contacts of suspected Omicron cases to self-isolate for 10 days, even if they are fully vaccinated.\nMeanwhile, the first ministers of Scotland and Wales have called for the PCR test requirement to be changed so that everyone arriving in the UK would have to isolate for eight days. \nThe latest cases of the Omicron variant in England were detected in the Camden and Wandsworth areas of London. Like the other three cases in England, they have been linked to travel in southern Africa.\nNine cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus have been identified in Scotland.\nThe average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. A further 42,583 cases were reported on Monday.\nDr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC it was hoped a booster vaccine dose might \"to some extent, counter the potential drop in vaccine effectiveness we might find with this variant\".\nShe said people could also do their bit by reducing social contacts.\nNHS England has said it will \"shortly\" set out how the booster vaccine programme will be expanded, including who will be prioritised and how capacity will be expanded.\nAn NHS spokesman said boosters would be given in priority order and urged people to come forward \"as quickly as possible\" when called.\nDr Farah Jameel, chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, told the BBC that GP practices needed to have their contractual targets paused so that they could \"refocus clinical priorities\" on supporting the rollout of jabs.\nThe University of Oxford, which developed a Covid vaccine alongside AstraZeneca, has said it can \"rapidly\" update its vaccine \"if it should be necessary\" to tackle the Omicron variant.\nEuropean stock markets have fallen after the boss of Moderna cast doubts on the effectiveness of vaccines against the new Omicron Covid variant."

She was struggling to make efforts [to breathe] at that point. \n\"I think she was fighting as hard as she could, but we needed to help her.\n\"I was watching her slip away and I couldn't do anything.\"\nMs Crook, who was at the concert with her daughter, told the hearing: \"I had hold of Saffie's hand quite a lot during that time and asked her to just squeeze it and to hold on tightly.\"\nShe said when she first saw Saffie, from Leyland in Lancashire, in the arena foyer, she did not want to move her for fear of causing further injuries to her badly injured legs. \nMs Crook said she expected medical help to arrive imminently.\n\"You don't think there won't be a paramedic, there won't be ambulances, there won't be medical equipment, I was waiting for what I'm used to,\" she added.\nMs Crook told the court she had no medical equipment.\n\"I literally had just my two bare hands,\" she said.\nSome medical experts have previously suggested Saffie's legs should have been splinted.\nBut Ms Crook told the inquiry she did not have the necessary equipment to do that and did not feel applying pressure to the girl's damaged legs was the right thing to do at the time. \n\"My medical opinion, my professional opinion, my opinion as a mother is that I needed to let that little girl be as pain free as possible and make sure she was as stable as possible,\" she said.\nThe inquiry also heard from Det Sgt Mark Haviland, from British Transport Police, who took the decision to move Saffie out of the foyer to get her urgent medical help. \nHe said he realised ambulance staff would not be coming into the bomb scene with a possible threat of further attacks.\nHe said a report of an \"active shooter\" had come across the radio. \nThe detective said he believed Saffie would have \"died on the floor\" of the foyer if they had not moved her. \nThe inquiry heard that Sgt Leon McLaughlin, from Greater Manchester Police, also helped to carry Saffie on the makeshift stretcher. \nHe said the girl was \"gravely injured\" and agreed they needed to get her out as soon as possible.\n\"I felt if we had waited then she would have died,\" he added.\nOnce outside, Det Sgt Haviland flagged down a passing ambulance. \nSgt McLaughlin told the inquiry how he had thought Saffie was likely to die as she laid on the pavement outside the concert venue.\n\"I was talking to her. Even though there was a lot of us there, it's a very lonely place to be,\" he said.\nThe inquiry also heard from North West Ambulance Service paramedic, Gillian Yates, who took Saffie to hospital.\nShe told the court Saffie asked if she was going to die, which were the only words she said to the medics.\nMs Yates said she decided to take Saffie straight to hospital rather than wait for a more senior clinician to reach them.\n\"It was obvious what was going to save Saffie was going to be getting her blood... surgery and being in hospital. So that was our priority,\" she said.\nThe inquiry, which will spend all this week considering Saffie's case, continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

I'm never going to get over it. It's just so wrong.\"\nA recent report by the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) showed that more than a quarter of patients in ambulances queuing at hospitals in the East of England had potentially experienced \"severe harm\" as a result. \nSharon McNally, director of nursing and midwifery at The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust, offered her condolences to Mr Drewett. \n\"We are extremely sorry to hear about the concerns that Mr Drewett has raised regarding the death of his wife and we are investigating the details,\" she said.\nThe EEAS spokesman added: \"At the time we received the call we were experiencing an extremely high demand for our services and had to divert two rapid response vehicles and two ambulances to immediately life-threatening emergencies before we were able to attend the scene.   \n\"The health and care system remains under significant pressure, both locally and nationally, and we are working with partner organisations across health and social care to reduce handover delays and the impact that they have on patients.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "NI Health,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan has said NI's Covid-19 certification scheme is \"divisive\", has been rushed and should not go ahead.\nThe scheme, which came into effect today, requires people to show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter some venues and events.\nHowever, there is a two-week grace period before fines are imposed on venues that fail to comply.\nThe majority of Stormont ministers agreed to the plan on 17 November.\nHowever, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ministers voted against it. \nMr Givan called for the other parties to explain why they voted in favour of the \"shambolic\" plan. \n\"They need to explain why they voted for something where there wasn't an equality impact assessment, legal opinion there in terms of humans rights implications or economic impact assessments available to other ministers when they voted,\" he told the BBC's Evening Extra programme.\nThe first minister said a reduction in hospital admissions had been achieved in the past week without the Covid passport.\nAccording to the Department of Health's Covid-19 dashboard there are 340 people in hospital today with coronavirus. Last Monday there were 378 Covid-19 inpatients. \nMr Givan said that similar measures in the Republic of Ireland had not worked and again called for the acceleration of the booster scheme rollout which he described as \"the single most effective measure we can take\".\nBusinesses have said there is a lack of clarity around the scheme and how they should enforce it.\nOn Friday, Health Minister Robin Swann said unlicensed premises like cafes would be exempt from the rule at this stage.\nThe Department of Health tweeted on Monday that the regulations had commenced, although they are due to be debated at a later date in the assembly.\nPublished on Monday afternoon, the regulations said businesses must have a system for checking people \"as soon as is reasonably practicable\" when they enter premises.\nFrom 29 November, either proof of vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or a positive PCR test for access to:\nThere will be no enforcement until 13 December to allow for the scheme to be \"bedded in\",  the Department of Health said in a statement last week (DoH).\nThe department said the phased approach followed feedback from the retail, hospitality, tourism and events sectors.\nIt said Covid certification can \"reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings\" as vaccinated people are \"less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people\".\n\"There is also evidence, from several studies worldwide, that even when people get infected, if they are vaccinated they are less likely to transmit it to others,\" it continued.\nCoffee shop owner Scott King said he believed it was \"inevitable\" that businesses like his would soon have to check Covid certification as well. \n\"It's only a matter of time before [Omicron] comes over here,\" Mr King told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"I can see more and more restrictions probably coming in place in the course of the next couple of weeks.\"\nMr King, who is based in Armagh, said Covid certification checks on entry could cost his business an extra \u00a3120 per day.\nMichael McAdam, of Movie House cinema chain, said members of the public will be asked for Covid certificates from Monday. \n\"If you're going to the cinema or going to the theatre tonight, you will be asked, and we're required by law to ask you, what your status is,\" he said. \n\"I think it's probably for the better.\"\nMr McAdam said if it drives up the number getting the Covid vaccination, \"it's probably for the better\".\nStephen Megarian, the managing director of a Belfast pub chain, said it felt \"unfair\" that licensed venues had been \"put in the front line\".\n\"It's just an added difficulty at a very difficult time,\" Mr Magorrian told Good Morning Ulster.\nHe said his business could not afford to face fines for not implementing Covid certification checks.\n\"We've used up our reserves we had in place already,\" he said.\n\"We can't afford to put our licence in jeopardy.\"\nMr Magorrian said his customers were confused about what was required of them, adding: \"We're going to have to be advising and telling them, if they turn up with the wrong stuff, what they need.\"\nDeclan Jordan, manager of a pub and restaurant in Londonderry, said he was frustrated with Stormont's messaging around the Covid vaccine passport. \n\"I'm very annoyed that they [the NI Executive] are just telling us that we have to start enforcing this today, not legally until another two weeks, but they can't tell us exactly what we have to do.\n\"We are trying to operate a business and we are trying to stay open, but we may need to take another employee in to just look after the Covid vaccine passport,\" Mr Jordan told BBC Radio Foyle. \n\"I am so angry, we just need to know what we have to do so we can put things in place.\""

      "tags": "NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,NHS Lanarkshire,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All nine cases of the Omicron variant of Covid in Scotland are linked to a single event, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nShe told MSPs that those affected had been tested on or around 23 November and had been self-isolating since then.\nShe said the cases all traced back to a \"single private event\" on 20 November.\nMs Sturgeon added: \"We fully expect that there will be more cases identified over the coming days that are also linked to this event.\"\nA total of 22 cases of the new variant have so far been confirmed in the UK.\nFive of the nine Scottish cases are in Lanarkshire and four are in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area.\nMs Sturgeon said the lack of any known travel or overseas connection to the cases suggested there was community transmission of the variant in Scotland.\n\"However, the fact that all known cases are so far linked to a single event suggests that this may still be limited,\" she said.\n\"Indeed, there is so far nothing in the wider look back exercise that Public Health Scotland has undertaken to suggest that community transmission of the new variant is either sustained or widespread.\"\nWhile any possible links with the COP26 climate summit were being investigated, the timing meant this was \"improbable\".\nNicola Sturgeon has promised to put in place the expanded booster programme recommended by the JCVI as soon as possible. \nWhat she has not said is exactly who will become eligible, when. We know that priority will be decided by age and risk but the details are still being worked out. \nThe first minister has made clear more staff and facilities will be needed, without explaining how this will be achieved. \nBy contrast, the NHS chief in England, Amanda Pritchard, has just announced a big recruitment plan for new vaccinators.\nBoris Johnson has also committed to offering booster jabs to all adults in England by the end of January 2022.\nIt may be the Scottish government will match that, but opposition parties are concerned about what they consider to be a lack of urgency.\nScotland is currently the most vaccinated part of the UK and no-one at Holyrood would want the NHS here to fall behind the pace with booster jabs. \nThe first minister said it was \"highly likely - indeed almost certain\" that more Omicron cases would emerge.\n\"However, the enhanced surveillance gives us the best possible chance of identifying cases quickly and, through isolation of index cases and close contacts and targeted testing, of then breaking transmission chains and containing spread while we learn more about the variant.\n\"And this is key. While so much about this new variant is so far unknown, it is important that we act on a highly precautionary basis.\"\nMs Sturgeon said that, rather than introducing new restrictions, the Scottish government was asking people to \"significantly step up and increase compliance\" with existing protections.\nThese include the wearing of face coverings, hygiene, home working, ventilation, vaccination and regular testing.\nNew travel restrictions have been introduced across the UK, under which all overseas travellers must take a PCR test on, or before, the second day of their arrival.\nMs Sturgeon said the Scottish government was advising that this should take place on the second day.\nThe vaccination programme is being expanded, with boosters being offered to all over-18s and the wait after a second dose cut from six to three months.\nChildren aged 12 to 15 will also now be invited for a second jab and severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth dose of the vaccine.\nMs Sturgeon said one million additional Scots were now eligible for booster jabs and that information would be provided as soon as possible for those who had now become eligible.\nIn addition, 16 and 17-year-olds are now able to book an appointment for their second dose online.\nJust how far to go is a tough decision for policymakers as they wait for the evidence on Omicron to emerge.\nThe latest data shows that case numbers in Scotland are actually falling and hospital admissions are down, particularly in older age groups who are most likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid.\nOn one hand this is all early evidence that booster jabs are working well against the dominant Delta variant - but on the other, we face a new unknown. \nAdditional rules around travel, enhanced testing and a reminder to comply with current rules may be enough, but some health experts think we need to do more now because it is better to take preventative steps and try to control spread, rather than risk a significant new wave.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there had been \"a glaring lack of urgency\" from the Scottish government.\n\"When two million Scots are waiting for a Covid jag, it's difficult to understand why the government is not doing everything possible to boost the rollout by backing our call for mass vaccination centres to be reopened,\" he said. \nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar asked Ms Sturgeon whether Scotland would reintroduce vaccine drop-in centres.\nThe first minister said there was no lack of urgency, and that there were ongoing discussions about the most appropriate ways to accelerate the vaccination programme.\nShe added that there had been no shortage of staff to deliver the rollout which had initially been planned, but that more staff and facilities would now be needed to speed up the process following the JCVI's new advice.\nMs Sturgeon said that process was under way and that the government would work with health boards to ensure it happened as quickly as possible.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has promised that boosters will be offered to everyone in England who is eligible by the end of January.\nThe Scottish government's clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme that a target had not yet been set for Scotland.\nHe said things would be \"slightly different\" north of the border, but officials were still \"crunching the numbers\".\nProf Leitch said there were only limited drop-in facilities because they wanted to control the age bands.\n\"We don't want 18-and-a-half-year-olds to get their vaccine before 49-year-olds. We want to do it in an ordered way in chunks of age groups,\" he said.\n\"That is how we have done it up to this point and that is why we are the most vaccinated part of the UK.\""

      "text": "\"We had 20 cancellations over the weekend, mostly for Christmas parties. Customers were phoning to tell us they weren't sure what was going to happen in a few weeks so they'd rather cancel now.\"\nDamian Wawrzyniak, an award-winning chef, is one of many in the hospitality industry worried about the impact the Omicron variant of coronavirus is having on his business.\nThe sector has been allowed to operate free from restrictions since 19 July, but there are fears customer confidence in eating and drinking out has taken a hit as restaurants and bars prepare for their main money-making period of the year.\nThere are also concerns some measures could return after the government announced it was reintroducing mandatory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport.\n\"Hospitality has been waiting for Christmas, and if it's not what we were hoping for, there's going to be some casualties across the industry, including my places,\" said Mr Wawrzyniak, who runs House of Feasts in Peterborough.\n\"We won't be able to survive without that Christmas trade.\"\nHospitality has been one of the hardest hit industries by the coronavirus pandemic, with many pubs, hotels and eateries being closed during lockdowns.\nAs businesses have begun to recover and recoup lost earnings, a chronic shortage in workers surfaced, with job vacancies reaching the highest levels since records began.\nSam Morgan, who owns the restaurants Craft and 8, told the BBC that a corporate booking for a private dining experience cancelled on Monday after the announcement of the new Covid variant. \nHe said the business, which had booked a table for 12 people, told him it had changed its policy and would look to rebook in January.\nThe restaurants purchase fresh produce ahead of large bookings, but Mr Morgan said \"that food will now end up in the bin\" due to the slim chances of a replacement booking.\nHis venues usually received up to 150 enquiries a day, he added, but had only seen about 10 in the last 48 hours. \n\"People are just freezing and they are not doing anything and that's all to do with consumer confidence,\" said Mr Morgan.\nThe confidence dent to customers would affect hospitality more than other sectors, he added, as people may think: \"Do we really want go out? Do we really need to go? I probably should not book.\"\nHowever, Mr Morgan said he was \"encouraged\" that the government had not implemented restrictions on hospitality but said he would be \"naive\" to believe they may not return.\nHe said his businesses relied on larger dining groups of six to 16 people, which would be affected if measures such as the \"rule of six\" returned.\n\"It's a challenge,\" said Mr Morgan. \"We are fighting a losing battle. We are ladened with debt.\"\nMeanwhile, Dave Critchley, chef and owner of Lu Ban restaurant in Liverpool, told the BBC his recently-opened business had never seen a \"solid, full December\" due to the pandemic.\nHe said the Chinese-inspired dine-in was starting to see larger groups cancel their bookings. Since the weekend, two outside events the restaurant was catering for cancelled as a result of the new variant.\n\"It's a real kick in the teeth,\" added Mr Critchley. \"That's big business. It's a double whammy at the moment.\"\nThe chef explained a strong Christmas was something the restaurant was \"desperate for\" due to January being a \"bleak time for hospitality\".\n\"We still want to have a business on the other side. We have got to expect the worst and hope for the best,\" he said.\nIndustry figures have said the industry could not \"financially sustain another lockdown\", with some calling for government support.\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the return of masks in shops and on public transport would \"undoubtedly have an immediate impact on consumer confidence\", which she said was \"fragile\".\n\"There is no doubt that this will have a dampening effect just as we were about to head into our busiest trading period,\" she added.\nMeanwhile, the British Beer and Pub Association said hospitality was a \"safe environment\" and restrictions \"need not be placed on our sector at this time - and particularly during the festive period where we visit the local to see friends and family\".\nLike others, Mr Wawrzyniak said the industry needs \"clear advice\" from the government.\n\"It's not for me to tell people to wear a mask or not. That's the government's job,\" he added.\n\"We went through hell in the last 18 months and we really don't need a repeat of that. We need to know what's going on.\"\nHe said the government's decision to review current measures in three weeks could deliver a further blow.\n\"What happens if they announce, around 17 December, that they'll lock us down? It will be an absolute disaster.\"\nA government spokesman said it had taken \"swift and decisive action\" to mandate face coverings in some settings, but this did not apply to hospitality venues.\nHe added: \"We have already provided an unprecedented support package of \u00a3352bn which hospitality businesses have had continued access to, and we have published a new Hospitality Strategy to support England's pubs, bars, restaurants and other venues to thrive long-term.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid booster jabs will be offered to everyone in England who is eligible by the end of January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nMr Johnson said the government would be \"throwing everything\" at the campaign so everyone can get a third jab.\nPeople will be invited to book a booster three months after their second vaccine dose.\nThe rollout was expanded in response to the emerging Omicron variant, which could be more infectious than Delta.\nA total of 22 cases of the new variant have so far been confirmed in the UK - 13 in England and nine cases in Scotland linked to a single event.\nThe prime minister said booster doses will be given at 1,500 community pharmacy sites and extra hospital hubs in England.\nHe added 400 military personnel will be on hand to help the NHS alongside \"the fantastic jabs army of volunteers\".\n\"There'll be temporary vaccination centres popping up like Christmas trees,\" he told a Downing Street press conference. \nEarlier, Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency - the body which replaced Public Health England - suggested people should limit unnecessary socialising in the run-up to Christmas, saying: \"If we all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the variant at bay\".\nBut the prime minister disagreed, saying government guidance remains the same - but that people should \"take sensible precautions\" like washing hands and wearing masks.\nAsked whether people should cancel Christmas parties and nativity plays, Mr Johnson said: \"We don't want people to cancel such events, and we think that overwhelmingly the best thing for kids is to be in schools.\"\nHe said instead, they were taking a \"balanced and proportionate\" approach, and while he thought it extremely unlikely that another lockdown would be required, he was ruling nothing out.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said getting vaccinated would \"give ourselves the best chance of a Christmas with our loved ones\".\nAlmost 18 million people in the UK have already had a booster jab. A further 14 million more adults have now become eligible for one in England alone, Mr Johnson said.\nOn Monday, the government's vaccines advisers said boosters would be offered to all over-18s in the UK with the minimum gap between the second dose and booster reduced from six to three months.\nMr Johnson urged people to wait to be contacted by the health service before booking their booster, saying: \"Even if you have had your second jab over three months ago and you are now eligible, please don't try and book until the NHS says it is your turn.\"\nJabs will be prioritised according to age, with the NHS working down the list in five-year bands as before, he said.\nAs well as expanding the booster jabs programme, the government has strengthened other Covid rules in response to concern over the new variant.\nFace coverings are once again compulsory in places like shops and on public transport in England, and contacts of suspected Omicron cases are now required to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status. \nAnd as of Tuesday morning, anyone coming to the UK must self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test, taken within 48 hours of arrival.\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the measures, but said he had written to the prime minister urging him to \"go further\" by introducing \"vital\" testing for everyone before they travel.\nHe said: \"They need urgently to put that additional measure in place... a PCR test is not a substitute for a pre-departure test.\"\nThe end of January target is ambitious, but certainly achievable. \nCrucially there is plentiful supply of vaccines - the challenge is increasing the rate at which the NHS can give jabs.\nCurrently just over two million booster doses a week are being given in England. At that rate it would take until the start of spring to vaccinate all eligible adults.\nThe PM can only set these targets for England but ministers in devolved nations have also committed to ramping up boosters\nThe challenge therefore is to get up to the levels of vaccination seen in the spring when around four million doses a week were being administered.\nSome of the infrastructure that was in place in those early days has been dismantled. Many GPs and their teams have returned to their day jobs. A third of the mass vaccination centres have closed.\nPharmacies have stepped in to offer more jabs, but they are constrained in how many they can do by lack of staff.\nExtra support for them will be vital. So will the hospital vaccination sites - there's more than 200 of them but only 30 currently vaccinate members of the public.\nNHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said she was aiming to free up capacity to allow hospitals, GP surgeries and pharmacies to give more booster jabs.\nShe said NHS staff were working at \"breakneck speed\" to expand the vaccine programme, which was already at its \"most complex phase\" and now faced the biggest change to eligibility so far.\nNorthern Ireland has announced extra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Scotland and Wales have said their booster programmes will be ramped up, but are yet to lay out the full details.\nA further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday, while another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.\nIn other developments:"

None have been identified in Wales, although officials have warned it is inevitable it will arrive.\nDuring Christmas 2020, only two households were allowed to meet on Christmas Day, in the middle of the Alpha wave.\nLabour's Eluned Morgan told a press conference it was \"too early to say yet what the Covid situation is likely to be as we enter the Christmas period\".\nShe urged \"people to act with caution over the Christmas period and to take very seriously the situation and the threat, indeed, of mixing with other people indoors during this time\".\n\"It is something that we need to take seriously.\n\"Omicron has not yet arrived in Wales, but it is simply a question of time before it does.\"\nThe advice was not echoed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday, who said there was no need to \"change the overall guidance about how people should be living their lives\".\nThat was despite comments urging caution from Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency, who urged people not to socialise if they do not need to in the run-up to Christmas.\nChairwoman of the vaccination board Dr Gill Richardson said the roll out of the expanded booster programme would be challenging.\nWales is not operating a walk-in system for boosters as has been used in England, with health boards offering appointments as they move through age groups - something the Welsh government says follows JCVI advice.\nDr Richardson said it would be expanded \"as quickly as possible\", and older people and at-risk groups would get theirs first.\nBoosters had already been offered to people over 40 and at-risk groups six months after their last vaccine.\nThe expansion, she said, \"will mean increasing the speed of the roll out and increasing the workforce to ensure we can offer boosters and second vaccines to everyone who is eligible\".\nPromising that supplies are available, Dr Richardson said plans included creating more capacity in clinics, using drive-through centres, working with GPs and other public service staff who are trained to give vaccines.\nShe said it would be \"huge and complex\" and would need a \"real call to arms\" from the workforce.\nDr Richardson suggested volunteers, charities, the fire service, agency staff and students could all be required to deliver the vaccines. \nBoris Johnson has promised to offer everyone eligible a booster by the end of January - but Eluned Morgan did not commit to a target on Tuesday, and said they were being worked on.\nAs well as third doses for all adults, those who are severely immuno-compromised will also be offered a booster fourth dose following their course of three doses.\nYoung people aged 12-15 will also be offered a second dose of Pfizer 12 weeks after the first.\nClive Hopkins, co-owner of Blancos Hotel and Restaurant in Port Talbot, said Omicron had already had an impact on his business.\n''This Saturday we had one booking for 150 people,\" he said. \"We ended up to doing 120, 30 didn't turn up.\"\nHe said it was \"very important\" that he gets business at Christmas.\n\"Many hotels and restaurants and function suites have really struggled for a long time now and they have the chance to get a little bit of money back, probably to see them through the worst month of the lot in January. \n\"If this gets knocked back as well I dunno, people who were struggling all this time could possibly lose their businesses.'' \nClaire Brook, of Chester-based law firm Aaron and Partners with clients in Wales, said seasonal parties are \"difficult for employers\".\nShe said she is seeing clients with larger numbers of people \"looking at ways of doing more team-specific smaller events, or even virtual get-togethers\", rather than large gatherings.\n\"They have that balancing act of, whilst wanting to celebrate an offer something fun and probably a well-needed get-together for their teams, but balancing that against the potential risks that that they need to manage within their own workplaces.\"\nRecent Covid figures have put the rolling seven-day rate per 100,000 at 472.1 over seven days - continuing a recent downward trend.\nFour deaths were reported on Tuesday, putting the total at 6,405.\nThere were 587 patients with Covid in hospital beds in Wales on Monday, down from 644 the previous week, with 47 patients being ventilated in critical care beds - down from 58.\nDespite the declining trends, Mr Drakeford warned the new variant would have an impact on the health service.\nHe told the Senedd on Tuesday it was a \"very sobering truth\" that pressures on the NHS \"are about to get even more challenging over the coming weeks\".\nWelsh Conservative Paul Davies had raised a report from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine that there had been an \"alarming number\" of avoidable deaths in emergency departments due to crowding.\nThe Welsh Conservatives called for an \"action plan\", including the reopening of any closed mass vaccination centres, and bringing back NHS Covid volunteers.\nThey called for schools to stay open, and for ministers to commit to easing restrictions if Omicron \"proves no more dangerous than Delta\".\nRussell George, Tory health spokesman, added: \"The health minister is doing her best in difficult circumstances but given the pressures facing public health in Wales and the importance of the vaccine rollout, it's clear the first minister needs to provide support in the form of a dedicated vaccines minister moving forward.\"\nFor Plaid Cymru, Delyth Jewell was concerned about the well-being of frontline NHS staff.\n\"The past two years have been incredibly difficult for NHS workers and people in social care,\" she said.\n\"We need to make sure there is support available for people who are going to be facing the next few weeks with strain and some trepidation.\""

      "text": "A winner in the ring - but out for the count - super-fit boxer Cara Owen was left clinging on to life.\nThe 23-year-old collapsed with a bleed on the brain after victory in a fight-night bout.\nAirlifted to hospital, trauma surgeons did not know if she was going to make it there alive.\n\"The last thing I remember was feeling ill in the changing room - and then nothing after that - nothing about the fight,\" said Cara.\nThat was two years ago - two long hard years of rehabilitation.\n\"When I woke up from the coma, I had no idea what was going on,\" recalled Cara, from Caernarfon in Gwynedd.\n\"I touched the side of my head, and there was nothing there - no hard sensation.\nHer first question to those gathered around her bed as she regained consciousness was: \"Did I win the fight?\"\nShe had - but it would be the last time she ever stepped inside a ring as a fighter.\nShe had suffered a major brain haemorrhage.\nIt was the reason for her collapse after the fight in September 2019, though Cara and her family suspect it was the result of an injury sustained in the days or weeks before her last bout.\nShe was flown by air ambulance to Royal Stoke University Hospital, where part of her skull had to be removed to relieve pressure on her brain.\nAt her bedside was her uncle, and the man who is viewed as her adopted father, Chris Pritchard.\nHe is the martial arts instructor who trained Cara, and also organised the fight that night.\n\"It was very hard. To see my niece, my adopted daughter as such, fighting for her life, it was very tough - and it's still tough to think about today,\" he said.\nBut having trained her since she was a small child, he knew her fitness would help pull her through.\n\"It was only 14 days after the accident that I was picking her up from hospital,\" said Chris, as he described the trauma surgeon's disbelief at the speed of Cara's recovery.\n\"How can a person who has suffered this injury be up talking, walking and leaving the hospital so soon?\n\"Her strength, her conditioning, her mental attitude which she has gained from martial arts, did help her push through this.\"\nBut leaving hospital was just the start of an arduous journey for Cara.\nThree months after initial surgery, she was under the knife again, this time to put a metal plate in her skull, to replace the bone that had to be removed.\n\"The recovery was very difficult,\" she reflected.\n\"My concentration skills, my memory, understanding what had happened - everything was hard.\n\"Even at Stoke, it was hard to walk again.\n\"But I got there in the end.\"\nHowever, probably the hardest challenge for Cara has been coming to terms with the fact she will never fight competitively, either in boxing or martial arts.\n\"That was heart-breaking to be honest - it still is to this day,\" she said.\nShe has been competing in contact sports, tournaments and ringside bouts since almost as long as she could walk.\n\"It is all I've known since I was three years old. But I'm happy to still be alive, and that I can still train - and now I can train others,\" she said.\nShe is now back in the gym every day, pulling on the boxing gloves and taking part in non-contact kick-boxing sessions.\nDespite her own experience, both she and her uncle are convinced the sport - be it boxing or martial arts - remains safe.\nInstructor Chris has not organised any fights since the night Cara was rushed to hospital - but he said he hoped to in the coming months, as long as Covid restrictions allowed.\n\"I know it's a contact sport, but I truly believe it is still very safe,\" he said.\n\"You know there's the medical checks that happen, the screening that gets done, the after-care - the whole thing is pretty safe.\"\nCara said she wanted to see those events again - and even if she could not be on the scorecard - she could pass on the skills that have made her such a fighter.\n\"I can imagine it will be a great feeling to pass it on to someone else.\n\"I'll still be there, hopefully walking them into the ring, so that I feel like I'm walking into the ring once again.\""

But it said it was taking measures to protect its Christmas food ranges, including stocking more turkeys and pigs in blankets in store compared to last year. \nIt is also keeping extra stock in depots such as mince pies, confectionary, Christmas cakes and puddings, and has recruited 15,000 temporary staff to work during the busy Christmas period.\nIn September, John Lewis said it was chartering a fleet of extra ships, along with a number of other businesses, to make sure it has Christmas stock on time. \nBoss Sharon White blamed a shortage of shipping containers which had made it tough - and expensive - to get a space on cargo ships travelling from various parts of the world.\nAsda - which was recently bought by the billionaire Issa brothers - said the fall in quarterly sales reflected unusually high demand in the same period last year when people were eating more meals at home due to Covid curbs. \nHowever, its rivals Tesco and Sainsbury's have both reported higher sales in the third quarter. \nAsda said customer habits that emerged in the pandemic had remained, with demand for its online delivery service still 80% higher than pre-pandemic levels. \nIt added that the lockdown trend of customers treating themselves to premium own-label products had also continued.

They are accompanied by a significant investment programme to upgrade branches to better suit customer needs. And, where it takes longer to get to the nearest branch, we will introduce more 'pop-up' services in communities.\"\nThese pop-up services, based in town halls, libraries and community centres in 10 areas, will allow customers to conduct basic banking, as well as receive digital support.\nThe government has published plans to ensure consumers and businesses have a legal right to withdraw and deposit cash within \"a reasonable distance\" of their home or premises.\nTSB recently faced a public outcry over plans to shut a museum at the site of the world's first savings bank.\nThe small cottage museum is on the site where Rev Henry Duncan set up his \"penny bank\" for parishioners in 1810.\nA deal has since been struck to transfer the site to another company in order to keep it open."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Stock markets,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Stock markets around the world have fallen after the boss of Moderna cast doubts on the effectiveness of vaccines against the new Omicron Covid variant.\nStephane Bancel told the Financial Times he thought there would be a \"material drop\" in vaccine efficacy.\nThe Covid variant was first detected in South Africa, and the symptoms have been mild so far.\nBut travel restrictions have been imposed as a precaution by places including the UK, the EU and the US.\nMr Bancel predicted that existing vaccines would be less effective in staving off Omicron, and that it would take months for drugs companies to update vaccines.\n\"There is no world, I think, where [the effectiveness] is the same level,\" he said.\nIn the US, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader S&P 500 share indexes closed 1.9% lower. The tech-focused Nasdaq lost 1.6%.\nThe falls also follow remarks by the chairman of the Federal Reserve suggesting that the emergence of the new variant would worsen uncertainty around the economic recovery and inflation.\nIn response to a question, Mr Powell also said it was time to retire the term \"transitory\" which he has used to describe recent high rates of inflation. The Federal Reserve should consider tapering bond purchases more quickly, the first step towards raising interest rates, he added. \nThe US market falls followed similar declines in Europe and Asia.\nThe UK's FTSE 100 share index, Germany's Dax, and France's Cac 40 slipped more than 1.5% each before regaining ground, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 lost 1.5%, hitting its lowest level in nearly seven weeks.\nTokyo's Nikkei index closed down 1.6%, crude oil prices fell nearly 3%, and the Australian dollar hit a one-year low.\nThere was also a scramble for assets that are considered to be safer in times of uncertainty, such as gold, German government bonds, and the yen.\n\"It's not good news, and it's coming from someone who should know,\" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency strategist Joe Capurso. \"Markets have reacted in exactly the way you'd expect them to.\"\nMarkets plunged on Friday after investors were rattled by the discovery of the new variant, with the FTSE 100 index suffering its biggest drop in more than a year.\nStock markets rebounded slightly on Monday, but are still far below last week's levels.\nHowever, both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250, which is more focused on UK firms, are still substantially higher than this time last year - up about 8.3% and 9.6% respectively.\nBig shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms or falls owing to coronavirus or the financial crisis.\nThere are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances.\nThere are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - invested by pension schemes.\nThe value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments.\nTiming is more critical for those at retirement age, as this may be when a retiree uses their pension pot to buy a retirement income, or annuity.\nThe bigger the pot, the more income they will get in retirement.\nRead more here.\nUncertainty about the new variant has triggered global alarm, with border measures casting a shadow over the economic recovery from the Covid pandemic that has been taking place.\nIt comes as infections rise again in some European countries.\nHowever, European Medicines Agency (EMA) executive director Emer Cooke told the European Parliament that even if the new variant becomes more widespread, existing vaccines should continue to provide protection.\nAndrea Ammon, who chairs the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC), said 42 cases of the variant had been confirmed in 10 EU countries. There were another six \"probable\" cases.\nShe said the cases were mild or without symptoms, although in younger age groups.\nThe science may still be uncertain but the Omicron variant has definitively intruded upon recent stock market euphoria.\nThe designation as a variant of concern last week, and then further comments this morning from vaccine makers that existing vaccines will not be as effective, has caused widespread and significant falls in share prices.\nSo what will the economic effect be? It should be limited and that is mainly because it's clear that the UK Government and the US Government will do everything to avoid any further lockdowns.\nThe world awaits the health data from hospitals, first from South Africa's outbreak, and then elsewhere, about its transmissibility and severity.\nThe new restrictions announced here in the UK and around the world reflect real time science, and in particular an expectation that the variant takes some bricks out of the wall of vaccine immunity.\nThat in and of itself will have some economic impact. In the UK, real time data from restaurant reservations and online job adverts were well above the equivalent day last year. Retail footfall was just 8% below the equivalent day in 2019. Things were beginning to get back to normal, even with a considerable number of Delta cases, and a steady stream of weekly deaths.\nOmicron has paused some of this process, merely by injecting a doubt that the pandemic is behind us.\nThe World Health Organization has said it could take weeks to determine how severe Omicron infections could be, and how much protection current vaccines give.\nThe University of Oxford said there was no evidence that current vaccines would not prevent severe disease from Omicron, but that it was ready to rapidly develop an updated version of its shot with AstraZeneca, if that is necessary.\nModerna and fellow drugs firms BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson are working on vaccines that specifically target Omicron in case existing shots are not effective against it.\nModerna has also been testing a higher dose of its existing booster."

      "tags": "Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Retailing,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Face coverings have become mandatory again in shops and on public transport in England as a precaution against the new Omicron variant of coronavirus. \nBut shopkeepers are concerned that this could have a serious impact on their businesses, at a time when violence and verbal abuse against retail and hospitality staff is at an all-time high. \nHere's what people in the sector had to say.\nKatie Pitts, co-owner of Leeds-based fashion boutique The Dressing Room, is worried that frustration over the pandemic might affect consumers' spending behaviour this Christmas.\n\"We've got a lot of lovely customers who have helped us through a tough time, but people are a bit frustrated,\" she says.\n\"We're a non-essential retailer, so if they don't feel like wearing a mask, they might not come in.\"\nAlthough The Dressing Room has a website, 70% of all sales still come from footfall to the store, as customers prefer to try clothing on before they buy, says Ms Pitt. \nSo far, no customers have declined to wear masks and Ms Pitts hopes it stays that way. \n\"It's not a discussion we want to have, it's not our rule, it's a rule we have to go by,\" she says. \nNigel Bourne, the owner of Sussex-based cookware retailer Rye Cookshop, tells the BBC face covering rules should \"never have gone out in the first place\".\nHe says he wishes the government would \"be stronger on advertising\" how people should wear masks, having experienced some customers wearing them wrongly.\nThe shop owner, based in Rye, East Sussex, says he hasn't had to call the police over people not wearing masks as no-one has been abusive. But he has had to ask people to leave his shop. \n\"It's hard work all the policing of it. We do it for ourselves and for other people. I do not want to work in a shop where people are not wearing their masks properly.\n\"If the law says you have got to wear it, wear it.\"\nThe guidance over how face coverings will be enforced in shops and on public transport will be set out in due course, the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC.\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council says police forces will \"continue to enforce coronavirus regulations where it is necessary to do so\" and will support transport and retail staff in ensuring people wear face coverings.\nIt is unclear whether penalties for those who refuse to wear masks without good reason will change. Previously, people faced a \u00a3200 fine which was reduced to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days.\nThe fine doubled for each subsequent offence and could go up to \u00a36,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. \nAssistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill says officers will respond to incidents where \"individuals are violent or abusive towards staff or members of the public\" and will be more visible in towns and shopping centres.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, 85% of adults said they had worn a face covering outside their home in the past seven days, with 70% saying they wore one often or always while shopping.\nHowever, just 18% of people shopping said that everyone or almost everyone they saw was wearing a face covering.\nSupermarket chain Iceland says it will not be policing whether customers are wearing face masks.\nIceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC's Today programme that while staff and customer safety was a priority, he did not want to put his staff at \"risk of confrontation or abuse\".\n\"I think over 90% of retail staff have been threatened, assaulted or abused in the last 12 months and we alone have had over 4,000 incidents of reported verbal abuse each year,\" he said.\nDuring the first coronavirus lockdown from March-May last year, the number of incidents rose to more than 50 incidents a week, he added. \n\"Since staff were told not to challenge customers, that figure dropped tenfold to five a week,\" said Mr Walker. \n\"So I think if the government want it to happen, they must step in to help businesses like us and police the wearing of masks.\"\nAccording to consumer expert Kate Hardcastle, business owners are particularly worried about experiencing abuse, particularly when it comes to enforcing social distancing rules. \n\"Small businesses say they have felt intimidated - one told me they feel they can't operate in their store by themselves.\n\"They feel they have to have another presence there as support, in case something happens.\"\nRetailers are concerned about damaging the relationship with their customers, says Ms Hardcastle, at a time when they can't really afford for anything else to go wrong. \n\"Not only is it unpleasant to deal with, but a lot of shop owners are experiencing recruitment issues. It's not going to entice someone to go into a retail career if they have to cope with ongoing abuse,\" she says. \nBut most of all, Ms Hardcastle says businesses are really \"terrified\" of being ordered by the government to close again.\nRebecca Morter, chief executive of sustainable fashion shop Lone Design Club, says she has encountered a couple of customers who don't want to follow Covid rules on masks and social distancing in the past.\nShe agrees with Ms Hardcastle that retailers are most concerned about being forced to close again.\n\"Anything that helps prevent the new variant and keep the virus spreading is a good thing,\" she says.\n\"I understand that some people disagree, but we really, really don't want to go into another lockdown, so for us it's important that everyone follows the rules so we can stay open.\"\nManchester shopping mall the Trafford Centre told the BBC it would be deploying staff to hand out free masks and encouraging shoppers to wear face coverings unless they are exempt.\nDoug Russell, health and safety officer at shop workers' union Usdaw, says it is \"extremely regrettable\" that the government didn't keep existing rules on masks in place as the country reopened. \nYet workers had no power to make customers wear them anyway, he adds, and that is unlikely to change this time.\nThe fact the issue \"attracted so much aggression by a minority of people\" is a \"social bafflement\", adds Mr Russell.\nHe says the new rules are inevitably going to lead to more \"clashes\" between shop workers and small groups of people who refuse to wear masks.\n\"Shop workers have been at the forefront all the way throughout the pandemic.\""

      "tags": "Shirley,Solihull,Death of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes",
      "text": "A six-year-old boy was fearful his father would kill him months before his death, a court has heard.\nThomas Hughes and partner Emma Tustin are on trial accused of murdering his son Arthur Labinjo-Hughes last June.\nIn a closing speech at Coventry Crown Court, Ms Tustin's defence said the boy was routinely assaulted by Mr Hughes at their Solihull home and had told others his \"dad was going to kill him\".\nBoth of the accused, who deny murder, also face child cruelty allegations. \nArthur died after sustaining an \"unsurvivable\" head injury on 16 June 2020 while in the sole care of Ms Tustin at her home on Cranmore Road in Shirley, Solihull.\nDespite medical evidence suggesting there was no way Arthur could have self-inflicted his fatal injuries, Ms Tustin, 32, maintained she was not responsible.\nShe has pleaded guilty to two counts of child cruelty which accused her of intimidation and assaults. She denies a third count alleging she poisoned Arthur with salt-laced drinks and meals.\nRepresenting her, Mary Prior told the court \"she let that little boy suffer and she accepts that, and she will pay a heavy price for that\".\nClosing her case, Ms Prior said the defendant had been painted as manipulative. She said Arthur had been struggling after his biological mother was jailed for a killing in 2019, and was said to be anxious, clingy and experiencing nightmares. \nMs Prior added Mr Hughes, 29, ignored advice from doctors and Arthur's school not to punish him and to treat him with kindness and understanding but he did not share this advice with Ms Tustin.\nSince he was five - before Mr Hughes and Ms Tustin struck up a relationship - Arthur had expressed concerns his father was going to kill him, Ms Prior told the court. She said the boy had expressed this to his wider family, his doctor and his school \"for well over a year and nobody listened\".\nThe court previously heard Mr Hughes made a number of threats towards his son, including to \"put him six feet under\", and had also sent Ms Tustin messages such as \"just end him\".\nAlthough he was not present for the alleged fatal assault on Arthur, prosecutors argue Mr Hughes is equally culpable as he \"encouraged\" violence against his son, as well as dealing out beatings himself.\nMr Hughes faces the same child cruelty counts as his co-defendant. Despite his not-guilty pleas, his counsel said he was \"not suggesting for a second he's anything other than guilty\" for the counts relating to intimidation and assault.\nHis defence argued Ms Tustin carried out assaults on Arthur in secret from Mr Hughes; assaults which escalated towards the end of Arthur's life.\nBernard Richmond told jurors Ms Tustin was \"a predator\" and Arthur her prey, \"because he had something she wanted - Thomas Hughes\".\nHe said she drove a wedge between Mr Hughes and Arthur and would \"bombard\" him with messages about the child's alleged behaviour. \nMr Richmond said Mr Hughes was \"stupid\" but not a murderer. There was \"nothing to suggest\" he had given Ms Tustin permission to harm his son, Mr Richmond added.\nThe trial continues.\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Cox says he will not be investigated over accusations he used his Commons office for legal work.\nMPs cannot use public resources, including parliamentary offices, for \"personal or financial benefit\".\nBut the former Attorney General was pictured in September in a virtual meeting representing the British Virgin Islands government, from what appeared to be his Commons office.\nLabour had reported it to the Standards Commissioner.\nSir Geoffrey said there would be no further action, confirming to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the Commissioner, Kathryn Stone, had declined to open an investigation.\nThe BBC understand Ms Stone decided there was insufficient evidence to justify an inquiry, believing the rules on the use of parliamentary offices should be operated with \"a sense of proportion\".\nA spokeswoman for the commissioner said Ms Stone does not comment on the conduct of individual MPs outside the information published on her website and reports published at the end of an investigation.\u202f  \nSir Geoffrey came under fire for his work outside the Commons as a lawyer amid the row over MPs' second jobs, in light of the row over former MP Owen Paterson. \nThe Register of Members' Interests showed the 61-year-old MP for Torridge and West Devon made almost \u00a3900,000 last year working as a barrister, including travelling to the British Virgin Islands during lockdown to advise its government on a corruption inquiry. \nA picture of him carrying out this work that emerged earlier this month appeared to show him in his Commons office, while a clip of the meeting also appeared to show him leave his desk after a division bell went off - a signal for MPs to go and vote. \nLabour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said Sir Geoffrey appeared to be in \"brazen breach of the rules\" and called for an investigation. \nBut a statement on behalf of Sir Geoffrey was posted on his website after, saying: \"He does not believe that he breached the rules but will of course accept the judgement of the Parliamentary Commissioner or of the Committee [on Public Standards] on the matter.\"\nSir Geoffrey has insisted he only participated in the inquiry from his office once. \nA wider argument broke out around second jobs over the following days, with Labour setting out plans to end all external work for MPs - unless it had a public service element.\nAt the same time, the government said it planned to ban MPs working as paid consultants or lobbyists, and won a vote in the Commons backing its proposals. \nBut steps for implementing the recommendations were not set out.\nOn Monday, the MPs' Standards Committee also recommended a ban on providing paid parliamentary advice or consultancy services, among a broader overhaul of the code of conduct.

      "tags": "Companies,Retailing,Zara,Inditex,Fashion",
      "text": "High Street fashion giant Inditex, which owns brands including Zara and Massimo Dutti, has appointed the founder's daughter as its new chairwoman.\nMarta Ortega will replace Pablo Isla, chairman of Inditex since 2011.\nMs Ortega has been with the firm for 15 years, starting out as an assistant at its High Street brand Bershka.\n\"I have always said I would dedicate my life to building upon my parents' legacy,\" the 37-year-old said. \n\"I have lived and breathed this company since my childhood, and I have learned from all the great professionals I have worked with over the last 15 years,\" said Ms Ortega, adding that she was deeply honoured by the trust the firm was placing in her. \nMs Ortega has been credited with strengthening the retailer's brand image, having led several campaigns, including the launch of Zara's premium collections such as Zara SRPLS and Charlotte Gainsbourg by Zara.\nInditex was founded by Amancio Ortega with his ex-wife Rosalia in 1975 in Galicia, Spain. \nMr Ortega is one of the world's richest men, with an estimated net worth of $77.8bn (\u00a358.3bn), according to Forbes. He was chairman of Inditex until 2011.\nInditex, whose brands also include Pull&Bear and Stradivariusm, has come to dominate High Streets around the world, with more than 6,600 shops globally.\nMost of its clothing is made close to its Spanish headquarters or in nearby countries such as Portugal, Morocco and Turkey, helping the firm to achieve its famously fast reaction times to new fashion trends.\nby Vivienne Nunis, BBC business reporter\nMarta Ortega P\u00e9rez began working for Inditex on a shop floor in London 15 years ago.\nHer new job will be as the company's chairwoman, helping steer a retail behemoth with nearly 7,000 stores, more than 8,000 factories and a market value of $100bn.\nIs she the right person for the job?\nShe says she's grown up around the company and learned a lot in her time formally working there.\nBut others will see this more as a Spanish version of the hit HBO series \"Succession\", where family members are given preference for top jobs over better qualified members of the team.\nIndeed shares in Inditex have fallen on news of the appointment.\nAlongside new chief executive \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda Maceiras, Marta Ortega P\u00e9rez will face a number of challenges. At a time when consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental costs of fast fashion, Zara particularly is in an awkward spot - its reputation is built on bringing style trends to High Street stores quickly and cheaply.\nThere are also supply chain concerns. Just this week, authorities in the French city of Bordeaux rejected plans by a Zara store to double its floor space, over allegations the fashion label may have profited from the forced labour of Uighurs in China. \nBut the new chief executive and chairwoman are unlikely to be steering the Inditex ship without the help of founder Amancio.\nWhen he resigned as chairman in 2011, he didn't put his feet up. Instead the man known as \"The Boss\" has remained very much involved in the company. Though now aged in his 80s, it's a fair bet he'll remain so, even with the appointment of the new executive team.\nThe group also announced the appointment of new chief executive \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda Maceiras on Tuesday. \nHe joined Inditex in March as general counsel and secretary of the board, following a career as a Spanish state attorney and in the private sector working for several Spanish banks.\nInditex shares fell almost 5% after the announcement. \nAnalysts at Kepler said outgoing chairman Mr Isla had driven Inditex's big international expansion over the past 17 years.\n\"We believe that the timing is not the best ... as we believe that both Marta Ortega and the CEO Oscar Maceiras have a lot to prove when it comes to their ability to run this big monster in the middle of the Covid crisis,\" it said.\nMaureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, says investors and analysts are \"nervous\" about Marta Ortega because she is not well known outside the fashion group, but she doesn't think it is fair to make assumptions about the future of Zara and its owner Inditex.\n\"They've got two people there who have relevant and long experience of the company - Carlos Crespo and Oscar Maceiras,\" she told the BBC.\n\"The current chief executive Carlos Crespo has moved over to become chief operating officer, so it's not like he's leaving the company. And they say Oscar Maceiras is good at team building.\"\nShe said talks about a succession plan had been underway at Inditex since Amancio Ortega stepped down in 2011: \"It was something that was going to happen eventually.\"\nCommenting on Ms Ortega's past performance at Zara, Ms Hinton said: \"It seems to me she has more marketing experience than managing experience, but as chairperson she will be steering the direction of the company, rather than hands-on day-to-day management.\""

      "title": "Covid: All UK adults to be offered booster jab",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid booster jabs are to be offered to all over-18s in the UK to help stop a potential wave of infections driven by the new variant Omicron.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation made a series of recommendations to expand the booster rollout.\nIt said the minimum gap between the second vaccine dose and booster should be reduced from six to three months. \nThe experts also said children aged 12-15 should be invited for a second jab.\nEarly evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk, but scientists say it will take about three weeks before it is known how the variant impacts on the effectiveness of vaccines. \nThe government has announced new rules on self-isolation and that face masks will be compulsory in shops and on public transport in England from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday in an effort to contain the spread of the variant.  Eleven cases of Omicron have now been detected in the UK.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told a Downing Street briefing that Omicron was the \"new kid on the block\" and it has \"always been the case that, at some point, we are going to get a variant that gives us heightened concern\".\nHe said: \"If vaccine effectiveness is reduced - as seems pretty likely, to some extent - the biggest effects are likely to be in preventing infections and, hopefully, there will be smaller effects in preventing severe disease.\n\"Vaccine boosting is the thing we can do most easily while we wait for that science mist to clear.\"\nProf Wei Shen Lim, chair of the JCVI, said he was not predicting the new variant would take hold in the UK but the experts wanted to be in the best possible position if there was an increase in infection.\nHe said: \"With any vaccine during a pandemic, we get the greatest benefit for individuals and society if the vaccine is deployed before the wave starts. We want to provide boosters early enough.... before any possible wave\".\nDirector general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, said the emergence of Omicron \"underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is\".\nThe aim of this announcement is to get ahead of a potential wave driven by the new variant Omicron.\nIf that happens - and it is an \"if\" at this stage because so much is unknown about the new variant - giving more people a booster jab will certainly help.\nWhile Omicron may make the vaccines less effective, the booster dose has been shown to significantly increase the immune response, which will help counter any advantages this variant may have.\nBut that will only happen if the vaccine is in people's arms. The NHS is doing about 2.5 million boosters a week on average at the moment. At that rate it will take three months to vaccinate all those eligible.\nIncreasing that will not be easy. About 50 mass vaccination centres have closed since the spring. Many GPs have also stepped back to concentrate on flu jabs and their day-to-day work.\nIt means the solution is likely to lie in extending the opening hours of current vaccination clinics late into the evenings and bringing in extra staff and volunteers to help.\nIn its advice, the JCVI also recommended severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth dose of the vaccine as a booster. They are currently receiving three jabs.\nThe committee said the booster rollout should take account of vulnerability. Boosters - either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines - should be offered in order of descending age groups, with priority given to those in a Covid at-risk group, it said. \nNHS England said people would be contacted when it was time for them to book their booster.\nA spokesperson said: \"The NHS will shortly set out how staff will expand the booster programme - this will include how booster jabs will be given in priority order... while also increasing capacity to vaccinate millions more people in a shorter space of time.\" \nBooster jabs were originally offered to the over-50s, front-line medical staff and people with health conditions that put them at greater risk. Earlier this month the rollout was widened to include the over-40s.\nThe JCVI's latest advice has been given to ministers in all parts of the UK. It only gives recommendations and the final decision on measures to combat Covid lies with the politicians.  \nSo far, ministers in England, Scotland and Wales have said they would follow the recommendations, and Northern Ireland is also expected to accept them.\nThe JCVI said it would continue to review data on the potential benefits and risks of offering the Covid vaccine to children aged five to 11.\nDr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said a review found it was safe for those aged 12 to 15 to have a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  This should be offered at a minimum of 12 weeks from their first dose. \nThe latest cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the Camden and Wandsworth areas of London, the UK Health Security Agency said. Like the other three cases in England, they have been linked to travel in southern Africa, where infections have been circulating. \nMs Sturgeon said some of the six cases identified in Scotland had no travel history. This suggested a degree of community transmission, she said, but there was currently no suggestion this was widespread.\nUK Health Secretary Sajid Javid was asked in the Commons about any impact Omicron could have on Christmas.\nHe said: \"The reason we've taken measures is to protect the progress we have made, and if we can do that then we can look forward to a fine Christmas.\"\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was not asking anyone to put plans on hold as \"these are protections, not restrictions\".\nMeanwhile, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said people should approach Christmas \"in the way that we've advised all the way through\" - that it should be different and better this year.\n\"That doesn't mean that people should neglect those simple things that we can do in our own lives, that still help to protect ourselves and others,\" he said.\nMr Javid also told MPs they would be given a chance to debate and vote on the face masks and isolation rule changes.\nHe said: \"If it emerges that this variant is no more dangerous than the Delta variant, then we won't keep measures in place for a day longer than necessary. \n\"Our experience of fighting this virus has shown us it's best to act decisively and swiftly when we see a potential threat. Which is why we're building our defences and putting these measures in place without delay.\"\nThe average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. A further 42,583 confirmed cases were announced on Monday."

I always think of Tom in the present, never in the past, but you're living a life you never imagined.\n\"It's just finding a way to push on, in a way that would make him proud.\"\nThe family's local MP paid tribute to them in the House of Commons on Tuesday. \nVale of Glamorgan MP, Alun Cairns, said the family had \"worked tirelessly with the Foreign Office, with the Minister for Europe, with the Embassy in Spain, to enhance the various authorities' response to tragic accidents overseas and have resulted in Tom's check.\"\nForeign Office minister, Amanda Milling MP, said following Tom's \"really, really sad death\", consular officials in Spain \"held meetings with local authorities to understand the procedural investigations that have taken place, to ask whether they can do more for the family\". \nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in a statement its staff had supported the Channon family following the death in Majorca.\n\"We continue to work with Tom's parents to ensure families have access to the information they need, and build on our work in preventing tragic accidents from happening in the future.\" "

Vaccination clinics in Aberdeenshire were also cancelled on Monday. \nThe Scottish government's resilience room, chaired by the deputy first minister, met on Monday afternoon. Mr Swinney urged people in need of support to contact their local council.\nHe said: \"It is good to see that some progress is being made across the country as power is restored.\n\"While we are hopeful for a further recovery as soon as possible, the scale and complexity of the situation cannot be underestimated.\n\"Many people are still without power and water, and that's why local authorities and partners are stepping up welfare support in affected areas for those who need it.\"\nOn Monday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with those still facing disruption. \nHe added: \"The situation in the north-east of Scotland is among the most concerning and, while forecasts are improving, we are on standby to provide further assistance to the Scottish government.\"\nMark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said: \"Storm Arwen has resulted in some of the most significant and challenging conditions experienced in the north of Scotland in decades, resulting in catastrophic damage to several overhead circuits with multiple instances of damage which need to be repaired before power can be restored.\n\"The damage caused by Storm Arwen is at least three times greater than we experienced from the Beast from the East storm in 2018, demonstrating the scale of challenge our teams have faced.\"\nSSEN has been working to restore power in the following locations:\nElsewhere, SP Energy Networks - which covers central and southern Scotland - said on Monday afternoon that it still had about 4,500 homes without supplies.\nThe areas most badly hit are in the Borders, Dumfriesshire, Fife and the Lothians.\nIt said the damage to the network was some of the worst it had experienced in more than 15 years and apologised to anyone affected.\nThe company added it would be offering accommodation to vulnerable customers if it could not restore supplies overnight.\nA number of schools in Dumfries and Galloway have been shut due to heating or power failures. They are all expected to reopen on Tuesday.\nScottish Borders Council has set up drop-in centres to provide soup, meals and hot drinks in Duns, Innerleithen, Hawick and Earlston.\nScottish Water said it was continuing work to restore water supplies to customers across several areas in Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perth, where about 1,500 properties remained without.\nThe main areas were Aberchirder, Lumsden, Rhynie, Lumphanan, Torphins, Fortingall and Fearnan.\nNetwork Rail Scotland said signalling issues been restored on the East Coast Mainline and it was working with operators to reintroduce impacted services.\nMeanwhile, hundreds of seal pups were killed at a nature reserve in the Scottish Borders during Storm Arwen.\nThe National Trust for Scotland (NTS) - which operates the site at St Abb's Head - said there were 224 dead pups in the water at a bay at Pettico Wick, with more washing ashore. \nForestry and Land Scotland has urged people not to visit its forests until checks for the level of damage and safety assessments have been carried out.\nIn the Aberdeenshire village of Kemnay a local caf\u00e9 took hot drinks, soup and mince pies to a nearby care home.\n\"The power's been off since four o'clock on Friday,\" said Andy Hutcheon, manager of Cafe 83.\n\"Many of the care home residents are our customers and they've been huddled in the reception trying to stay warm. They were delighted to see us.\" \nThe caf\u00e9 also set up a barbeque outside for any other locals who needed a drink or food.\n\"There's no heating and no-one has a phone signal - so it's been pretty dire,\" he added.\nAcross the UK, three men were killed by falling trees during the storm, which triggered the Met Office's highest red level storm warning. \nThe 35-year-old driver of a pick-up truck was fatally injured on Friday afternoon in Aberdeenshire.\nHave you been experiencing a power cut since Storm Arwen?

      "tags": "Competition and Markets Authority,Meta",
      "text": "Facebook's parent company, Meta, has been ordered to sell Giphy by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority.\nThe company, then known simply as Facebook, bought the Gif-sharing search engine last year for a reported $315m (\u00a3236m).\nIt planned to integrate Giphy's vast database of looping short video animations with another of its existing social-media platforms, Instagram.\nBut the CMA ruled the purchase unfair to competing social-media platforms.\nFacebook adopted Meta as its new corporate name, in October - but individual platforms owned by the company, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, retain their original identities. \nIn May 2020, when it announced its acquisition of Giphy, it said 50% of the Gif search engine's traffic already came from Facebook platforms - half of that from Instagram.\nBut Giphy also provides Gifs to competitors such as TikTok, Snapchat and Twitter.\nGif stands for Graphics Interchange Format, an image format developed in the 1980s to display static and moving images.\nAnd they have become a staple of social-media posts and comments.\nThe CMA said: \"After consulting with interested businesses and organisations - and assessing alternative solutions put forward by Facebook - the CMA has concluded that its competition concerns can only be addressed by Facebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer.\"\nStuart McIntosh, who chaired the independent inquiry into the acquisition, said without action it would \"allow Facebook to increase its significant market power in social media even further, through controlling competitors' access to Giphy Gifs\".\n\"By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social-media users and promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising,\" he added.\nExperts said the decision by the regulator was a significant one. \nPeter Broadhurst, partner at law firm Crowell & Moring, said: \"This is the first time the CMA has ever blocked a major digital tech deal and indicates the direction of travel for the UK regulator's oversight of similar deals going forward.\"\nIn its decision the CMA noted that Giphy's advertising services had the \"potential\" to compete with Facebook's. \n\"This will cause quite a lot of uncertainty for companies trying to do deals where the parties don't actually compete but maybe could do in the future - particularly where one of them may be big in its own market,\" said Mr Broadhurst.\nBut Meta told BBC News: \"We disagree with this decision. \n\"We are reviewing the decision and considering all options, including appeal. \n\"Both consumers and Giphy are better off with the support of our infrastructure, talent, and resources. \n\"Together, Meta and Giphy would enhance Giphy's product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API [application programming interface] partners in the UK and around the world who use Giphy every day, providing more choices for everyone.\"\nIn June 2020, the CMA sent an enforcement order to Facebook, effectively putting a hold on any merging of the companies until its investigation was over.\nIn August 2021, it announced its provisional findings - the acquisition would \"harm competition between social-media platforms and remove a potential challenger in the display-advertising market\".\nAt the time, the CMA warned \"it could require Facebook to unwind the deal and sell off Giphy in its entirety\".\nBut Meta's lawyers said this provisional finding contained \"fundamental errors of law and fact\".\nBy seeking to undo the acquisition \"in circumstances where Giphy does not even carry on business in the UK, not only is the CMA engaging in extraterritorial overreach but the CMA is sending a chilling message to start-up entrepreneurs, 'Do not build new companies because you will not be able to sell them,'\" they said."

      "tags": "MI6",
      "text": "Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6, must become more open in order to do its secret work effectively. That's according to its chief, Richard Moore, in his first major public speech since taking on the role in October 2020.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), quantum computing and digital technology have combined to completely transform the way human intelligence is gathered by spies, presenting MI6 with major challenges in the digital age.\nBiometric data and facial recognition, for example, have made it far harder for intelligence officers to assume false identities in hostile countries without being recognised and exposed.\nIt was revealed in September that inside MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross there is a real-life Q Section that works to provide Britain's spies with the latest gadgets to keep them safe and secret. \nBut on Tuesday, in addressing the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Mr Moore will admit that mastering human intelligence in this era of accelerating technology is not something his service can do in its own.\nMr Moore, who has spent 34 years working for MI6, will tell his audience it \"includes being more open, and partnering with the private sector to find new technologies\". \nHe adds that \"advances in quantum engineering and engineered biology will change entire industries\". \nAdvances here and in data science in general will have attractions for malign actors, both nation-state and trans-national terrorist groups. \n\"I am paid,\" he says, \"to look at the threat side of the ledger. MI6 deals with the world as it is, not as we would like it to be\". \nHe describes the impact of all this revolutionary technical progress as \"a white-hot focus for MI6\".\nSo where exactly does he say these threats to the UK's national security are coming from?\nMr Moore lists China, Russia, Iran and international terrorism as the \"Big Four\" priorities for the (West's) intelligence world. \n\"Our adversaries are pouring money and ambition into mastering artificial intelligence, quantum computing and synthetic biology because they know... this will give them leverage\".\nAs one of Britain's three intelligence agencies, along with the Security Service (MI5) and GCHQ, MI6's role has always been to acquire secrets from overseas targets to help protect Britain's national security. \nWhile human intelligence - old-fashioned spying - has been at the heart of its work, the MI6 chief points to his service's innovations over time.  Examples he cites are \"from the chemistry that enabled us to produce secret writing technologies in the early days, to the wireless and secure speech technologies we developed during the Second World War\".\nToday, he says, MI6 is a founding member of the UK's unified cyber command which counters state threats, terrorists and criminals and supports military operations.  \nThis speech could perhaps be seen as a belated admission that if it is not careful, MI6 risks getting left behind by the breakneck speed of advances in digital technology. \n\"We cannot hope to replicate the global tech industry, so we must tap into it,\" he says. \"\nThrough the National Security Strategic Investment Fund we are opening up our mission problems to those with talent in organisations that wouldn't normally work with national security.\"\nBut such a sea change in the way MI6 works will not go unnoticed by Britain's adversaries. Going into partnership with others outside the closed world of career spies, whose lifelong mantra has been secrecy, brings with it an inherent risk of leaks or worse, however thoroughly people are vetted. \nMI6 may have no other choice but to go down this route - but it is still a bold move that could present the UK's enemies with some interesting opportunities."

      "text": "Bree Runway, Lola Young and Holly Humberstone have been nominated for the Brits rising star award, which recognises pop's ones-to-watch.\nThe prize, formerly known as the Critics' Choice, has previously gone to Adele, Sam Fender and Jorja Smith.\nRunway and Humberstone both made this year's BBC Sound Of longlist, with Humberstone finishing runner-up.\nYoung is the voice behind this year's John Lewis Christmas advert. The winner will be announced on 10 December.\nThe award, supported by BBC Radio 1, recognises British artists who had not achieved a top 20 album or more than one top 20 single by 31 October this year. \nJudged by a panel of industry experts, it will be handed out at the main Brits ceremony, due to be held at London's 02 arena on 8 February.  \nHere's a quick guide to the three contenders:\nThe singer and rapper performed to former US First Lady Michelle Obama as a schoolgirl aged 14, who told her to \"keep going\".\nShe followed this advice, studying music at university and eventually going viral with her mirror covers  - filming herself singing to the mirror - that gained millions of views on social media.\nThe success of her 2000AND4EVA mixtape sparked the hit Hot Hot, which alongside her BBC Sound Of listing saw her pick up the BET award for best new international act.  \nHot Hot also secured her a Mobo nomination for best video and a nod for best female. \nRunway, now 29, said she feels honoured by this rising star Brit nomination.\n\"It's all so exciting, especially as previous nominees have gone on to do such amazing things, I hope I'm struck by that same luck.\n\"Attending the Brits alone has been something I've wanted to do for years, but attending as a rising star nominee is a dream.\"\nThe 21-year-old has drawn comparisons to Billie Eilish and Maggie Rogers through her tormented lyricism and lo-fi sound, but the title track to her first EP Falling Asleep At The Wheel proved a success very much her own - racking up 200 million streams to date.\nAfter finishing runner-up in this year's BBC Sound Of, she went on to be nominated as an Ivor Novello future star, with critical acclaim also heaped upon her second release, The Walls Are Way Too Thin.\nThe Lincolnshire-born star, who told BBC music correspondent Mark Savage in January that she wants her lyrics to be tattoo-worthy, said she is \"struggling to comprehend\" her Brit nomination.\nAn open-mic veteran by the tender age of 13 when she won her first national competition, Young has described her Brit nomination as a \"big step\".\nGrowing up in south London, the powerhouse vocalist released a number of EPs to critical acclaim, before working with award-winning producer Paul Epworth in 2021, including on her latest smoky-guitar single FAKE.\nYoung also recently found mainstream success by soundtracking this year's John Lewis Christmas advert with a new version of 1984 classic Together In Electric Dreams by Philip Oakley and Giorgio Moroder.\n\"I can't believe I've been nominated for this award. It feels surreal and completely unexpected. I feel very excited to have been nominated,\" said the singer.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "In the past week a heavily mutated Covid variant has been identified, rapidly labelled a \"variant of concern\" by the World Health Organization and named Omicron. It has been detected in countries including the UK.\nIt is a rapidly evolving situation. Omicron's genetic profile has raised concerns, but there's a shortage of real-world data that means nobody has the complete picture of what it can do. \nIt is unclear how big a threat it poses. \nYet, it is at this early stage, in an absence of definitive facts and when there is a danger of both underreacting and overreacting, that the UK government has to act. \nIt's like you or me deciding whether to marry someone after the first date. Only the stakes are much higher. \nWhat we know is Omicron has mutations that theoretically help it to spread more quickly and there is mounting evidence of that happening in South Africa. \nIt also has mutations that theoretically make vaccines less effective and the World Health Organization says there is a higher risk of reinfection than with other variants.\nBut we don't know how transmissible it is. We don't know whether it is milder or more severe. We don't know what will really happen when it comes up against our significant wall of immunity built up through vaccines, boosters and high levels of Covid this autumn. \nThe government's response is to test everyone coming in to the UK, isolate all Omicron contacts, ramp up boosting and bring back compulsory face masks in some public places.\nLet's be clear - that will not stop more Omicron cases arriving or circulating. It's already arrived. If a virus is good at spreading then eventually it will slip through. \nAnd it has the potential to spread here too. Cases of Covid have been climbing except for a lull over the October half term. \nThey are averaging at more than 40,000 a day and the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - is just above the crucial threshold of one, which means cases are growing.\nThe government has been focusing on the pressure on hospitals and pre-Omicron this would have been a key factor in whether to tighten restrictions or go for Plan B. But despite the rise in cases, the numbers needing hospital care for Covid has actually been tumbling due to the success of booster vaccines. \nBut if the current Delta variant can spread here and Omicron combines faster transmission with some ability to evade immunity, then it too has the potential to circulate.\nAll the measures can do is buy time, but for what? Science and boosters.\nThere are important scientific questions that need answering and top of the list is what happens when Omicron meets high levels of immunity. The answer, for better or worse, will dictate what happens next. \nThe vaccines that have been used in the UK train the body to attack the spike protein on the virus - specifically the version of spike from the original variant from Wuhan in China. \nOur immune system learns to attack several parts of that spike. The antibodies in our blood are like a pit crew descending on a Formula 1 car - each going to their target area. But the mutations in Omicron are like changing some parts of the car to bamboozle the mechanics and make their job harder.\nAny dent to immunity is most likely to affect the odds of you catching Covid. What we've seen from the phenomenon of waning immunity is that protection against severe disease and death is more resilient. It will take time to know for sure.\nIt might sound odd, but booster doses could limit any impact. In theory you can compensate for a less efficient immune defence by simply throwing more antibodies and T-cells at the problem, even if they are imperfect.\nMore than 17 million people have already had a third dose and the government wants to ramp up boosting. Other countries have cut the gap between the second and third dose from six months to five and we should hear from the government's vaccine advisers soon. \nPharmaceutical companies say they could update vaccines to match the Omicron variant in around 100 days if they were needed. \nIt is worth noting we do have new weapons in our armoury in the form of anti-viral drugs. Paxlovid and molnupiravir both target the inner workings of the virus and experts have told me there is no suggestion their effectiveness would be knocked by the mutations seen so far. \nThere is also a desire to understand how sick people are getting with Omicron. It is often incorrectly claimed that a virus must become milder as it mutates. The reality is much more complicated and it will take time to get the answer as the country with the most confirmed cases, South Africa, has a relatively young population. The younger you are the milder Covid tends to be.\nThere are already cries that the government is both over-reacting and not going far enough. \nThe problem for all of us is we'll only know the right answer with hindsight.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "A newly published cache of documents directly links top Chinese leaders including President Xi Jinping to the state's crackdown on Uyghur Muslims.\nThe documents include speeches which analysts say prove senior government leaders called for measures that led to mass internment and forced labour.\nChina has consistently denied that it is committing genocide against Uyghurs.\nSome of the documents were the subject of an earlier report, but the latest leak has previously unseen information.\nThey were passed to the Uyghur Tribunal - an independent people's tribunal in the UK - in September, but have not previously been published in full. The tribunal asked three academics who specialise in the field - Drs Adrian Zenz, David Tobin and James Millward - to authenticate the documents. \nThe documents, branded the 'Xinjiang Papers', after the region which is home to most of China's Uyghurs, reveal how Chinese Communist party (CCP) leaders including Mr Xi and Premier Li Keqiang made statements which directly led to policies affecting the Uyghurs and other Muslims.\nThese include forced internments, mass sterilisations, forced assimilation, \"re-education\", and coercion of detained Uyghurs to work in factories.\nThe New York Times had reported on an identical set of documents that were leaked to them in 2019, but not all were made available to the public.\nIn a report on the documents, Dr Zenz said his analysis showed that the links between statements made by top government figures and subsequent policies that were implemented against the Uyghurs were \"far more extensive, detailed and significant than previously understood\".\nChina has come under massive international pressure over allegations of human rights violations in Xinjiang. A marked shift in China's approach to the region can be traced back to two brutal attacks on pedestrians and commuters in Beijing in 2013 and the city of Kunming in 2014, blamed by China on Uyghur Islamists and separatists.\nIts response from 2016 onwards has been the building of so-called \"re-education\" camps for Uyghurs and other Muslims, and the targeting of Xinjiang residents deemed to have displayed any behaviour viewed as a sign of untrustworthiness.\nChina has also pursued a strategy of forced labour, by deploying Uyghurs to pick cotton in Xinjiang. \nIn addition, reports have emerged of China forcibly mass sterilising Uyghur women to suppress the population, separating children from their families, and attempting to break the cultural traditions of the group.\nSeveral countries, including the US, Canada and the Netherlands, have accused China of committing genocide and crimes against humanity. \nChina has vehemently denied these allegations, saying the crackdown in Xinjiang is necessary to prevent terrorism and root out Islamist extremism, and the camps are an effective tool for \"re-educating\" inmates in its fight against terrorism."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid booster jabs are to be offered to all over-18s in the UK to help stop a potential wave of infections driven by the new variant Omicron.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation made a series of recommendations to expand the booster rollout.\nIt said the minimum gap between the second vaccine dose and booster should be reduced from six to three months. \nThe experts also said children aged 12-15 should be invited for a second jab.\nEarly evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk, but scientists say it will take about three weeks before it is known how the variant impacts on the effectiveness of vaccines. \nThe government has announced new rules on self-isolation and that face masks will be compulsory in shops and on public transport in England from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday in an effort to contain the spread of the variant.  Eleven cases of Omicron have now been detected in the UK.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told a Downing Street briefing that Omicron was the \"new kid on the block\" and it has \"always been the case that, at some point, we are going to get a variant that gives us heightened concern\".\nHe said: \"If vaccine effectiveness is reduced - as seems pretty likely, to some extent - the biggest effects are likely to be in preventing infections and, hopefully, there will be smaller effects in preventing severe disease.\n\"Vaccine boosting is the thing we can do most easily while we wait for that science mist to clear.\"\nProf Wei Shen Lim, chair of the JCVI, said he was not predicting the new variant would take hold in the UK but the experts wanted to be in the best possible position if there was an increase in infection.\nHe said: \"With any vaccine during a pandemic, we get the greatest benefit for individuals and society if the vaccine is deployed before the wave starts. We want to provide boosters early enough.... before any possible wave\".\nDirector general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, said the emergence of Omicron \"underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is\".\nThe aim of this announcement is to get ahead of a potential wave driven by the new variant Omicron.\nIf that happens - and it is an \"if\" at this stage because so much is unknown about the new variant - giving more people a booster jab will certainly help.\nWhile Omicron may make the vaccines less effective, the booster dose has been shown to significantly increase the immune response, which will help counter any advantages this variant may have.\nBut that will only happen if the vaccine is in people's arms. The NHS is doing about 2.5 million boosters a week on average at the moment. At that rate it will take three months to vaccinate all those eligible.\nIncreasing that will not be easy. About 50 mass vaccination centres have closed since the spring. Many GPs have also stepped back to concentrate on flu jabs and their day-to-day work.\nIt means the solution is likely to lie in extending the opening hours of current vaccination clinics late into the evenings and bringing in extra staff and volunteers to help.\nIn its advice, the JCVI also recommended severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth dose of the vaccine as a booster. They are currently receiving three jabs.\nThe committee said the booster rollout should take account of vulnerability. Boosters - either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines - should be offered in order of descending age groups, with priority given to those in a Covid at-risk group, it said. \nNHS England said people would be contacted when it was time for them to book their booster.\nA spokesperson said: \"The NHS will shortly set out how staff will expand the booster programme - this will include how booster jabs will be given in priority order... while also increasing capacity to vaccinate millions more people in a shorter space of time.\" \nBooster jabs were originally offered to the over-50s, front-line medical staff and people with health conditions that put them at greater risk. Earlier this month the rollout was widened to include the over-40s.\nThe JCVI's latest advice has been given to ministers in all parts of the UK. It only gives recommendations and the final decision on measures to combat Covid lies with the politicians.  \nSo far, ministers in England, Scotland and Wales have said they would follow the recommendations, and Northern Ireland is also expected to accept them.\nThe JCVI said it would continue to review data on the potential benefits and risks of offering the Covid vaccine to children aged five to 11.\nDr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said a review found it was safe for those aged 12 to 15 to have a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  This should be offered at a minimum of 12 weeks from their first dose. \nThe latest cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the Camden and Wandsworth areas of London, the UK Health Security Agency said. Like the other three cases in England, they have been linked to travel in southern Africa, where infections have been circulating. \nMs Sturgeon said some of the six cases identified in Scotland had no travel history. This suggested a degree of community transmission, she said, but there was currently no suggestion this was widespread.\nUK Health Secretary Sajid Javid was asked in the Commons about any impact Omicron could have on Christmas.\nHe said: \"The reason we've taken measures is to protect the progress we have made, and if we can do that then we can look forward to a fine Christmas.\"\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was not asking anyone to put plans on hold as \"these are protections, not restrictions\".\nMeanwhile, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said people should approach Christmas \"in the way that we've advised all the way through\" - that it should be different and better this year.\n\"That doesn't mean that people should neglect those simple things that we can do in our own lives, that still help to protect ourselves and others,\" he said.\nMr Javid also told MPs they would be given a chance to debate and vote on the face masks and isolation rule changes.\nHe said: \"If it emerges that this variant is no more dangerous than the Delta variant, then we won't keep measures in place for a day longer than necessary. \n\"Our experience of fighting this virus has shown us it's best to act decisively and swiftly when we see a potential threat. Which is why we're building our defences and putting these measures in place without delay.\"\nThe average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. A further 42,583 confirmed cases were announced on Monday."

They can land vertically, similar to the Harrier Jump Jet, and combine radar-evading stealth technology with supersonic speeds.\nJets from HMS Queen Elizabeth previously participated in missions over Iraq and Syria.\nThe F-35s are operated by the renowned 617 Squadron, known as the \"Dambusters\".\nBuilt by the US firm Lockheed Martin, the UK's F-35s are the B variant of the jet and are flown by pilots from the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, based at RAF Marham in Norfolk."

      "text": "The new Covid-19 variant, Omicron, was present in the Netherlands earlier than previously thought, officials say.\nIt was identified in two test samples taken in the country between 19 and 23 November, which is before the variant was first reported by South Africa.\nIt is not clear whether those who took the tests had visited southern Africa.\nIt was previously thought that two flights that arrived from South Africa on Sunday had brought the first cases of the variant to the Netherlands. \nFourteen people on the flights to the capital, Amsterdam, tested positive for Omicron, among 61 passengers who were found to have coronavirus.\nHowever, while the two new samples reveal Omicron was in the Netherlands earlier than thought, they do not predate the cases in southern Africa. The variant was first found in a specimen collected on 9 November, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nEarly evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk. But scientists say it will take about three weeks before it is known how the heavily mutated variant impacts on the effectiveness of vaccines.\n\"In a special PCR test, the samples showed an abnormality in the spike protein,\" the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM)  which announced the earlier cases, said on Tuesday. \n\"This raised the concern that the Omicron variant...  might be involved. [Health officials] will notify the people involved and start source and contact tracing,\" it said.\nThe RIVM also said that a number of different strains of Omicron were found among the passengers on board the two flights on Sunday.\n\"This means that the people were very probably infected independently from each other, from different sources and in different locations,\" a spokesman said.\nIt's unlikely we will ever know precisely when or where Omicron first emerged. \nSouth Africa alerted the world to the new variant on 24 November after it found its first case. Since then, other countries have been on the lookout for it and more cases have been identified around the globe thanks to genome sequencing tests. \nNot every nation has the ability, however, to carry out these added checks. \nEven the UK, which is one of the front-runners using the technology, is unable to screen every positive Covid case to determine which variant is the cause. \nPCR tests, meanwhile, can hint if a Covid case might be Omicron, but cannot confirm it for sure.\nDutch authorities, meanwhile, are also seeking to contact and test thousands of passengers who have travelled from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe.\nThe US, Canada, the UK and the EU have all restricted travel from southern Africa amid concern over the new variant.\nBut the UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the isolation of southern Africa, adding that \"the people of Africa cannot be blamed for the immorally low level of vaccinations available\".\nSouth Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said the wider region had been the victim of unfair discrimination, adding that the bans would not be effective in preventing the spread of the variant.\nA foreign ministry statement also said the travel bans were \"akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker\".\n\"Excellent science should be applauded and not punished,\" it said."

      "title": "Alice Sebold apologises to man cleared of her rape",
      "text": "American author Alice Sebold has apologised for her part in the wrongful conviction of a man who was cleared last week of raping her in 1981. \nIn her memoir Lucky, she described being raped and later telling police she had seen a black man in the street who she believed was her attacker. \nAnthony Broadwater was arrested and convicted, spending 16 years in prison. \nA statement from Mr Broadwater, released via his lawyers, said he was \"relieved that she has apologised\". \nIn Ms Sebold's apology statement, she said: \"I am sorry most of all for the fact that the life you could have led was unjustly robbed from you, and I know that no apology can change what happened to you and never will\". \nLucky sold more than one million copies and launched Ms Sebold's career as an author. She went on to write the novel The Lovely Bones which was turned into an Oscar-nominated film by Peter Jackson. \nLucky's publisher announced on Tuesday that it would stop distributing the memoir while working with Ms Sebold to \"consider how the work might be revised\". \nThe book detailed how Ms Sebold was attacked when she was an 18-year-old student at Syracuse University in New York. \nMonths later, she reported seeing a black man in the street who she thought was her attacker, and alerted police. \nAn officer then detained Mr Broadwater, who had reportedly been in the area at the time. \nAfter his arrest, Ms Sebold failed to pick him out in a police line-up, selecting another man. But Mr Broadwater was tried anyway and Ms Sebold identified him as her attacker in court. He was convicted based on her account and microscopic hair analysis. \nAfter he was released from prison in 1998, Mr Broadwater remained on the sex offenders register. \nHe was exonerated on 22 November after a re-examination of the case found he had been convicted on insufficient and now-discredited forms of evidence. \nHis wrongful conviction came to light after an executive producer working on a film adaptation of Lucky raised questions over the case, and later hired a private investigator. \n\"Certain things leapt out at me as being unusual in the American criminal justice system - specifically the line-up procedure where Alice picked the wrong person as her assailant\u2026 but they tried him [Mr Broadwater] anyway,\" Timothy Mucciante told the BBC's Today programme.\nHe said he discussed his concerns with other members of the production team, but was assured that the book had been vetted and reviewed by lawyers. \n\"In June, I was separated from the picture, and... about a week later or so I contacted the private investigator,\" he said.\nMr Mucciante said he hired the investigator on a Wednesday, and by the Friday both men were convinced there had been a miscarriage of justice.\nHe described it as a \"terrific tragedy... not only in terms of the unfortunate assault of Alice, but also the sort of metaphoric assault of Anthony Broadwater, who spent 16 years in prison and 23 years after that as a registered sex offender\". \nMr Mucciante said it was \"impossible\" for him \"to lay any blame at the 18-year-old Alice Sebold\" for the wrongful conviction.\n\"I read Alice's apology and Anthony was very gracious in accepting that apology and I really applaud him for that. That's the kind of person he is,\" he said. \nUpon hearing the news that he had been cleared of the crime, Mr Broadwater, 61, told AP news agency that he was crying \"tears of joy and relief\". \nMs Sebold said in her statement that she had spent the last eight days trying to \"comprehend how this could have happened\". \n\"I will also grapple with the fact that my rapist will, in all likelihood, never be known, may have gone on to rape other women, and certainly will never serve the time in prison that Mr Broadwater did,\" she added.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Stock markets,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Stock markets around the world have fallen after the boss of Moderna cast doubts on the effectiveness of vaccines against the new Omicron Covid variant.\nStephane Bancel told the Financial Times he thought there would be a \"material drop\" in vaccine efficacy.\nThe Covid variant was first detected in South Africa, and the symptoms have been mild so far.\nBut travel restrictions have been imposed as a precaution by places including the UK, the EU and the US.\nMr Bancel predicted that existing vaccines would be less effective in staving off Omicron, and that it would take months for drugs companies to update vaccines.\n\"There is no world, I think, where [the effectiveness] is the same level,\" he said.\nIn the US, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader S&P 500 share indexes closed 1.9% lower. The tech-focused Nasdaq lost 1.6%.\nThe falls also follow remarks by the chairman of the Federal Reserve suggesting that the emergence of the new variant would worsen uncertainty around the economic recovery and inflation.\nIn response to a question, Mr Powell also said it was time to retire the term \"transitory\" which he has used to describe recent high rates of inflation. The Federal Reserve should consider tapering bond purchases more quickly, the first step towards raising interest rates, he added. \nThe US market falls followed similar declines in Europe and Asia.\nThe UK's FTSE 100 share index, Germany's Dax, and France's Cac 40 slipped more than 1.5% each before regaining ground, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 lost 1.5%, hitting its lowest level in nearly seven weeks.\nTokyo's Nikkei index closed down 1.6%, crude oil prices fell nearly 3%, and the Australian dollar hit a one-year low.\nThere was also a scramble for assets that are considered to be safer in times of uncertainty, such as gold, German government bonds, and the yen.\n\"It's not good news, and it's coming from someone who should know,\" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency strategist Joe Capurso. \"Markets have reacted in exactly the way you'd expect them to.\"\nMarkets plunged on Friday after investors were rattled by the discovery of the new variant, with the FTSE 100 index suffering its biggest drop in more than a year.\nStock markets rebounded slightly on Monday, but are still far below last week's levels.\nHowever, both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250, which is more focused on UK firms, are still substantially higher than this time last year - up about 8.3% and 9.6% respectively.\nBig shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms or falls owing to coronavirus or the financial crisis.\nThere are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances.\nThere are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - invested by pension schemes.\nThe value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments.\nTiming is more critical for those at retirement age, as this may be when a retiree uses their pension pot to buy a retirement income, or annuity.\nThe bigger the pot, the more income they will get in retirement.\nRead more here.\nUncertainty about the new variant has triggered global alarm, with border measures casting a shadow over the economic recovery from the Covid pandemic that has been taking place.\nIt comes as infections rise again in some European countries.\nHowever, European Medicines Agency (EMA) executive director Emer Cooke told the European Parliament that even if the new variant becomes more widespread, existing vaccines should continue to provide protection.\nAndrea Ammon, who chairs the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC), said 42 cases of the variant had been confirmed in 10 EU countries. There were another six \"probable\" cases.\nShe said the cases were mild or without symptoms, although in younger age groups.\nThe science may still be uncertain but the Omicron variant has definitively intruded upon recent stock market euphoria.\nThe designation as a variant of concern last week, and then further comments this morning from vaccine makers that existing vaccines will not be as effective, has caused widespread and significant falls in share prices.\nSo what will the economic effect be? It should be limited and that is mainly because it's clear that the UK Government and the US Government will do everything to avoid any further lockdowns.\nThe world awaits the health data from hospitals, first from South Africa's outbreak, and then elsewhere, about its transmissibility and severity.\nThe new restrictions announced here in the UK and around the world reflect real time science, and in particular an expectation that the variant takes some bricks out of the wall of vaccine immunity.\nThat in and of itself will have some economic impact. In the UK, real time data from restaurant reservations and online job adverts were well above the equivalent day last year. Retail footfall was just 8% below the equivalent day in 2019. Things were beginning to get back to normal, even with a considerable number of Delta cases, and a steady stream of weekly deaths.\nOmicron has paused some of this process, merely by injecting a doubt that the pandemic is behind us.\nThe World Health Organization has said it could take weeks to determine how severe Omicron infections could be, and how much protection current vaccines give.\nThe University of Oxford said there was no evidence that current vaccines would not prevent severe disease from Omicron, but that it was ready to rapidly develop an updated version of its shot with AstraZeneca, if that is necessary.\nModerna and fellow drugs firms BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson are working on vaccines that specifically target Omicron in case existing shots are not effective against it.\nModerna has also been testing a higher dose of its existing booster."

      "tags": "Travel,Air travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Face coverings have become mandatory again on public transport and shops in England in an effort to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.\nPeople arriving in the UK from abroad will now also have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.\nIt comes after 14 cases of the new variant were detected in the UK.\nBoris Johnson is expected to set out plans for the booster jab programme in England at a news conference later.\nOn Monday the government announced a major expansion of the booster jab rollout as part of efforts to help stop a potential wave of infections. They are to be offered to all over-18s in the UK, with children aged 12 to 15 invited for a second jab.\nMore local pharmacies could be used as part of the rollout and it is likely that there will be some prioritisation to ensure the vulnerable get their top-up shots first - as with the original scheme.\nThree more Omicron cases have been found in Scotland and Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said it is expected cases of the new variant will continue to rise.\nEarly evidence suggests Omicron - first found in southern Africa - has a higher re-infection risk. But scientists say it will take about three weeks before it is known how the variant impacts on the effectiveness of vaccines.\nMr Johnson said the new mask and testing measures would \"buy us time in the face of this new variant\".\nRichard Walker, managing director of the Iceland grocery chain, told the BBC his company supported compulsory mask wearing but he would not be asking staff to police those who refused to do so.\nCare Minister Gillian Keegan told BBC Breakfast that it was \"down to individuals\" to do the right thing, calling on the public to be \"sensible\", and said she understood Mr Walker's position.\nWhile it is still unclear the impact the new variant could have she said people should continue with their Christmas plans but be \"cautious\".\nPolice in England say they will work \"in partnership with relevant business owners and their staff\" to ensure people comply with the new face coverings rules.\nAssistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said officers would engage with people not wearing face coverings and encourage them to do so.\nAs a last resort people can be fined \u00a3200, reduced to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days.\nThe changes will be reviewed in three weeks' time and the health secretary told MPs they would be given a chance to vote on them.\nScientists are agreed accelerating the booster programme is key to combatting Omicron if the worst fears are realised.\nThat job though now lies in the hands of the NHS.\nAnd the challenge that it faces is that the infrastructure that was so successful in delivering the jabs in the first half of the year has been scaled back.\nThree-quarters of vaccinations were delivered by GP-led teams. But many of those GP and staff have now returned to their day jobs, focussing on the flu vaccine rollout and their patients.\nAround 50 mass vaccination centres have also been shut down.\nRestarting any of that will not be immediate so in the short-term the easiest solution is to extend the opening hours of the remaining big centres and providing more support to high street pharmacists who are also heavily involved.\nCurrently around 2.5m booster jabs are being given each week - at that rate it could take around three months to provide boosters to everyone.\nHalving that would give the UK the best possible chance of combatting any Omicron wave.\nMr Javid said if it emerged that the variant was \"no more dangerous than the Delta variant\" then measures would not be kept in place \"for a day longer than necessary\".\nThe new rules on face coverings bring England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where they are already mandatory on public transport and for many indoor areas. \nNewly-published guidance says they should be worn in locations including shops, shopping centres, posts offices, banks, hairdressers and food takeaways, as well as on public transport.\nAlthough the change does not require people in England to wear coverings in pubs and restaurants, they are required in hospitality venues elsewhere in the UK in some circumstances.\nLabour's shadow health minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan said the government should not have stopped asking the public in England to wear masks.\nAnother change, which has already come into effect, requires all contacts of suspected Omicron cases to self-isolate for 10 days, even if they are fully vaccinated.\nMeanwhile, the first ministers of Scotland and Wales have called for the PCR test requirement to be changed so that everyone arriving in the UK would have to isolate for eight days. \nThe latest cases of the Omicron variant in England were detected in the Camden and Wandsworth areas of London. Like the other three cases in England, they have been linked to travel in southern Africa.\nNine cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus have been identified in Scotland.\nThe average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. A further 42,583 cases were reported on Monday.\nDr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC it was hoped a booster vaccine dose might \"to some extent, counter the potential drop in vaccine effectiveness we might find with this variant\".\nShe said people could also do their bit by reducing social contacts.\nNHS England has said it will \"shortly\" set out how the booster vaccine programme will be expanded, including who will be prioritised and how capacity will be expanded.\nAn NHS spokesman said boosters would be given in priority order and urged people to come forward \"as quickly as possible\" when called.\nDr Farah Jameel, chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, told the BBC that GP practices needed to have their contractual targets paused so that they could \"refocus clinical priorities\" on supporting the rollout of jabs.\nThe University of Oxford, which developed a Covid vaccine alongside AstraZeneca, has said it can \"rapidly\" update its vaccine \"if it should be necessary\" to tackle the Omicron variant.\nEuropean stock markets have fallen after the boss of Moderna cast doubts on the effectiveness of vaccines against the new Omicron Covid variant."

      "text": "The Covid booster programme is to be expanded and speeded up after six cases of the new Omicron variant of Covid were identified in Scotland.\nThe Scottish government said it had already started work on implementing the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nBoosters will be offered to over-18s, and the wait after a second dose is being cut from six to three months.\nChildren aged 12 to 15 will also now be invited for a second jab.\nScotland's chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, welcomed the advice from the JCVI, which said it wanted to help stop a potential wave driven by the new variant.\nDr Smith said: \"Scotland has already started work on its implementation, including the recommendation that boosters can now be given to all adults no less than three months after a second dose.\n\"Urgent talks with health boards and vaccination partners are under way and further information on the delivery of this advice will follow as soon as possible.\"\nThe JCVI said those aged 12 to 15 should be invited for a second jab three months after their first.\nIt has also recommended that severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth dose of the vaccine.\nThe advice came as it emerged 11 Omicron cases have now been detected across the UK.\nFour have been identified in Lanarkshire and two in Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Those affected are isolating but none are in hospital.\nContact tracing is taking place and all close contacts of suspected Omicron cases will be advised to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said additional testing would be introduced in areas where cases of the new variant are identified. \nShe said there was no evidence that community transmission was sustained or widespread at this stage - but that even limited community transmission underlined the importance of complying with the steps to tackle the spread of the virus.\nMs Sturgeon told a media briefing on Monday: \"At this stage we are asking people to significantly step up and increase compliance with all existing precautions.\n\"Face coverings; hygiene like washing hands and surfaces; vaccination; and of course testing yourself with LFDs and testing before you mix with people from other households.\"\nShe added: \"As of today, I am asking employers to maximise the potential of home working.\"\nAsked about whether the new variant could affect Christmas, the first minister said: \"I'm not asking anybody today to put plans on hold.\n\"Right now what I'm asking people to do is to up the level of compliance with all of the protections that are still in place. These are protections, not restrictions.\"\nOmicron was first reported in South Africa, but cases have been detected in countries across the world, including Australia, Germany, Israel and Hong Kong.\nMs Sturgeon said there was no evidence of any link to the recent COP26 summit in Glasgow, or the Scotland rugby team's match with South Africa at Murrayfield earlier this month.\nScotland's CMO Dr Smith said it was currently believed that the first confirmed case in Scotland had tested positive on 23 November.\nNo new Covid protections were announced by the first minister but clearly the Scottish government is keeping that under review.\nAnd Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that she favours stricter rules - UK wide - for international arrivals.\nThere is already a quarantine requirement for those coming to the UK from a range of countries in southern Africa that have been added to the \"red list\".\nPCR tests within 48 hours for all international arrivals are also being brought in across the four nations. \nMs Sturgeon and her counterpart in Wales, Mark Drakeford, have now written to the prime minister suggesting an eight-day self-isolation period for all those arriving in the UK from abroad.\nThis is being suggested as an additional precaution as scientists try to work out how dangerous, or otherwise, the Omicron variant is.\nThe first ministers are also seeking assurances that the Treasury would support any new Covid measures, should they be required.\nBut Nicola Sturgeon stressed that she hopes a return to restrictions will not be necessary. \nTen countries in southern Africa have been added to the travel \"red list\" in response. All overseas travellers arriving into the UK from 04:00 on Tuesday will need to take a PCR test.\nMs Sturgeon said it was important to \"prepare for the worst and act on a precautionary basis\".\nShe added: \"But that does not mean we are not hoping for something considerably short of the worst.\n\"We are still hoping for the best and that our developing understanding of this variant will reduce rather than increase our concern.\n\"I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis we will seek to act at all times in a proportionate manner.\"\nMs Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford also want to see tougher travel restrictions for people arriving in the UK.\nThey wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson proposing that people should self-isolate for eight days, with tests on day two and day eight.\nHowever, that was ruled out by the prime minister's spokesman, who said such a move would have a detrimental effect on the travel industry.\nMs Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford also called for urgent talks with Mr Johnson, and for a Cobra committee meeting to take place \"as soon as possible\".\nBut Downing Street said that no Cobra meeting was scheduled.\nThe UK government has tightened the rules on the wearing of face coverings in England, bringing them closer into line with those in Scotland - where there is also some use of vaccine passports for large events, and more stringent advice on home working.\nThe new travel restrictions were announced on Saturday as the World Health Organization designated Omicron a \"variant of concern.\"\nEarly evidence suggests the new Omicron variant has a higher reinfection risk.\nThe first UK cases - picked up from analysis of recent positive Covid tests from all around the country - were confirmed on Saturday in Essex and Nottingham.\nProfessor Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast it was \"almost inevitable\" that there would be many more cases.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Hundreds of thousands of cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus have now been detected in the UK, and hospital admissions are rising.\nOmicron is not making people as ill as previous variants, but the sheer volume of people testing positive is still forcing huge numbers to isolate.\nOmicron appears to be more like a cold for some people, with common reported symptoms including a sore throat, runny nose and a headache.\nPrevious Covid variants were more likely to lead to a loss of taste or smell, a new cough and a high temperature - although these are still the three official symptoms.\nDespite spreading much faster than the previous variant (Delta), health experts say Omicron is milder and less likely to make people ill or need treatment in hospital. That's mainly down to protection from booster vaccines and from previous infections.\nIn South Africa, where it was first identified, Omicron is thought to have peaked. There are also early signs that this may be happening in London, but scientists warn there could be more problems in the UK once Omicron hits the oldest and most vulnerable populations in large numbers.\nSwabs from PCR tests, which are sent to labs for analysis, can show if the variant causing the infection looks like Omicron, Delta or something else. \nFewer than half of UK labs have the required technology to detect suspected Omicron cases. This means that in some areas, it may be detected more quickly than in others.\nConfirming that a suspected case is Omicron requires a full genetic analysis, which takes between four and five days.\nBy looking closely at the genetic material provided though testing, scientists can confirm whether someone is positive with Omicron or the already widely-circulating Delta.\nUp to 20% of the swabs from positive test results in the UK each week - around 60,000 cases - are sent for genomic sequencing.\nThis process doesn't give the full picture but by using those results, scientists are able to estimate what proportion of new cases are the new variant.\nAll viruses constantly mutate, and these mutations result in new versions - or variants.\nSome of these can make the virus more harmful, or simply spread more easily. Scientists term these \"variants of concern\" (VoC).\nThe Omicron variant is a VoC because it has many mutations that haven't been seen before.\nA large number of these are on the part of the virus that most vaccines target - the spike protein.\nThis initially gave rise to concerns that existing vaccines might not be effective against Omicron. \nHowever, research from the UK Health Security Agency found that getting a booster vaccine provides 88% protection against ending up ill in hospital - only slightly less than against previous variants.\nAnother study found that the risk of going to A&E or being admitted to a hospital ward after catching Omicron was roughly half that of the older Delta variant.\nPCR tests can be ordered free from the government website if you have symptoms, but these can be in short supply. They can also be bought from a private company if you need one for travel purposes.\nRapid or lateral flow tests (LFTs) will give you a quick result if you want to know whether you're negative or positive for coronavirus. However, they they can't tell you which variant of the virus you are infected with.\nIf you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive for Covid - of any variant - you must stay at home and self-isolate. \nIn England and Wales, you can end isolation after seven days if you can provide two negative tests on day six and seven. \nPeople who are double-vaccinated and come into contact with a person with Covid should take daily lateral flow tests for seven days, rather than immediately self-isolating.\nIn Scotland, you must self-isolate for 10 days if someone in your household tests positive - even if you've been fully vaccinated.\nYou can get more detail on self-isolation rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland here.

      "text": "The UK \"will throw everything\" at the expanded booster jab rollout in the wake of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, Boris Johnson has said.\nBut the PM insisted there was no need to change the overall guidance on \"how people should be living their lives\".\nEarlier Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, said people should not socialise \"when we don't particularly need to\".\nMeanwhile masks must now be worn in shops and public transport in England.\nA total of 22 cases of the new coronavirus variant have so far been confirmed in the UK. Thirteen are in England - in the East Midlands, the east of England, London and the North West.\nNine cases are in Scotland and all appear to have come from a single event on 20 November, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new variant, and reported it to the World Health Organization on 24 November.\nSpeaking outside a vaccine centre in north London earlier today, Mr Johnson said it is \"overwhelmingly likely\" booster jabs can give a \"lot of protection against all types of the virus\", adding it is crucial for everybody to get the additional dose when eligible.\nHe added: \"We've no doubt at all that the NHS, all the volunteers, the Army, everybody can rise to the challenge. Is it going to be hard work? Yes it is, but I know people can do it.\"\nBooster jabs are to be offered to all over-18s in the UK and children aged 12 to 15 will be invited for a second jab, as part of a major expansion of the vaccine programme.\nAt a No 10 press conference the prime minister announced that the aim is to offer all adults in England over 18 a booster jab by the end of January 2022, with people becoming eligible for a booster at least three months after their second dose. \nThat means 14 million more adults have now become eligible for a booster in England alone, Mr Johnson said.\nJabs will be rolled out at 1,500 community pharmacy sites and extra hospital hubs in England and some 400 military personnel will work with the \"jabs army of volunteers\", he announced.\nPeople arriving in the UK from abroad will also now have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.\nEarlier Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency - the body which replaced Public Health England - suggested people should reduce social contacts in the run up to Christmas.\nWhen asked about her comments, the prime minister said she was right and people should continue to take \"normal precautions\", but said a change in the guidance wasn't necessary\n\"We don't see anything to suggest that we need to go, for instance, to Plan B,\" he said, referring to tougher curbs in England.\nHowever, Mr Johnson added taking \"particular precautions\" against Omicron were needed until experts know \"exactly what kind of a threat it may present\".\nSome Conservative backbench MPs questioned Dr Harries' advice during a debate on face masks in the House of Commons, with some asking on whose authority she was speaking given her suggestion was not government policy.\nMeanwhile, Wales' health minister Eluned Morgan said people should take the \"threat\" of socialising indoors with others at Christmas seriously.\nThe new rules on face coverings bring England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where they are already mandatory on public transport and for many indoor areas. \nNewly-published guidance says they should be worn in locations including shops, shopping centres, posts offices, banks, hairdressers and food takeaways, as well as on public transport.\nAlthough the change does not require people in England to wear coverings in pubs and restaurants, they are required in hospitality venues elsewhere in the UK in some circumstances.\nPolice in England say they will work \"in partnership with relevant business owners and their staff\" to ensure people comply with the new face coverings rules.\nAs a last resort people can be fined \u00a3200, reduced to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days.\nAnother change, which has already come into effect, requires all contacts of suspected Omicron cases to self-isolate for 10 days, even if they are fully vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid booster jabs will be offered to everyone in England who is eligible by the end of January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nMr Johnson said the government would be \"throwing everything\" at the campaign so everyone can get a third jab.\nPeople will be invited to book a booster three months after their second vaccine dose.\nThe rollout was expanded in response to the emerging Omicron variant, which could be more infectious than Delta.\nA total of 22 cases of the new variant have so far been confirmed in the UK - 13 in England and nine cases in Scotland linked to a single event.\nThe prime minister said booster doses will be given at 1,500 community pharmacy sites and extra hospital hubs in England.\nHe added 400 military personnel will be on hand to help the NHS alongside \"the fantastic jabs army of volunteers\".\n\"There'll be temporary vaccination centres popping up like Christmas trees,\" he told a Downing Street press conference. \nEarlier, Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency - the body which replaced Public Health England - suggested people should limit unnecessary socialising in the run-up to Christmas, saying: \"If we all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the variant at bay\".\nBut the prime minister disagreed, saying government guidance remains the same - but that people should \"take sensible precautions\" like washing hands and wearing masks.\nAsked whether people should cancel Christmas parties and nativity plays, Mr Johnson said: \"We don't want people to cancel such events, and we think that overwhelmingly the best thing for kids is to be in schools.\"\nHe said instead, they were taking a \"balanced and proportionate\" approach, and while he thought it extremely unlikely that another lockdown would be required, he was ruling nothing out.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said getting vaccinated would \"give ourselves the best chance of a Christmas with our loved ones\".\nAlmost 18 million people in the UK have already had a booster jab. A further 14 million more adults have now become eligible for one in England alone, Mr Johnson said.\nOn Monday, the government's vaccines advisers said boosters would be offered to all over-18s in the UK with the minimum gap between the second dose and booster reduced from six to three months.\nMr Johnson urged people to wait to be contacted by the health service before booking their booster, saying: \"Even if you have had your second jab over three months ago and you are now eligible, please don't try and book until the NHS says it is your turn.\"\nJabs will be prioritised according to age, with the NHS working down the list in five-year bands as before, he said.\nAs well as expanding the booster jabs programme, the government has strengthened other Covid rules in response to concern over the new variant.\nFace coverings are once again compulsory in places like shops and on public transport in England, and contacts of suspected Omicron cases are now required to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status. \nAnd as of Tuesday morning, anyone coming to the UK must self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test, taken within 48 hours of arrival.\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the measures, but said he had written to the prime minister urging him to \"go further\" by introducing \"vital\" testing for everyone before they travel.\nHe said: \"They need urgently to put that additional measure in place... a PCR test is not a substitute for a pre-departure test.\"\nThe end of January target is ambitious, but certainly achievable. \nCrucially there is plentiful supply of vaccines - the challenge is increasing the rate at which the NHS can give jabs.\nCurrently just over two million booster doses a week are being given in England. At that rate it would take until the start of spring to vaccinate all eligible adults.\nThe PM can only set these targets for England but ministers in devolved nations have also committed to ramping up boosters\nThe challenge therefore is to get up to the levels of vaccination seen in the spring when around four million doses a week were being administered.\nSome of the infrastructure that was in place in those early days has been dismantled. Many GPs and their teams have returned to their day jobs. A third of the mass vaccination centres have closed.\nPharmacies have stepped in to offer more jabs, but they are constrained in how many they can do by lack of staff.\nExtra support for them will be vital. So will the hospital vaccination sites - there's more than 200 of them but only 30 currently vaccinate members of the public.\nNHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said she was aiming to free up capacity to allow hospitals, GP surgeries and pharmacies to give more booster jabs.\nShe said NHS staff were working at \"breakneck speed\" to expand the vaccine programme, which was already at its \"most complex phase\" and now faced the biggest change to eligibility so far.\nNorthern Ireland has announced extra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Scotland and Wales have said their booster programmes will be ramped up, but are yet to lay out the full details.\nA further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday, while another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,NHS Lanarkshire,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All nine cases of the Omicron variant of Covid in Scotland are linked to a single event, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nShe told MSPs that those affected had been tested on or around 23 November and had been self-isolating since then.\nShe said the cases all traced back to a \"single private event\" on 20 November.\nMs Sturgeon added: \"We fully expect that there will be more cases identified over the coming days that are also linked to this event.\"\nA total of 22 cases of the new variant have so far been confirmed in the UK.\nFive of the nine Scottish cases are in Lanarkshire and four are in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area.\nMs Sturgeon said the lack of any known travel or overseas connection to the cases suggested there was community transmission of the variant in Scotland.\n\"However, the fact that all known cases are so far linked to a single event suggests that this may still be limited,\" she said.\n\"Indeed, there is so far nothing in the wider look back exercise that Public Health Scotland has undertaken to suggest that community transmission of the new variant is either sustained or widespread.\"\nWhile any possible links with the COP26 climate summit were being investigated, the timing meant this was \"improbable\".\nNicola Sturgeon has promised to put in place the expanded booster programme recommended by the JCVI as soon as possible. \nWhat she has not said is exactly who will become eligible, when. We know that priority will be decided by age and risk but the details are still being worked out. \nThe first minister has made clear more staff and facilities will be needed, without explaining how this will be achieved. \nBy contrast, the NHS chief in England, Amanda Pritchard, has just announced a big recruitment plan for new vaccinators.\nBoris Johnson has also committed to offering booster jabs to all adults in England by the end of January 2022.\nIt may be the Scottish government will match that, but opposition parties are concerned about what they consider to be a lack of urgency.\nScotland is currently the most vaccinated part of the UK and no-one at Holyrood would want the NHS here to fall behind the pace with booster jabs. \nThe first minister said it was \"highly likely - indeed almost certain\" that more Omicron cases would emerge.\n\"However, the enhanced surveillance gives us the best possible chance of identifying cases quickly and, through isolation of index cases and close contacts and targeted testing, of then breaking transmission chains and containing spread while we learn more about the variant.\n\"And this is key. While so much about this new variant is so far unknown, it is important that we act on a highly precautionary basis.\"\nMs Sturgeon said that, rather than introducing new restrictions, the Scottish government was asking people to \"significantly step up and increase compliance\" with existing protections.\nThese include the wearing of face coverings, hygiene, home working, ventilation, vaccination and regular testing.\nNew travel restrictions have been introduced across the UK, under which all overseas travellers must take a PCR test on, or before, the second day of their arrival.\nMs Sturgeon said the Scottish government was advising that this should take place on the second day.\nThe vaccination programme is being expanded, with boosters being offered to all over-18s and the wait after a second dose cut from six to three months.\nChildren aged 12 to 15 will also now be invited for a second jab and severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth dose of the vaccine.\nMs Sturgeon said one million additional Scots were now eligible for booster jabs and that information would be provided as soon as possible for those who had now become eligible.\nIn addition, 16 and 17-year-olds are now able to book an appointment for their second dose online.\nJust how far to go is a tough decision for policymakers as they wait for the evidence on Omicron to emerge.\nThe latest data shows that case numbers in Scotland are actually falling and hospital admissions are down, particularly in older age groups who are most likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid.\nOn one hand this is all early evidence that booster jabs are working well against the dominant Delta variant - but on the other, we face a new unknown. \nAdditional rules around travel, enhanced testing and a reminder to comply with current rules may be enough, but some health experts think we need to do more now because it is better to take preventative steps and try to control spread, rather than risk a significant new wave.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there had been \"a glaring lack of urgency\" from the Scottish government.\n\"When two million Scots are waiting for a Covid jag, it's difficult to understand why the government is not doing everything possible to boost the rollout by backing our call for mass vaccination centres to be reopened,\" he said. \nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar asked Ms Sturgeon whether Scotland would reintroduce vaccine drop-in centres.\nThe first minister said there was no lack of urgency, and that there were ongoing discussions about the most appropriate ways to accelerate the vaccination programme.\nShe added that there had been no shortage of staff to deliver the rollout which had initially been planned, but that more staff and facilities would now be needed to speed up the process following the JCVI's new advice.\nMs Sturgeon said that process was under way and that the government would work with health boards to ensure it happened as quickly as possible.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has promised that boosters will be offered to everyone in England who is eligible by the end of January.\nThe Scottish government's clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme that a target had not yet been set for Scotland.\nHe said things would be \"slightly different\" north of the border, but officials were still \"crunching the numbers\".\nProf Leitch said there were only limited drop-in facilities because they wanted to control the age bands.\n\"We don't want 18-and-a-half-year-olds to get their vaccine before 49-year-olds. We want to do it in an ordered way in chunks of age groups,\" he said.\n\"That is how we have done it up to this point and that is why we are the most vaccinated part of the UK.\""

      "text": "Thousands of people have spent a fourth night without power in the wake of Storm Arwen.\nThe north-east of Scotland remains the worst hit, with police declaring a major incident in the area due the widespread disruption.\nAreas of Moray, Angus, Perthshire, Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders are also affected. \nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said the complexity of the recovery \"cannot be underestimated\".\nEnergy provider SSEN said the storm had caused \"catastrophic damage\", three times greater than that caused by the Beast from the East in 2018. \nIt said on Monday evening that power had been restored to 103,000 customers, but 17,000 remained without. \nAbout 9,500 homes in Killin, Perthshire, and Alford and Aboyne in Aberdeenshire had been reconnected on Monday morning. \nA further 7,000 properties in Braemar, Ballater, Torphins, Comrie and other areas were reconnected throughout the day.\nHowever SSEN warned that some places would not see power restored before Tuesday - and some localised faults would take even longer to repair. \nIt advised customers in this situation to make alternative arrangements if possible.  \nRest centres were set up and hot food and drinks are being supplied to people, many of whom have been without electricity since Friday afternoon. \nAberdeenshire Council chief executive Jim Savege told the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland it had been a \"pretty tough\" time for the area.\nHe said schools would be closed on Monday and Tuesday and they would be checked for storm damage. Vaccination clinics in Aberdeenshire were also cancelled on Monday. \nThe Scottish government's resilience room, chaired by the deputy first minister, met on Monday afternoon. Mr Swinney urged people in need of support to contact their local council.\nHe said: \"It is good to see that some progress is being made across the country as power is restored.\n\"While we are hopeful for a further recovery as soon as possible, the scale and complexity of the situation cannot be underestimated.\n\"Many people are still without power and water, and that's why local authorities and partners are stepping up welfare support in affected areas for those who need it.\"\nOn Monday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with those still facing disruption. \nHe added: \"The situation in the north-east of Scotland is among the most concerning and, while forecasts are improving, we are on standby to provide further assistance to the Scottish government.\"\nMark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said: \"Storm Arwen has resulted in some of the most significant and challenging conditions experienced in the north of Scotland in decades, resulting in catastrophic damage to several overhead circuits with multiple instances of damage which need to be repaired before power can be restored.\n\"The damage caused by Storm Arwen is at least three times greater than we experienced from the Beast from the East storm in 2018, demonstrating the scale of challenge our teams have faced.\"\nSSEN has been working to restore power in the following locations:\nElsewhere, SP Energy Networks - which covers central and southern Scotland - said on Monday afternoon that it still had about 4,500 homes without supplies.\nThe areas most badly hit are in the Borders, Dumfriesshire, Fife and the Lothians.\nIt said the damage to the network was some of the worst it had experienced in more than 15 years and apologised to anyone affected.\nThe company added it would be offering accommodation to vulnerable customers if it could not restore supplies overnight.\nA number of schools in Dumfries and Galloway have been shut due to heating or power failures. They are all expected to reopen on Tuesday.\nScottish Borders Council has set up drop-in centres to provide soup, meals and hot drinks in Duns, Innerleithen, Hawick and Earlston.\nScottish Water said it was continuing work to restore water supplies to customers across several areas in Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perth, where about 1,500 properties remained without.\nThe main areas were Aberchirder, Lumsden, Rhynie, Lumphanan, Torphins, Fortingall and Fearnan.\nNetwork Rail Scotland said signalling issues been restored on the East Coast Mainline and it was working with operators to reintroduce impacted services.\nMeanwhile, hundreds of seal pups were killed at a nature reserve in the Scottish Borders during Storm Arwen.\nThe National Trust for Scotland (NTS) - which operates the site at St Abb's Head - said there were 224 dead pups in the water at a bay at Pettico Wick, with more washing ashore. \nForestry and Land Scotland has urged people not to visit its forests until checks for the level of damage and safety assessments have been carried out.\nIn the Aberdeenshire village of Kemnay a local caf\u00e9 took hot drinks, soup and mince pies to a nearby care home.\n\"The power's been off since four o'clock on Friday,\" said Andy Hutcheon, manager of Cafe 83.\n\"Many of the care home residents are our customers and they've been huddled in the reception trying to stay warm. They were delighted to see us.\" \nThe caf\u00e9 also set up a barbeque outside for any other locals who needed a drink or food.\n\"There's no heating and no-one has a phone signal - so it's been pretty dire,\" he added.\nAcross the UK, three men were killed by falling trees during the storm, which triggered the Met Office's highest red level storm warning. \nThe 35-year-old driver of a pick-up truck was fatally injured on Friday afternoon in Aberdeenshire.\nHave you been experiencing a power cut since Storm Arwen?

      "tags": "Human rights,Prisons,Polmont",
      "text": "Every death in prison custody should have an independent investigation completed within months of it happening, a new report has said. \nThe Scottish government ordered the review two years ago after the deaths of four prisoners in just four days.\nThe independent review said the families of people who died should be involved at every stage and a written report should be made on each death.\nIt said data must be studied so lessons can be learned to prevent more deaths.\nThe Scottish government has accepted in principle all of the review's recommendations, saying that a new, independent investigation of every death would complement the current inquiry processes, including Fatal Accident Inquiries. \nAdopting this recommendation will bring Scotland in line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe review report said Scotland had one of the highest rates of deaths in prison in Europe and said there needed to be systemic changes to the response to these deaths.\nThe report followed a recent Glasgow University study which showed that Fatal Accident Inquiries (FAIs) into deaths in custody were often starting three or four years after the incident.\nIt said that in nine out 10 cases there was no finding of a reasonable precaution and no recommendations to improve practice or prevent death.\nThe Independent Review into the Response to Deaths in Prison Custody said there was \"a noticeable lack of family engagement\" at every step on the journey.\nIt called for a \"more humane, compassionate, rights-based response to the loss of life in Scotland's prisons\". \nLinda Allan, whose daughter Katie died in Polmont Young Offenders Institute in 2018, has previously told the BBC she was \"flabbergasted\" to discover the number of \"preventable\" deaths in custody, especially among young people.\nMs Allan is still waiting for the FAI into her daughter's death.\nKatie took her own life after being sentenced for drink-driving and knocking a 15-year-old boy unconscious.\nLawyer Aamer Anwar issued a statement on behalf of Katie's family and the family of William Lindsay, a 16-year-old who killed himself in Polmont Young offenders' Institution in 2018.\nIt said the review findings were a \"damning indictment\" of the Scottish Prison Service. \n\"For the last three years the families we represent have decried a prison system in crisis that has directly led to deaths. For far too long the SPS has known that no matter how catastrophic their failure in duty of care to prisoners, they will never face justice,\" it added. \nHe said the Scottish government had, to date, failed to hold the SPS to account.\nStewart and Liz Taylor's son Maxwell took his own life at HMP Edinburgh in February 2016, just a few weeks before his 33rd birthday. He was on remand, charged with possession of a knife. \nMaxwell was a drug user and had been in and out of prison for many years.\nMr and Mrs Taylor told BBC Scotland Maxwell was a \"loveable rascal\".\nMrs Taylor said: \"He was the most devilish lovely child - he really was - but as he progressed he became more and more out of control.\"\nThe parents were estranged from Maxwell when he died. A police officer who they knew came to tell them the news and they say they had almost no contact from the prison.\nAn FAI was held into Maxwell's death two-and-a-half-years after his death.\nMr Taylor said: \"We found out four years down the line that there had been a memorial service in Saughton for Maxwell the week after he died, and we knew nothing about it.\"\nHis wife added: \"We are not talking about why somebody is in prison, we are talking about the fact a family member has died and the families need to be included in any process that comes from that death.\"\nThe report into deaths in custody said Scotland had one of the highest imprisonment rates in Northern Europe and one of the highest mortality rates.\nIt also said deaths in prison had been rising over the past five years. Between 2016 and 2019, the average was 32.5 deaths per year.\nThe largest cause of death was by natural causes because of the ageing prison population.\nHowever, the report said self\u2011inflicted death had long been a cause for concern and suicide was the leading cause of death of people under 21.\nThe review was co-chaired by Wendy Sinclair-Gieben, chief inspector of Her Majesty's Prisons in Scotland, Prof Nancy Loucks, chief executive of Families Outside, and Judith Robertson, who chairs the Scottish Human Rights Commission.\nIts other recommendations include: \n\"It is now incumbent on all of those with responsibilities to uphold human rights to take action to implement these recommendations,\" the report said. \nSpeaking in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday, Justice Secretary Keith Brown thanked those who put the report together. He also thanked the families involved in the review. \nHe said: \"Their willingness to revisit the grief they experienced and the insights gained through their participation has made this important work possible.\n\"We accept in principle the review's recommendations and will very carefully consider the detail of these and take forward, as a matter of priority, improvements with key partners that will effect change to improve the ways that deaths of loved ones in prison custody are experienced by bereaved families.\n\"This includes the key recommendation of an independent body separately examining every death in custody.\n\"We are committed to making improvements to the response to, and experiences of, families impacted by a death in custody.\""

      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the Omicron coronavirus variant poses a high risk of infection surges around the globe. \nThe variant could lead to severe consequences in some regions, the WHO said on Monday. \nThe head of the organisation, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, renewed a call for a global push to get vaccines to poorer nations. \nCovid-19 is \"not done with us\" yet he warned.\nThe variant was detected in South Africa earlier this month with initial evidence suggesting it has a higher re-infection risk. South Africa has been praised for its prompt reporting of the variant. \n\"Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,\" the WHO said.\nSpeaking on Monday, Dr Tedros said scientists around the world are working to discover if the new variant is associated with higher transmission, risk of reinfection and how it reacts to vaccines.\n\"Omicron's very emergence is another reminder that although many of us think we are done with Covid-19, it is not done with us,\" he said. \nHe added that no deaths have been linked to the new variant yet. \nCases have already been reported in a number of countries including Canada, the UK, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands. \nThe new variant has prompted the UK, EU and US to issue a travel ban on Southern African countries - a decision criticised by South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa.\nJapan has announced it is closing its borders to new foreign visitors from midnight on Tuesday, while Australia has paused its long-awaited plan to ease border restrictions. \nTravel into Australia for international students and \"skilled workers\" holding visas was meant to re-start on Wednesday but has now been delayed until 15 December. \nIsrael has also banned foreigners from entering the country. \nIn the UK, Covid booster jabs are set to be offered to all over-18s to help stop a new wave driven by Omicron. \nThe US has also followed suit with Joe Biden telling Americans to \"go get your booster\". He also urged people to wear masks indoors. \nBut Mr Biden also said he did not anticipate any further US travel restrictions or lockdowns at this time. \nThere have been more than 261 million cases and five million deaths around the globe since the pandemic started in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

      "tags": "Afghanistan,China,MI6",
      "text": "MI6 chief Richard Moore has warned of China's \"debt traps and data traps\" in his first live broadcast interview.\nMr Moore - known as \"C\" - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme these traps threatened to erode sovereignty and have prompted defensive measures.\nHe denied the fall of Afghan capital Kabul was an intelligence failure and signalled closer ties with tech giants.\nThe decision to speak more openly about his work was important in a modern democracy, the ex-secret agent said.\nIn a wide-ranging interview before he gave his first major public speech since taking on the role as head of MI6, Mr Moore:\nSpeaking about the threat posed by China, Mr Moore described its use of \"debt traps and data traps\".\nHe said Beijing is \"trying to use influence through its economic policies to try and sometimes, I think, get people on the hook\".\nExplaining the \"data trap\", he said: \"If you allow another country to gain access to really critical data about your society, over time that will erode your sovereignty, you no longer have control over that data.\n\"That's something which, I think, in the UK we are very alive to and we've taken measures to defend against.\" \nSpeaking later at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, Mr Moore said China was now \"the single greatest priority\" for his agency and warned that a \"miscalculation\" by an over-confident regime in Beijing over an issue like Taiwan could pose a \"serious challenge\" to global peace.\nHe also said it was essential for Western countries to stand up to the \"full spectrum\" of threats from Moscow - from state-sanctioned attacks, such as the Salisbury poisoning, to using political proxies to undermine stability in the Balkans.\nThe assessment of the speed at which the Taliban would seize control of Kabul as British and American troops withdrew from Afghanistan was \"clearly wrong\", Mr Moore admitted on the Today programme.\nBut he said it was \"really overblown to describe it in terms of intelligence failure\". \"None of us predicted the speed of the fall of Kabul,\" he said.\n\"Frankly, if we had recruited every member of the Taliban Shura, you know, the leadership group of the Taliban, [if] we recruited every one of them as a secret agent, we still wouldn't have predicted the fall of Kabul because the Taliban didn't.\"\nHowever, he added that there is no \"soft soaping\" that the victory of the Taliban had been a \"serious reverse\" and he is concerned it will be a \"morale boost for extremists around the world, and indeed for those sitting in the capitals in Beijing, Tehran, and Moscow\".\nMI6 chiefs used to do what they could to avoid the spotlight, preferring their names were only known by a select few. But now they know that a public face is part of the job. \nThe current chief is even active on Twitter, something some of his staff found a touch uncomfortable at first and now he has appeared live on the BBC. \nThe reason is that spy chiefs know they need public support - partly as they want to be seen to be accountable and know the public are less trusting of secrecy than in the past. \nBut they also want to use the publicity to help recruit the best staff to their ranks and gain the support of businesses and others to help in their mission. \nThey hope they can do this while maintaining secrecy about some parts of their work - for MI6 that means the identity of those who provide them with information.\nMr Moore described Russia as an \"acute threat\" and said Russian President Vladimir Putin has been clear that he does not recognise Ukraine's right to be an independent state.\n\"From time to time we get sort of crises around Ukraine as we worry about build-up of troops and what President Putin's intentions might be,\" he said. \n\"Therefore it bears very careful watching and it bears very careful signalling to the Russians about, you know, the price that they would have to pay if they intervened, as they did in 2014.\"\nHe said there was not \"an adversarial sort of agenda here\", adding: \"We're not trying to encircle Russia, we're not trying to prevent it from pursuing its legitimate interest.\"\nLooking ahead to the future of the Secret Intelligence Service, Mr Moore said he wanted to \"partner in a different way\" with the UK's technology industry to help its real-life \"Q labs\" stay ahead.\nBut he said the service would always uphold UK laws around privacy and data.\nMr Moore also revealed the significance of the green ink used by those in his role - which came from a tradition started by Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming, the first head of MI6, or \"C\".\nHe said the green ink means those working in the service know any directive has been signed by him. \"The same is true of my typescript on my computer,\" he added.

      "title": "Covid-19: Vaccination booster clinics open across NI",
      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A series of Covid-19 vaccination clinics have opened to help meet demand for booster doses. \nOn Monday, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended booster jabs be offered to over-18s.  \nThe clinics, at this stage, are offering boosters to the over 50s, as well as first and second doses to anyone eligible of any age.\nNorthern Ireland has had the lowest uptake of the booster shot in the UK.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the aim was to give boosters to all eligible age groups \"as quickly as possible\".\nHe urged the public not to be \"put off getting their first, second or booster doses due to concerns or speculation about the Omicron variant\".\nA number of cases of the new variant have already been detected in both England and Scotland.\nThe health minister said it was \"very likely that vaccination will continue to protect against severe illness from Omicron as it does against other variants of SARS-CoV-2\".\n\"In addition, our vaccines provide very good protection against the Delta variant, which remains the predominant strain in Northern Ireland at this point,\" he added.\nBookings for the vaccination clinics can be made here.\nThe JCVI also said the minimum gap between the second vaccine dose and booster should be reduced from six to three months.\nThe experts also said children aged 12-15 should be invited for a second jab.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health reported two further Covid-19-related deaths in Northern Ireland, and 1,585 new cases.\nIf aged over 50\nIf aged 40 to 49\nIf aged 18 to 39\nThe new vaccination hubs and clinics will operate alongside the ongoing vaccination work of GPs and local pharmacies.\nThe pharmacy sector is finalising plans for a special weekend of additional walk-in booster vaccination clinics this Saturday and Sunday.\nTrust centres are also providing ongoing first and second doses for all eligible age groups.\nDr Alan Stout, from the British Medical Association, said encouraging people to get their first dose is just as important as the booster jab roll-out.\n\"It's not because we're anxious that the effect of the vaccine is dipping any quicker,\" he added.\n\"It's to make sure that we don't get that dip in the middle of what's going to be a very difficult winter.\"\nEveryone over the age of 18 is being invited to come forward and get a booster jab, but this is a staged process, depending on age and other criteria.\nThat means you will have to wait your turn to receive the booster vaccine, you can't turn up at a clinic any time.\nThe advice is to go to the NI Direct website or to your local health trust website where you can find out where you can get the booster jab.\nIn terms of a fourth dose of the vaccine being offered to those who are immunosuppressed, the aim is to protect them from the virus even further.\nProf Martin McKee, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said if three doses were to cut the risk of contracting Covid-19 by 93%, then another dose would provide even more protection.\nWith members of the public still coming forward for their first and second doses of the vaccine, public health messaging is ongoing to encourage as many people as possible to get jabbed.\nPatricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, thanked those who had come forward to help with the vaccination programme over the last year, and asked that they do so once again.\n\"Providing vaccines for the unvaccinated is still a high priority,\" she added.\n\"We're working through children and encouraging anyone not vaccinated to come forward.\n\"But if you are the eligible age, and you have the right amount of time between your second and booster dose, you can book or walk right in.\"\nThe Covid-19 certification system which came into effect on Monday may have also had an impact on vaccine uptake.\n\"It's hard to know what exactly is working but we have definitely have seen a greater uptake in the over 18s,\" said Patricia Donnelly.\n\"The stories we're getting from the vaccination centres, and from GPs and pharmacists, is that a surprising number of older people are only coming forward now that have held back and been frightened up until now.\"\nMs Donnelly said it was unlikely that the under 40s would be able to get a booster jab before Christmas. \nMore than 3,000,000 Covid vaccinations have been delivered in Northern Ireland in the past year.\nMeanwhile, there have been no confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 detected in Northern Ireland, according to the deputy chief medical officer.\nDr Lourda Geoghegan told BBC News NI it was possible that cases could emerge \"in the coming days and weeks\".\nShe said there was \"some cause for concern\" about the new variant compared to other variants \"given the amount of mutations or the changes in the genetic make-up of the virus, particularly around the spike protein\".\nHowever, studies continue into the transmissibility of Omicron and whether it is a more severe form of the virus, Dr Geoghegan said on BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \nHer comments follow a warning from Health Minister Robin Swann on Monday that the variant may already be present in Northern Ireland after a number of cases were found in England and Scotland.\nMr Swann said it was \"not a time for panic or despair\" and it was \"very likely that vaccination will continue to protect against severe illness from Omicron as it does against other variants\"."

      "text": "Electricity companies have been accused of taking too long to restore supplies after Storm Arwen caused outages across the north of England.\nMore than 20,000 households had a fourth night without power and some said finding information was difficult.\nOne resident, from Blanchland in Northumberland, said \"nobody can get through to Northern Powergrid and the situation is getting desperate\". \nJim Cardwell from the firm said he was \"sorry for the disruption\".\n\"There are significant areas where we've got large sections of our overhead lines that carry our power to people that need to be rebuilt in order to return supplies to normal,\" he said.\nNorthern Powergrid added it had restored power to 90% of its customers.\nMeanwhile damage across Cumbria is \"so widespread\" some properties may be without power \"for a few more days,\" the council said, with about 6,500 in the county currently affected.\nIt said Electricity North West (ENW) was mobilising teams \"around the clock\" to repair the network and restore power.\nIt comes as the Environment Agency is set to announce flood alerts in several parts, and a more serious Flood Warning for the Ulverston area. \nA number of community hubs have been set up to offer support.\nIndra Rampersad van Boeckel from Ford in Berwick has been without power since Friday evening and saw her shed crushed by a neighbouring tree.\n\"It's heart breaking really... it's not easy even making a cup of tea on a stove,\" the 42-year-old dentist said.\n\"The house is just a mess... We have burned our full stash of candles and had to get lots of extra supplies.\n\"(When) the power goes off, that's a different league.\"\nSimon Lisney, from Craghead, County Durham, said his power had been off since Friday and he had spent four hours on hold to Northern Powergrid on Sunday before the line dropped.\n\"There's no communication,\" he said.\n\"You go on to their Facebook page, their Twitter page - they don't respond. You try and phone and the calls are dropping.\n\"There's been no foresight. The Beast from the East was bad but power didn't go off for four or five days.\"\nNorthern Powergrid said engineers were installing temporary fixes and using generators, and had been able to deploy helicopters to survey damage since winds had died down. \nAbout 17,000 homes in the North East, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire are still without power, and about 3,000 in the Electricity North West area.\nSome customers may be without a connection until Friday, the firms said.\nENW said the storm had been \"absolutely devastating\" with 800 incidents reported and just under 98,000 properties affected.\nIncident manager Stephanie Trubshaw said the damage was \"some of the worst we have ever seen\".\nMore than 60,000 people had called ENW for information and the firm had contacted 6,000 vulnerable customers on its priority register, Ms Trubshaw said.\nSome customers would remain without power for \"a few more days\", she added.\nThe firm has received complaints about the delay in restoring supplies alongside claims attempts to contact the company have gone unanswered.\nResponding to updates on ENW's Facebook page, one customer said it was \"abuse\" to be left without power.\n\"You cannot leave people in this state during freezing temperatures,\" they said.\nAnother complained that they had been told their postcode was being dealt with on Monday night and then, on Tuesday morning, that it had been reconnected three days ago, although it was still off.\nJayme Yates-Bell, from Kendal, has diabetes and kidney failure and said the situation was \"getting really challenging\".\n\"We need to know how long we're going to be like this,\" she said.\n\"I've got a fridge with my medicine in that's now probably useless.\"\nThousands of people in Scotland have also spent a fourth night without power, with the north east of the country remaining the worst hit, with police declaring a major incident in the area due the widespread disruption.\nMr Cardwell said Northern Powergrid had been dealing with an \"unprecedented level of calls\".\n\"We're sorry if customers have struggled to get hold of us,\" he said.\n\"We try our very best to deal with high volumes [of calls] but there have been places and times where customers have been let down.\"  \nThe company had rung those still without power on Monday to understand their circumstances, Mr Cardwell said.\nHe urged anyone who had not been contacted, especially if they had needs which made them more vulnerable, to \"do your best to get in touch\".\nRichard O'Connor, from Blanchland, said the village had been without heating, power or internet since Friday night.\n\"Nobody can get through to Northern Powergrid and the situation is getting desperate,\" he said.\n\"People are cold and now going low on food. We need help.\"\nNorthumberland farmer Simon Bainbridge said it was time \"to get the Army in\".\n\"Get that logistics in, get people some hot food, get people some water and just try and get some of these villages back up on their feet,\" he said.\n\"People are just cold and they're miserable and they've got no water and it's just not good.\" \nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nBooster jabs will be offered to everyone who is eligible in England by the end of January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. They will be prioritised according to age, with the NHS working down the list in five-year bands. All UK adults will be offered a booster jab three months after their second dose of a Covid vaccine. Mr Johnson said England will have more than 1,500 community pharmacy sites and around 400 military personnel to help with the rollout. \nCases of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 were present in the Netherlands earlier than previously thought, Dutch officials have said. The strain was identified in two test samples between 19 and 23 November, before it was first reported by South Africa. It is not clear whether the people who were tested had visited southern Africa. Previously it was thought that two flights from South Africa had brought the first cases of the variant on Sunday.\nAll nine cases of Omicron in Scotland are linked to a \"single private event\" on 20 November, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. She told the Scottish Parliament that all those affected had been tested on or around 23 November and had been self-isolating since then. Ms Sturgeon added the lack of any known travel or overseas connection to the cases suggested there was community transmission of the variant in Scotland and she expects more cases linked to the event to be found in the coming days.\nStock markets around the world have fallen after the boss of pharmaceutical company Moderna cast doubts on the effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron. Stephane Bancel told the Financial Times he thought there would be a \"material drop\" in vaccine efficacy and predicted it would take months to update them. Share price drops were seen in stock markets in the US, across Europe and in Asia over the course of Tuesday.\nFalling numbers of vets combined with a growing number of animals to treat since the pandemic began has led to an urgent meeting by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. An award-winning vet from Wales has told the BBC there are \"more patients than we've ever seen\" following the boom in pet-ownership, while the number of new vets is plummeting. Fewer European vets coming to Britain, more vets leaving to work abroad and others leaving the profession are all factors the urgent meeting have been told were responsible for the 700 people fewer becoming vets compared to 2019.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nHere is an explainer on what exactly has changed with the Covid rules in the UK.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Can he do everything possible to ensure they are reconnected well before Christmas?\"\nMr Kwarteng said he would be looking at the issue on a \"daily basis\", adding: \"Being without power until Christmas is simply unacceptable, I'll say that publicly, and I'll do everything I can to make sure that that doesn't happen.\" \nJayme Yates-Bell, from Kendal, has diabetes and kidney failure and said the situation she faced was \"really challenging\".\n\"We need to know how long we're going to be like this,\" she said.\n\"I've got a fridge with my medicine in that's now probably useless.\"\nA spokesperson for the ENA said: \"Supporting and reconnecting customers is our absolute priority and our customer teams are working around the clock to contact customers and keep them informed.\"\nNorthern Powergrid said customers would be eligible for compensation. \nA payment of \u00a370 per household had been set for the first 24 hours of power loss or 48 if conditions had been severe, as well as \u00a370 for every additional 12-hour period without power.\nHowever, payouts are capped at \u00a3700. \nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "The father of the youngest victim of the Manchester Arena attack has said that the response to the bombing was \"shameful\" and \"inadequate\".\nSaffie-Rose Roussos, eight, was among 22 people killed in the 2017 bombing.\nHer dad Andrew Roussos told the inquiry into the blast he had never heard \"so many excuses\".\n\"That poor little girl hung in there for someone to come and help her. What she got was a bloody advertising board and untrained people,\" he said.\nHundreds of people were also injured when bomber Salman Abedi detonated a homemade explosive at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May that year. \nMr Roussos said: \"I see myself as an uneducated clever man. But in a room full of clever people I have never heard so many excuses, so much justification that the response on 22 May was somewhat acceptable.\n\"The response on that night was shameful and inadequate. The people that excuse it should feel shame.\n\"The response of the security services should go down in history as one of the worst failures from start to finish and that's what we should learn from this.\"\nSaffie's mother Lisa Roussos, who was severely injured in the attack, told the inquiry she was unable to move in the moments after the bombing.\n\"I can remember just thinking: 'Just stay awake. Help will come soon, just stay where you are. Just stay awake there's going to be help on the way',\" she said.\n\"It felt like hours before anybody approached me, and they asked me my name. I was really breathless and all I managed to say was 'Saffie'.\"\nMrs Roussos said she wanted to thank \"those that tried to help Saffie that night and were with her\". \n\"And I also want to say to the professionals and MI5, this inquiry isn't about protecting your job, your reputation, or your uniform,\" she added.\n\"We understand the sheer panic and fear you were faced with that night but until you admit the failings how can there be a positive change?\"\nEarlier, the inquiry heard how Saffie, from Leyland in Lancashire, had \"the night of her life, singing, dancing and laughing\" with her mother and sister Ashlee.\nAfter the explosion, Saffie had been showing signs of consciousness and was asking for her mother. \nA member of the public, Paul Reid, stayed with her for 30 minutes, reassuring her and at times shouting to keep her awake.\nIn a statement to the inquiry, Marianne Gibson, from Emergency Training UK (ETUK) who was the initial first aider at the arena to tend to Saffie, said she thought she was already dead and so moved on to help other people. \nAnother ETUK first aider, Elizabeth Woodcock, later put a bandage on a large wound on her back.\nMr Reid, an off-duty nurse and a police officer were constantly reassuring Saffie and pleading with her to \"stay with us\", the inquiry was told.  \nA group of people carried Saffie out of the foyer on a makeshift stretcher made out of an advertising hoarding.\nAfter they flagged down a passing ambulance, she was put into the vehicle where she asked paramedics: \"Am I going to die?\"\nParamedic Gillian Yates said in a statement to the inquiry: \"If we had not picked up Saffie-Rose, I believe she would have died on the street. I feel we gave her the best chance of surviving.\"\nFellow paramedic Gemma Litter said as soon as she saw the extent of Saffie's injuries she \"knew we would lose her\". \nSaffie reached Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, where a trauma team was waiting, 52 minutes after the bombing but was pronounced dead at 23:40 GMT, over an hour after the blast.\nThe court has been told there was a disagreement among medical experts about whether she might have survived if her treatment had been different.\nThe inquiry, which will spend all this week considering Saffie's case, continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

He was a defenceless detainee. I just could not understand why he was being treated in the way he was being treated,\" he said.\n\"He was clearly distressed.

My mum would never have suggested I work in a prison.\"\nPressed on why he didn't report what he had seen, he said the process involved going to managers, yet managers had been involved in the abuse he witnessed. \nHe said there was a \"culture of silence\" among staff at Brook House, and a \"them and us\" relationship with detainees.\nLow staffing levels meant Brook House was \"not a fit and proper or humane place to hold detainees\", he added.\nOne evening, shocked at the mistreatment he witnessed - first as an assistant custody officer then a detention custody officer - he began to compose a resignation letter. \nHe then saw a BBC Panorama investigation into a G4S youth detention centre starting on the television.\n\"I was watching staff members who wore the same uniform as me abusing people in their care,\" he said. \n\"It reminded me of things I had witnessed in Brook House.\"\nHe stopped writing the letter and instead contacted Panorama.  \nHe was trained to be an undercover reporter by the BBC and spent a month secretly filming at Brook House.\nThe facility is not supposed to be run like a jail, but Mr Tulley said it was designed like a category B prison, with locked windows, doors which only open from the outside, and toilets within the sleeping area. \nG4S training recommended they be called \"rooms\", although Mr Tulley said they were generally called cells by officers. \nHe criticised the way he was told as a trainee to use inaccurate language when reporting incidents involving force. \nIn situations where an officer struck a detainee with a riot shield he was told this should be recorded as \"I placed the shield on the detainee\". \nWhen using a head or arm lock, the phrase recommended was \"I supported the detainee's head, or arm\". \nMr Tulley told the inquiry he didn't feel comfortable with this sort of language as his time at the centre went on.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "tags": "The Commonwealth,Barbados,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "Barbados has officially removed Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state and become the world's newest republic.\nIn an overnight ceremony in the capital, Bridgetown, Dame Sandra Mason was sworn in as president.\nThe Prince of Wales and Barbadian singer Rihanna attended the event, which coincided with the country's 55th anniversary of independence.\nIn a speech, Prince Charles acknowledged the \"appalling atrocity of slavery\" the Caribbean island suffered.\nThe new era for Barbados ends Britain's centuries of influence, including more than 200 years when the island was a hub for the transatlantic slave trade.\nTo signify the official change of power, a final salute was made to the British monarchy and the Royal Standard flag was lowered and replaced.\nSpeaking as the guest of honour at the event, Prince Charles reiterated the continuing ties between the two nations despite the constitutional status change. \nHe described the moment as a new beginning before being awarded the prestigious Order of Freedom of Barbados by the new president.\nThe Queen sent the country her \"warmest good wishes\" for \"happiness, peace and prosperity in the future\" and said the nation holds a \"special place\" in her heart. \nDame Sandra Mason, 72, the island's governor-general since 2018, was named as president-elect of the nation following a vote in parliament last month. She now replaces the Queen as the head of state.\n\"Vessel Republic Barbados has set sail on her maiden voyage. May she weather all storms and land our country and citizens safely on the horizons and shores which are ahead of us,\" she said after being sworn in.\nBarbados announced its plan to become a republic last year, but it will remain within the Commonwealth.\nFormerly known as the British Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Nations is a loose association of former British colonies and current dependencies, along with some countries that have no historical ties to Britain.\nLeading national figures, including Prime Minister Mia Mottley, swore allegiance to Barbados in front of the new president at the ceremony, which lasted for several hours.\nShe later announced that pop star Rihanna would be named a national hero by President Mason. The artist and businesswoman, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, was previously named an ambassador by her home country in 2018. \n\"May you continue to shine like a diamond and bring honour to your nation,\" Ms Mottley said, in reference to one of Rihanna's songs. \nIn the heat of a Barbados night, the handover ceremony has combined pomp and ceremony with one big party.\nIt has been a show of national pride with a sprinkling of this island's most famous names as VIP guests including the cricketer Sir Garfield Sobers and the singer Rihanna.\nIn between them both sat the Prince of Wales. It must have been a moment of mixed emotions for him - he took the final salute and watched the Royal Standard lowered for the last time as his mother was removed as head of state.\nHe used his speech to emphasise the pain of slavery and the enduring friendship of the two nations.\nThe mood music from the royal household has been positive and pragmatic.\nThey can't stop a constitutional shift but they can try to ensure positive relationships remain.\nThe country's prime minister has described the move to a republic as a \"seminal moment\" which will see Barbados fully leave its colonial past behind.\nIt was one of England's first slave colonies. English settlers first occupied the island in 1627 and, under British control, it became a sugar plantation economy using enslaved people brought in from Africa. \nSlavery was abolished in Barbados in 1834 and the country became fully independent in 1966.\nIn his speech on Tuesday, Prince Charles spoke of the \"appalling atrocity of slavery\" which he said \"forever stains our history\".\nBefore Barbados, the last nation to remove the Queen as head of state was Mauritius in 1992.\nWith a population of about 285,000 people, Barbados is one of the more populous and prosperous Caribbean islands.\nOnce heavily dependent on sugar exports, its economy has diversified but has been hit hard by Covid-19 hurting tourism and rising prices caused by supply chain disruptions."

It said: \"We hope Cinema & Co will comply with the court order and follow all of the Covid safety measures.\""

      "title": "Covid-19: Vaccination booster clinics open across NI",
      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A series of Covid-19 vaccination clinics have opened to help meet demand for booster doses. \nOn Monday, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended booster jabs be offered to over-18s.  \nThe clinics, at this stage, are offering boosters to the over 50s, as well as first and second doses to anyone eligible of any age.\nNorthern Ireland has had the lowest uptake of the booster shot in the UK.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the aim was to give boosters to all eligible age groups \"as quickly as possible\".\nHe urged the public not to be \"put off getting their first, second or booster doses due to concerns or speculation about the Omicron variant\".\nA number of cases of the new variant have already been detected in both England and Scotland.\nThe health minister said it was \"very likely that vaccination will continue to protect against severe illness from Omicron as it does against other variants of SARS-CoV-2\".\n\"In addition, our vaccines provide very good protection against the Delta variant, which remains the predominant strain in Northern Ireland at this point,\" he added.\nBookings for the vaccination clinics can be made here.\nThe JCVI also said the minimum gap between the second vaccine dose and booster should be reduced from six to three months.\nThe experts also said children aged 12-15 should be invited for a second jab.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health reported two further Covid-19-related deaths in Northern Ireland, and 1,585 new cases.\nIf aged over 50\nIf aged 40 to 49\nIf aged 18 to 39\nThe new vaccination hubs and clinics will operate alongside the ongoing vaccination work of GPs and local pharmacies.\nThe pharmacy sector is finalising plans for a special weekend of additional walk-in booster vaccination clinics this Saturday and Sunday.\nTrust centres are also providing ongoing first and second doses for all eligible age groups.\nDr Alan Stout, from the British Medical Association, said encouraging people to get their first dose is just as important as the booster jab roll-out.\n\"It's not because we're anxious that the effect of the vaccine is dipping any quicker,\" he added.\n\"It's to make sure that we don't get that dip in the middle of what's going to be a very difficult winter.\"\nEveryone over the age of 18 is being invited to come forward and get a booster jab, but this is a staged process, depending on age and other criteria.\nThat means you will have to wait your turn to receive the booster vaccine, you can't turn up at a clinic any time.\nThe advice is to go to the NI Direct website or to your local health trust website where you can find out where you can get the booster jab.\nIn terms of a fourth dose of the vaccine being offered to those who are immunosuppressed, the aim is to protect them from the virus even further.\nProf Martin McKee, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said if three doses were to cut the risk of contracting Covid-19 by 93%, then another dose would provide even more protection.\nWith members of the public still coming forward for their first and second doses of the vaccine, public health messaging is ongoing to encourage as many people as possible to get jabbed.\nPatricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, thanked those who had come forward to help with the vaccination programme over the last year, and asked that they do so once again.\n\"Providing vaccines for the unvaccinated is still a high priority,\" she added.\n\"We're working through children and encouraging anyone not vaccinated to come forward.\n\"But if you are the eligible age, and you have the right amount of time between your second and booster dose, you can book or walk right in.\"\nThe Covid-19 certification system which came into effect on Monday may have also had an impact on vaccine uptake.\n\"It's hard to know what exactly is working but we have definitely have seen a greater uptake in the over 18s,\" said Patricia Donnelly.\n\"The stories we're getting from the vaccination centres, and from GPs and pharmacists, is that a surprising number of older people are only coming forward now that have held back and been frightened up until now.\"\nMs Donnelly said it was unlikely that the under 40s would be able to get a booster jab before Christmas. \nMore than 3,000,000 Covid vaccinations have been delivered in Northern Ireland in the past year.\nMeanwhile, there have been no confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 detected in Northern Ireland, according to the deputy chief medical officer.\nDr Lourda Geoghegan told BBC News NI it was possible that cases could emerge \"in the coming days and weeks\".\nShe said there was \"some cause for concern\" about the new variant compared to other variants \"given the amount of mutations or the changes in the genetic make-up of the virus, particularly around the spike protein\".\nHowever, studies continue into the transmissibility of Omicron and whether it is a more severe form of the virus, Dr Geoghegan said on BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \nHer comments follow a warning from Health Minister Robin Swann on Monday that the variant may already be present in Northern Ireland after a number of cases were found in England and Scotland.\nMr Swann said it was \"not a time for panic or despair\" and it was \"very likely that vaccination will continue to protect against severe illness from Omicron as it does against other variants\"."

A fourth student - Justin Shilling, 17 - died on Wednesday.\nPolice allege the suspect, a pupil at the school, used a handgun that his father had bought on Friday.\nNo motive has yet been identified. A police update is expected on Wednesday.\nStudents have described hiding under desks during the attack. \nSome students had reportedly stayed at home on Tuesday because of safety concerns.\nPolice received the first emergency calls from the high school in the town of Oxford, about 40 miles (65km) from Detroit, at 12:51 local time (17:51GMT). \nWithin minutes, more than 100 calls had been placed to emergency services.\nOfficials say the suspect surrendered five minutes after police were called when officers confronted the teenager in a school corridor.\nNo shots were fired during the arrest, and the suspect was not injured, police said, adding that he was carrying a semi-automatic handgun that still contained seven rounds of ammunition at the time.\nThe precise sequence of events remains unclear, but police said they believed the youth had carried the weapon into school in a backpack, and had emerged from a bathroom brandishing the gun.\nThree students died in the attack: two girls, Madisyn Baldwin and Hana St Juliana, and Tate Myre, who died in a local deputy's car before the officer could get him to the hospital.\nMore than 32,000 people have signed an online petition to rename the school's stadium after Tate, who was one of Michigan's most promising young American footballers.\nTwo of the injured were undergoing surgery on Tuesday evening, while the other six were in a stable condition with gunshot wounds. A teacher whose shoulder had a graze wound had been discharged from hospital.\nOakland County Sheriff, Mike Bouchard, said that investigators were at a loss to explain what might have precipitated \"an unspeakable and unforgivable\" act of violence, adding that the suspect was not co-operating with authorities.\n\"The person that's got the most insight and the motive is not talking,\" he told reporters.\nThe boy had been told by his parents not to talk to police and officers were searching his home, police said.\nAll schools will be closed for the rest of the week and crisis support is being offered to students and parents. \n\"Of course I'm shocked. I'm devastated,\" said Oxford superintendent of schools Tim Throne. \nAccording to the Detroit Free Press newspaper, rumours had been circulating of a possible attack, and some students had decided not to attend classes on Tuesday.\nParent Jody Job told the paper that her son had skipped school because \"he felt like something was going to go down\".\nRobin Redding told the Associated Press that her son had also missed classes due to concerns about safety. \n\"He was not in school today,\" she said. \"He just said that 'Ma I don't feel comfortable. None of the kids that we go to school with are going today.'\"\nPolice cautioned against speculating on the safety concerns before the investigation is complete.\nPresident Joe Biden spoke about the shooting during a visit to Minneapolis, Minnesota. \n\"My heart goes out to the families enduring the unimaginable grief of losing a loved one,\" he said. \nUS shootings on school grounds have been ticking steadily upwards in recent years, according to pro gun-control group Everytown.\nAfter a brief dip last year during coronavirus lockdowns, the number of such attacks has rebounded with 138 incidents of gunfire on school grounds so far in 2021."

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "An Australian firm which claims to have a database of more than 10 billion facial images is facing a potential \u00a317m fine over its handling of personal data in the UK.\nThe Information Commissioner's Office said it had significant concerns about Clearview AI, whose facial recognition software is used by police forces.\nIt has told the firm to stop processing UK personal data and delete any it has. \nClearview said the regulator's claims were \"factually and legally incorrect\". \nThe company - which has been invited to make representations - said it was considering an appeal and \"further action\".\nIt has already been found to have broken Australian privacy law but is seeking a review of that ruling. \nClearview AI's system allows a user - for example, a police officer seeking to identify a suspect - to upload a photo of a face and find matches in a database of billions of images it has collected from the internet and social media.\nThe system then provides links to where matching images appeared online.\nThe firm has promoted its service to police as resembling a \"Google search for faces\".\nBut in a statement, the UK's Information Commissioner said that Clearview's database was likely to include \"a substantial number of people from the UK\" whose data may have been gathered without people's knowledge. \nThe firm's services are understood to have been trialled by a number of UK law enforcement agencies, but that was discontinued and Clearview AI does not have any UK customers. \nThe ICO said its \"preliminary view\" was that the firm appeared to have failed to comply with UK data protection laws by:\nThe UK Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: \"I have significant concerns that personal data was processed in a way that nobody in the UK will have expected.  \n\"UK data protection legislation does not stop the effective use of technology to fight crime. But to enjoy public trust and confidence in their products, technology providers must ensure people's legal protections are respected and complied with.\"  \nThe decision is provisional and the ICO said any representations by Clearview AI will be carefully considered before a final ruling is made in the middle of next year.\nHoan Ton-That, chief executive of Clearview AI, said: \"I am deeply disappointed that the UK Information Commissioner has misinterpreted my technology and intentions. \n\"My company and I have acted in the best interests of the UK and their people by assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors, and other victims of unscrupulous acts.... We collect only public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law.\" \nThere are some signs that big tech companies are growing wary of face recognition.\nEarlier in November, Facebook announced that it would no longer use facial recognition software to identify faces in photographs and videos.\nBut online tools, and search engines, using facial recognition technology continue to operate, privacy campaigners warn."
