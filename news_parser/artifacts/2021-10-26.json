      "tags": "Our Planet Now,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "A key pledge ahead of an upcoming climate change conference has still not been met and the money is not sure to be available before 2023.\nThe UK government has set out a new financing plan ahead of next week's climate change conference - COP26.\nIt talks of how developed countries hope to deliver $100bn a year in climate finance to developing countries. \nThe original aim was for that target to be reached by 2020.\nBut the financing plan said the target looked \"unlikely\" to be met but that it was \"confident\" the target would be hit by 2023.\nSome environmentalists say the new plan is too little, too late. \nCOP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma said: \"This plan recognises progress, based on strong new climate finance commitments. There is still further to go, but this delivery plan, alongside the robust methodological report from the OECD, provides clarity, transparency and accountability. \n\"It is a step towards rebuilding trust and gives developing countries more assurance of predictable support.\"\nClimate finance plays a critical role in helping developing countries tackle climate change and adapt to its impacts. \nIn 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilise $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020, and in 2015 agreed to extend this goal through to 2025.\nHowever, the UK COP26 Presidency now says the $100bn goal is likely to fall short in 2021 and 2022 - though is confident it will be met in 2023.\nMohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, said: \"To provide confidence and momentum going into COP26, the $100bn climate finance goal must be met immediately, not in 2023. \n\"The financing announcement is extremely disappointing in that it asks us as developing countries to wait even longer for the delivery of a promise that was first made more than a decade ago. I know the UK presidency has worked very hard for this, and I appreciate their efforts, but this is not sufficient to lay the groundwork for a successful outcome at COP26. \n\"Unless more progress is made in the next fortnight, we will all be in trouble. \"\nThe finance delivery plan was produced by Jonathan Wilkinson and Jochen Flasbarth, environment ministers from Canada and Germany, respectively, at the request of Mr Sharma.\nCanadian finance minister Jonathan Wilkinson was keen to stress that in his view the plan would achieve the $100bn goal per year over the 2020-2025 period.\n\"We have much greater confidence that the goal that was agreed upon will in fact, be achieved, and in fact, it will be overachieved beyond 2023 so I think that's very good news. \n\"And I think that, perhaps through this process, we've moved the bar in terms of how we can provide greater confidence and transparency going forward.\"\nOn Monday, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said it was \"touch and go\" whether the upcoming COP26 global climate conference will secure the agreements needed to help tackle climate change.\n\"It is going to be very, very tough this summit. I am very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it is touch and go, it is very, very difficult, but I think it can be done,\" he said.\nIn the meantime, the climate crisis continues to deepen: the World Meteorological Organization has said the build-up of warming gases in the atmosphere rose to record levels in 2020 despite the pandemic.\nThe amounts - or concentrations - of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide rose by more than the annual average in the past 10 years.\n\"Developing countries have been rightfully disappointed that so far developed countries have not delivered on the $100bn pledge that was already given in 2009,\" said the one of the plan's authors, Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's secretary of state for the environment.\n\"Hence, I am glad that the process I was honoured to lead jointly with minister Jonathan Wilkinson has created momentum to help complying with the finance commitment overall in the period up to 2025. We are very aware that also after today's release of the Delivery Plan, a lot of work remains.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

See you there.\"\nThe Climate Strike has been organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, which was founded by young people inspired by Ms Thunberg's activism.\nThe protest march will go from Kelvingrove Park in the west end of Glasgow to George Square in the city centre.\nMs Thunberg's comments came as unions representing rail and council workers confirmed their plans for strikes during the summit.\nCouncil cleaners, janitors, refuse and recycling workers across Scotland could take industrial action from 8 November.\nA joint trade union group, including Unison, Unite and the GMB, is seeking a \u00a32,000 flat rate pay increase or 6%, whichever is greater, from Scotland's local authority umbrella body Cosla.\nScotRail could also be hit by strikes from 1 November after the RMT Union rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union described the offer of a 2.5% increase this year, 2,2% in 2022 and a one-off \u00a3300 bonus for staff working during the summit as \"pitiful\".\nThree other rail unions, Unite, Aslef and the TSSA have already accepted the offer.\nThe Scottish government has said it will focus on \"making alternative plans for rail operations during Cop26\" if a pay offer is not accepted by Wednesday.\nAbout 120 world leaders are expected to attend the United Nations summit from 31 October to 12 November.\nGreta Thunberg told the BBC this week that summits will not lead to action on climate goals unless the public demand change too.\nIn a wide-ranging interview ahead of COP26, she said the public needed to \"uproot the system\"."

      "title": "Covid: Are cases about to plummet without Plan B?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Rising Covid cases have been putting both the NHS and ministers under huge pressure.\nBut could this be about to change - and change quite dramatically?\nIt is dangerous to read too much into a few days of data - especially given the way infection levels in the south-west of England have been skewed by the lab test failings. But the recent rise that has caused so much concern does appear to have slowed and maybe is starting to drop in England.\nAnd despite all the talk about the need for the government to introduce Plan B - working from home, mandatory mask wearing and vaccine passports - there is actually a school of thought that we may be on the brink of seeing infection levels plummet.\nModelling done for the government suggests cases and deaths could soon start to fall dramatically. \nThat though is dependent on a number of factors, including the vast majority of over-50s coming forward for their boosters, and a degree of cautious behaviour throughout winter when it comes to mixing and socialising.\nThis model, based on estimated total infections rather than those that come forward for testing and get reported in daily data, comes from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which is just one of the groups that feeds into the government.\nIt is certainly the most optimistic at the moment, although what is noticeable is that the others produced by Imperial College London and University of Warwick also point to some degree of decrease being the most realistic scenario.\nTo understand why this may happen, you have to look at what has been driving the infection rates in recent weeks. \nDuring the summer, rising infections were being recorded largely in older teenagers, and then, since school returned, the high rates have been sustained by younger teenagers.\nIn the most recent week, nearly half of cases have been in the under-20s.\nThis has happened with relatively little spillover into older age groups. Once the virus had passed through these groups, who after all were the people least protected by the vaccine, there was always going to be a drop-off in infection levels because of the high levels of natural immunity acquired.\nThat in turn reduces that relatively small risk of infections being passed on to older age groups, while the rollout of boosters tops up their protection levels. \nAll the new modelling is quick to stress that there is still a huge amount of uncertainty over exactly when a sustained drop will happen and how far case numbers will fall.\nThat is because infection levels are driven by two basic things - the type and amount of mixing people do, and the strength of immunity in the population.\nOn both counts, there is much that is unknown. Experts still do not fully understand to what extent immunity from two doses of vaccination wanes or how many people will come forward for boosters.\nAnd, of course, predicting human behaviour and what happens to mixing patterns is very difficult.\nProf John Edmunds, who leads the modelling group at LSHTM, says these are all reasons why it is hard to be precise about what will happen and when. However, he certainly expects a \"hiatus\" to kick in at some point over the winter, pointing out that all the models are suggesting this to some extent.\nHe is, though, still worried about Christmas, which is a period when there is a lot of inter-generational mixing, and a possible rebound in Covid in the spring.\nThe modelling does though raise a question over whether Plan B is needed at this stage.\nProf Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases at University of Edinburgh, agrees a drop over winter is certainly possible. \nBut he still believes extra measures are worth taking as a \"precautionary step\", reducing the risk of more drastic action being needed further down the line at a time when other respiratory viruses, such as flu, will just add to the pressure on the NHS.\nHe says the situation with Covid is so finely balanced that a small swing towards greater mixing or more waning than expected could make a big difference. \nIt may also take a little time for the falls to start having an impact.\n\"The number of hospitalisations are at such a level currently that we really cannot tolerate much more of an increase,\" he adds.\nBut he says the attention given to Plan B has masked some of the arguably more important issues.\n\"There are five million adults in the UK who have not even had one dose and we know unvaccinated people are far more likely to be hospitalised by Covid - I don't know why there is not more attention given to this.\"\nOn top of this there is the fact that only half of cases appear to be coming forward to get tested - surveillance data from the Office for National Statistics suggests the true level of infection is twice what is being reported daily.  \"We need to do better at finding cases and supporting people to self-isolate,\" he adds. \nMaking progress on those, according to Prof Woolhouse, is even more important than Plan B.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "tags": "COP26,Airbnb,Glasgow",
      "text": "An Airbnb host has been banned from taking bookings during COP26 after he hiked the cost of a lodging by $2,000.\nTan Copsey had booked the two-bedroom flat in Glasgow's west end well in advance of the summit only to receive an email with the inflated price.\nThe host said he was concerned he had \"missed out on a great deal of money\" after seeing the average room price increase by \"400%\" in the area.\nMr Copsey said: \"I had already paid. We already had an agreement.\"\nAirbnb said it had \"zero tolerance\" for this kind of behaviour.\nOriginally reported in The Herald, Mr Copsey posted about his experience on social media, joking he was having a \"great time\" with COP26 accommodation.\nMr Copsey, who will be visiting his 10th UN climate summit, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme he made the booking about three months ago.\nBut a few weeks ago he received a \"really interesting\" message from the host.\nMr Copsey, who works for a US non-profit organisation, said: \"The message essentially said: 'I am pretty disappointed that you booked early because I have missed out on a whole lot of money. Prices in our area have gone up 400% and so I would like to charge you more. Specifically, in your currency, $2,000 more.\"\nHe had originally booked a two-week stay at the property for \u00a32,175 ($3,000).\nMr Copsey said: \"The thing that bothered me about it was that I had already paid. We already had an agreement.\"  \nHe cancelled his booking and has since arranged alternative accommodation for COP26, which starts at the Scottish Event Campus on Sunday.\nMr Copsey said his main concern now was the situation facing delegates who did not have the same resources.\n\"The bigger thing that is happening is that all these people from around the world are coming to Glasgow and they are coming to do something that is really important and really good,\" he said.\n\"And I don't think it is right that they are priced out because they are on government salaries. They work for small non-profits in Africa or the Pacific Islands, and they are already paying a huge amount of money to get to Glasgow because of the pandemic and because of travel being disrupted.\"\nDespite his experience, Mr Copsey, whose area of specialism is the reduction of methane emissions, said he did not have any vindictive thoughts against the host or a negative opinion of Scottish people.\nAnd he said he hopes the many \"incredibly kind\" offers of accommodation he has received can now be used to help others who are less fortunate.\nAn Airbnb spokesperson said: \"We have zero tolerance for this behaviour and have taken action against the host and blocked them from accepting other bookings during this period. \n\"The guest has been refunded in full and we have offered support in helping them find alternative accommodation.\"\nEarlier this month BBC Scotland found evidence that a squeeze on available accommodation had sent prices soaring in Glasgow.\nOne room in the city initially advertised as \u00a342 per night was later advertised at \u00a31,400 per night during the summit.\nFiona Hooker, of the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland campaign, said the cost and availability of accommodation was \"a huge concern\" for activists hoping to attend.\nAnd restaurateur and property owner Charan Gill called the practice \"opportunistic\".\nHe said: \"You will not live off this money forever - fine, you might make an extra few hundred or thousand pounds here and there. \n\"At the end of the day you have to go back to your normal people, your normal market, your normal tenants who keep your bread buttered.\"\nAirbnb told the BBC they would donate all revenue from stays in Glasgow during the summit to Zero Waste Scotland.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

      "text": "On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget.\nHe'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on.\nEach year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. \nIt outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services.\nThe Budget speech will be delivered on Wednesday 27 October.\nIt usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. \nThis year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: \nAfter the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing.\nThe Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid.\nA number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise in the minimum wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50 and an end to the public sector pay freeze.\nThe chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions:\nBudget 2021: What has already been announced?\nMeasures such as the furlough scheme - which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic.\nTo close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. \nIn the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed \u00a3320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. \nEconomists expect it to borrow around \u00a3180bn more this year, another enormous sum. \nDuring his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead.\nThe government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises.\nOne major tax rise was announced in September - the \u00a312bn Health and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT.\nThere has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier.\nAt the same time, the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills.\nHe is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. \nOverall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England.\nThe government has already said that the NHS in England will receive an extra \u00a35.9bn to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans.\nBut other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport, are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgets next year. \nThey have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful.\nSome parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. \nOthers, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions.\nScotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December.\nIf the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rule called the Barnett formula. \nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "Energy industry,UK economy,Nuclear power,EDF Energy",
      "text": "Funding rules paving the way for a new major nuclear power station have been announced by the Business and Energy Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng.\nThe move is the latest stage in efforts to build the \u00a320bn Sizewell C project in Suffolk.\nThe proposed plant is still subject to planning approval, but until now, the Treasury has been uncertain of how to pay for it. \nEven if the project is approved, it still faces strong local objections. \nThe government said the new financing model could help cut the cost of new nuclear power projects in Britain, saving consumers more than \u00a330bn on each new large-scale station.\nThe proposals include electricity customers paying for part of nuclear schemes' costs upfront through bills.\nThe new model, known as RAB (Regulated Asset Base), has already been used to finance some large infrastructure projects, including the \u00a34.2bn Thames Tideway \"super-sewer\".\nIt allows investors to receive returns before the projects have been completed.\nThe Treasury was initially reluctant to use the RAB model. \nNot only does it add money to consumer bills over the lifetime of the project, but it also leaves consumers vulnerable to cost overruns, which have plagued previous nuclear developments. \nHowever, contractor EDF Energy has been adamant that lessons learned on previous projects - and the fact that it is building an identical plant at Hinkley Point - have largely mitigated those risks, says BBC business editor Simon Jack.\nMr Kwarteng said the new funding model was a better way to finance such projects.\n\"The existing financing scheme led to too many overseas nuclear developers walking away from projects, setting Britain back years,\" he said.\n\"We urgently need a new approach to attract British funds and other private investors to back new large-scale nuclear power stations in the UK.\"\nEmployers' organisation the CBI said the new financing model was \"a crucial step in building a secure, affordable and greener energy system in the years ahead\".\n\"Getting new projects off the ground will be a huge boost to supply chains and can deliver jobs right across the UK,\" said Tom Thackray, director of the CBI's decarbonisation programme.\nThe Nuclear Industry Association said it would add a small levy to bills of no more than a few pounds during the early phase of construction and less than \u00a31 a month over the course of a project.\nIt \"warmly welcomed\" the plan, adding it would also bring substantial savings in terms of CO2 emissions worth \u00a3526m a year at today's carbon prices, or \u00a318 per year for every UK household.\nBut the high cost of big nuclear plants and the plummeting cost of renewables such as offshore wind make the project controversial.\nHowever, the enormous amount of low-carbon non-intermittent electricity that it produces is considered by the government to be an essential part of the UK's future energy mix as existing nuclear plants are phased out.\nThe recent intermittency of wind power has also made the case in ministers' minds for an \"always on\" part of the energy supply, our business editor adds.\nTogether, Hinkley and Sizewell C are expected to produce 14% of the UK's current electricity needs, but they are unlikely to be operational until the late 2030s.\nThe new funding plan has been greeted with dismay by campaigners against the proposed plant.\nAlison Downes of Stop Sizewell C described it as \"a desperate measure to attract investment\" for \"a project so toxic that no one wants to pay for it\". \nShe added: \"Compared to other energy solutions, Sizewell C is an expensive distraction - too damaging, too slow for our climate emergency and with serious question marks over its reactor technology.\""

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "A significant number of Scots most at risk from Covid are still waiting for a booster jab despite receiving their second dose more than six months ago.\nJust over 616,000 people in the top priority vaccine groups are now due their booster - but only 511,807 jabs have been given, figures show.\nScientists say an effective pre-winter booster programme is vital to protect those most vulnerable from Covid.\nThe Scottish government said its booster programme was \"on track\".\nThe UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised in September there should be an interval of at least six months between second and third doses.\nThere is no breakdown available in Scotland on who the third doses have been given to, but as with the initial vaccine programme, the highest priority groups are being targeted first.\nPublic Health Scotland (PHS) figures indicate there are 104,000 people in these groups who have passed six months since their second dose, but are yet to receive a booster.\nOther older age groups show a similar pattern.\nProf Andrew Watterson, a public health researcher at the University of Stirling, said the vaccines offered \"decreased protection\" over time, and that it was important for immunity to be boosted before winter.\n\"Winter will bring more respiratory illnesses and make more people - and especially already vulnerable and highly exposed people - even more vulnerable to the combined serious effects of Covid,\" he told BBC Scotland.\nScotland and the rest of the UK had a quick start to its vaccination programme, which began last December, jabbing the most vulnerable with first doses ahead of almost every other country in the world.\nHowever, it means the country now has large number of elderly people who were vaccinated earlier and may now be seeing some of that protection fade.\nPHS data shows an increase in the proportion of older people being admitted to hospital with Covid over the past few weeks.\nIn May and June, the over-80s were typically accounting for about 6% of weekly admissions, but this had risen to almost 18% in the week up to 12 October.\nProf Watterson said: \"It's possible but not known that delayed boosters might cause increased hospitalisation - but effects would be less severe generally after double-jabbing even if immunity is waning.\n\"At what point the waning becomes significant is another question not yet fully answered and will probably vary between individuals.\"\nThe JCVI has recommended that everyone over 50 should be offered a third dose of a Covid vaccine, along with front-line medical staff and younger adults with some underlying health conditions.\nThe Scottish government estimates there are about 3,375,000 people in the nine priority categories in Scotland. All of them will eventually be invited for a booster jab.\nPHS figures relating to the most at-risk groups - including residents and staff in care homes for older adults, as well as front-line health and social care workers - show that 616,285 are now due a booster having received a second dose more than six months ago.\nThis leaves a gap of 104,478 people who can now receive the booster, but are yet to receive it.\nThis group also includes the clinically extremely vulnerable, 16-64 year olds with underlying health problems and unpaid carers aged 16 and over.\nFocusing on the over-50s population group, 889,677 people now had their second jab more than six months ago, leaving about 377,872 people potentially waiting for their booster.\nHowever, some of the over-50s may be counted in other priority groups, if for example they are a care home worker or have an underlying health condition.\nDaily figures on booster vaccines are only available from 13 October, but they show that, on average, about 25,000 jabs are being administered a day.\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf said Scotland's booster programme was prioritising those at the highest risk of both Covid-19 and flu.\n\"We started this as soon as possible following the JCVI advice - that the booster dose should be offered no earlier than six months after completion of the primary vaccine course,\" he said.\n\"It is important to note that many people in the original early priority cohorts of the initial vaccination programme had already had a six-month gap prior to this JCVI advice.\n\"In addition to delivering the Covid-19 vaccine boosters, this year we are offering a record number of free flu vaccines to help protect the people of Scotland. It is the biggest ever flu vaccination programme in Scotland reaching over four million people.\""

      "tags": "Kenya,British Army,Ministry of Defence",
      "text": "The family of a Kenyan woman allegedly killed by a British soldier in 2012 have told the BBC of their anger and despair that no-one has yet been convicted of her murder.\nThe UK defence ministry says it has been co-operating with a Kenyan inquiry into Agnes Wanjiru's death following allegations of a cover-up reported by the Sunday Times at the weekend (subscription required).\nHer body was found in a septic tank at a hotel in central Kenya nearly three months after she had spent an evening partying with soldiers.\nThe 21-year-old left behind a five-month old daughter, who is now being cared for by her sister Rose Wanyua in the town of Nanyuki, 200km (125 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi.\nMs Wanyua sobbed as she revealed how the Sunday Times report had raked up painful memories.\nShe and her husband John Muchiri said the family had given up any hope of finding justice for Ms Wanjiru, who they knew as Ciru.\n\"If it was Ciru who had killed that white person, by now I wouldn't even know where she is jailed,\" Ms Wanyua said.\n\"But whoever killed her went free and is living his life. I am raising her child alone, no-one has asked about their well-being, not even the government.\"\nMs Wanjiru, who dropped out of high school and later became a sex worker to look after her baby, was last seen by witnesses on the night of 31 March 2012.\nShe was walking out of a Nanyuki bar accompanied by two British soldiers.\nHer body was later discovered behind a room where the soldiers had stayed, with missing body parts and a stabbing injury. \nKenyan judge Njeri Thuku concluded after an inquest in 2019 that Ms Wanjiru had been murdered by one or two British soldiers.\nShe ordered two further criminal inquiries, but the military took no action, the Sunday Times reports.\nA soldier told the paper that the killer had confessed to him and he had reported it, but the army had failed to initially investigate. \nKenyan detectives are also said to have asked British military police to question some of the soldiers, but the UK's defence ministry denied receiving such a request. \nOn Tuesday, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Ministry of Defence (MOD) had fully co-operated with the Kenyan investigation - and would continue to do so.\nMr Muchiri said the family felt let down, but could not afford legal representation to take the matter further.\n\"You know, we are poor. I'm a casual labourer. We'd have loved to retain a lawyer to follow up. We can't,\" he said.\nFor decades, locals have complained about the British army, which has a training base in Nanyuki.\nA lawyer who represents them told the BBC many of the issues go unaddressed.\n\"Even with our local police, you will just report a case, and then nothing goes beyond the investigation stage,\" Kelvin Kubai said. \"Most of the locals do not have the resources and financial capacity, to enable them pursue justice on such grounds.\"\nThe UK High Commissioner to Kenya, Jane Marriott, has expressed \"shared concern\" over Ms Wanjiru's death and reiterated her government's support for the investigation.\nThe British Army Training Unit Kenya (BatUK) has also said it is supporting the MOD's discussions with Kenyan authorities over the murder. \nFor Agnes Wanjiru's family - nine years after her murder - the wait for justice continues.

      "text": "Afghans, including former officials and activists, are calling on the UK government to announce when its new resettlement scheme will open.\nMany fearful for their safety under the Taliban regime say they are worried for their lives while they wait to find out if they are eligible to come to the UK.\nOne man currently in hiding in the country told the BBC: \"The more we wait the more in danger we are.\"\nMinister Victoria Atkins told MPs the scheme was not being paused.\nThe Home Office minister said: \"While we appreciate the need to act quickly it is also important that we do this properly and ensure any scheme meets the needs of those it is being set up to support.\" \nMeanwhile, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has written to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to raise \"serious concerns\", saying that months after the official evacuation ended thousands of people are still stranded in Afghanistan.\nMs Truss faces questions from MPs in Parliament on Tuesday, the first time in her new role.\nThe government announced a new Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) on 18 August, and committed to re-house 5,000 vulnerable Afghans in the UK in the first year, and 20,000 in the coming years. It is not yet open. \nThat scheme is separate to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) that launched on 1 April to resettle people who worked for the UK in Afghanistan.\nThe BBC has spoken to Afghans who are waiting to find out if they will be eligible for the scheme, one who talks about his family home being raided by the Taliban, and another who reports family members being threatened.\nAll their names have been changed to protect their anonymity. \nMohammed, who is in hiding in Afghanistan, is an alumnus of the Chevening scholarship scheme, the government programme that funds masters degrees at UK universities for foreign students with leadership potential.\nIn August, he and other Chevening alumni were told they - and current scholars - would be a priority for the first wave of evacuations and provided the UK government with their details.\nBut they are not sure if they will be eligible for the new ACRS scheme.\nHe told the BBC: \"The fact that it has taken so long is one concern, but the fact we don't even know if we will be considered for the scheme is a bigger concern for us.\"\nHe fears that \"the more we wait the more in danger we are, the more risk we face\" and worries that because Chevening scholars and alumni were previously prioritised for evacuation they have been identified as a group with a strong affiliation to the UK.\n\"It's been more than a month now that I and many other Chevening alumni like me are hiding in our houses and we are fearing persecution if we step out.\n\"We are trying to limit our interactions - we have had very limited interaction with our friends and relatives.\"\nHe added that if \"you go out and you talk to someone and they find you - it's over for you\".\n\"If I stay here - that's the end of life. I can't go out, I can't get a job, I can't work, study - nothing at all. That's something to think about later. Right now - it's our lives that are in danger.\"\nAmina is also a Chevening alumni and feels particularly at risk from the Taliban because of her work as a women's rights campaigner and because she is from the Hazara community - an ethnic group who have been persecuted.\n\"The thing that makes me really worried is that they know about my identity, my background in Afghanistan, and my work experience. I'm a Chevening scholar alumni, before I was a women's rights advocate.\"\nAmina was contacted by the Home Office in the summer - identified as an individual at risk - and provided them with all the details of her and her dependents. But she says she hasn't heard back from the UK government since mid-August.\nAhmad worked for the Afghan government security services and is currently hiding in Afghanistan. He shared videos with BBC News that show his family home after being raided by the Taliban.\nHe received an email on 20 August from the Foreign Office asking for his details but he has not heard from them since.\n\"On the fourth day of the Taliban in Kabul, we left our home and hid in a safe and secret place since then because my mother was also an adviser to the intelligence service department of Afghanistan.\"\nHe said his \"main fear\" is that the Taliban will arrest, torture or kill former government employees.\nAli also worked for the Afghan government and gave his details to the Home Office one and a half months before leaving Afghanistan but had no response. After Kabul fell to the Taliban he fled to a third country, gave the Home Office his details, and was told he was a priority for evacuation - but has not had contact since.\nHis family are still in Afghanistan and he says they have been threatened by the Taliban.\n\"Every single, or every two days, they are going to our offices, to our homes to find us or to find one of our family members. Every single day I worry about their lives, about their security.\n\"I fought many years against the Taliban - it was also about ISIS, al-Qaeda who were a big worry for Afghanistan and a big worry for the world. \n\"The world did not remain a good soldier and a good friend to Afghanistan. Especially to people like me who were in the frontline and who were defending the world from terrorism.\"\nMs Nandy said: \"Many of them [Afghans waiting to hear] are people who helped us, British nationals, or the dependents of those who helped us - who are now being targeted by the Taliban and in some cases hunted door to door,\" she said.\nShe said when Parliament was recalled in August the \"only concrete commitment\" the prime minister and former foreign secretary Dominic Raab made was \"to respond to every email from members of parliament raising urgent cases of people who were stranded in Afghanistan\".\nShe said: \"They promised to do that by the beginning of September, that promise was not met, now the Foreign Office is writing to MPs asking them not to raise cases any more and signposting them to a scheme run by the Home Office that isn't even open yet.\" \nShe has written to the new foreign secretary to ask her to \"get a grip on the mess that she was left when she took office\". \nForeign Affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat said: \"Those who stood with us now need us to stand with them but every day of delay costs lives. We've been pressing the government for clarity urgently to protect our friends and their families.\" \nIn the Commons, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes said Afghans who had arrived in the UK were \"desperately\" looking for information on how the ACRS was going to work to help family members join them. \nAnd Green Party MP Caroline Lucas told the BBC that when she told the Foreign Office about British nationals still stranded she was met with \"deafening silence\".\n\"Of the seven British nationals I have been in contact with who are still in Afghanistan, none of them according to the responses I've received, were actually registered with the FCDO as being British nationals stranded in Afghanistan,\" she said.\n\"This is despite me sending multiple messages to the FCDO and Home Office, and most of the British nationals also making enquiries directly themselves to the FCDO contact points in the public domain.\"  \nOne former ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Nick Kay, said he has \"daily\" requests from Afghans in hiding \"in very perilous situations\" asking for help: \"At the moment all I can do is point them towards the Home Office website for the ACRS.\n\"Very high up on the screen there is the simple statement that 'this scheme is not yet operational'.\n\"There is no date for when they can apply. And there is no clarity for the criteria there will be for the scheme.\n\"So really I feel frustrated but, more than that, these Afghans feel incredibly at risk, their lives have been turned upside down, they would just like some clarity from the UK government, a clear timeframe and some action rather than just the words.\""

      "text": "Premier Inn owner Whitbread has said it will pay millions in wage rises and bonuses to try to combat what it calls persistent staff shortages. \nThe chain said hospitality-wide labour shortages meant a \"material number of vacancies\" remained unfilled. \nHigher pay rates will cost Whitbread \u00a312m-\u00a313m, it said, while it is also paying \u00a310m in retention bonuses.\nRecent official figures show vacancies at a record, with hospitality seeing some of the biggest shortages.\nThe Office for National Statistics said vacancies reached 1.1 million between July and September, the highest level since records began in 2001.\nThe Institute for Employment Studies said this month that labour shortages were affecting the whole economy. \nMany firms are being forced to pay signing on bonuses, or raise pay rates to tempt staff to work for them.\nStaff costs are among a host of price pressures facing businesses and Whitbread also pointed to rising utility costs. \nHowever, the company said its recovery in recent months had been better than expected, and UK demand had been \"very strong\" since 17 May when Covid restrictions were eased to allow leisure overnight stays at its hotels.\nIt added that it now expects revenue-per-room rates to return to pre-pandemic levels next year.\nAt the start of this month Whitbread announced a pay increase for its UK-based hourly-paid staff. \nIt needs to add 2,000 staff to its current head count of 30,000, including in housekeeping, reception and kitchens.\nChief executive Alison Brittain said: \"Whitbread traded significantly ahead of the market in the UK during the first half of the year.\n\"The operating environment during the summer and into autumn has been challenging largely as a result of our very high occupancy levels, market-wide supply chain issues and a tighter labour supply in the hospitality sector.\"\nIts revenue remains 39% down on the same period pre-pandemic two years ago, but it has more than doubled since last year.\nPre-tax losses in the first half of the year narrowed from \u00a3724.7m last year to \u00a319.3m, but this was still well down on the profit of \u00a3219.9m made before the pandemic."

      "text": "The Met Police has apologised to the family of two murdered sisters for failings in the way it responded when they were reported missing.\nDanyal Hussein, 19, killed Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, at Fryent Country Park in Wembley, north-west London, on 6 June 2020.\nA missing persons log was incorrectly closed and inquiries were not progressed, an investigation has found.\nThe sisters' mother said the apology was 10 months too late.\nTheir bodies were found by Ms Smallman's boyfriend the day after they had been reported missing to police. \nAn investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found the Met's response following calls from worried friends and family of the missing sisters was \"below the standard that it should have been\".\nMina Smallman, the sisters' mother, said the Met had shown \"incompetent, reprehensible and blatant disregard of agreed procedures regarding missing persons\" during its investigation.\nCommissioner Dame Cressida Dick said a better response would have saved their family and friends \"immeasurable pain\".\n\"While we know that very sadly Nicola and Bibaa had been murdered in the early hours of Saturday 6 June 2020, before they were reported missing, if we had responded better we may have saved their friends and family immeasurable pain,\" she said.\n\"I am very sorry that the level of service we provided fell short.\"\nThe pair were reported missing on Saturday, 7 June after attending a birthday celebration the previous evening but an inspector closed the logs after receiving information that was not accurately recorded.\nThe IOPC said a search by the sisters' families and friends of their last known location led to the discovery of their bodies in Fryent Country Park, Wembley on Sunday - 36 hours after the party.\nSpeaking about the apology, the sister's mother said: \"We're not the only parties who suffered mental anguish at the hands of the Met's incompetent, reprehensible and blatant disregard of agreed procedures regarding missing persons.\"\nMs Smallman added that the on-duty call handler had made \"inappropriate and manipulating assertions, which led to cancellation of the missing persons report. \n\"We're also of the view that his unprofessional comments about the picnic suggests racial profiling, misogyny or classism.\"\nDame Cressida said she contacted the family to ask if they would allow her or another senior officer to visit to apologise in person.\nHowever, Ms Smallman said: \"Sorry is something you say when you comprehend the wrong you do and take full responsibility for it. Demonstrating that by taking appropriate proportionate action which to our minds is not going to happen.\n\"The investigation was not handled appropriately. The apology should have been done face-to-face and not nearly 10 months later.\"\nThe IOPC investigation found an inspector closed the police logs after receiving information about the sisters' possible whereabouts from a family member.\nHowever, that information was \"inaccurately\" recorded by a communications supervisor, so the inquiries were not progressed properly.\nThe inspector told the IOPC it had been one of \"the most challenging shifts of his career\" with 16 missing persons reports and an under-capacity unit due to the pandemic.\nThe force said it agreed its service the weekend the sisters went missing was \"below the standard it should have been\".\nIt said no misconduct was found by an officer and two members of police staff but there would be action taken over their performance, which was found to be inadequate.\nThere was no suggestion racial bias played any part in how the missing persons reports were dealt with, it said.\nResponding to the IOPC report, Barry Gardiner, MP for Brent North, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The Met really does need to have a root and branch reform in the way in which it operates, the way in which it treats people and it needs to ground itself much better in the community.\""

      "title": "Budget 2021: Public sector workers set for pay rise, says Sunak",
      "tags": "Public sector,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Millions of public sector workers are set to see their wages rise next year, after the government confirmed a pay freeze is being lifted. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak will use his Budget on Wednesday to say nurses, teachers and members of the armed forces are among those set to benefit. \nA \"temporary pause\" in salary progression was introduced last November as a response to the pandemic.\nLabour says tax and price rises mean families face a cost of living crisis.\nThe public sector pay freeze was part of the government's response to what it described as the \"economic emergency\" caused by Covid, with only the lowest-paid excluded.\nIn his spending review in November 2020, Mr Sunak said he could not justify an across-the-board increase when many in the private sector had seen their pay and hours cut in the crisis.\nThe Treasury said exactly how much of a pay rise public sector workers receive depends on the recommendations from the independent pay review bodies, who set the pay for most frontline workforces - including nurses, police officers, prison officers and teachers.\nBut asked if public sector pay would rise above inflation, a Downing Street spokesperson said the independent pay review body would consider what the rise should be and that No 10 couldn't \"pre-judge that process\". \nSeparately, campaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the tax to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row at Wednesday's Budget.  \nThe BBC has also been told VAT on household energy would not be cut with the Treasury arguing it would be poorly targeted and that lower income households could be better helped through other schemes. \nIn an announcement on Monday, the Treasury said the chancellor would use his forthcoming Budget to say \"the solid economic recovery and encouraging signs in the labour market\" mean the \"pay pause\" can be lifted. \nIn a statement, Mr Sunak said: \"The economic impact and uncertainty of the virus meant we had to take the difficult decision to pause public sector pay.\n\"And now, with the economy firmly back on track, it's right that nurses, teachers and all the other public sector workers who played their part during the pandemic see their wages rise.\"\nBusiness Minister Paul Scully said it was \"important public sector workers are recognised for what they do and are rewarded fairly\".\nHe said it was part of a number of measures to help people on low incomes, which also included the rise in the national living wage announced on Monday.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \"We know there are pressures. We know this is a difficult time for the economy, for people in the country in terms of the cost of living.\"\nThe Treasury said the \"temporary pause\" had helped ensure the gap between public and private sector pay did not widen further during the height of the pandemic. \nIt said public sector average weekly earnings rose by 4.5% in 2020/21 whilst private sector wage increases were a third lower than they were pre-crisis, at 1.8%.\nOn Tuesday figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that workers and occupations hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, with employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work seeing the sharpest dip and recovery.\nIt comes at a time of fierce debate about the pressure families are under amid soaring energy bills and price rises for goods in shops. \nOpposition MPs have accused the Conservatives of presiding over a cost of living crisis with cuts to universal credit and tax rises to fund the NHS and social care.\nThere is disquiet among some Conservative backbenchers too about whether ministers should be doing more to help struggling households. \nThere may be an element of relief for some public sector workers that their pay will at at least not be frozen for another year. \nBut it may not be enough to lift the bitterness many feel that in the year when many of them were key workers, often risking their health on the frontlines of the pandemic, they're coping with a real terms pay cut. \nEven nurses, who've received more than most, have seen their spending power shrink as inflation gets above 3%. And that renewed squeeze on living standards is getting worse with record petrol prices and energy bills driving up the cost of living. \nWhat shouldn't be taken at face value is the notion that the government \"can't afford\" to pay more. What a government that issues its own currency decides it can or cannot \"afford\" has no objective economic basis, but is a matter of political choice.  \nFor example, as the IFS points out, the cost of servicing debt is lower than it was pre-pandemic. In fact, it's the second lowest it's been since the 1950s. \nEven if official interest rates rise to 1.25%, they will still be historically low - and that is manageable as long as tax receipts are rising faster than the debt servicing cost. \nWith teachers' pay in real terms 8% lower than a decade ago, hospital consultants 9% lower, NHS dentists 32% down, a reality is coming home: you can't get the work done if you can't attract the staff to do it. \nThe cost of not allowing pay rises - in the harm it could to the government's other goals such as better public health and education - could have been higher than any pay rise. \nThe UK's largest union, Unison, said the pay freeze would continue \"in all but name\" unless government departments get extra money. \nIts general secretary Christina McAnea said while there was \"never a good time to freeze public sector pay\", to do so \"at the peak of a pandemic was the height of folly\" while \"staff were doing their all to keep under-pressure services running\".\nShe added: \"There can be no decent public services without the people to run them.\n\"Pay freezes don't help employers hold on to experienced staff, nor attract new recruits. \n\"But if the chancellor doesn't allocate extra money to government departments to fund the much-needed wage rises, the pay freeze will continue in all but name.\" \nTorsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation described the announcement as \"blindingly obvious\" adding that it was \"totally inevitable\" the pay freeze would be lifted. \n\"What we don't know, is what is going to happen to public sector pay - lifting the freeze is one thing, but a rise could be anything between 0 to a million per cent pay rise.\"\nLabour says many of those working on the frontline dealing with Covid are among those being hit by the government's choices. \nShadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said: \"This Conservative government's choice last year to freeze pay for so many frontline workers, who have been among the real heroes of the pandemic, was damaging and unsustainable. \n\"The government must work to ensure a fair settlement and reflect the vital work of all key workers including many who have been burnt out over the course of the pandemic.\"\nMeanwhile, the Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has told MPs it was \"not acceptable\" to brief the media ahead of MPs about the Budget.\nSir Lindsay said that ministers used to \"walk\" if they briefed about a Budget."

      "text": "Britain's turkey farmers will do their best to ensure Christmas \"is as normal as it can be\" but shortages are likely, an industry representative has warned.\nThe government has assured consumers that turkeys will be available for the festive season.\nMinisters are pinning their hopes on overseas workers brought in on temporary visas to \"save Christmas\".\nBut Graeme Dear, from the British Poultry Council, told MPs the scheme had come too late.\n\"We have been given access through the seasonal workers scheme for up to 5,500 [employees] but that finishes on 31 December,\" he said.\n\"We would have loved to have known about that in June, and therefore could have placed enough turkeys for a full Christmas.\"\nHe added that farmers \"will do our utmost to make sure Christmas is as normal as it can be,\" but told MPs: \"There is a likelihood there will be a shortage\". \nHe said his industry was facing a 16% reduction in its workforce.\nEarlier this month, Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden told Sky News: \"We will make sure that people have their turkeys for Christmas.\n\"I know that for the Environment Secretary George Eustice, this is absolutely top of his list.\"\nOther farming industry representatives blamed shortages on Brexit and Covid, and urged the government to ease restrictions on immigration, in evidence to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. \nTom Bradshaw, of the National Farmers' Union, said labour shortages were \"our number one challenge\".\nHe cited daffodil farms, which he said were down a third on their usual staff numbers, leading to nearly a quarter of their crop going to waste.\nAnd he added that courgettes, apples and autumn raspberries had not been picked, in addition to \"the tragic cull in the pig sector\".\n\"Many businesses are mothballing their facilities... I've never seen the industry in this position and the real lack of confidence is crippling the sector,\" he added.\nHis comments were echoed by Derek Jarman, from the British Protected Ornamentals Association, who said the flowers and plants industry were facing a 25% reduction in labour next year.\n\"That will mean crops un-harvested - the market is there but not the labour to produce them,\" he said.\n\"We're all frightened, we're all in great fear, we don't know what to do, I've never seen it like this in my entire life, never.\"\nConservative MP Sheryll Murray asked the witnesses what was the dominant reason for the shortages.\nMr Jarman blamed Brexit for workers leaving the UK, telling the committee: \"We as a nation said 'we don't want you'.\"\nCharlie Dewhirst, a policy adviser for the National Pig Association said the coronavirus pandemic had been \"an accelerator of so many issues\".\n\"It is almost 50:50,\" said Mr Dear arguing that a lot of EU citizens left in \"the run up\" to Brexit but the pandemic \"encouraged\" others to \"go home\". \nAsked if labour shortages could be filled by the UK population, Mr Bradshaw noted that unemployment is \"very low\".\nHe said the industry had been told the end of the furlough scheme, introduced during the pandemic, would result in high unemployment and that \"we would recruit from that pool\".\n\"It's now not happened so where is the pool of labour,\" he asked, \nThe government has said firms should pay higher wages to attract staff.\nAsked about labour shortages in farming earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC the industry could not \"simply go back to the tired, failed, old model, reach for the lever called 'uncontrolled immigration' get people in, low wages\".\nIn October, the government announced a number of measures to ease pressure on the pig industry including extending its seasonal workers scheme to pork butchers.\nThe Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme allows farmers to recruit overseas on a quota basis - but Mr Bradshaw said the numbers should be expanded and extended to other areas such as the ornamental sector.

      "text": "The government has been blamed for failing to reduce demand for flying and meat-eating as part of its plans to rein in climate change.\nThe Climate Change Committee advisory body says ministers also have not shown how to achieve their ambition of cutting the demand for road travel.\nIt warns a \u201ctechno-centric\u201d approach to cutting emissions adopted by the prime minister has a high risk of failure.\nBut a report from the committee praised the government's Net Zero Strategy.\nA government spokeswoman welcomed the CCC\u2019s generally positive response to the Net Zero Strategy and said it would meet all its climate change goals.\nBoris Johnson has regularly promised that climate change can be tackled without what he calls \u201chairshirtery\u201d.\nMany experts agree technology is needed but say behaviour must change too. \nThey judge that the demand for high-carbon activities must be cut for the UK to meet climate targets in the 2030s.\nThe report from the CCC - an independent body advising the UK and devolved governments on emissions targets - comes ahead of the COP26 climate summit which will be held in Glasgow from Sunday.\nIt says: \"There is less emphasis on reducing demand for high carbon activities than in the CCC's scenarios. \n\"The government does not include an explicit ambition on diet change, or reductions in the growth of aviation, and policies for managing travel demand have not been developed to match the funding that has been committed.\"\nThe committee added: \"These remain valuable options with major co-benefits and can help manage delivery risks around a techno-centric approach. They must be explored further with a view to early action.\"\nNick Eyre, Professor of Energy and Climate Policy at the University of Oxford, went even further. \nWith reference to the PM's \"hairshirtery\" jibe, he told a COP26 media briefing: \"The PM's headline about not changing the way we use energy is not just helpful - it's unrealistic. \n\"We won't reach climate goals unless there's a combination of technology and behaviour change.\"\nThe government\u2019s over-arching Net Zero climate plans unveiled last week showed how almost every sector of the economy should virtually eliminate planet-heating carbon emissions by 2050.\nBut on the eve of the Budget the committee warns that the Treasury still lacks policies to cut emissions.\nIt has not explained, for instance, how finances can be raised for a massive investment in clean electricity, or how a great home insulation programme will be prompted and supported. \nThe committee said: \"Currently vague plans must be quickly pinned down for improving home energy efficiency for the 60% of UK households that are owner-occupiers but not in fuel poverty.\"\nMore policies are needed, too, to curb emissions from land use and farming, it says.\nThe criticisms are tempered by praise for the sweeping nature of the government\u2019s Net Zero Strategy, which is thought to be the first in the world to demonstrate how emissions can be cut across the board. \nThe report says the strategy is achievable and affordable, and will create many jobs.\nCCC chairman Lord Deben said: \u201cThis is a genuine step forward. The UK was the first major industrialised nation to set Net Zero into law \u2013 now we have policy plans to get us there. \n\u201cMinisters have made the big decisions \u2013 to decarbonise the power sector by 2035, to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles, to back heat pumps for homes. \n\u201cThey have proposed policies to do it. I applaud their ambition but now they must deliver these goals and fill in the remaining gaps in funding and implementation.\u201d\nThis may prove easier said than done, because there is currently a gulf between the government\u2019s climate promises and its achievements. \nThe CCC recently judged that ministers had only achieved around a fifth of the carbon cuts needed to meet previous climate targets.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nA government spokeswoman said: \"We value the Climate Change Committee's expert advice as we work to implement our comprehensive plan to finish the job and eradicate the UK's contribution to climate change by 2050. \n\"As the committee rightly highlights, our world-leading Net Zero Strategy builds on the UK's proven track record of having decarbonised faster than any other G7 country in recent decades.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin"

      "tags": "Rachel Reeves,Ofgem,Energy industry,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021",
      "text": "VAT on household energy bills will not be cut in the Chancellor's Budget on Wednesday, despite calls to help families struggling with soaring prices.\nLabour has been calling for the rate to be slashed from 5% to zero for the next six months to help households get through a \"tough winter\".\nBut Whitehall sources have told the BBC such a move would be poorly targeted.\nThey say lower income households can be better helped through other schemes.\nRising energy bills have been causing alarm to families and political leaders amid warnings from the energy regulator, Ofgem, of more \"significant rises\" next spring. \nThe cap on prices, which went up earlier this month for households in England, Scotland and Wales, is due to be reviewed again next April, with the expectation that it will climb further. \nWhen the price cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nEven if wholesale gas prices were to drop significantly from now, the extra costs that suppliers have had to shoulder in the last couple of months means a steep rise in household bills in April is inevitable.\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, who was speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show last Sunday, said many households were facing a \"tough winter\".\nShe said: \"When we pay our gas and electricity bills, 5% of that money goes automatically to the taxman.\n\"There's something very simple the government could do. It would be immediate and it would be felt automatically on people's bills next month - and that is to cut that rate of VAT from 5% to 0%.\"\nShe said VAT receipts had come in more than \u00a32bn higher than forecast because of rising prices, giving the chancellor some wriggle room to act.\nThe charity, National Energy Action, which campaigns to combat fuel poverty, said a further 1.2 to 1.5m households could struggle to heat and power their homes next April, on top of the 4m people already estimated to be behind on their bills. \nIt is calling on the chancellor to help poorer households with Winter Fuel Payments.\nDirector of policy, Peter Smith, said: \"Treasury coffers could be boosted by as much as \u00a3100m directly through VAT receipts on rising energy prices.\n\"Carbon tax revenues have also risen sharply because of the gas crisis, adding an additional \u00a31bn in revenue to the Treasury on top of \u00a34bn already made this calendar year.\"\nThe Treasury said support was offered through existing schemes instead such as \"warm home\" discounts, cold weather payments and winter fuel allowances. \nOn Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who was also speaking on the Marr programme, said there was \"no magic wand\" to make the problems disappear. \nHe said there were several factors contributing to high inflation, such as pressure on global supply chains as economies have reopened after Covid, and soaring energy prices."

      "text": "Defiant protesters remain on the streets of Sudan after the country's armed forces launched a military coup.\nChanting and waving flags, they have blocked roads in the capital Khartoum and around the country following the takeover.\nOn Monday coup leader Gen Abdel Fattah Burhan dissolved civilian rule, arrested political leaders and called a state of emergency.\nSoldiers opened fire on crowds and reportedly killed 10 people.\nAccording to Reuters, Gen Burhan has said Monday's coup was justified to avoid \"civil war\" and that the detained prime minister will be returned to his home on Tuesday.  Earlier, he sought to justify the takeover by blaming political infighting.\nThe coup has drawn global condemnation. Diplomats told AFP news agency the UN Security Council is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss the crisis. \nTroops are reported to have been going house to house in Khartoum arresting local protest organisers.\nThe city's airport is closed and international flights are suspended. The internet and most phone lines are also down. \nCentral Bank staff have reportedly gone on strike, and across the country doctors are said to be refusing to work in military run hospitals except in emergencies.\nCivilian leaders and their military counterparts have been at odds since long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the military's actions \"are a betrayal of Sudan's peaceful revolution\". The US has halted $700m (\u00a3508m) in aid. \nAfter a night of protests, demonstrators remained on the streets on Tuesday morning, demanding the return of civilian rule.\n\"Civilian rule is the people's choice,\" they chanted as they set up barricades of burning tyres. Many women are also taking part, shouting \"no to military rule\".\nThe protests continue despite troops opening fire on demonstrators on Monday. \nOne wounded protestor told reporters he was shot in the leg by the army outside the military headquarters, while another man described the military firing first stun grenades, then live ammunition.\n\"Two people died, I saw them with my own eyes,\" said Al-Tayeb Mohamed Ahmed. Sudan's doctors' union and the information ministry also wrote on Facebook that the fatal shootings had happened outside the military compound.\nPictures from a hospital in the city showed people with bloodied clothing and various injuries. \nWorld leaders have reacted with alarm to news of the military takeover.\nThe US has joined the UK, EU, UN and African Union, of which Sudan is a member, in demanding the release of political leaders who are now under house arrest.\nAmong them are Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and his wife, along with members of his cabinet and other civilian leaders.\nBBC Arabic's Mohamed Osman reported from the capital that a special security unit of the military went to the prime minister's home early on Monday morning, and tried to persuade Mr Hamdok to agree to the coup, but he refused.\nThe agreement between civilian and military leaders signed in 2019 was designed to steer Sudan towards democracy but has proven fragile with a number of previous coup attempts, the last just over a month ago.\nGen Burhan, who was head of the power-sharing council, said Sudan was still committed to the transition to civilian rule, with elections planned for July 2023. \nAre you in Sudan?

      "text": "A Black Lives Matter activist said her trust was \"destroyed\" when police tried to recruit her as an informant.\nSwansea University law student Lowri Davies said she was called in March by a covert officer.\nThe anti-racism campaigner said she was confused to be asked to give details of far-right activists protesting at Black Lives Matter demonstrations.\nSouth Wales Police said a complaint referring to contact made by a covert  officer was being considered.\nMs Davies received the call from the woman \"out of the blue\" on a Tuesday morning.\n\"She says that she is a covert police officer and she works for informants, usually with drugs and burglary and, in my case, the protests,\" she said. \n\"And she said that she was interested in other groups turning up and causing chaos in our protests and being not from our movement.\n\"But to be honest, I knew that this was a ruse, because what would I know about other groups... I've got no information on that - I'm a part of Black Lives Matters Swansea - the alt-right is not something that I'm very aware of.\"\nMs Davies said a meeting was arranged with the woman and a superior officer the following day.\nShe added: \"I was absolutely terrified, I can't really explain how terrified I was, I was so terrified that I just went completely numb.\"\nMs Davies spent 90 minutes with the officers and was asked about her family, BLM and the alt-right. She said she did not respond to follow-up phone calls.\nShe said the experience made her question herself, and she now had a \"vetting process\" in her head when new people came into her life. \nShe said she had a good working relationship with police on protests, but added: \"For them to turn around and almost 'good cop, bad cop' me really destroyed what I thought was going on.\"\nShe said she was surprised police would want to infiltrate her group.\n\"It really hits home when it's in the UK, and especially in Swansea. We're a small non-violent group... it was really, really confusing, scary and baffling,\" Ms Davies added.\nTim Brain, a former chief constable of the Gloucestershire force who now writes on police matters, said use of informants was now a \"highly regulated field\".\n\"They have to be recruited under a very strict regime where there is an authorising officer, a handler and a controller so there's a lot of oversight about the recruitment and the way an informant - or as they're now properly called, a covert human intelligence source - operates,\" he said.\n\"Think in terms of the old British crime dramas of the '70s or even the '80s and just forget all of that - the recruiting and the handling of a covert human intelligence source is now specialist work by a specialist unit within a police force.\"\nIn a statement, South Wales Police said it would \"neither confirm nor deny any specific details in relation to this matter\".\n\"A complaint has been received which refers to contact made by a covert officer. This is currently being considered by the force's professional standards department and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,\" it said. \n\"The use of informants is a well-established and highly regulated tactic used by police forces across the country to protect the public. Their use is controlled within strict legal parameters by trained specialised staff and the accountability and protection of the informant and the public is paramount.\n\"Protest organisers have an obligation to liaise with police forces and South Wales Police has a proven track record in working with organisers to facilitate lawful protest while minimising disruption to the wider public.\""

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nNurses, teachers and other public sector workers are set to see their wages rise next year. Pay was frozen for at least 1.3m people last November as part of the government's response to the \"economic emergency\" caused by Covid. But \"the solid economic recovery and encouraging signs in the labour market\" mean the \"pay pause\" can be lifted, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak will set out the plan in Wednesday's Budget. Labour says the \"government must work to ensure a fair settlement\".\nAs the US prepares to reopen its borders, new restrictions have been announced for those wishing to travel the country. Proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or a negative Covid test are among the rules outlined by the White House before they come into effect on 8 November. The US is adopting \"an air travel policy that relies primarily on vaccination to advance the safe resumption of international air travel to the United States,\" a proclamation signed by President Joe Biden says.\nCovid cases have been rising and health professionals have been among those calling for stricter Plan B measures to be introduced as pressure mounts on the NHS. But the recent rise in infections appears to have slowed and maybe starting to drop in England. This comes as modelling done for the government suggests cases and deaths could soon start to fall dramatically. So are cases about to plummet without the need to introduce Plan B? Health correspondent Nick Triggle has investigated.\nMore than 100,000 Scots most at risk from coronavirus are still waiting for a booster jab, figures from Public Health Scotland show. They have had the second dose of the vaccine more than six months ago so are eligible for the jab. The Scottish government says its booster programme, seen by scientists as a vital way to protect the most vulnerable, is \"on track\".\nIt was an emotional return for specialist diabetes podiatrist Neely Mozawala when she went back to London's ExCel centre where she'd vaccinated people against Covid-19. The Marvel and DC fan went back for the pop culture exhibition, MCM Comic Con, and revealed who she thinks the real superheroes are: \"Everyone working in the NHS during Covid,\" says the 29-year-old.

It was his first public reaction to critics since his special debuted on 5 October. He appeared at the show alongside popular podcaster Joe Rogan. \n\"It's been said in the press that I was invited to speak to transgender employees at Netflix and I refused,\" Chappelle, 48, told the audience.\n\"That is not true. If they had invited me I would have accepted it. Although I am confused about what we are speaking about... You said you want a safe working environment at Netflix. Well it seems like I'm the only one that can't go to the office anymore.\"\n\"To the transgender community, I am more than willing to give you an audience,\" he continued. \"But you will not summon me. I am not bending to anybody's demands.\"\nHe also denied that he was in conflict with the LGBT community, saying \"this has nothing to do with them. It's about corporate interests and what I can say and what I cannot say.\"\nLast week Netflix reported record subscriber numbers of 213.5 million globally.\nChappelle also said the special had led to him being disinvited from showing his latest documentary, Untitled, at film festivals.\n\"Today, not a film company, not a movie studio, not a film festival... will touch this film,\" he said, calling on people to see his new film and decide \"am I cancelled or not?\""

      "text": "Workers and occupations hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, official figures show.\nEmployees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work saw the sharpest dip and recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nA revival in pay rates for men has meant the gender pay gap has widened.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls from unions to give public sector workers a significant rise when a freeze on pay is lifted.\n\"We need a proper plan from the chancellor [at the Budget] to get pay rising across the economy,\" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady.\n\"That means a pay rise for all public sector workers that at least matches the cost of living. If Rishi Sunak does not increase department budgets the pay freeze will be over in name only.\"\nThe ONS figures show median weekly pay for full-time employees was \u00a3611 in April 2021, representing a 4.3% increase from the same month in the previous year.\nHowever, the change was far more dramatic for certain sections of the workforce, owing to furlough and other effects of the Covid crisis.\nFor example, employees aged 16 and 17 saw pay drop by 11.4% in 2019-20, before growing by 12.5% the following year.\nConstruction workers saw weekly pay go up by 16.8% in 2021 compared with a fall of 10.4% a year earlier. Manufacturing employees benefited from an 8.3% increase after a 3.1% drop previously.\nThere were also significant regional differences, with gross weekly earnings up by 8.8% in Northern Ireland, compared with a 1.1% rise in London, in 2021.\nNicola White, head of earnings at the ONS, said: \"After virtually flatlining last year at the start of the pandemic, earnings are returning to something like their long-term trend over the last few years.\n\"Increases this year were most marked for the groups worst affected in 2020, such as younger people, men and those in lowest-paid jobs.\"\nThe impact of the pandemic was different for men's pay compared with women's earnings, primarily due to furlough.\nThe recent rebound in pay for many men resulted in a worsening of the gender pay gap between male and female earners. In April 2020, the gap was 7%, but it was 7.9% in April this year, following previous improvements.\n\"This isn't a reversal of the trend, it is a bump caused by the pandemic,\" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \n\"When the 2020 study was carried out, more men were furloughed, and half were on temporarily lower pay, so the gap looked smaller than it actually was. When the 2021 study was done, the position was reversed, so it looked larger than it really was.\"\nMs Coles said the gender pay gap was affected significantly by how people lived their lives and brought flexibility of work into sharp focus.\n\"Children make an enormous difference, but the gap doesn't widen when women take time off with their first newborn, at the average age of 31. It is later, when they reach 40, that it opens up, so the relationship between pay and parenting is more complicated,\" she said."

      "tags": "Independent Office for Police Conduct",
      "text": "Police officers and staff who abuse their position for a sexual purpose have \"no place in policing and will be found out\", a watchdog has warned. \nFigures from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for referrals made in England and Wales last year were nearly double the 2016 numbers.  \nAbuse of Powers for a Sexual Purpose (APSP) referrals are the largest form of police corruption, the IOPC said.\nBetween 2016 and 2020, there were 643 referrals for abuse of position. \nThese resulted in 206 independent investigations. \nThe National Police Chiefs Council defines APSP as: \"Any behaviour by a police officer or police staff member, whether on or off duty, that takes advantage of their position as a member of the police service to misuse their position, authority or powers in order to pursue a sexual or improper emotional relationship with any member of the public.\"\nLast year there were 131 referrals and 70 investigations. That compares to 74 referrals in 2016, which led to 10 investigations.\nBetween April 2018 and March 2021, 66 police officers and members of staff have faced disciplinary proceedings. Misconduct was proven in 63 cases.\nOf the 52 who faced the more serious charge of gross misconduct, 38 are no longer serving and barred from policing for life - six were later convicted of criminal offences.\nNot all APSP allegations will be covered by these figures as many incidents will be investigated by the police forces themselves.\nIOPC deputy director general Claire Bassett described these cases as an \"appalling abuse of the public's trust\", which has a \"devastating impact on the people involved, who are often in a vulnerable situation\".\nShe said: \"The police are there to help them, not exploit them.\n\"Recent events we have seen, including the horrific actions of Wayne Couzens, remind us that policing must act to root out this kind of behaviour once and for all.\"\nIn 2017 legislation was introduced setting out the criteria in which mandatory referrals to the watchdog should be made, including an explicit reference to APSP, which has led to the steep rise in the number of cases being reported, the IOPC said.\nAPSP is the \"single largest form of police corruption\" the watchdog explained, accounting for around a quarter of all referrals and almost 60% of investigations last year. \nChief Constable Lauren Poultney from the National Police Chiefs' Council said: \"There is no place in policing for those who abuse their position for a sexual purpose.\"\n\"Any case of such abuse is one too many, it is a serious betrayal of what policing stands for and its duty to protect the public.\"\nSeparate figures obtained after a Freedom of Information Request by BBC Newsnight show the number of complaints made about police officers accused of sexual misconduct across the UK.\nOf the 44 out of 46 UK forces who responded, 2,702 police officers have been accused of sexual misconduct in the last five years.\nDisciplinary action taken from these allegations ended with three per cent of cases in criminal court, eight per cent with an officer dismissed and a further eight per cent issued with a reprimand.\nNewsnight spoke to a victim of domestic violence who was exploited by a serving officer.\nJessica (not her real name) reported she had been blackmailed about sexually explicit images of her being posted on the internet.\nAn officer she believed to be investigating repeatedly asked her for the explicit videos and images and sent explicit images of himself in return - including while in uniform.\nHe had previously contacted another woman in a similar way and received training about forming inappropriate relationships.\nThe officer was dismissed after a police misconduct hearing and barred for five years.\nCaroline Nokes MP, chairwoman of the women and equalities committee, told Newsnight officers who exploit vulnerable people should be \"barred forever\".\n\"It shouldn't be the case that they can serve a five-year bar and come back. That simply isn't protecting the vulnerable,\" the Conservative MP added."

      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to announce \u00a370m in funding to help small and medium sized enterprises (SME) in Northern Ireland in this week's budget.\nHer Majesty's Treasury said the funding will build on the British Business Bank's existing programmes to help SMEs to invest and grow. \nIt will provide loans or invest in local companies.\nThe way in which businesses can access the fund will be outlined in due course.\nLocal companies that may avail of the funding include recent start-ups looking to borrow smaller amounts to kickstart activity or established SMEs looking for larger investments to grow their business. \nThe funding will be part of a government commitment to level up opportunities.\nIt will build on the success of existing funds in other parts of the UK, which have been shown to support the creation of high-paying high productivity jobs and the upskilling of existing workforces, the Treasury said.\nDescribing Northern Ireland as a \"powerhouse of ingenuity\", Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK government was continuing to support small businesses across the country to grow and succeed. \n\"We're investing millions of pounds to help thousands of businesses take their next step,\" he said.\n\"Since the start of the pandemic, the UK government has spent \u00a3352bn right across the UK on support. \n\"In Northern Ireland this included protecting more than 284,000 jobs through the furlough scheme, \u00a3118m in self-employment support, help for businesses and the procurement of vaccines.\"\nIn addition to the \u00a370m for Northern Ireland, Scotland will benefit from \u00a3150m and Wales will receive \u00a3130m for a new fund delivered by the British Business Bank."

      "tags": "Exoplanets,Astronomy",
      "text": "Astronomers have found hints of what could be the first planet ever to be discovered outside our galaxy.\nNearly 5,000 \"exoplanets\" - worlds orbiting stars beyond our Sun - have been found so far, but all of these have been located within the Milky Way galaxy.\nThe possible Saturn-sized planet discovered by Nasa's Chandra X-Ray Telescope is in the Messier 51 galaxy.\nThis is located some 28 million light-years away from the Milky Way.\nThis new result is based on transits, where the passage of a planet in front of a star blocks some of the star's light and yields a characteristic dip in brightness that can be detected by telescopes.  \nThis general technique has already been used to find thousands of exoplanets.\nDr Rosanne Di Stefano and colleagues searched for dips in the brightness of X-rays received from a type of object known as an X-ray bright binary. \nThese objects typically contain a neutron star or black hole pulling in gas from a closely orbiting companion star. The material near the neutron star or black hole becomes superheated and glows at X-ray wavelengths.\nBecause the region producing bright X-rays is small, a planet passing in front of it could block most or all of the rays, making the transit easier to spot.\nThe team members used this technique to detect the exoplanet candidate in a binary system called M51-ULS-1.\n\"The method we developed and employed is the only presently implementable method to discover planetary systems in other galaxies,\" Dr Di Stefano, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, US, told BBC News.\n\"It is a unique method, uniquely well-suited to finding planets around X-ray binaries at any distance from which we can measure a light curve.\"\nThis binary contains a black hole or neutron star orbiting a companion star with a mass about 20 times that of the Sun. A neutron star is the collapsed core of what had once been a massive star.\nThe transit lasted about three hours, during which the X-ray emission decreased to zero. Based on this and other information, the astronomers estimate that the candidate planet would be around the size of Saturn, and orbit the neutron star or black hole at about twice the distance Saturn lies from the Sun.\nDr Di Stefano said the techniques that have been so successful for finding exoplanets in the Milky Way break down when observing other galaxies. This is partly because the great distances involved reduce the amount of light which reaches the telescope and also mean that many objects are crowded into a small space (as viewed from Earth), making it difficult to resolve individual stars.\nWith X-rays, she said, \"there may be only several dozen sources spread out over the entire galaxy, so we can resolve them.  In addition, a subset of these are so bright in X-rays that we can measure their light curves.\n\"Finally, the huge emission of X-rays comes from a small region that can be substantially or (as in our case) totally blocked by a passing planet.\"\nThe researchers freely admit that more data is needed to verify their interpretation.\nOne challenge is that the planet candidate's large orbit means it would not cross in front of its binary partner again for about 70 years, quashing any attempts to make a follow-up observation in the near-term.\nOne other possible explanation that the astronomers considered is that the dimming has been caused by a cloud of gas and dust passing in front of the X-ray source.\nHowever, they think this is unlikely, because the characteristics of the event do not match up with the properties of a gas cloud.\n\"We know we are making an exciting and bold claim so we expect that other astronomers will look at it very carefully,\" said co-author Julia Berndtsson of Princeton University, New Jersey. \n\"We think we have a strong argument, and this process is how science works.\"\nDr Di Stefano said that the new generation of optical and infrared telescopes would not be able to compensate for the problems of crowding and dimness, so observations at X-ray wavelengths would likely remain the primary method for detecting planets in other galaxies.\nHowever, she said a method known as microlensing might also hold promise for identifying extra-galactic planets.\nThe study has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Astronomy.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "tags": "Owen Paterson",
      "text": "Ex-minister Owen Paterson could be suspended from the Commons for 30 days after an MPs' watchdog found he had \"repeatedly\" used his position as an MP to benefit two companies who paid him as a consultant.\nThe watchdog described his actions as \"an egregious case of paid advocacy\".\nIn reply, the Conservative MP said: \"The process I have been subjected to does not comply with natural justice.\"\n\"I am not guilty and a fair process would exonerate me,\" he added.\nMr Paterson said the process was \"a major contributory factor\" in the death of his wife, Rose, who took her own life last year.\nThe committee said the allegations related to events which took place before Mrs Paterson's death.\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone opened an investigation into the North Shropshire MP following accusations he had lobbied on behalf of two companies who employed him.\nHer report said he was a paid consultant to Randox and Lynn's Country Foods and had made approaches to the Food Standards Agency and Department for International Development ministers about the companies. \nThe commissioner also found Mr Paterson had breached the MPs' code of conduct by using his parliamentary office on 16 occasions for meetings relating to his outside business interests between October 2016 and February 2020 - and in sending two letters relating to business interests on House of Commons headed notepaper.\nThe report noted that there was no immediate financial benefit secured by the two companies, but that Mr Paterson's approaches could \"clearly have conferred significant benefits on Randox and Lynn's in the long term and even in the short term secured meetings that would not have been available without Mr Paterson's involvement\".\nThe Standards Committee recommended that Mr Paterson, who is a former Northern Ireland Secretary, be suspended from Parliament for 30 sitting days, which will now be debated. \nIf an MP is suspended for more than 10 sitting days by a parliamentary committee, this can automatically trigger a recall petition - something which could lead to a by-election in their seat. \nMr Paterson has strongly denied any wrongdoing. \nSpeaking to the BBC, the former environment secretary said he was \"absolutely stunned\" by the report's recommendations. \nHe said he had wanted to alert the environment department about carcinogenic products in milk and ham, defending his actions as \"absolutely right\" and arguing that it had \"saved lives\". \n\"If it happened again this morning, I would do it again,\" he added.\nThe MP accused the commissioner and the committee of not talking to him until months into the investigation and failing to hear from his 17 witnesses.\nHe claims he was pronounced guilty by the commissioner \"without being spoken to\" and that \"no proper investigation was undertaken\".\nThe BBC has been told the committee interviewed Mr Paterson and reviewed all the witness statements he provided, while the commissioner offered Mr Paterson an interview but he didn't proceed with it.  \nA spokesperson for Randox said it was aware of the report, adding: \"Randox does not wish, or need, to comment on this investigation.  This is a matter for Mr Paterson and the relevant parliamentary authorities.\"\nA spokesperson for Lynn's Country Foods said the company would not be making a statement.\nIn Mr Paterson's response to the committee report he said: \"I lost my beloved wife of 40 years and this process was a major contributory factor.\" \nHe said the way the investigation was conducted \"undoubtedly played a major role\", saying: \"Rose would ask me despairingly every weekend about the progress of the inquiry, convinced that the investigation would go to any lengths to somehow find me in the wrong.\"\nMr Paterson told the BBC the investigation had \"destroyed the last quarter of my life\" and that his wife had been \"very rattled\" by the inquiry.\nIn the report, the committee said it was \"painfully conscious that Mr Paterson lost his wife in tragic circumstances in June 2020\".\n\"We wish to express our deepest sympathy to him for his loss - this last year must have been very distressing for him and we have taken these circumstances fully into account in considering Mr Paterson's conduct during the period of the investigation.\"\nHowever, the committee said the allegations related to conduct prior to Mrs Paterson's death and that \"it is these allegations on which we are required to adjudicate, impartially, without fear or favour, and with a sole eye to the rules of the House and the requirements of natural justice\".\nIt added that it was \"very possible that grief and distress caused by this event has affected the way in which Mr Paterson approached the Commissioner's investigation thereafter\".\nThe committee also noted other mitigating factors including Mr Paterson's ill health.\nThe committee said Mr Paterson's \"evident passion for and expertise\" in food and farming was \"admirable\" but warned it should be \"channelled within the rules of the House\".\nListing \"aggravating factors\" that influenced the recommended punishment for Mr Paterson, it said: \"No previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of behaviour in failing to separate private and public interests.\"\nIt added that \"Mr Paterson's financial remuneration from Randox and Lynn's amounted to nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary\" and that during the investigation Mr Paterson had \"made serious, personal, and unsubstantiated allegations against the integrity of the commissioner and her team\"."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,David Attenborough",
      "text": "\"If we don't act now, it'll be too late.\" That's the warning from Sir David Attenborough ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.  \nThe broadcaster says the richest nations have \"a moral responsibility\" to help the world's poorest. \nAnd it would be \"really catastrophic\" if we ignored their problems, he told me in a BBC News interview.  \n\"Every day that goes by in which we don't do something about it is a day wasted,\" he said.\nSir David and I were speaking at Kew Gardens in London during filming for a new landmark series, The Green Planet, to be aired on BBC1 next year.  \nOur conversation ranged from the latest climate science to the importance of COP26 to the pace of his working life. \nThe UN climate science panel recently concluded that it is \"unequivocal\" that human activity is driving up global temperatures.  \nAnd Sir David said that proved that he and others had not been making \"a fuss about nothing\", and that the risks of a hotter world are real.  \n\"What climate scientists have been saying for 20 years, and that we have been reporting upon, you and I both, is the case - we were not causing false alarms.  \n\"And every day that goes by in which we don't do something about it is a day wasted. And things are being made worse\". \nBut he said the report had not convinced everyone and that they are acting as a brake on efforts to tackle climate change.  \n\"There are still people in North America, there are still people in Australia who say 'no, no, no, no, of course it's very unfortunate that there was that forest fire that absolutely demolished, incinerated that village, but it's a one-off'. \n\"Particularly if it's going to cost money in the short term, the temptation is to deny the problem and pretend it's not there. \n\"But every month that passes, it becomes more and more incontrovertible, the changes to the planet that we are responsible for that are having these devastating effects.\" \nHis call for an urgent response reflects the latest scientific assessment that to avoid the worst impacts of rising temperatures, global carbon emissions need to be halved no later than 2030.  \nThat's why the coming years are described as \"the decisive decade\" and why the COP26 talks are so crucial for getting the world on a safer path now. \nAs things stand, emissions are projected to continue rising rather than starting to fall, and Sir David was sounding more exasperated than I've heard before. \n\"If we don't act now, it will be too late,\" he said. \"We have to do it now.\" \nWe turned to the question of responsibility, a highly contentious issue which will loom large at the conference. Developing countries have for years accused the richest nations, which were the first to start polluting the atmosphere, of failing to shoulder their share of the burden. \nThe argument is that they should be making the deepest cuts in carbon emissions and providing help to those who need it most.  A long-standing promise of $100bn a year for low carbon development and to build stronger defences against more violent weather has yet to be fulfilled - reaching that total will be a key test of whether COP26 succeeds or fails. \nFor Sir David, this is one of the most worrying challenges, and he says it would be \"really catastrophic\" if threats to the poorest nations were ignored.  \n\"Whole parts of Africa are likely to be unliveable - people will simply have to move away because of the advancing deserts and increasing heat, and where will they go? Well, a lot of them will try to get into Europe. \n\"Do we say, 'Oh, it's nothing to do with us' and cross our arms? \n\"We caused it - our kind of industrialisation is one of the major factors in producing this change in climate. So we have a moral responsibility.  \n\"Even if we didn't cause it, we would have a moral responsibility to do something about thousands of men, women and children who've lost everything, everything. Can we just say goodbye and say this is no business of ours?\" \nFinally I asked about his own hectic workload at the age of 95 - from filming documentaries to addressing the G7 summit, the UN Security Council and the Duke of Cambridge's Earthshot Prize.  \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\n\"I don't plan very far ahead - as you say, I'm 95. How long can you go on? It isn't within our gift to say those things or to know those things.  \n\"All I know is that if I get up tomorrow and I feel that I'm able to do a decent day's work, then I shall jolly well do it and be grateful.  \n\"And the day is going to come when I'm going to get out of bed and say, I don't think I can do that. When that's going to be, who knows? I don't.\" \nHaving watched him filming for five hours straight, and remaining not only focused but also good-humoured, I suggested that he still loved what he was doing.  \n\"At the moment, I feel it would be a waste of an opportunity just to back out and not do the things I think are very important to do in which I am well placed to do.\"  \nAnd the next major engagement in the Attenborough diary? Nothing less than speaking, virtually or in-person, to what's set to be the largest ever gathering of global leaders on British soil: COP26, in a few days' time.   "

      "text": "The price of a pint of beer will have to rise by as much as 30p to help pay for higher wages and energy costs, one pub company has warned. \nAs the government prepares to unveil its Budget, City Pub Group said price rises were \"the only way forward\".\nOn Monday, the government said the National Living Wage would rise to \u00a39.50 per hour in April for those over 23 years old.  \nClive Watson, the chain's boss, said this would cost it about \u00a31m a year. \nOther pub owners echoed Mr Watson's warning, with industry bodies calling for help for the sector.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said that while increases to the minimum wage and the minimum living rate would be \"welcomed\" by many staff in pubs, it was a further cost increase for pubs who were \"still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future\". \n\"It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,\" she added. \nWetherspoons, however, has announced it will cut drink prices next month on a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. \nBecks bottles and whisky measures will be sold for 99p at some branches. Wetherspoons said prices will be reduced at all of its almost 900 pubs but the discounts will vary. \nIn October, JD Wetherspoon reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks. \nThe firm was also recently affected by a shortage of some beer brands, caused by driver shortages due to a combination of Covid and Brexit.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak's latest Budget, to be delivered later, comes as the pub trade is still recovering from lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.\nCity Pub Group weathered the financial storm thanks to government assistance, putting 99% of its staff on furlough during the pandemic.  \n\"That's basically kept the industry on life support, but we're coming off life support now and we need to be able to have a road to recovery,\" Mr Watson told the BBC.\nLast month, the group, which owns 45 pubs, reported that sales had been above 90% of pre-pandemic levels since Covid restrictions were eased in May.\nBut now it faces further challenges - not just minimum wage rises, but also higher energy and food costs, as well as employers' national insurance contributions going up next April.\nThe price of beer \"would probably have to go up by 25 to 30p a pint\" to take account of all that, Mr Watson said.\n\"We want to do our bit - it's very important, but at the same time we don't want everything going up the whole time, because all that will do is stoke inflation,\" he added. \nUK inflation is expected to rise above 4% by the end of this year.  \nWhile Mr Watson said increases to the minimum wage were a \"good idea\", he warned that those increases could be \"gobbled up by other inflationary pressures\". \nHe said a more effective measure would be for the government to cut VAT as a way of reducing the cost of living. \nThe hospitality industry currently benefits from a reduced VAT rate of 12.5%, but that is due to revert to 20% in April.\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade group UK Hospitality, said the VAT tax rise would be \"unsustainable\" and mean that businesses would have \"no option\" but to pass the cost on to customers.\n\"We are facing into considerable headwinds with a bubble of inflationary pressures coming through the supply chain, as well as wage rate inflation,\" she added.\nCosts 'inevitably' passed on.\nMartin Greenhow, managing director at Mojo, a chain of six pubs in the north of England, said supply chain costs were \"certainly putting pressure\" on the business. \n\"If costs go up, prices go up, it's fairly inevitable,\" he said. \nAll of the 89 staff the firm employs are currently on or above the National Living Wage.\n\"The coming increase will of course affect everyone, as those above it will also expect to see a pro-rata increment which will cost the business thousands,\" he explained. \nMr Greenhow said that these staffing and supply costs would \"inevitably be passed on to the consumer\". \n\"Furlough and grants helped us survive, but essentially our survival was achieved by huge borrowings, which represent another cost to the business and therefore another inflationary driver.\"\nIan Ridley runs three pubs and the majority of his 50 staff earn the National Living Wage. \n\"Something's got to give, we cannot absorb these cost pressures,\" he explained.  \nAlthough he has not worked through the cost projections for next year yet, Mr Ridley estimates the price of a pint could rise by 20p.\n\"When we're trying to encourage customers to come back and we're compete with supermarkets on booze, higher prices are not going to help us,\" he told the BBC. \nThe wage increases will mean an estimated \u00a320,000 of extra costs, in addition to higher food, transport and brewery bills. \nRising energy costs are causing concern and Mr Ridley said the VAT hike in April and business tax rates were another \"huge worry\".

With Britain's longest-reigning monarch as a patient, every development in her health will be scrutinised.\nIt might be a high-profile responsibility but it's not a full-time position. \"My role at the medical household doesn't have fixed sessions, and it's as and when I'm needed,\" said 63-year-old Sir Huw, who was knighted this year.\nThe role of royal doctor was also \"completely different from what I would normally be doing\", he told Imperial College.\nWhen there were staff shortages during the pandemic, he helped with ward rounds at St Mary's - and he is also director of the Family Cancer Clinic at St Mark's Hospital in Harrow, north-west London. \nHe has a long-standing involvement in cancer research.\nIt's not known whether he was with the Queen for her medical checks at the King Edward VII hospital this week, but he is listed there as a consultant, with a specialism in gastroenterology.\nHe also works at another medical practice a few streets away from the Edward VII - a private hospital in Marylebone, used by the royals, which originally treated wounded officers from the Boer War.\nThere is a range of other doctors in the medical household and other medical officers who attend the Queen when she travels overseas - and other specialists could be consulted.\nAnother of her doctors, Peter Fisher, was killed in an accident when cycling in London three years ago.\nIn his comments to Imperial College, Sir Huw pointed to keeping people safe in the pandemic as a \"key priority\" for the medical household.\nBeing the doctor to the royals has always been a mixture of medicine and diplomacy, says Elizabeth Hurren, professor of modern history at the University of Leicester.\nFrom the Tudors to the 18th Century, royal doctors were \"as much psychological as diagnostic\" in their approach, offering soothing advice to people who were unlikely to take direct instructions, she says.\nHow would you tell a monarch, ancient or modern, to take a rest?\nProf Hurren, who has researched the history of medicine, says the doctor had to be one of the most trusted people in the royal circle. \"It was very intimate. They needed to entrust them with the most private parts of their lives.\"\nThere are continuous tensions that are still true into the present day, she says. \"How much medical information do you give the public? How do you maintain a sense of privacy?\" \nIn previous centuries, the monarch might have wanted to keep illnesses away from the eyes of the court, not wanting to show vulnerability. \"The court was alive with rumour and gossip,\" she says. And the doctor would be expected to keep medical problems confidential.\nProf Hurren says the role of the court is now played by the modern media - and the same questions of balancing privacy with public life are facing the present-day royal family and their doctors."

      "text": "Blue Origin, the space tourism company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has announced plans to launch a commercial space station. \nBosses said on Monday that they hope to operate the station, named \"Orbital Reef,\" by the end of the decade. \nPromotional material released by the company claims the station will be a \"mixed-use business park\" in space and will host up to 10 people. \nThe company will partner with Sierra Space and Boeing to build the outpost.\nBlue Origin said the 32,000 sq ft station would provide customers with an ideal location for \"film-making in microgravity\" or \"conducting cutting-edge research\" and said it would also include a \"space hotel\".\nAt a press conference to launch the initiative, executives from Blue Origin and Sierra Space declined to give an estimate of the building costs, though the project seems assured of heavy funding from Mr Bezos, who has committed to spending $1bn (\u00a3726m) a year on Blue Origin. \nThe announcement comes as Nasa searches for proposals to replace the 20-year-old International Space Station (ISS). While funding for the station has been guaranteed until at least 2030, the outpost is in desperate need of repairs. \nRussian officials have previously warned that its cosmonauts could leave the station by 2025 over fears outdated equipment could trigger a major incident. \nIn response, Nasa announced plans earlier this year to award $400m in private contracts to space companies to help the agency replace the ageing outpost. \nHowever, there is likely to be stiff competition for the funding. Earlier this week, a partnership between Nanoracks, Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin announced its own plans to launch a space station into low orbit by 2027. \nBlue Origin has faced mixed fortunes so far this year. High-profile launches of its New Shepard rocket, which saw Mr Bezos and Star Trek star William Shatner blasted into space, gained significant media attention. \nBut the company has also faced accusations of sexual harassment in the workplace and of turning a blind eye to serious safety concerns from former employees. \nLast month it missed out on a lucrative $2.9bn Nasa contract which went to billionaire Elon Musk's Space X, one of Blue Origin's chief rivals in the commercial space race."

      "tags": "Public sector,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Millions of public sector workers are set to see their wages rise next year, after the government confirmed a pay freeze is being lifted. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak will use his Budget on Wednesday to say nurses, teachers and members of the armed forces are among those set to benefit. \nA \"temporary pause\" in salary progression was introduced last November as a response to the pandemic.\nLabour says tax and price rises mean families face a cost of living crisis.\nThe public sector pay freeze was part of the government's response to what it described as the \"economic emergency\" caused by Covid, with only the lowest-paid excluded.\nIn his spending review in November 2020, Mr Sunak said he could not justify an across-the-board increase when many in the private sector had seen their pay and hours cut in the crisis.\nThe Treasury said exactly how much of a pay rise public sector workers receive depends on the recommendations from the independent pay review bodies, who set the pay for most frontline workforces - including nurses, police officers, prison officers and teachers.\nBut asked if public sector pay would rise above inflation, a Downing Street spokesperson said the independent pay review body would consider what the rise should be and that No 10 couldn't \"pre-judge that process\". \nSeparately, campaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the tax to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row at Wednesday's Budget.  \nThe BBC has also been told VAT on household energy would not be cut with the Treasury arguing it would be poorly targeted and that lower income households could be better helped through other schemes. \nIn an announcement on Monday, the Treasury said the chancellor would use his forthcoming Budget to say \"the solid economic recovery and encouraging signs in the labour market\" mean the \"pay pause\" can be lifted. \nIn a statement, Mr Sunak said: \"The economic impact and uncertainty of the virus meant we had to take the difficult decision to pause public sector pay.\n\"And now, with the economy firmly back on track, it's right that nurses, teachers and all the other public sector workers who played their part during the pandemic see their wages rise.\"\nBusiness Minister Paul Scully said it was \"important public sector workers are recognised for what they do and are rewarded fairly\".\nHe said it was part of a number of measures to help people on low incomes, which also included the rise in the national living wage announced on Monday.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \"We know there are pressures. We know this is a difficult time for the economy, for people in the country in terms of the cost of living.\"\nThe Treasury said the \"temporary pause\" had helped ensure the gap between public and private sector pay did not widen further during the height of the pandemic. \nIt said public sector average weekly earnings rose by 4.5% in 2020/21 whilst private sector wage increases were a third lower than they were pre-crisis, at 1.8%.\nOn Tuesday figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that workers and occupations hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, with employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work seeing the sharpest dip and recovery.\nIt comes at a time of fierce debate about the pressure families are under amid soaring energy bills and price rises for goods in shops. \nOpposition MPs have accused the Conservatives of presiding over a cost of living crisis with cuts to universal credit and tax rises to fund the NHS and social care.\nThere is disquiet among some Conservative backbenchers too about whether ministers should be doing more to help struggling households. \nThere may be an element of relief for some public sector workers that their pay will at at least not be frozen for another year. \nBut it may not be enough to lift the bitterness many feel that in the year when many of them were key workers, often risking their health on the frontlines of the pandemic, they're coping with a real terms pay cut. \nEven nurses, who've received more than most, have seen their spending power shrink as inflation gets above 3%. And that renewed squeeze on living standards is getting worse with record petrol prices and energy bills driving up the cost of living. \nWhat shouldn't be taken at face value is the notion that the government \"can't afford\" to pay more. What a government that issues its own currency decides it can or cannot \"afford\" has no objective economic basis, but is a matter of political choice.  \nFor example, as the IFS points out, the cost of servicing debt is lower than it was pre-pandemic. In fact, it's the second lowest it's been since the 1950s. \nEven if official interest rates rise to 1.25%, they will still be historically low - and that is manageable as long as tax receipts are rising faster than the debt servicing cost. \nWith teachers' pay in real terms 8% lower than a decade ago, hospital consultants 9% lower, NHS dentists 32% down, a reality is coming home: you can't get the work done if you can't attract the staff to do it. \nThe cost of not allowing pay rises - in the harm it could to the government's other goals such as better public health and education - could have been higher than any pay rise. \nThe UK's largest union, Unison, said the pay freeze would continue \"in all but name\" unless government departments get extra money. \nIts general secretary Christina McAnea said while there was \"never a good time to freeze public sector pay\", to do so \"at the peak of a pandemic was the height of folly\" while \"staff were doing their all to keep under-pressure services running\".\nShe added: \"There can be no decent public services without the people to run them.\n\"Pay freezes don't help employers hold on to experienced staff, nor attract new recruits. \n\"But if the chancellor doesn't allocate extra money to government departments to fund the much-needed wage rises, the pay freeze will continue in all but name.\" \nTorsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation described the announcement as \"blindingly obvious\" adding that it was \"totally inevitable\" the pay freeze would be lifted. \n\"What we don't know, is what is going to happen to public sector pay - lifting the freeze is one thing, but a rise could be anything between 0 to a million per cent pay rise.\"\nLabour says many of those working on the frontline dealing with Covid are among those being hit by the government's choices. \nShadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said: \"This Conservative government's choice last year to freeze pay for so many frontline workers, who have been among the real heroes of the pandemic, was damaging and unsustainable. \n\"The government must work to ensure a fair settlement and reflect the vital work of all key workers including many who have been burnt out over the course of the pandemic.\"\nMeanwhile, the Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has told MPs it was \"not acceptable\" to brief the media ahead of MPs about the Budget.\nSir Lindsay said that ministers used to \"walk\" if they briefed about a Budget."

      "text": "An Edinburgh bookshop owner has been hailed a hero by Hollywood actor Tom Hanks for \"keeping typewriters alive\".\nTom Hodges typed a letter to the film star this summer and received a reply from the actor praising his work.\nThe 35-year-old has invited Hanks to visit his shop, Typewronger Books, while the National Museum of Scotland's typewriting exhibition is on show. \nMr Hodges, Scotland's only typewriter mechanic, said he was \"overjoyed\" to receive the letter.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"The reason this is cool for me is not the same as it is for everyone else.\n\"He might be a big Hollywood actor but for me it's all about his love of typewriters.\n\"There are a few typewriter geeks, such as Ben Aleshire in New Orleans and Luke Winter who has the Glasgow Story Wagon, but Tom Hanks gets the crown.\"\nMr Hodges typed the letter to Hanks about two months ago from his grandfather's old Remington Noiseless typewriter explaining all about his life and how he came to be a typewriter mechanic and \"geek\". He also inserted an origami dragon that he had made.\nMr Hodges said: \"I told him how I had run away from Edinburgh to live a Bohemian life in Paris and lived as a Tumbleweed at the Shakespeare and Company bookshop.\n\"It is a bookshop in Paris where you can sleep and live there. You turn up and if they have a space you can stay.\n\"The tradition there is to be kind to strangers lest they be angels in disguise. I arrived dressed like a mad parrot in all my colours and floor-length coat.\n\"I think it was a very good disguise as they let me stay. It has lots of nooks and crannies you can sleep in.\n\"They had old decrepit typewriters and it was there I taught myself to fix them so I could encourage the other Tumbleweeds to write on them.\"\nOn headed notepaper from the set of the Baz Luhrman-directed Elvis biopic, Hanks celebrated Mr Hodges for \"battling against the giants to sell the best of books - and keep typewriters alive\" as he hinted he may pay the capital a visit in the near future.\nMr Hodges said he was very curious when the letter arrived at his shop.\n\"I had no idea it was from him,\" he said. \"I get letters from all over the world and then I saw the letterhead and thought 'interesting'.\n\"Then inside it said Tom Hodges you are my hero and I flipped to the bottom and there was Tom Hanks' name.\n\"It was a proper type-written letter with his mistakes x'd out. \n\"Typewriter mechanics hate Tipp-ex because it gets in the mechanics so it was great to see he had x'd out his mistakes instead.\"\nHanks' letter had the insignia of The King's notorious manager Colonel Tom Parker - set to be portrayed by the actor in the film due for release next year - as he wrote the letter from that set.\nIn a 2019 interview with the New York Times, Hanks said he had collected typewriters since he was a teenager.\nAt one point he had hundreds of the machines, which he described as \"brilliant combinations of art and engineering.\" He now has 120.\nMr Hodges said: \"I hope he gets to see the [typewriter] exhibition at one point.\n\"It would be lovely to meet him. He seems like a really wonderful man.\n\"I would want to talk to him about typewriters an awful lot.\n\"I'm overjoyed with his letter, it's a marvellous thing.\""

      "text": "There was an \"unjustified reliance\" on firefighters to evacuate Grenfell Tower on the night of the fatal fire, a union has told the inquiry into the disaster.\nThe Fire Brigades Union said building owners and managers should draw up evacuation plans to prevent future catastrophes.\nUnion lawyer Martin Seaward said there was a \"near total failure\" of fire safety measures at Grenfell Tower.\nThe June 2017 disaster at the west London tower block killed 72 people.\nThe comments came on the final day of closing statements in a section of the inquiry focusing on the fire safety measures in the building, its management, risk assessment and the communication with residents.\nMr Seaward criticised the approach to fire safety taken by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO).\nHe told the inquiry on Tuesday the \"hazardous rainscreen cladding system\" should have been identified as a risk and removed by April 2016.\n\"Additionally, the near total failure of all the active and passive fire safety measures allowed the rapid deterioration of conditions inside the tower, which grossly impeded the firefighters' operations, including search and rescue,\" Mr Seaward said.\nMr Seaward added if the fire risk management system from the tenant management organisation had worked \"most, if not all\" of the people who died would have been saved.\nThe lawyer argued to the inquiry the safety plans were characterised by an \"unjustified reliance\" on the London Fire Brigade to evacuate residents, \"including those especially at risk in the event of fire in Grenfell tower\".\nMr Seaward said: \"Of course, the fire and rescue service will attend and do its best at any fire or other emergency, but fire safety depends on everyone doing their bit.\n\"That very much includes responsible persons developing and practising building-specific evacuation plans for residents, including personal emergency evacuation plans for those especially at risk, in the same way that employers do in office blocks or factories.\"\nAnne Studd QC, representing London Mayor Sadiq Khan, told the inquiry the tenant management organisation did \"very little\" to see if Grenfell was suitable for the stay put strategy in its fire assessments and Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council (RBKC) had limited oversight of them.\n\"The evidence before you, Mr Chairman, has demonstrated a culture of failings in transparency and candour by the KCTMO, which, coupled with a lack of intrusion from RBKC, was a toxic combination,\" she said.\nJames Maxwell-Scott QC, representing the council, told the inquiry it \"apologised unreservedly\" again for council failings before the disaster.\nThe failings included the number of council officers devoted to monitoring the KCTMO being \"insufficient\" and its housing commissioning team not making enough use of the corporate health and safety team's expertise to \"prevent issues falling between the gaps,\" he said. \nThe lawyer added the KCTMO was an independent, managing agent of Grenfell Tower which was at an \"arm's length\" from the council, which was the building's landlord.\n\"The council fully admits that it retained some control over the tower, and therefore continued to have some responsibilities for it under the Fire Safety Order. But those responsibilities are better described as residual ones than shared primary ones,\" he told the inquiry."

      "text": "The authorities would have been led to \"the bomb\" if they had followed the Manchester Arena attacker on his return from Libya, an inquiry has heard.\nGiving evidence, a senior MI5 officer agreed if Salman Abedi had been trailed when he returned to the UK, he could \"conceivably\" have revealed his plans.\nThe Manchester Arena Inquiry previously heard it was an error not to question him on 18 May 2017.\nAbedi detonated a device at the venue on 22 May 2017, killing 22 people.\nThe MI5 officer, referred to as Witness J, has been giving evidence as the public inquiry looks into what was known about Abedi before the bombing.\nThe hearing was told that, following his arrival at Manchester Airport on 18 May, the 22-year-old took a bus a very short distance before getting a taxi he had ordered with a new sim card purchased at the airport.\nThe taxi took Abedi directly to a car that had been used to store explosives.\nPete Weatherby QC, representing families of those who died, asked if Abedi had engaged in \"anti-surveillance\" techniques following his arrival at the airport.\n\"You could clearly draw that inference,\" Witness J said.\nThe killer would \"have taken you the bomb\" had he been followed, Mr Weatherby said.\n\"Conceivably, yes,\" the witness replied, but he added that it would have taken a \"high priority operation\" to have detected what was happening.\nThe inquiry previously heard Abedi was not stopped at the airport or investigated after he arrived in the UK.\nChairman Sir John Saunders asked the witness how MI5 had concluded that a port stop - where someone is questioned and searched - could not have prevented the attack, given it cannot be known what would have been found.\nWitness J said that was the view of internal MI5 experts, which he agreed with.\nDuncan Atkinson QC, representing other bereaved relatives, said a search of Abedi's phone could have shown recipes for explosives, images of the target or discussions of the plot.\nHe added that the mere act of searching and questioning him could have prevented the planned attack.\nSir John said that \"on the face of it\", stopping Abedi at the border might have \"caused a different result\", as could a faster internal MI5 process for reassessing people who had previously been investigated by the service.\nThe witness refused to say whether MI5 had asked for an associate of the Abedi brothers to be questioned at Manchester Airport on 23 March 2017.\nThe man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was stopped trying to leave the UK and his phones were downloaded. He then left the country the following month.\nHe was travelling on a one-way ticket, carrying three phones, a large amount of cash and camouflage clothing, the inquiry heard.\nOne phone was later found to contain evidence showing the man ordering sulphuric acid on behalf of the Abedi brothers, which they used to make explosives.\nMessages from the man to the bomber's brother Hashem Abedi were read out in court, in which he used the word \"oil\" to refer to the acid, which Mr Weatherby said \"undermined\" any innocent explanation for his involvement.\nOne text said \"the oil has arrived to your delight\" and another \"God bless you in the end and in salvation\".\nWitness J told the inquiry he could not discuss \"in open\" what MI5 knew or did not know about the phone evidence.\nMr Weatherby also said it was a \"rash statement\" for MI5 to say its current assessment is that only Salman and Hashem Abedi were knowingly involved in the attack plot, given the evidence relating to other people and the fact there are formal outstanding suspects in the case.\nFollowing the two days of evidence from the MI5 officer, John Cooper QC read out a statement on behalf of several bereaved families.\nIt said that it seemed clear to the families \"that there have been significant failings by MI5 that need to be addressed\".\nFrom Monday, there will be three weeks of closed hearings during which MI5 will be questioned by the inquiry's lawyers in the absence of the families and their barristers.\nAddressing Witness J directly, who was shielded from the families by a wooden box while giving evidence, he continued to read the statement.\n\"We are not able to be part of the closed session, but we urge you on behalf of those that were murdered on that night to fully co-operate,\" it said.\nIt added a plea for MI5 to be \"humble, accountable and fully open with the inquiry legal team\", adding: \"Do not fail us again.\"\nThe inquiry continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "title": "Covid: Are cases about to plummet without Plan B?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Rising Covid cases have been putting both the NHS and ministers under huge pressure.\nBut could this be about to change - and change quite dramatically?\nIt is dangerous to read too much into a few days of data - especially given the way infection levels in the south-west of England have been skewed by the lab test failings. But the recent rise that has caused so much concern does appear to have slowed and maybe is starting to drop in England.\nAnd despite all the talk about the need for the government to introduce Plan B - working from home, mandatory mask wearing and vaccine passports - there is actually a school of thought that we may be on the brink of seeing infection levels plummet.\nModelling done for the government suggests cases and deaths could soon start to fall dramatically. \nThat though is dependent on a number of factors, including the vast majority of over-50s coming forward for their boosters, and a degree of cautious behaviour throughout winter when it comes to mixing and socialising.\nThis model, based on estimated total infections rather than those that come forward for testing and get reported in daily data, comes from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which is just one of the groups that feeds into the government.\nIt is certainly the most optimistic at the moment, although what is noticeable is that the others produced by Imperial College London and University of Warwick also point to some degree of decrease being the most realistic scenario.\nTo understand why this may happen, you have to look at what has been driving the infection rates in recent weeks. \nDuring the summer, rising infections were being recorded largely in older teenagers, and then, since school returned, the high rates have been sustained by younger teenagers.\nIn the most recent week, nearly half of cases have been in the under-20s.\nThis has happened with relatively little spillover into older age groups. Once the virus had passed through these groups, who after all were the people least protected by the vaccine, there was always going to be a drop-off in infection levels because of the high levels of natural immunity acquired.\nThat in turn reduces that relatively small risk of infections being passed on to older age groups, while the rollout of boosters tops up their protection levels. \nAll the new modelling is quick to stress that there is still a huge amount of uncertainty over exactly when a sustained drop will happen and how far case numbers will fall.\nThat is because infection levels are driven by two basic things - the type and amount of mixing people do, and the strength of immunity in the population.\nOn both counts, there is much that is unknown. Experts still do not fully understand to what extent immunity from two doses of vaccination wanes or how many people will come forward for boosters.\nAnd, of course, predicting human behaviour and what happens to mixing patterns is very difficult.\nProf John Edmunds, who leads the modelling group at LSHTM, says these are all reasons why it is hard to be precise about what will happen and when. However, he certainly expects a \"hiatus\" to kick in at some point over the winter, pointing out that all the models are suggesting this to some extent.\nHe is, though, still worried about Christmas, which is a period when there is a lot of inter-generational mixing, and a possible rebound in Covid in the spring.\nThe modelling does though raise a question over whether Plan B is needed at this stage.\nProf Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases at University of Edinburgh, agrees a drop over winter is certainly possible. \nBut he still believes extra measures are worth taking as a \"precautionary step\", reducing the risk of more drastic action being needed further down the line at a time when other respiratory viruses, such as flu, will just add to the pressure on the NHS.\nHe says the situation with Covid is so finely balanced that a small swing towards greater mixing or more waning than expected could make a big difference. \nIt may also take a little time for the falls to start having an impact.\n\"The number of hospitalisations are at such a level currently that we really cannot tolerate much more of an increase,\" he adds.\nBut he says the attention given to Plan B has masked some of the arguably more important issues.\n\"There are five million adults in the UK who have not even had one dose and we know unvaccinated people are far more likely to be hospitalised by Covid - I don't know why there is not more attention given to this.\"\nOn top of this there is the fact that only half of cases appear to be coming forward to get tested - surveillance data from the Office for National Statistics suggests the true level of infection is twice what is being reported daily.  \"We need to do better at finding cases and supporting people to self-isolate,\" he adds. \nMaking progress on those, according to Prof Woolhouse, is even more important than Plan B.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "Leading global coal and gas supplier Australia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison however said the plan would not include ending Australia's fossil fuel sectors.\nThe nation will also not set ambitious targets for 2030 - an objective of next month's COP26 global climate summit.\nHis plan has drawn criticism, with Murdoch University fire ecology expert Joe Fontaine saying it had \"all the strength of a wet paper bag\".\nAustralia has long dragged its heels on climate action. It has some of the highest emissions per head of population and is a massive exporter of fossil fuels.\nStrategic allies the US and UK have both pledged to cut emissions faster. The UK has pledged that all its electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035, while the US has announced plans to halve its emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. \n\"We won't be lectured by others who do not understand Australia. The Australian Way is all about how you do it, and not if you do it. It's about getting it done,\" Mr Morrison wrote in a newspaper column on Tuesday.\nTo halt the worst effects of climate change, nations have pledged to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C by 2050. \nThis requires cutting emissions by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050, scientists say. Over 100 nations have committed to carbon neutrality. \nNet zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is achieved by a combination of cutting emissions as much as possible - mainly by reducing gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), which are released in the use of fossil fuels - and so-called offsetting measures, such as planting trees and carbon-capture technology.\nMr Morrison announced an investment of more than A$20bn (\u00a311bn; $15bn) in \"low-emissions technologies\" over the next 20 years - such as efforts to capture carbon in soil, lower solar energy costs, and developing greener industries. \nBut Australia will also use more gas, at least in the short term. Most controversially, there is no plan to limit fossil fuels. \n\"We want our heavy industries, like mining, to stay open, remain competitive and adapt, so they remain viable for as long as global demand allows,\" Mr Morrison wrote.\nAustralia's 2030 commitment will remain a 26% cut on 2005 emissions. It is currently on track for a 30-35% reduction, the government said. \nWhile the 2050 pledge has been widely welcomed, the government has been ferociously criticised for not offering more details.\nAustralia's Climate Council think tank said it was \"a joke without strong emissions cuts this decade\". \nMany said the government has been too slow on climate action, despite seeing first-hand impacts such as bushfires, floods and drought.\n\"The word plan doesn't constitute a plan no matter how many times you say it,\" said Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese.\nScott Morrison's announcement is worth noting not because it offers anything different to other countries, but because of how late to the party Australia is!\nThis announcement took months of political wrangling and was left down to the wire with days before the COP26 summit in Glasgow. \nThat the government had to make political concessions to its junior coalition partner - the National Party - shows you how complicated and politically divisive climate action is in Australia. \nThe Nationals represent electorates in regional areas where most high-emission industries like coal mining are based. After days of toing and froing, they backed the 'process'. \nThe prime minister assured Australians the target will not mean paying more for their energy bills. \"Technology not taxes,\" he said. \nHe addressed regional Australians directly and said the plan won't involve shutting down coal and gas production or exports. He talked about billions of dollars invested in low-emission technologies. The government's plan would \"strike a balance\", Mr Morrison said. \nBut he failed to explain how this balance will be struck. How the government will square keeping its coal industry, for example, and reaching net zero by 2050 - and what role technology will play in all of that. Especially when Canberra won't budge on its much-criticised 2030 targets.\nWhile this is a big moment for Australia, the details are still murky and potentially problematic on how net zero will be achieved. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "McDonald's workers walked out at restaurants in 12 US cities in protest at the fast food giant's handling of sexual harassment claims. \nOrganisers, who have held five strikes over harassment since 2018, say McDonald's has \"largely ignored\" frontline workers who complain.\nCashiers and cooks walked out in Chicago, Detroit, Houston and Miami among other places on Tuesday.\nThe chain said \"sexual harassment and assault have no place\" at McDonald's.\nIt is not clear how many in total have joined the strike. \nAccording to Fight for $15, the campaign group organising the action, workers have filed more than 50 complaints and lawsuits alleging harassment at corporate-owned and franchise McDonald's outlets since 2016.\nCampaigners claim the chain does little to tackle the problem at franchise-run restaurants, which make up the majority, but also at corporate-owned outlets. Moreover, staff who have spoken out have faced retaliation, such as having their hours cut or being fired, organisers say. \n\"I'm going on strike because despite years of protests, McDonald's still refuses to take responsibility for the countless women and teenagers who face harassment on the job at its stores across the globe,\" said Jamelia Fairley, a McDonald's worker in Sanford, Florida.\n\"No matter what McDonald's says, not much has changed for workers like me.\"\nIn a 2020 survey of nearly 800 female workers at McDonald's restaurants and franchises, three-quarters said they were harassed at work. \nIn the same survey, which was commissioned by unions, 71% said that they suffered consequences for reporting the behaviour.\nAfter a review of workplace safety earlier this year, McDonald's said it will require all workers, at both corporate and franchise-owned stores, to undergo anti-harassment training from next January. \nHowever, campaigners say the announcement is \"short on specifics\", including what might happen to those who fail to follow the rules. \nIn a statement, McDonald's said it was committed to \"thoroughly investigating\" allegations at its corporate-owned restaurants, and that it expected its franchisees to \"uphold a similar standard\".\n\"Every single person working at a McDonald's restaurant deserves to feel safe and respected when they come to work, and sexual harassment and assault have no place in any McDonald's restaurant,\" it said.\n\"We know more work is needed to further our workplace ambitions, which is why all 40,000 McDonald's restaurants [worldwide] will be assessed and accountable to global brand standards.\n\"These standards prioritise action in multiple areas, including prevention of harassment, discrimination and retaliation.\""

      "text": "VAT on household energy bills will not be cut in the Chancellor's Budget on Wednesday, despite calls to help families struggling with soaring prices.\nLabour has been calling for the rate to be slashed from 5% to zero for the next six months to help households get through a \"tough winter\".\nBut Whitehall sources have told the BBC such a move would be poorly targeted.\nThey say lower income households can be better helped through other schemes.\nRising energy bills have been causing alarm to families and political leaders amid warnings from the energy regulator, Ofgem, of more \"significant rises\" next spring. \nThe cap on prices, which went up earlier this month for households in England, Scotland and Wales, is due to be reviewed again next April, with the expectation that it will climb further. \nWhen the price cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nEven if wholesale gas prices were to drop significantly from now, the extra costs that suppliers have had to shoulder in the last couple of months means a steep rise in household bills in April is inevitable.\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, who was speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show last Sunday, said many households were facing a \"tough winter\".\nShe said: \"When we pay our gas and electricity bills, 5% of that money goes automatically to the taxman.\n\"There's something very simple the government could do. It would be immediate and it would be felt automatically on people's bills next month - and that is to cut that rate of VAT from 5% to 0%.\"\nShe said VAT receipts had come in more than \u00a32bn higher than forecast because of rising prices, giving the chancellor some wriggle room to act.\nThe charity, National Energy Action, which campaigns to combat fuel poverty, said a further 1.2 to 1.5m households could struggle to heat and power their homes next April, on top of the 4m people already estimated to be behind on their bills. \nIt is calling on the chancellor to help poorer households with Winter Fuel Payments.\nDirector of policy, Peter Smith, said: \"Treasury coffers could be boosted by as much as \u00a3100m directly through VAT receipts on rising energy prices.\n\"Carbon tax revenues have also risen sharply because of the gas crisis, adding an additional \u00a31bn in revenue to the Treasury on top of \u00a34bn already made this calendar year.\"\nThe Treasury said support was offered through existing schemes instead such as \"warm home\" discounts, cold weather payments and winter fuel allowances. \nOn Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who was also speaking on the Marr programme, said there was \"no magic wand\" to make the problems disappear. \nHe said there were several factors contributing to high inflation, such as pressure on global supply chains as economies have reopened after Covid, and soaring energy prices."

Any vaccines approved by US health regulators will be accepted. \nUnvaccinated travellers, including Americans, will have to show a negative Covid test taken within one day of departure. \nChildren under the age of 18 will be exempt from the vaccination requirement but must still provide a negative test taken within three days of travel. \nThe new restrictions take effect on 8 November."

      "text": "Britain's turkey farmers will do their best to ensure Christmas \"is as normal as it can be\" but shortages are likely, an industry representative has warned.\nThe government has assured consumers that turkeys will be available for the festive season.\nMinisters are pinning their hopes on overseas workers brought in on temporary visas to \"save Christmas\".\nBut Graeme Dear, from the British Poultry Council, told MPs the scheme had come too late.\n\"We have been given access through the seasonal workers scheme for up to 5,500 [employees] but that finishes on 31 December,\" he said.\n\"We would have loved to have known about that in June, and therefore could have placed enough turkeys for a full Christmas.\"\nHe added that farmers \"will do our utmost to make sure Christmas is as normal as it can be,\" but told MPs: \"There is a likelihood there will be a shortage\". \nHe said his industry was facing a 16% reduction in its workforce.\nEarlier this month, Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden told Sky News: \"We will make sure that people have their turkeys for Christmas.\n\"I know that for the Environment Secretary George Eustice, this is absolutely top of his list.\"\nOther farming industry representatives blamed shortages on Brexit and Covid, and urged the government to ease restrictions on immigration, in evidence to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. \nTom Bradshaw, of the National Farmers' Union, said labour shortages were \"our number one challenge\".\nHe cited daffodil farms, which he said were down a third on their usual staff numbers, leading to nearly a quarter of their crop going to waste.\nAnd he added that courgettes, apples and autumn raspberries had not been picked, in addition to \"the tragic cull in the pig sector\".\n\"Many businesses are mothballing their facilities... I've never seen the industry in this position and the real lack of confidence is crippling the sector,\" he added.\nHis comments were echoed by Derek Jarman, from the British Protected Ornamentals Association, who said the flowers and plants industry were facing a 25% reduction in labour next year.\n\"That will mean crops un-harvested - the market is there but not the labour to produce them,\" he said.\n\"We're all frightened, we're all in great fear, we don't know what to do, I've never seen it like this in my entire life, never.\"\nConservative MP Sheryll Murray asked the witnesses what was the dominant reason for the shortages.\nMr Jarman blamed Brexit for workers leaving the UK, telling the committee: \"We as a nation said 'we don't want you'.\"\nCharlie Dewhirst, a policy adviser for the National Pig Association said the coronavirus pandemic had been \"an accelerator of so many issues\".\n\"It is almost 50:50,\" said Mr Dear arguing that a lot of EU citizens left in \"the run up\" to Brexit but the pandemic \"encouraged\" others to \"go home\". \nAsked if labour shortages could be filled by the UK population, Mr Bradshaw noted that unemployment is \"very low\".\nHe said the industry had been told the end of the furlough scheme, introduced during the pandemic, would result in high unemployment and that \"we would recruit from that pool\".\n\"It's now not happened so where is the pool of labour,\" he asked, \nThe government has said firms should pay higher wages to attract staff.\nAsked about labour shortages in farming earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC the industry could not \"simply go back to the tired, failed, old model, reach for the lever called 'uncontrolled immigration' get people in, low wages\".\nIn October, the government announced a number of measures to ease pressure on the pig industry including extending its seasonal workers scheme to pork butchers.\nThe Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme allows farmers to recruit overseas on a quota basis - but Mr Bradshaw said the numbers should be expanded and extended to other areas such as the ornamental sector.

      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "A US government panel has voted to recommend the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine should to be given to children aged five to 11.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experts backed the move on Tuesday, paving the way for emergency authorisation within a matter of weeks. \nIn September, the company said its trial data showed the Covid jab was safe for children in that age group.\nThe US is already giving the vaccine to those aged 12 and over. \nThis latest decision affects some 28 million US children.\nThe decision now awaits further approval from the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They are expected to do that on 2 November, meaning vaccinations could begin the very next day.\nThe FDA's expert panel determined that the benefits of having the jab outweigh any other health risks. \nCompany trial data submitted to regulators in September said the jabs produced a \"robust\" antibody immune response in that age bracket. \nChildren aged five to 11 are given a jab with a third of the dosage given to adults. \nRegulators, however, also had to weigh up the risk of heart inflammation, a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. \nOfficial data from the US shows 160 children aged five to 11 have died of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. In total, the country has recorded close to 740,000 deaths from the virus.\nBut millions have contracted the illness, thousands of whom ended up in hospital. The US has also reported more than 5,000 cases of a rare inflammatory disease linked to Covid infections, which has killed 46 children.\nOn Monday, Moderna announced it would submit trial data to regulators after a study found its own Covid vaccine produced a \"robust neutralising antibody response\" in children aged six to 11.\nThe UK has just begun to roll out jabs for children aged 12 to 15. The country's chief medical officers recommend one dose of a vaccine for children in that age group, although approaches differ in other countries. \nThis is a landmark decision that could influence practice in other countries, not just the US.\nSome nations, like Israel, have already intimated that they plan to follow suit.\nThe US regulator has carefully weighed the pros and cons and says there is a case for vaccinating younger children against Covid. \nAlthough most children are unlikely to get seriously ill if they catch coronavirus, they may still be infectious, even with no symptoms. \nThe vaccine could help stop them from spreading the virus to others. \nAnd some young children can still get sick with Covid. The vaccine would guard against that too.\nThe world will be watching how the rollout goes with the Pfizer jab and what impact it has on the pandemic. "

      "tags": "Our Planet Now,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "A key pledge ahead of an upcoming climate change conference has still not been met and the money is not sure to be available before 2023.\nThe UK government has set out a new financing plan ahead of next week's climate change conference - COP26.\nIt talks of how developed countries hope to deliver $100bn a year in climate finance to developing countries. \nThe original aim was for that target to be reached by 2020.\nBut the financing plan said the target looked \"unlikely\" to be met but that it was \"confident\" the target would be hit by 2023.\nSome environmentalists say the new plan is too little, too late. \nCOP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma said: \"This plan recognises progress, based on strong new climate finance commitments. There is still further to go, but this delivery plan, alongside the robust methodological report from the OECD, provides clarity, transparency and accountability. \n\"It is a step towards rebuilding trust and gives developing countries more assurance of predictable support.\"\nClimate finance plays a critical role in helping developing countries tackle climate change and adapt to its impacts. \nIn 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilise $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020, and in 2015 agreed to extend this goal through to 2025.\nHowever, the UK COP26 Presidency now says the $100bn goal is likely to fall short in 2021 and 2022 - though is confident it will be met in 2023.\nMohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, said: \"To provide confidence and momentum going into COP26, the $100bn climate finance goal must be met immediately, not in 2023. \n\"The financing announcement is extremely disappointing in that it asks us as developing countries to wait even longer for the delivery of a promise that was first made more than a decade ago. I know the UK presidency has worked very hard for this, and I appreciate their efforts, but this is not sufficient to lay the groundwork for a successful outcome at COP26. \n\"Unless more progress is made in the next fortnight, we will all be in trouble. \"\nThe finance delivery plan was produced by Jonathan Wilkinson and Jochen Flasbarth, environment ministers from Canada and Germany, respectively, at the request of Mr Sharma.\nCanadian finance minister Jonathan Wilkinson was keen to stress that in his view the plan would achieve the $100bn goal per year over the 2020-2025 period.\n\"We have much greater confidence that the goal that was agreed upon will in fact, be achieved, and in fact, it will be overachieved beyond 2023 so I think that's very good news. \n\"And I think that, perhaps through this process, we've moved the bar in terms of how we can provide greater confidence and transparency going forward.\"\nOn Monday, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said it was \"touch and go\" whether the upcoming COP26 global climate conference will secure the agreements needed to help tackle climate change.\n\"It is going to be very, very tough this summit. I am very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it is touch and go, it is very, very difficult, but I think it can be done,\" he said.\nIn the meantime, the climate crisis continues to deepen: the World Meteorological Organization has said the build-up of warming gases in the atmosphere rose to record levels in 2020 despite the pandemic.\nThe amounts - or concentrations - of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide rose by more than the annual average in the past 10 years.\n\"Developing countries have been rightfully disappointed that so far developed countries have not delivered on the $100bn pledge that was already given in 2009,\" said the one of the plan's authors, Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's secretary of state for the environment.\n\"Hence, I am glad that the process I was honoured to lead jointly with minister Jonathan Wilkinson has created momentum to help complying with the finance commitment overall in the period up to 2025. We are very aware that also after today's release of the Delivery Plan, a lot of work remains.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "A woman launching an innovative new comb for afro hair wants to use her experience to get other young black women into engineering.\n\"I would have loved a young me to have been taught by a black woman,\" said Swansea-based Youmna Mouhamad.\nShe received an enterprise fellowship from the Royal Academy of Engineering to help her develop the product.\nFewer than 2% of engineers are women from ethnic minorities.\n\"I want to be part of the change, so that a young person that comes after me is in a place where they feel much more heard and much more accepted,\" said Youmna.\nShe was doing a PhD in physics when she first got the idea for the Nyfasi Deluxe Detangler, which provides an easier way of conditioning natural afro hair.\nYoumna supported her studies by working as a nanny and the little girl she looked after used to cry with pain when her hair was washed and conditioned. \n\"The whole house would be full of tears,\" she remembers. \"I wanted her to have a better experience.\n\"I shifted to engineering because I always had a desire to work on things that I can touch with my hands, and I love the process of taking an idea and actually creating something.\"\nOnce Youmna had developed a prototype she looked for women with afro hair to join a focus group to test it. \nLenient and her nine-year-old daughter, Goodness, were among the volunteers.\n\"I have got three girls and I do their hair myself,\" said Lenient.\n\"The washing process is dreadful because they don't want to. Why? Because it's quite painful for them, especially the combing part.\"\n\"And this detangler, the first time I tried it, it was really easy.\"\nGoodness agreed, adding: \"The normal comb feels like someone is pulling your hair, when it's tangled it hurts. But with this comb, it's very soft and easy to untangle.\"\nWhile Youmna is excited about the rave reviews, she doesn't just want to launch a new business, she also wants to be a role model for other women from ethnic minorities to follow in her footsteps.  \n\"My huge passion in personal development is actually empowering other people.\" \nShe says her experience as a black woman student in science and technology was difficult at times. \n\"When I was going through it, I thought it was me. I didn't think it was the environment.\n\"But when I spoke to other [black] students, it really got to me because it was like 'oh my God, you know, it's not you!'\n\"I never had a single black teacher, and that does a lot because of the simple fact of saying 'if she can be there, so can I'.\"\nYoumna is being mentored in launching her business by Prof Dylan Jones-Evans at the University of South Wales.\nHe hopes Youmna's success will encourage more people from ethnic minorities into entrepreneurship in Wales and the rest of the UK.\n\"Many of them don't have the right role models, but slowly that's changing,\" he says\n\"I see Youmna over the next few years - and she is already - being a role model for so many people.\"\nAnother volunteer in the focus group, Charlotte Ajomale-Evans, said Youmna was already mentoring her.\n\"I just made friends with her and she's taken me on board and taught me a lot about developing and speaking out, especially in regard to racism.\"\n\"And she's also taught me to look after my hair, which is quite important.\""

      "tags": "Personal finance,UK economy,Pay,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Workers and occupations hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, official figures show.\nEmployees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work saw the sharpest dip and recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nA revival in pay rates for men has meant the gender pay gap has widened.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls from unions to give public sector workers a significant rise when a freeze on pay is lifted.\n\"We need a proper plan from the chancellor [at the Budget] to get pay rising across the economy,\" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady.\n\"That means a pay rise for all public sector workers that at least matches the cost of living. If Rishi Sunak does not increase department budgets the pay freeze will be over in name only.\"\nThe ONS figures show median weekly pay for full-time employees was \u00a3611 in April 2021, representing a 4.3% increase from the same month in the previous year.\nHowever, the change was far more dramatic for certain sections of the workforce, owing to furlough and other effects of the Covid crisis.\nFor example, employees aged 16 and 17 saw pay drop by 11.4% in 2019-20, before growing by 12.5% the following year.\nConstruction workers saw weekly pay go up by 16.8% in 2021 compared with a fall of 10.4% a year earlier. Manufacturing employees benefited from an 8.3% increase after a 3.1% drop previously.\nThere were also significant regional differences, with gross weekly earnings up by 8.8% in Northern Ireland, compared with a 1.1% rise in London, in 2021.\nNicola White, head of earnings at the ONS, said: \"After virtually flatlining last year at the start of the pandemic, earnings are returning to something like their long-term trend over the last few years.\n\"Increases this year were most marked for the groups worst affected in 2020, such as younger people, men and those in lowest-paid jobs.\"\nThe impact of the pandemic was different for men's pay compared with women's earnings, primarily due to furlough.\nThe recent rebound in pay for many men resulted in a worsening of the gender pay gap between male and female earners. In April 2020, the gap was 7%, but it was 7.9% in April this year, following previous improvements.\n\"This isn't a reversal of the trend, it is a bump caused by the pandemic,\" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \n\"When the 2020 study was carried out, more men were furloughed, and half were on temporarily lower pay, so the gap looked smaller than it actually was. When the 2021 study was done, the position was reversed, so it looked larger than it really was.\"\nMs Coles said the gender pay gap was affected significantly by how people lived their lives and brought flexibility of work into sharp focus.\n\"Children make an enormous difference, but the gap doesn't widen when women take time off with their first newborn, at the average age of 31. It is later, when they reach 40, that it opens up, so the relationship between pay and parenting is more complicated,\" she said."

      "text": "Rhondda Cynon Taf has the largest number of higher-risk coal tips in Wales, with 75 posing a potential safety threat, new figures show.\nA council-by-council breakdown of where Wales' 327 higher-risk tips are located has been published, including 71 now revealed to be in the worst category.\nThere are calls from opposition parties for precise locations to be disclosed.\nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh government was not hiding anything.\nAndrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) council, said the tips were regularly monitored and checked for movement, but long-term investment was needed.\n\"Clearly, if climate change is going to see more heavy rain in short periods of time, we want to make sure and give assurance to residents that the tips are stable,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\nAs well as RCT, Merthyr Tydfil and Caerphilly have large numbers of high-risk tips.\nThe information was published ahead of a coal tip safety summit on Tuesday between Welsh and UK ministers.\nCategory A tips are either \"minor\" or have already been restored, while category B ones are unlikely to cause a risk due to their size or location. \nCategory C and D tips pose a higher potential safety risk, but the Welsh government stressed it did not mean they posed an imminent or immediate threat, but that more frequent inspections were scheduled.\nIt also renewed calls for the Conservatives in London to fund work to repurpose, reclaim and remediate disused coal tips, which it thinks will cost \u00a3500m to \u00a3600m over the next 15 years.\nBut the UK government said the Welsh government was \"more than adequately funded\".\nClimate change has raised concern that extreme weather could increase the risk of tips becoming unstable.\nA landslide at Tylorstown in RCT following Storm Dennis prompted new work to identify all disused coal tips in Wales.\nThe study, conducted by the Welsh government with the UK government's Coal Authority and others, identified 2,456.\nWhile 1,155 and 678 are in category A and B groups respectively, 256 are in category C and 71 are in category D.\nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest number of high-risk tips, with 23 category D and 52 category C.\nIt is followed by Merthyr Tydfil with 14 in category D and 45 in category C, then Caerphilly, which has seven in D and 44 in C.\nNeath Port Talbot has the highest number of disused tips of any authority, but only has 12 category D and 27 category C.\nCeredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Newport and Vale of Glamorgan have no recorded disused coal tips.\nMany tips are in private ownership and the Welsh government said the figures were subject to change.\nIt also plans to introduce a new management regime and law which would have a new categorisation system. \nThe Welsh government said it was the first time it had published a breakdown by council area, but opposition parties have previously called for more detail of their locations.\nUnder current plans the Welsh government hopes to publish the details in the first half of next year.\nMr Drakeford told BBC Wales that his government will publish precise locations \"as soon as we are confident that it is in proper order, ready to be shared\".\n\"70% of coal tips in Wales are privately owned. There's quite a complex piece of work to be done to make sure we've got all the proper details in good order,\" he said.\nPhilip Thomas, from Ynyshir, lives less than 100m from a coal tip and runs social media accounts calling for action to clean up the sites across south Wales.\nHe said while the figures were not a surprise, it was \"shocking that there are so many higher risk tips out there\".\nHe added: \"What goes through my mind is if they're teaching children that Aberfan is a terrible disaster, and we should never forget, why have we forgotten? \n\"Why has it taken Tylorstown for us to realise that these tips have been there?\"\nWelsh Conservative Janet Finch-Saunders said it was \"vital Labour ministers provide more detail on the locations of these sites and urgently announce an action plan to put local communities' worries at ease\".\n\"However, all we have seen so far is Labour ministers blaming others. They've had ample opportunities to protect people and communities by making these coal tips safe, but as ever, they've chosen not to act, instead they've opted to pass responsibility.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Heledd Fychan urged both the UK and Welsh governments to work together so that Aberfan is never repeated.\nShe said: \"People living in the communities most at risk should also be told the status of the coal tips nearby, so that they can help authorities by urgently reporting any changes they may see.\"\nMr Drakeford said winter inspections were under way for higher-risk tips.\n\"We recognise how concerning living in the shadow of a coal tip can be for communities and we want to reassure local residents that a lot of work is being done to ensure they are safe.\n\"Our funding settlement does not recognise the substantial, long-term costs of remediating and repairing these sites.\"\nA UK government spokesman said: \"In 2020, to help with the unforeseen impact of Storm Dennis, we provided \u00a331m of additional funding to the Welsh government, of which \u00a39m was to repair vulnerable coal tips. \n\"Ultimately, however, the management of coal tips in Wales is a devolved matter and therefore not one the UK government would expect to provide additional funding for.\""

      "tags": "Lindsay Hoyle,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021,NHS",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told MPs the Budget begins the work to prepare for a new economy post Covid, as he delivers his speech in the Commons.\nSpending plans for transport, health and education have been unveiled in the press.\nMr Sunak is under pressure to help people with the cost of living.\nSources say he will adjust the universal credit taper rate, meaning those working will be able to take home more of the money they earn.\nA \u00a320 a week top up to the benefit was cut earlier this month, but details of any changes have yet to be announced.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer will not be responding to the Budget, as the leader of the opposition is normally expected to do, as he is isolating after testing positive for Covid. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out Labour's response instead.\nAccording to Downing Street, Mr Sunak told the cabinet on Wednesday morning that his Budget \"will deliver a stronger economy for the British people\" with the \"levelling-up\" agenda - spreading prosperity around the country - a \"golden thread\" running through it.\nThe chancellor is under pressure to reveal more about the economic outlook, with government debt soaring to record peace time levels in the wake of the pandemic.\nAnd he will deliver a three-year spending review alongside his Budget.\nThe Treasury has asked departments to find \"at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets\" - so it is clear not every area will get the same treatment. \nPolicies already unveiled from the chancellor's Budget include:\nYou can read more on the announcements the government has already made here. \nOne of the pre-announced policies is the end to a pay freeze for public sector workers - such as teachers, nurses and police officers - but ministers have so far refused to say whether it will be a real-terms rise by being higher than inflation.\nPay for most frontline workforces is set by independent pay review bodies and No 10 has said it could not \"prejudge that process\".\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was furious about the number of spending plans that were given to the media before Mr Sunak's big speech - they are traditionally meant to be announced in Parliament so MPs can challenge and scrutinise them. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing echoed the reproof just before the Chancellor got to his feet.\nA No 10 spokesman said they \"recognised the importance of parliamentary scrutiny\" and they \"always listen very carefully to the Speaker\".\nWhisper it. After the economy took an absolute hammering during the pandemic, might the chancellor tomorrow actually be in a much cheerier political mood than he could have predicted? \nDuring his Budget warm-up in the last few days, Rishi Sunak has already totted up promises of around an extra \u00a320bn of spending, as well as announcing how some of the cash that was already promised is going to be carved up.  \nHold on for a second though. On the specifics, there is no guarantee that unfreezing the wages of 2.5 million workers in England will mean they get pay rises that aren't eroded by inflation. \nThe same goes for increases for workers on low pay, and cuts to universal credit will pinch too. \nHaving treated us all to cosy snaps of him and his Labrador, Nova, and him hard at work in his athleisure wear, Rishi Sunak wants to give the political impression that he's a chancellor we can all be comfortable with - careful with our money, but not afraid to spend it on things that matter, who has modern Tory instincts, but won't ditch the party's traditions.  \nBut remember Budget warm-ups are just that. However many announcements there have already been, however carefully the photographs of the prep have been thought through and selected, what matters is what he actually says at lunchtime on Wednesday.\nWhat matters are the numbers - what's in black and white - in the end.\nRead more from Laura here. \nSir Keir Starmer tweeted: \"The Budget must take the pressure off working people.\n\"With costs growing and inflation rising, Labour would cut VAT on domestic energy bills immediately for six months.\n\"Unlike the Tories, we wouldn't hike taxes on working people and we'd ensure online giants pay their fair share.\"\nEx-Tory chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Newscast the government should not use higher wages as \"a bung\" to secure the support of low income voters.\n\"The instinct to send a message to business that we need to invest more capital rather than just relying on cheap labour, I think is the right instinct, I would support that,\" he said.\nAdam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, warned it was going to be a \"brutal and bitter winter for millions of householders\" who were unable to bear the costs of energy price rises.\nHe called for the chancellor to find a way to put some of the extra tax receipts raised by the price increases back in the pockets of the most vulnerable."

It's not a party political issue - this virus doesn't vote.\"\nGarry Graham, deputy general secretary of the union Prospect, said the public looked to MPs to set an example.\n\"It's welcome that House authorities are finally catching on to what unions have been saying, that it's too early to relax. But we're still left in the ludicrous situation where MPs do as they please on masks while everyone else does the right thing,\" he said.\n\"Continuously changing an already inconsistent message is a recipe for non-compliance and increased risk to everyone.\""

      "text": "The parents of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi are still living in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, where they are under surveillance by Libyan authorities, the BBC has confirmed. \nA Libyan security source said there is no evidence against the parents. \nBut the source added: \"We are watching the family, constantly. If anything happens we will know.\"\nRamadan Abedi and his wife Samia Tabbal are suspects in the case. They have not been charged with an offence in the UK.\nThe pair left the UK for Libya in April 2017, a month before the attack. \nRamadan was detained in Tripoli two days after the attack, but later released.\nA senior MI5 officer told the Manchester Arena Inquiry on Monday that he was \"likely\" to have influenced his son's extremist beliefs. In the past he has denied having links with Islamist militant groups or having any knowledge of the attack.\nHis fingerprints were found inside a car used by Salman Abedi and his brother Hashem to store explosives and bomb-making material.\nTwenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017.\nAs bereaved parents in Manchester keep searching for answers, and for justice, here in Tripoli the bombers' parents are keeping a low profile.\nBBC news has confirmed they still come and go from the family home on the outskirts of Tripoli, sometimes staying for a few days, sometimes for a week. \nThe two-storey house sits behind a breeze block wall down a rough side road. When we visited the house the tall metal gates were chained shut. \nThe only thing visible inside was an upturned wheelbarrow in the front yard. But a neighbour - who did not want to be identified - told us that Mr Abedi and his wife had been at the house just days before.\nThe couple have refused to engage with the Manchester Arena inquiry, as has their oldest son Ismail. He managed to fly out of the UK on 29 August, evading a scheduled appearance. He missed a flight the day before, having been delayed by questioning from the police.\nSince then his whereabouts are unconfirmed, but there is speculation he may have come to Libya, where he has an extended family network.\nLibya's foreign minister Najla El-Mangoush - who is British born herself - told the BBC authorities in Libya and in Britain are in contact on this issue.\n\"I think there is collaboration between the general attorney office, and some figures in England related to this issue,\" she said. \n\"I am not sure if there is any positive outcome. We respect the judicial system and we don't want to interfere, but also we are willing to collaborate from a political perspective if there is anything we can do from our side.\"\nOfficials in Libya are keen to stress their willingness to co-operate with requests for help from Britain - if they receive any. Asked if she was aware of any requests for assistance with other possible suspects who might be in Libya, the minister replied \"not recently\".\nLibya extradited the bomber's brother Hashem Abedi in 2019. \"He didn't expect to be handed over to the British,\" a source in Libya told the BBC. \nHe is now serving 55 years for his role in the attack."

      "text": "Saudi Arabia's crown prince suggested using a \"poison ring\" to kill the late King Abdullah, a former top Saudi intelligence official has alleged.\nIn an interview with CBS, Saad al-Jabri said Mohammed bin Salman told his cousin in 2014 that he wanted to do so to clear the throne for his father.\nThere were tensions within the ruling family at the time over the succession.\nThe Saudi government has called Mr Jabri a discredited former official with a long history of fabrication.\nIn his interview with CBS's 60 Minutes programme Mr Jabri warned that Crown Prince Mohammed - Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler and the son of King Salman - was a \"psychopath, killer, in the Middle East with infinite resources, who poses threat to his people, to the Americans and to the planet\".\nHe alleged that at a 2014 meeting the prince suggested to his cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the then interior minister, that he could arrange the killing of King Abdullah.\n\"He told him: 'I want to assassinate King Abdullah. I get a poison ring from Russia. It's enough for me just to shake hand with him and he will be done,'\" Mr Jabri said. \n\"Whether he's just bragging... he said that and we took it seriously.\"\nHe said the matter was settled privately within the royal court. But he added that the meeting was secretly filmed and that he knew where two copies of the video recording were. \nAbdullah died at the age of 90 in 2015 and was succeeded by his half-brother Salman, Mohammed bin Salman's father, who named Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince. \nIn 2017, Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as heir to the throne by Mohammed bin Salman. He also lost his role as interior minister and was reportedly placed under house arrest before being detained last year on unspecified charges. \nMr Jabri fled to Canada after Mohammed bin Nayef was ousted.\nHe said in the interview that he was warned by a friend in a Middle Eastern intelligence service that Mohammed bin Salman was sending a hit team to kill him in October 2018, just days after Saudi agents murdered the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.\nHe alleged that a six-person team landed at an airport in Ottawa but were deported after customs found they were carrying \"suspicious equipment for DNA analysis\".\nLast year, Mr Jabri accused the crown prince of attempted murder in a civil suit filed in a US federal court. \nThe prince rejected the allegations. He has also denied any involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, although US intelligence agencies assessed that he approved the operation.\nThe BBC has contacted the Saudi government for comment on the allegations.\nIn a statement sent to CBS, the Saudi embassy in Washington labelled Mr Jabri as \"a discredited former government official with a long history of fabricating and creating distractions to hide the financial crimes he committed, which amount to billions of dollars, to furnish a lavish life-style for himself and his family\".\nMr Jabri is being sued for corruption by various Saudi entities and a Canadian judge has frozen his assets saying there is \"overwhelming evidence of fraud\". \nHe denies stealing any government money, saying his former employers rewarded him generously.\nIn March 2020, Saudi authorities detained Mr Jabri's son Omar and daughter Sarah in what human rights groups said was an apparent effort to coerce him to return to Saudi Arabia. \nLast November, two months after their father sued the crown prince, the siblings were sentenced to nine and six-and-a-half years in prison respectively by a Saudi court after being convicted of money laundering and \"attempting to escape\" the country. They denied the charges.\nAn appeals court upheld their sentences in a secret hearing at which they were not present."

      "tags": "Online Safety Bill,Fake News,Instagram,Facebook",
      "text": "Whistleblower Frances Haugen has told MPs Facebook is \"unquestionably making hate worse\", as they consider what new rules to impose on big social networks.\nMs Haugen was talking to the Online Safety Bill committee in London.\nShe said Facebook safety teams were under-resourced, and \"Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety\".\nAnd she warned that Instagram was \"more dangerous than other forms of social media\".\nWhile other social networks were about performance, play, or an exchange of ideas, \"Instagram is about social comparison and about bodies... about people's lifestyles, and that's what ends up being worse for kids\", she told a joint committee of MPs and Lords.\nShe said Facebook's own research described one problem as \"an addict's narrative\" - where children are unhappy, can't control their use of the app, but feel like they cannot stop using it.\n\"I am deeply worried that it may not be possible to make Instagram safe for a 14-year-old, and I sincerely doubt that it is possible to make it safe for a 10-year-old,\" she said.\nThe committee is fine-tuning a proposed law that will place new duties on large social networks and subject them to checks by the media regulator Ofcom.\nAsked if the law was \"keeping Mark Zuckerberg awake at night\", Ms Haugen said she was \"incredibly proud of the UK for taking such a world-leading stance\".\n\"The UK has a tradition of leading policy in ways that are followed around the world.\n\"I can't imagine Mark isn't paying attention to what you're doing.\" \nMs Haugen also warned that Facebook was unable to police content in multiple languages around the world - something which should worry UK officials, she said.\n\"UK English is sufficiently different that I would be unsurprised if the safety systems that they developed primarily for American English were actually under-enforcing in the UK,\" she said.\nAnd she said that dangerous misinformation in other languages affects people in Britain.\n\"Those people are also living in the UK, and being fed misinformation that is dangerous, that radicalises people,\" she warned.\nMs Haugen also urged the committee to include paid-for advertising in its new rules, saying the current system was \"literally subsidising hate on these platforms\" because of their algorithmic ranking.\n\"It is substantially cheaper to run an angry hateful divisive ad than it is to run a compassionate, empathetic ad,\" she said.\nAnd she also urged MPs to require a breakdown of who is harmed by content, rather than an average figure - suggesting Facebook is \"very good at dancing with data\", but pushes people towards \"extreme content\".\n\"The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience,\" she said.\n\"The real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,\" she said.\nShe warned that employees were unable to report internal concerns at Facebook - something she called a \"huge weak spot\".\n\"When I worked on counter-espionage, I saw things where I was concerned about national security, and I had no idea how to escalate those because I didn't have faith in my chain of command at that point,\" she told the committee.\nAnd she warned: \"We were told to accept under-resourcing.\"\nSimilar problems plague Facebook's Oversight Board, which can overturn the company's decisions on content, she said. She repeated her claim that Facebook has repeatedly lied to its own watchdog, and said this is a \"defining moment\" for the Oversight Board to \"step up\".\n\"I don't know what the purpose of the Oversight Board is,\" she said.\nIt comes as several news outlets published fresh stories based on the thousands of leaked documents Ms Haugen took with her when she left Facebook.\nFacebook has characterised previous reporting as misleading, and at one point referred to the leaked documents as \"stolen\".\n\"Contrary to what was discussed at the hearing, we've always had the commercial incentive to remove harmful content from our sites,\" a spokesperson said, after Ms Haugen finished giving evidence.\n\"People don't want to see it when they use our apps, and advertisers don't want their ads next to it. That's why we've invested $13bn (\u00a39.4bn) and hired 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on our apps. \"\nThe company said that over the last three quarters it has halved the amount of hate speech seen on Facebook, which it claims now accounts for only 0.05% of all content viewed.\n\"While we have rules against harmful content and publish regular transparency reports, we agree we need regulation for the whole industry so that businesses like ours aren't making these decisions on our own,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"The UK is one of the countries leading the way and we're pleased the Online Safety Bill is moving forward.\"\nAn avalanche of information emerged on Monday from leaked Facebook documents - and it was hard to keep up. \nAllegations include that the social media giant is aware of its role in inciting violence all around the world, or causing harm to its users from US and UK to India and Ethiopia. \nA common theme runs through each of the stories. They all suggest a tension between employees raising the alarm about their concerns and a corporate machine that does not appear to be using this to inform its policies. \nReporters and journalists have been highlighting many of these same concerns, especially for the past 18 months. I've investigated the human cost of online disinformation and abuse again and again and exposed the damage being done to real people offline using these sites. \nBut until these documents were released by Ms Haugen, it was very difficult to know how aware Facebook was of that damage.\nThese latest leaks reinforce the idea that it is conscious of it - although it refutes a number of the claims. \nAnd it means pressure is mounting on policymakers around the world to do something about it.

      "title": "Japan's Princess Mako finally marries commoner boyfriend Kei Komuro",
      "tags": "Asia,Japan,Royalty",
      "text": "Japan's Princess Mako has married her college sweetheart Kei Komuro - thus losing her royal status.\nUnder Japanese law, female imperial family members forfeit their status upon marriage to a \"commoner\" although male members do not.\nShe also skipped the usual rites of a royal wedding and turned down a payment offered to royal females upon their departure from the family.\nShe is the first female member of the royal family to decline both.\nThe couple are expected to move to the US - where Mr Komuro works as a lawyer - after marriage. The move has drawn inevitable comparisons with British royals Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, earning the newlyweds the nickname \"Japan's Harry and Meghan\". \nLike Ms Markle, Mr Komuro has come under intense scrutiny since his relationship with Ms Mako was announced. He was most recently criticised for sporting a ponytail when he returned to Japan. \nSome tabloid newspapers and social media users felt his hairstyle - seen as unconventional in Japan - was unbecoming of someone set to marry a princess. \nThere was also a protest on Tuesday against the couple's marriage. \nIn a press conference on Tuesday, Ms Mako said she apologised for any trouble brought to people by her marriage. \n\"I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused and I am grateful for those... who have continued to support me,\" she said, according to an NHK report. \"For me, Kei is irreplaceable - marriage was a necessary choice for us.\"\nMr Komuro added that he loved Ms Mako and wanted to spend his life with her. \n\"I love Mako. We only get one life, and I want us to spend it with the one we love,\" said Mr Komuro according to an AFP report.  \"I feel very sad that Mako has been in a bad condition, mentally and physically, because of the false accusations.\"\nPrincess Mako left her Tokyo residence at around 10:00 local time on Tuesday (01:00 GMT) to register her marriage, bowing several times to her parents, Crown Prince Fumihito and Crown Princess Kiko. She also hugged her younger sister before she left, news outlet Kyodo reported. \nThere has been excessive media coverage around the couple over the years, which has caused the princess to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, the Imperial Household Agency (IHA) had earlier said.\nHer relationship has been met with controversy in the country. \nOn Tuesday, people were pictured protesting against the marriage in a Japanese park.\nMany slogans appeared to bring up financial issues around Mr Komuro's family - specifically his mother.\nThe former princess got engaged to Mr Komuro in 2017 and the two were set to wed the following year. But the marriage was delayed following claims Mr Komuro's mother had financial problems - she had reportedly taken a loan from her ex-fianc\u00e9 and not paid him back.\nThe palace denied the delay was linked to this, though Crown Prince Fumihito said it was important for the money issues to be dealt with before the couple got married.\nAccording to the BBC's Tokyo correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, the real reason for the animosity towards Mr Komuro seems to be among some conservative Japanese who believe he is not a worthy partner for a niece of the emperor.\nMr Komuro - who has received a job offer from a top New York law firm - comes from humble origins, and local tabloids have spent years digging dirt on his family, including the allegations against his mother. \nThe reaction to Princess Mako and Kei Komuro's relationship by some media and people in Japan, has highlighted the pressure women in Japan's imperial family face.\nThe Imperial Household Agency has said Princess Mako suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the harsh criticism from the media and on social media around her engagement since it was announced nearly four years ago.\nShe is not the first woman in the Japanese royal family to be affected this way.\nHer grandmother Empress Emerita Michiko temporarily lost her voice nearly 20 years ago when criticised by the media as being somehow unfit to be the Emperor's wife. Her aunt-in-law Empress Masako, suffered depression after she was blamed for failing to produce a male heir.\nRoyal women have been forced to strictly adhere to certain expectations - they must be supportive of their husbands, produce an heir, and be a guardian of Japan's traditions. If they fall short they are savagely criticised. \nThis is also true of Princess Mako, who said she would give up her royal status. But even that has not been enough to stop the attacks on her, her husband, and their marriage.\nRead this story in Japanese here."

      "text": "A man from North Carolina who vanished in the 1970s has been identified as one of dozens of victims murdered by serial killer John Wayne Gacy. \nFrancis Wayne Alexander's remains were among those found in the crawl space of Gacy's Chicago-area home in 1978. \nCook County Sheriff Tom Dart ordered eight unidentified victims' bodies to be exhumed in 2011 in an effort to identify them through DNA testing.\nAlexander is the third Gacy victim to be identified in the last decade. \nHe would have been 21 or 22 when Gacy killed him between 1976 and 1977, Mr Dart's office said.\nGacy was convicted of killing 33 young men between 1972 and 1978 and burying them on his property. He was executed in 1994. \nHe often lured young men to his home for sex by pretending to be a police officer or promising them construction work. \nIn reopening the investigation, Sheriff Dart asked families of youngsters who had vanished between 1970 and Gacy's 1978 arrest to submit saliva samples to compare DNA with the eight victims who were buried without being identified. \nMonths later, William George Bundy, a 19-year-old construction worker, was identified as a Gacy victim.\nIn 2017, James Byron Haakenson - a missing teenager from Minnesota - was named as another victim.\nInvestigators matched DNA samples from Mr Alexander's mother and half-brother to his remains. \nAlexander's sister, Carolyn Sanders, thanked the sheriff's office for giving the family \"closure\".\n\"It is hard, even 45 years later, to know the fate of our beloved Wayne. He was killed at the hands of a vile and evil man,\" Ms Sanders said. \n\"We can now lay to rest what happened and move forward by honouring Wayne.\"\nAuthorities say they are unsure how Mr Alexander crossed paths with Gacy, one of America's most infamous serial killers.\nHe had moved to Chicago, where he was married for around three months before divorcing in 1975.\nIn January 1976, he received a traffic ticket in Chicago. After this, officers found no record of him being alive.\nMr Alexander \"lived in an area that was frequented by Gacy and where other identified victims had previously lived\", the sheriff's office said.\nPolice say their efforts to identify the other remains are ongoing."

      "text": "Sudan's coup leader, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has said the military seized power on Monday to prevent \"civil war\".\nHe added that the deposed Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok was being kept at the general's house \"for his own safety\", but has now returned home.\nProtests are continuing for a second day in the capital, Khartoum, with roads, bridges and shops closed. Phone and internet lines are also disrupted. \nAt least 10 people are reported to have been killed since the unrest began.  \n\"The dangers we witnessed last week could have led the country into civil war,\" Gen Burhan told a news conference earlier on Tuesday. \n\"The prime minister was at his house but we feared that he will be harmed,\" he added.\n\"I was with him last night... and he is going about his life... he will return to his home when the crisis is over and all threats are gone.\"\nThe general said he had dissolved civilian rule, arrested political leaders and called a state of emergency as political groups had been inciting civilians against the security forces.\nThe BBC's Mohamed Osman in Khartoum says the fact that Gen Burhan has prepared a long list of ministers, as well as promising to announce top judicial appointments within two days, suggests extensive planning prior to the coup. \nThe take over has drawn global condemnation. The US, the UK, EU, UN and African Union, of which Sudan is a member, have all demanded the immediate release of all arrested political leaders which includes members of Mr Hamdok's cabinet.\nUN chief Antonio Guterres said Sudan was among an \"epidemic of coups d'etats\" affecting Africa and Asia, and he urged the world's \"big powers\" to band together for \"effective deterrence\" through the UN Security Council.\nMeanwhile, the US has halted $700m (\u00a3508m) in aid to Sudan and the EU has threatened to do the same. Both are demanding the restoration of the civilian government without preconditions. \nSince Monday, troops are reported to have been going house to house in Khartoum arresting local protest organisers.\nOur correspondent says thousands more people have joined the protests in the capital, mainly in residential neighbourhoods near the city centre.\nThe city's airport is closed and all flights are cancelled until Saturday.\nStaff at the country's central bank have reportedly gone on strike, and doctors across Sudan are said to be refusing to work in military-run hospitals except in emergencies.\nCivilian leaders and their military counterparts have been at odds since long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019.\nA power-sharing agreement between civilian and military leaders was designed to steer Sudan towards democracy but has proven fragile with a number of previous coup attempts, the last just over a month ago.\nGen Burhan, who was head of the power-sharing council, said Sudan was committed to the transition to civilian rule, with elections planned for July 2023.\nAre you in Sudan?

      "text": "Facebook has posted better-than-expected profits for the third quarter, as it continues to face bad press over leaked internal documents. \nThe social media giant made $9bn (\u00a36.5bn) of profit in the three months to September, up from $7.8bn last year. \nHowever, it was hit by a new privacy update to Apple's iOS 14 operating system, which made it harder for brands to target ads at specific users. \nIt comes amid fresh claims of unethical behaviour made by a former employee.\nFrances Haugen has released a cache of internal documents to the public, alleging that Facebook put profit before user safety. \nMultiple media reports say the documents show Facebook struggled to moderate content that promoted hate speech and sex trafficking outside of the US. \nOn Monday, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerburg told investors on a conference call: \"What we are seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.\"\nIn the 12 months to 30 September, the social media giant said its monthly user-base had grown 6% to 2.91 billion. \nHowever, despite its strong profits, its revenue slightly undershot analyst expectations, amid \"headwinds\" caused by Apple's privacy rules.\nFacebook said the privacy update would also have an impact on its digital business in the final quarter of the year, but that it expected to adjust to the changes in time.\nThe firm said it would spend some $10bn on its metaverse division this year - known as Facebook Reality Labs - which is tasked with creating augmented and virtual reality hardware, software and content. \nThe world's largest social media network is under scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators, including from the Federal Trade Commission, which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices.\nThe whistleblower documents, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have only intensified that pressure. \nThey include internal research about Instagram's effects on teen mental health; whether Facebook's platforms stoke division; and the social media giant's handling of the 6 January Capitol riot.\nAt a hearing on Monday, Ms Haugen told UK MPs that Facebook is \"unquestionably making hate worse\".\nShe said Facebook safety teams were under-resourced, and that \"Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety\". \nThe MPs are considering what new rules to impose on big social networks under the planned Online Safety Bill.\nBut on his conference call, Mr Zuckerberg hit back: \"Good faith criticism helps us get better, but my view is that we are seeing a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company. \n\"The reality is that we have an open culture that encourages discussion and research on our work so we can make progress on many complex issues that are not specific to just us.\"\nDespite the allegations, shares in Facebook climbed by 1.3% in after hours trading on Monday. The firm's stock is up by about 20% so far this year. "

It's not a party political issue - this virus doesn't vote.\"\nGarry Graham, deputy general secretary of the union Prospect, said the public looked to MPs to set an example.\n\"It's welcome that House authorities are finally catching on to what unions have been saying, that it's too early to relax. But we're still left in the ludicrous situation where MPs do as they please on masks while everyone else does the right thing,\" he said.\n\"Continuously changing an already inconsistent message is a recipe for non-compliance and increased risk to everyone.\""

      "tags": "Sewage,Conservative Party,Water pollution,House of Lords",
      "text": "The government says it will force water companies to make a \"progressive reduction\" in the sewage it dumps in rivers, amid pressure from the Lords. \nPeers proposed a change to the Environment Bill last week in an attempt to cut the pollution, but it did not win enough support from MPs.\nIt led to a backlash on social media, and Lords promising to try again. \nBut Environment Secretary George Eustice has now promised to bolster measures by making them a legal duty.\nHe said the government already had plans in place to require water companies to act on sewage, but added: \"We've listened to the debate in Parliament [and] we will write what was already government policy into [law] to give people the reassurance they seek.\"\nThe crossbench peer who put forward the Lords amendment, the Duke of Wellington, said he met Mr Eustice earlier on Tuesday ahead of a debate in Parliament on the Environment Bill. \nSpeaking in the Lords, he said was \"grateful for the gesture\", but he had yet to form an opinion on the language of the government's proposal, so would be pushing ahead with his own plan to end the \"revolting practice\".\nThe duke's amendment passed in the Lords by 213 votes to 60, and will now be debated by MPs at a later date.  \nHowever, due to parliamentary rules, his amendment would have to be approved by the Lords anyway to allow the government to replace it with its own plan when the bill returns to the Commons. \nThe environmental issue has come to a head days before the start of the COP26 climate summit, being hosted by the UK in Glasgow.\nThe Environment Agency allows water utilities to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather events, such as prolonged heavy rain.\nThis protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes.\nBut according to the public body's own figures, water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times last year, with untreated effluent - including human waste, wet wipes and condoms - released into waterways for more than three million hours in 2020.\nThe Lords agreed an amendment to the Environment Bill that would put a legal duty on water companies and the government to demonstrate progressive reductions in discharges of untreated sewage and required them to \"take all reasonable steps\" to avoid using combined sewer overflows.\nBut when the proposal was voted on by MPs last week, it lost by 265 votes to 202 - even with 22 Tories rebelling against the government to vote in favour of the plan. \nThe government had said the amount of sewage discharged by water companies was \"not acceptable\" and that it had made it \"crystal clear\" to firms that significant reductions must be a priority. \nBut a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the intentions of the Lords' amendment, which it said would involve an overhaul of the UK's Victorian sewerage system - would cost upwards of \u00a3150bn.\n\"That would mean that individuals - every one of us as taxpayers - paying potentially thousands of pounds each as a result,\" they added. \nShortly before the issue was brought up again for debate in the Lords, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs proposed its own amendment for when the bill returns to the Commons.\nThe new legal duty would be placed directly on water companies to make a \"progressive reduction\" in the sewage it dumps into rivers. \nIt follows on from advice it gave the industry's financial regulator, Ofwat, earlier this year, saying water companies must take steps to significantly reduce storm overflows and that the regulator should ensure funding should be approved for them to do so.\nAnd the firms would need to produce \"comprehensive statutory Drainage and Sewerage Management Plans, setting out how they will manage and develop their drainage and sewerage system over a minimum 25-year planning horizon - including how storm overflows will be addressed\".\nA number of peers welcomed the move by the government, but some warned it still may not go far enough, with Labour's Baroness Quin saying she hoped the government would move even further now people across the country were \"waking up to the problem\".\nLabour's shadow environment secretary, Luke Pollard, also said the \"screeching u-turn\" on the issue due to the public backlash would \"do little to convince the public that the health of our rivers, rather than the health of Conservative polling, is at the forefront of ministers' minds\".\nHe added: \"The government still has no clear plan and no grip on the issue of raw sewage being pumped into our seas and rivers.\""

      "text": "The government has been blamed for failing to reduce demand for flying and meat-eating as part of its plans to rein in climate change.\nThe Climate Change Committee advisory body says ministers also have not shown how to achieve their ambition of cutting the demand for road travel.\nIt warns a \u201ctechno-centric\u201d approach to cutting emissions adopted by the prime minister has a high risk of failure.\nBut a report from the committee praised the government's Net Zero Strategy.\nA government spokeswoman welcomed the CCC\u2019s generally positive response to the Net Zero Strategy and said it would meet all its climate change goals.\nBoris Johnson has regularly promised that climate change can be tackled without what he calls \u201chairshirtery\u201d.\nMany experts agree technology is needed but say behaviour must change too. \nThey judge that the demand for high-carbon activities must be cut for the UK to meet climate targets in the 2030s.\nThe report from the CCC - an independent body advising the UK and devolved governments on emissions targets - comes ahead of the COP26 climate summit which will be held in Glasgow from Sunday.\nIt says: \"There is less emphasis on reducing demand for high carbon activities than in the CCC's scenarios. \n\"The government does not include an explicit ambition on diet change, or reductions in the growth of aviation, and policies for managing travel demand have not been developed to match the funding that has been committed.\"\nThe committee added: \"These remain valuable options with major co-benefits and can help manage delivery risks around a techno-centric approach. They must be explored further with a view to early action.\"\nNick Eyre, Professor of Energy and Climate Policy at the University of Oxford, went even further. \nWith reference to the PM's \"hairshirtery\" jibe, he told a COP26 media briefing: \"The PM's headline about not changing the way we use energy is not just helpful - it's unrealistic. \n\"We won't reach climate goals unless there's a combination of technology and behaviour change.\"\nThe government\u2019s over-arching Net Zero climate plans unveiled last week showed how almost every sector of the economy should virtually eliminate planet-heating carbon emissions by 2050.\nBut on the eve of the Budget the committee warns that the Treasury still lacks policies to cut emissions.\nIt has not explained, for instance, how finances can be raised for a massive investment in clean electricity, or how a great home insulation programme will be prompted and supported. \nThe committee said: \"Currently vague plans must be quickly pinned down for improving home energy efficiency for the 60% of UK households that are owner-occupiers but not in fuel poverty.\"\nMore policies are needed, too, to curb emissions from land use and farming, it says.\nThe criticisms are tempered by praise for the sweeping nature of the government\u2019s Net Zero Strategy, which is thought to be the first in the world to demonstrate how emissions can be cut across the board. \nThe report says the strategy is achievable and affordable, and will create many jobs.\nCCC chairman Lord Deben said: \u201cThis is a genuine step forward. The UK was the first major industrialised nation to set Net Zero into law \u2013 now we have policy plans to get us there. \n\u201cMinisters have made the big decisions \u2013 to decarbonise the power sector by 2035, to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles, to back heat pumps for homes. \n\u201cThey have proposed policies to do it. I applaud their ambition but now they must deliver these goals and fill in the remaining gaps in funding and implementation.\u201d\nThis may prove easier said than done, because there is currently a gulf between the government\u2019s climate promises and its achievements. \nThe CCC recently judged that ministers had only achieved around a fifth of the carbon cuts needed to meet previous climate targets.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nA government spokeswoman said: \"We value the Climate Change Committee's expert advice as we work to implement our comprehensive plan to finish the job and eradicate the UK's contribution to climate change by 2050. \n\"As the committee rightly highlights, our world-leading Net Zero Strategy builds on the UK's proven track record of having decarbonised faster than any other G7 country in recent decades.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin"

      "text": "Covid rates in Wales have hit another new record high, according to health officials.\nFigures published on Tuesday showed a rate of 719.9 cases for every 100,000 people over the last seven days.\nThe number of Covid cases in Wales remains the highest infection rate of all the UK nations.\nBut one of the heads of Public Health Wales said he felt the levels of infection were beginning to slow.\n\"We are looking at fairly high rates compared to other times in the pandemic response,\" accepted Dr Fu-Meng Khaw, who is the national director of health protection at PHW. \"But I feel that we are plateauing.\"\nHe said the daily number of cases in Wales stood between 2,500 and 3,000 new infections.\nDr Khaw said all the models looking at the latest wave of Covid suggested it would begin to fall in the near future, despite the current high levels.\n\"I am confident that over the coming weeks we will start seeing a drop,\" he told BBC Wales.\nIt follows a warning that some people are behaving as if the Covid pandemic is over - ignoring Wales' face mask laws and not social distancing.\nThe latest number of positive cases reported by Public Health Wales (PHW) was 5,228 between Friday morning and Monday morning.\nA further 31 deaths with Covid-19 have also been recorded, with 6,117 people dying with the virus since the start of the pandemic in Wales, according to PHW figures.\nThe health body said due to a technical issue reporting figures on Tuesday, not all cases of Covid reported in Wales in the last 72 hours had been flagged as new, and it was likely there had been about 8,000 actual new cases over the period.\nDr Khaw said the highest levels of Covid transmission were being seen among young adults and children in Wales.\nHe also said the rate of hospital admissions from Covid was increasing, and was being carefully monitored to ensure it was not down to new variants of the disease.\nBut he stressed there was \"no evidence\" that a new \"variant of concern\" was in circulation in Wales at the moment.\nThe highest infection rate is in Blaenau Gwent, at just under 1,330 cases per 100,000 over the last seven days.\nNeighbouring counties in the Aneurin Bevan health board area also share high levels of Covid, with both Torfaen and Caerphilly nudging over the 1,000 infection rate.\nWrexham has Wales' lowest rate, at 368.5 cases per 100,000 people.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said it was \"right to be concerned\" about the current Covid rates.\n\"There is far too much coronavirus circulating in the community\", he said.\nThe Welsh government will announce its latest response to the pandemic on Friday, as part of a three-week review.\nBut ministers have said they were not considering moving into \"Covid Urgent\" - where social and business restrictions could be reintroduced.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford added that if numbers continued to rise \"we would all have to be asking ourselves serious questions about what we would need to do to bring numbers of that sort back under control\".\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan has already indicated they will consider whether the Covid Pass scheme introduced at the start of October should be widened."

      "tags": "Energy industry,UK economy,Nuclear power,EDF Energy",
      "text": "Funding rules paving the way for a new major nuclear power station have been announced by the Business and Energy Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng.\nThe move is the latest stage in efforts to build the \u00a320bn Sizewell C project in Suffolk.\nThe proposed plant is still subject to planning approval, but until now, the Treasury has been uncertain of how to pay for it. \nEven if the project is approved, it still faces strong local objections. \nThe government said the new financing model could help cut the cost of new nuclear power projects in Britain, saving consumers more than \u00a330bn on each new large-scale station.\nThe proposals include electricity customers paying for part of nuclear schemes' costs upfront through bills.\nThe new model, known as RAB (Regulated Asset Base), has already been used to finance some large infrastructure projects, including the \u00a34.2bn Thames Tideway \"super-sewer\".\nIt allows investors to receive returns before the projects have been completed.\nThe Treasury was initially reluctant to use the RAB model. \nNot only does it add money to consumer bills over the lifetime of the project, but it also leaves consumers vulnerable to cost overruns, which have plagued previous nuclear developments. \nHowever, contractor EDF Energy has been adamant that lessons learned on previous projects - and the fact that it is building an identical plant at Hinkley Point - have largely mitigated those risks, says BBC business editor Simon Jack.\nMr Kwarteng said the new funding model was a better way to finance such projects.\n\"The existing financing scheme led to too many overseas nuclear developers walking away from projects, setting Britain back years,\" he said.\n\"We urgently need a new approach to attract British funds and other private investors to back new large-scale nuclear power stations in the UK.\"\nEmployers' organisation the CBI said the new financing model was \"a crucial step in building a secure, affordable and greener energy system in the years ahead\".\n\"Getting new projects off the ground will be a huge boost to supply chains and can deliver jobs right across the UK,\" said Tom Thackray, director of the CBI's decarbonisation programme.\nThe Nuclear Industry Association said it would add a small levy to bills of no more than a few pounds during the early phase of construction and less than \u00a31 a month over the course of a project.\nIt \"warmly welcomed\" the plan, adding it would also bring substantial savings in terms of CO2 emissions worth \u00a3526m a year at today's carbon prices, or \u00a318 per year for every UK household.\nBut the high cost of big nuclear plants and the plummeting cost of renewables such as offshore wind make the project controversial.\nHowever, the enormous amount of low-carbon non-intermittent electricity that it produces is considered by the government to be an essential part of the UK's future energy mix as existing nuclear plants are phased out.\nThe recent intermittency of wind power has also made the case in ministers' minds for an \"always on\" part of the energy supply, our business editor adds.\nTogether, Hinkley and Sizewell C are expected to produce 14% of the UK's current electricity needs, but they are unlikely to be operational until the late 2030s.\nThe new funding plan has been greeted with dismay by campaigners against the proposed plant.\nAlison Downes of Stop Sizewell C described it as \"a desperate measure to attract investment\" for \"a project so toxic that no one wants to pay for it\". \nShe added: \"Compared to other energy solutions, Sizewell C is an expensive distraction - too damaging, too slow for our climate emergency and with serious question marks over its reactor technology.\""

      "text": "National plans to cut carbon fall far short of what's needed to avert dangerous climate change, according to the UN Environment Programme. \nTheir Emissions Gap report says country pledges will fail to keep the global temperature under 1.5C this century.\nThe Unep analysis suggests the world is on course to warm around 2.7C with hugely destructive impacts. \nBut there is hope that, if long term net-zero goals are met, temperatures can be significantly reined in. \nJust a few days before COP26 opens in Glasgow, another scientific report on climate change is \"another thundering wake-up call\", according to the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres.\nThis week, we've already had a study from the WMO showing that warming gases were at a new high last year, despite the pandemic.\nNow in its 12th year, this Emissions Gap report looks at the nationally-determined contributions (NDCs) or carbon-cutting plans that countries have submitted to the UN ahead of COP. \nThese pledges run up to 2030 and have been submitted by 120 countries. Unep has also taken account of other commitments to cut warming gases not yet formally submitted in an NDC. \nThe report finds that when added together, the plans cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by around 7.5% compared to the previous pledges made five years ago.\nThis is nowhere near enough to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within sight, say the scientists who compiled the study.\nTo keep 1.5C alive would require 55% cuts by the same 2030 date. That means the current plans would need to have seven times the level of ambition to remain under that limit. \n\"To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C, we have eight years to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions: eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts,\" said Inger Andersen, executive director of Unep.\n\"The clock is ticking loudly.\"\nAccording to the authors, the current pledges would see the world warm by 2.7C this century, a scenario that Antonio Guterres calls a \"climate catastrophe\".\nHe believes the report highlights the failures of political leaders.\n\"The emissions gap is the result of a leadership gap,\" he said at the launch of the study. \n\"But leaders can still make this a turning point to a greener future instead of a tipping point to climate catastrophe.\"\nAs Mr Guterres suggests, there are some hopeful signs in the report. \nAround 50 countries plus the EU have pledged a net zero target for the middle of this century.\nThese strategies cover over half of greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe Unep analysis finds that if these plans were implemented fully, this could shave 0.5C off the temperature rise by 2100.  \nThis would bring the global temperature level down to 2.2C, which would see dramatic and deadly impacts from warming but would be a step in the right direction from where the world is currently headed. \nThe problem, though, is that many of these net zero goals are ambiguous, say the authors - particularly among the world's 20 richest nations, where a dozen long-term plans are said to be quite vague. \nMany delay significant cuts until after 2030, raising serious doubts about whether they can really deliver net zero just 20 years later. \nAnother hopeful sign relates to methane. The report also says there is great potential to make progress on these emissions, which are the second largest source of warming. \nUp to 20% of these emissions from fossil fuels, from waste and from agriculture could be curbed at low or no cost. \nHowever, the opportunity to develop a far greener world as the world recovers from Covid is in danger of being lost, say the authors. \nThey find that around 20% of recovery investments will support renewables and the green economy.\n\"The huge sums spent to recover economies from Covid-19 are a once-in-a-generation opportunity to boost low-carbon technologies and industries. In most cases, this opportunity is not being taken,\" said Brian O'Callaghan, project manager of the Oxford University Economic Recovery Project, and an author on the Unep report.\n\"This is a particular slap in the face for vulnerable nations who are suffering the worst consequences of climate change\u2026we remain without a commitment from the highest emitters to cover the loss and damage that they have brought on the world.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

It is whether he has an excuse to breach the order and the crown say he does not.\"\nThe trial continues. \nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "The exemption of teachers in Northern Ireland from fair employment legislation \"is outdated and needs to be removed\", according to a union.\nA number of MLAs and the former first minister, Arlene Foster, have previously criticised that exemption.\nThe teaching union, the NASUWT, is the latest to call for the exemption to be scrapped.\nThe recruitment of teachers is exempt from legislation outlawing religious discrimination in Northern Ireland.\nThe NASUWT said removing the exemption would \"tackle endemic nepotism and lack of diversity in the teaching profession.\"\nThe union is to present a motion to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) conference in Belfast on Tuesday.\nIt calls for the backing of the wider trade union movement for the exemption to be removed.\n\"The practical effect of this is that it is not currently unlawful to discriminate against someone in an appointment process on the basis of their religious belief,\" the NASUWT said.\nIn 1976, the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act exempted teachers and clergy as \"the essential nature of the job requires it be done by a person holding, or not holding, a particular religious belief\".\nThat was maintained in the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.\nThe exemption allows schools to use religious background or belief in deciding who to recruit to teaching posts.\nIt also means schools have no legal obligation to monitor the community background of their teaching staff.\nIn 2004, the Equality Commission investigated the exemption and found \"the exception of teachers from the religious discrimination provisions is widely accepted, and the support for change is a minority view\".\nAccording to the Equality Commission, there were concerns from the Catholic church at the time that ending it would lead to Catholic schools losing their religious ethos and becoming non-denominational.\nThere were also concerns from the Protestant churches that Protestant teachers would be disadvantaged because of the need for teachers in Catholic primary schools to have a certificate in religious education.\nThe commission did recommend scrapping the exemption for post-primary schools but no changes to the law were subsequently made.\nGeraldine McGahey, chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said: \"It definitely should go from post-primary schools and, in primary schools, we think there should be a concerted effort to find a way to remove from that as well.\"\nIn recent years a number of assembly members have been critical of the recruitment of teachers being exempt from fair employment laws.\nIn 2019, research from the Unesco Education centre at Ulster University (UU) also suggested it contributed to relatively few teachers from a Protestant background teaching in Catholic maintained schools, and vice-versa.\nThe Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) said it was \"actively considering its position on the issue\".\nBut CCMS added it believed the exemption \"should remain in place until such time as any proposals for its repeal can be demonstrated to give complete confidence to the future of, in our case, Catholic education\". \nThe NASUWT's Northern Ireland official Justin McCamphill said the exemption was \"outdated and needs to be removed\".\n\"We are calling on the first and deputy first minister to remove this and ensure that every teacher has equality of opportunity and is able to apply for work in any school regardless of their religion or perceived community background,\" he said.\nThe leaders of the five main political parties in Northern Ireland are also expected to speak at the ICTU conference at the Waterfront Hall on Tuesday."

      "text": "Scotland's transport minister has said he is \"not optimistic\" a rail strike during COP26 will be avoided. \nGraeme Dey accused the RMT union of moving the goalposts during negotiations aimed at avoiding industrial action by ScotRail staff.\nHe said contingency plans were being made to keep the trains running but warned of extensive disruption.\nScotRail and the government has set an arbitrary deadline of 17:00 on Wednesday for the offer to be accepted. \nThree other unions representing rail workers -  Unite, Aslef and TSSA - have accepted a pay deal which is worth 4.7% over two years and includes a \u00a3300 bonus for working during the summit.\nThe Scottish government has said the offer remains on the table but the union has described the deadline as like \"having a gun pointed at our head\". \nScotRail said it was necessary to allow contingency plans, which will see suitably-trained supervisors and managers replace striking staff, to be finalised.\nThe operator said its focus would be on connecting Glasgow and Edinburgh and on providing key routes through Glasgow but it would not be drawn on the frequency of services or their period of operation.\nAsked on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme if he thought a strike would be avoided, the transport minister said \"the signs are not optimistic\".\nHe added: \"The RMT along with the other trade unions were made an offer several weeks ago and it took them two weeks to come back to ScotRail and give us a formal decision on whether or not they were accepting it. \n\"In the subsequent period we've tried to reach an agreement and time and time again the goalposts have been moved. \n\"This is not about a gun being held to anybody's head. We are less than a week away from COP and we need to know where we stand.\" \nMr Dey said there were contingency plans to keep some train services running during the UN climate change summit. \n\"Considerable amount of effort has gone in to deliver the best possible train service that we can in the circumstances. I'm not going to mislead the public and suggest it will rival the current level of service,\" he said.\n\"There will be disruption. It won't just affect COP26 - it will affect the wider travelling public. It will be extensive - there is no doubt about that but we are working flat out to try and ensure that as many trains as possible are running.\"\nAnalysis by Andrew Picken\n\"Decimated\" is the word used by ScotRail officials when describing service levels if the planned industrial action goes ahead.\nRMT members in ScotRail are mainly conductors and ticket examiners and, unlike in other countries, without them the majority of train services in Scotland do not operate.\nThis would include the flagship express route between Edinburgh and Glasgow as well as ScotRail's InterCity services. \nContingency planning for the strike is under way, but it is likely the level of service would not even match the limited offering there has been on Sundays since March where separate strike action has been taking place. \nIf there is no resolution by Wednesday's deadline, ScotRail will spend the rest of the week training workers from other parts of its business to take on some of the duties, such as staffing ticket barriers. \nThree other trade unions which represent ScotRail staff, including train driver union Aslef, have accepted the pay rise on offer and this increase has been put in place for them and non-unionised ScotRail workers.\nRMT regional organiser in Scotland Mick Hogg said the transport minister's comments were \"nonsense\" and claimed the union had been \"stonewalled\" for months.\nHe said while there had been movement over a separate issue of rest day working, there had been no progress on pay and proposed efficiency savings. \n\"What that means is there are going to be booking office closures, job losses and station closures - and a denial for the most vulnerable people in society to get access to Scotland's trains,\" he said.\nMr Hogg later told the BBC the RMT was pressing for a one-year pay deal of about 4.9% which was not linked to efficiency savings. The current offer is for 2.5% this year and 2.2% in 2022.\nScotRail operations director David Simpson defended the current offer, especially as passenger numbers have plummeted due to Covid.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"It reflects very clearly the financial position the industry is in post pandemic.\"\nMr Simpson added that he could not understand why Mr Hogg had not put the deal to his members.\nOn the impact of a strike as the eyes of the world are on Glasgow, he said: \"I think everybody wants to make sure COP is successful and rail is to play its part in that but we can't just throw money at that without consequences. There is a very strong offer on the table.\"\nAs the deadline looms, he added: \"We hope the strike can be resolved but on the basis of the RMT's current position it is very wise and prudent to be making these contingency plans in case it goes ahead.\"\nCOP26 runs from Sunday 31 October to Friday 12 November, with 120 world leaders and more than 30,000 visitors are expected in Glasgow. \nThe RMT is threatening strike action from 1 November, for the duration of the summit.\nA separate dispute could see thousands of council workers across Scotland including refuse, recycling, maintenance and school catering and janitorial staff taking strike action during the second week of the climate talks.  \nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the Scottish ministers should have acted earlier to resolve the disputes.\n\"These unions are exploiting COP26 to their advantage and I think that's absolutely wrong,\" he said.\n\"But fundamentally the Scottish government have been found wanting, they've stood on the sidelines, done nothing about this until the last minute which is why there's potential for absolute chaos because the SNP Scottish government and Glasgow City Council haven't dealt with these issues soon enough.\"\nLabour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray said setting a deadline for the RMT to accept the offer was not the way to resolve the rail dispute.\n\"The derisory offer, that I think is of 2.2% - less than what inflation is currently running at - is a pay cut in real terms for people who kept the railways running during Covid,\" he said. \nHe said the dispute with council workers was an example of cuts \"coming home to roost\" after a decade of underinvestment in council services. \nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats said the transport minister should resign if the dispute was not resolved by the start of the \"most important climate summit of all time\".\nTransport spokeswoman Jill Reilly said: \"If the trains don't run smoothly and on time for the duration of COP26, then Graeme Dey should resign.\n\"The eyes of the world will soon be on Scotland. Ministers need to stop grandstanding and hammer out a deal that gets the trains running.\""

      "tags": "Science policy,Brexit",
      "text": "UK scientists are likely to be \"frozen out\" of EU research programmes because of delays in Brexit negotiations, according to MPs.\nEarlier this month, the EU indicated that the UK's participation in its \u00a3100bn research programme was tied to negotiations over Northern Ireland.\nThe Commons European Scrutiny Select Committee says British science will not recover from \"lost opportunities\".\nIts chair, Sir Bill Cash, said that the delay was damaging UK businesses.\n\"It's been the best part of a year and British research institutions remain frozen out of key projects and funding despite agreement on participation. With each passing day, the opportunities are missed, British institutions are left high and dry while science marches on without them and the returns on our financial contribution edge lower,\" said Mr Cash.\n\"This needs to be addressed swiftly, so we're calling on the government to lay out the steps it is taking to ensure UK participation is formalised.\"\nThe EU's Horizon Europe programme brings together researchers from industry and academic research institutions. The projects range from fundamental research to tackling societal issues, such as combating climate change. \nThe UK's continued participation in the EU's Horizon programme was agreed in principle just before Christmas in the Brexit withdrawal agreement. But the signing off of a formal agreement on the UK's associate membership has dragged on for months.\nThere have been growing fears that scientific collaboration had become a bargaining chip tied to negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market after Brexit. Earlier this month, the EU's research commissioner, Mariya Gabriel, seemed to confirm these suspicions when she told the R&D policy news website sciencebusiness.net: \"transversal issues need to be tackled first\".\nThe delay is creating problems, because funding cannot be released to UK collaborators until there is a formal agreement. If it becomes apparent that agreement will take many more months, EU researchers will not include UK scientists in their projects.\nProf James Wilsdon, who is the director of the Research on Research Institute at the University of Sheffield, points to estimates that uncertainties arising from Brexit have already led to the UK research to missing out on \u00a31.5bn of research funding since 2016. \n\"This number is rising fast, as Horizon Europe, the world's largest and most successful co-funding scheme, gets into full swing, and the UK is stuck outside.\n\"Unless this is resolved soon, the fear must be that the UK drops out, or is locked out, by default rather than design, as the rest of Europe marches on without us. This would be a tragedy for both sides, and would leave the UK's ambitions to be a scientific superpower in tatters.\" \nThe EU's Earth mapping effort, Copernicus, is similarly affected by the delay. This affects UK aerospace companies wanting to bid for contracts to manufacture equipment for Copernicus because the contracts are dished out as a proportion of the contribution from member states. Because of the impasse, British firms can't contribute and so, according to the Select Committee report, will be \"frozen out\".\nMPs on the Committee said that the delay raised concerns about value for money of participation in EU programmes. The UK's contribution to the Horizon Europe programme is expected to be about \u00a32.1bn a year. \nThe President of the UK's Royal Society, Prof Sir Adrian Smith, called for negotiators to stop treating the issue of research funding as a bargaining chip.\n\"Last Christmas, all sides agreed that the UK would associate to Horizon Europe,\" he said.\n\"Nearly a year on, the association agreement is still not signed, having become entangled in other issues. Vital research that benefits all nations will be delayed unless all sides look at Horizon Europe on its own merits and get the deal signed.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"

That means the current plans would need to have seven times the level of ambition to remain under that limit. \n\"To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C, we have eight years to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions: eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts,\" said Inger Andersen, executive director of Unep.\n\"The clock is ticking loudly.\"\nAccording to the authors, the current pledges would see the world warm by 2.7C this century, a scenario that Antonio Guterres calls a \"climate catastrophe\".\nHe believes the report highlights the failures of political leaders.\n\"The emissions gap is the result of a leadership gap,\" he said at the launch of the study. \n\"But leaders can still make this a turning point to a greener future instead of a tipping point to climate catastrophe.\"\nAs Mr Guterres suggests, there are some hopeful signs in the report. \nAround 50 countries plus the EU have pledged a net zero target for the middle of this century.\nThese strategies cover over half of greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe Unep analysis finds that if these plans were implemented fully, this could shave 0.5C off the temperature rise by 2100.  \nThis would bring the global temperature level down to 2.2C, which would see dramatic and deadly impacts from warming but would be a step in the right direction from where the world is currently headed. \nThe problem, though, is that many of these net zero goals are ambiguous, say the authors - particularly among the world's 20 richest nations, where a dozen long-term plans are said to be quite vague. \nMany delay significant cuts until after 2030, raising serious doubts about whether they can really deliver net zero just 20 years later. \nAnother hopeful sign relates to methane. The report also says there is great potential to make progress on these emissions, which are the second largest source of warming. \nUp to 20% of these emissions from fossil fuels, from waste and from agriculture could be curbed at low or no cost. \nHowever, the opportunity to develop a far greener world as the world recovers from Covid is in danger of being lost, say the authors. \nThey find that around 20% of recovery investments will support renewables and the green economy.\n\"The huge sums spent to recover economies from Covid-19 are a once-in-a-generation opportunity to boost low-carbon technologies and industries. In most cases, this opportunity is not being taken,\" said Brian O'Callaghan, project manager of the Oxford University Economic Recovery Project, and an author on the Unep report.\n\"This is a particular slap in the face for vulnerable nations who are suffering the worst consequences of climate change\u2026we remain without a commitment from the highest emitters to cover the loss and damage that they have brought on the world.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "Flooding triggered by a powerful storm has overwhelmed the Sicilian city of Catania, killing at least two people.\nFierce storms battered southern Italy for a third day on Tuesday, leaving roads completely submerged in parts of the island of Sicily.\nDramatic video from Catania showed water gushing through the streets as floods engulfed the city.\nForecasters say eastern Sicily is being hit by a rare Mediterranean hurricane, known as a Medicane.\nItaly's Department for Civil Protection issued its most severe weather warning for parts of Sicily and neighbouring Calabria on Tuesday.\nThe agency warned of potential risk to life and damage to property from heavy rain, thunderstorms and gale force winds in those areas.\nScientists say climate change caused by human activity is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense.\nThe mayor of Catania, Salvo Pogliese, said eastern parts of Sicily were experiencing exceptional weather events \"unprecedented\" in their intensity.\nCiting the \"seriousness of the situation\", the mayor ordered the closure of all businesses in Catania except essential services until midnight on Tuesday.\n\"I urge the entire population to not leave home except for emergency reasons, because roads are overrun by water,\" the mayor posted on Facebook.\nItalian media reported the death of a 53-year-old man who was found under a car after torrential rains swept through the town of Gravina, north of Catania.\nThe deaths come after the body of a 67-year-old man was found on Monday. Rescuers are still searching for his 54-year-old wife, who was swept away along with her husband by flood waters in the town of Scordia, also near Catania, on Sunday.\nThe rain has deluged historic parts of Catania, turning its Via Etnea high street into a river and its squares into lakes.\nA blackout has left homes and businesses without electricity, while schools have been closed in the city and nearby towns.\nLa Repubblica newspaper said flooding forced the evacuation of some buildings belonging to Catania's Garibaldi hospital.\n\"The emergency situation is widespread and extremely critical and it does not seem to be improving,\" a spokesman for the fire service told Reuters news agency.\nItalian weather website iLMeteo said the storm was expected to gradually worsen throughout the week, bringing more heavy rains and flooding on Thursday and Friday.\nFrancesca Marchese for BBC News in Catania, Sicily\nOnly a medical emergency led me to leave home this morning, while a Medicane (a so-called Mediterranean Hurricane) hit Catania and surrounding areas.\nWith my toddler and my pensioner dad, I reached my GP in Gravina di Catania with my Fiat Panda never going faster than 12mph (20kph). \nWe had to reverse a couple of times and find alternative routes when the streets turned into rivers and lakes, with the water from blocked drains reaching my window. Some road drains are still clogged by the volcanic ash from nearby Mount Etna, which has erupted 52 times this year.\nI had no idea that a 53-year-old man had died minutes before in the same area, swept away from his car after a minor car accident.\nI returned home as soon as possible, relieved to be safe and sound but worried about my loved ones still at work in Catania city centre. I know many of them decided to stay safe indoors at their workplace, even after their working hours, waiting for the storm to pass."

      "text": "Premier Inn owner Whitbread has said it will pay millions in wage rises and bonuses to try to combat what it calls persistent staff shortages. \nThe chain said hospitality-wide labour shortages meant a \"material number of vacancies\" remained unfilled. \nHigher pay rates will cost Whitbread \u00a312m-\u00a313m, it said, while it is also paying \u00a310m in retention bonuses.\nRecent official figures show vacancies at a record, with hospitality seeing some of the biggest shortages.\nThe Office for National Statistics said vacancies reached 1.1 million between July and September, the highest level since records began in 2001.\nThe Institute for Employment Studies said this month that labour shortages were affecting the whole economy. \nMany firms are being forced to pay signing on bonuses, or raise pay rates to tempt staff to work for them.\nStaff costs are among a host of price pressures facing businesses and Whitbread also pointed to rising utility costs. \nHowever, the company said its recovery in recent months had been better than expected, and UK demand had been \"very strong\" since 17 May when Covid restrictions were eased to allow leisure overnight stays at its hotels.\nIt added that it now expects revenue-per-room rates to return to pre-pandemic levels next year.\nAt the start of this month Whitbread announced a pay increase for its UK-based hourly-paid staff. \nIt needs to add 2,000 staff to its current head count of 30,000, including in housekeeping, reception and kitchens.\nChief executive Alison Brittain said: \"Whitbread traded significantly ahead of the market in the UK during the first half of the year.\n\"The operating environment during the summer and into autumn has been challenging largely as a result of our very high occupancy levels, market-wide supply chain issues and a tighter labour supply in the hospitality sector.\"\nIts revenue remains 39% down on the same period pre-pandemic two years ago, but it has more than doubled since last year.\nPre-tax losses in the first half of the year narrowed from \u00a3724.7m last year to \u00a319.3m, but this was still well down on the profit of \u00a3219.9m made before the pandemic."

      "tags": "Budget 2021",
      "text": "The Treasury has released a deluge of funding announcements, days before the chancellor delivers his Budget on 27 October. \nStatements from the government setting out spending for transport, health and education have been put out in the past few days.\nCommons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is furious, telling MPs on Monday it was \"not acceptable\" to brief the media ahead of MPs and on Tuesday that the government was behaving in a \"discourteous manner\".\nHe thundered that ministers used to \"walk\" if they briefed about a Budget.\nIndeed, in 1947, then-Chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after he leaked details of his budget to a journalist.\nDefending pre-Budget announcements, Treasury Minister Simon Clarke said the government had not commented on the \"substantive tax measures\" that would appear in the Budget.\nSo what do we know?\nFirstly, this isn't the complete story. \nRishi Sunak's Budget won't all be about displays of generosity. The Treasury has asked departments to identify \"at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets\" and we may hear more about those plans on Wednesday. \nThe government has already committed to spending for health, schools, defence and overseas aid so other areas such as local government, justice and further education may face a squeeze on their budgets.\nAnd there may be more to some of the seemingly lavish spending pledges than meets the eye.\nAnalysis by political correspondent Damian Grammaticas\nBeware what you are reading! They sound good, all these announcements in the run up to Budget and Spending Review. \nBut they need to be taken with caution. This is the PR blitz seeking good headlines. We don't yet know the detail of exactly what the government is planning. \nThe raft of investments will make a difference. But there are questions. \nAre the transport links, treatment centres and other projects entirely new or have some parts been announced (with equal fanfare) before now? \nCrucially what is happening more broadly to the budgets of the departments getting cash? \nA shiny investment in something is great, but is that department's day-to-day spending being squeezed? And what of those areas that aren't getting the handouts?\nBest to wait until Wednesday to truly judge the chancellor's largesse.\nThe government has announced that England's city regions will receive \u00a36.9bn to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects.\nThis includes \u00a31.07bn for Greater Manchester, \u00a31.05bn for the West Midlands and \u00a3830m for West Yorkshire.  \nHowever, the figure of \u00a36.9bn only includes \u00a31.5bn of additional spending because the government is including the \u00a34.2bn promised in 2019 alongside funding for buses announced by the prime minister last year.\nThe chancellor has refused to be drawn on the future of the eastern leg of High Speed Two, which could be delayed or cancelled to save an estimated \u00a340bn.  If built, the extension would cut journey times between London and the North East by 31 minutes. It would also shave 52 minutes off trips between London and Leeds.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England.\nNHS England will get \u00a35.9bn to tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. That covers \u00a32.3bn for diagnostic tests including clinics in shopping centres for scans; \u00a31.5bn on beds equipment and new \"surgical hubs\"; and \u00a32.1bn to improve IT. \nHealth bodies welcomed the money but warned it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. According to data published by NHS digital, in June there were 93,806 full-time vacancies across the NHS in England.\nMr Sunak is set to announce a rise in the National Living Wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50, to come into effect from 1 April next year.\nThis is a 6.6% increase in the minimum wage for all those aged 23 and over - more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living.\nAssuming a 40 hour week, the new minimum wage amounts to a salary of \u00a31,646 per month or \u00a319,760 a year. \nThe increases to the wage rates follow recommendations made by the Low Pay Commission, an independent advisory board.\nThe Treasury has also announced it will be lifting a pay freeze imposed on millions of public sector workers last year as a result of the pandemic. \nIndependent pay review bodies will recommend how much extra money workers will get early next year.\nThe government's major tax change has already been announced, as earlier this year the prime minister told MPs he would introduce a tax in England designed to tackle the NHS backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and later to pay for social care.\nHowever, we know a few other changes (or rather lack of changes) that will be announced on Wednesday.\nCampaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the levy to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row. \nAnd separately, the BBC has been told VAT on household energy would not be cut. \nThe health department will get \u00a35bn over the next three years for research and development.\nThis includes \u00a395m which will go towards researching methods for treating cancer, obesity and mental health.\nThe money will also be spent on developing genome technology which could detect more than 200 conditions in newborn babies.\n\u00a32.6bn will be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities.\nThe money will also go towards improving school buildings' accessibility and funding new, special provision in free schools England.\nThe Budget will also include \u00a31.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds plus \u00a3550m for adult skills in England.\nCurrently there are over 6,000 on T-level courses, but the government hopes to ramp up those numbers. \nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned that the extra money was a \"gamble\" as it was unclear how many would want to take the qualification. \nThe government will also spend a further \u00a3830m modernising colleges in England.\nThe Treasury is allocating \u00a31.8bn for building around 160,000 new homes on derelict or unused land - also known as brownfield sites - in England. \nAn extra \u00a39m will also go towards allowing councils to turn neglected urban spaces into \"pocket parks\" roughly the size of a tennis court.\nThe chancellor is also expected to confirm \u00a365m for digitising England's planning system.\nGrants worth \u00a31.4bn will be given to \"internationally mobile\" companies to invest in UK infrastructure.\nThis includes \u00a3345m aimed at increasing resilience for future pandemics and \u00a3800m for the production of electric vehicles in north-east England and the Midlands.\nAs part of the package, a talent network team will aim to attract high-skilled workers to the UK, through \"innovation hotspots\" initially based in San Francisco and Boston in the US and Bengaluru in India.\nThe government has announced \u00a3500m to support parents and children in England. \nThis includes \u00a3200m to support families with complex issues; \u00a382m to fund centres in 75 different areas to provide advice for parents; \u00a3100m for mental health support for expectant parents; and \u00a350m for breastfeeding support.\nLabour has argued that the government previously closed over 1,000 children's centres - known as Sure Start centres - and that this new announcement \"rings hollow\".\nMr Sunak defended past cuts, arguing that the new funding would \"create a network of family hubs which are broader than the Sure Start centres\".\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "Climate activists who slept overnight in London's Science Museum will approach the attraction's visitors to tell them about its sponsorship deals.\nA new gallery funded by a subsidiary of the Adani Group, a multinational business involved in coal extraction, is due to open in 2023.\nAbout 30 members of the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN) camped out in the lobby as a protest on behalf of \"victims\" of fossil fuel companies.\nNo arrests have been made.\nDemonstrator Izzy Warren, 17, said the group, which includes school pupils, university students and scientists, chose to occupy the museum because the owners had ignored their petitions, letters and boycotts.\n\"We would really like to greet people who come to the museum this morning so they are aware of what they are supporting, and what they are paying for.\n\"The Science Museum is blatantly taking money from some of the worst perpetrators of the climate crisis.\"\nThe demonstration comes after the Science Museum last week announced a new gallery, called Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery. \nAdani Green Energy is a solar power developer based in India and is a subsidiary of the Adani Group, which through another arm of its business is also involved in extracting coal.\nA spokesperson for the renewables company said: \"An environment where every child can grow up breathing pollution-free air - that is the environment we dream to create and have to a certain extent managed to enrich lives with our renewable energy plants.\n\"Adani Green Energy is pioneering in helping transition to renewable power generation. We develop, build, own, operate and maintain utility scale grid connected solar and wind projects.\"\nBiologist Dr Alexander Penson, who took part in the sit-in, said it was \"appalling\" the museum was persisting in fossil fuel sponsorship and starting a new relationship with Adani.\nThe activists said they negotiated with museum staff to be moved from the second floor of the building to the Energy Hall near the main entrance so that they would have access to toilets for the whole night.\nLondon's Science Museum\nThe museum has also faced criticism for partnering with Shell to fund its Our Future Planet exhibition, which is about carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions to the climate crisis.\nThe agreement with the fossil fuel giant included a gagging clause, committing the museum not to say anything that could damage Shell's reputation.\nThe Science Museum has consistently defended its stance on working with fossil fuel partners.\nChief executive Ian Blatchford said trustees \"are not convinced by the argument from some who say we should sever all ties with organisations that are 'tainted' by association, direct or indirect, with fossil fuels.\n\"We believe the right approach is to engage, debate and challenge companies, governments and individuals to do more to make the global economy less carbon intensive. \n\"Adani Green Energy is an example of an energy sector business bringing expertise and investment to renewables at the scale needed to deliver meaningful change.\" \nA Met Police spokesperson said: \"Officers attended and engaged with the protesters and museum staff.\n\"The protesters stated their intention was to remain in the museum overnight. This was agreed to by museum staff.\n\"No further police action was required.\""

It was a big moment in the royal calendar and it's a decision that would not have been taken lightly.\nOnly on Tuesday morning the 95-year-old Queen was shown back at work and sending a signal that all was well.\nHer meetings on Tuesday were held on video - and a video message will be sent to the Glasgow summit - so perhaps this will be more of how we'll see the monarch in future.\nShe will be more online, while those in-line will take up more of the public responsibilities.\nThe Queen spent the night of 20 October in a London hospital before returning the next day to Windsor Castle, where she was said to be \"in good spirits\".\nShe did not attend a church service at Windsor on Sunday.\nIt has been a busy period of official engagements for the Queen.\nAn official record of her diary showed at least 16 formal events during October.\nShe has been seen using a walking stick at recent public events, including at a Westminster Abbey service and when she opened the sixth term of the Senedd in Wales.\nIn its latest statement, the palace said: \"Following advice to rest, The Queen has been undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle.\n\"Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend the evening reception of COP26 on Monday, 1 November.\"\nThe statement concluded: \"Her Majesty is disappointed not to attend the reception but will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message.\"\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "Sewage,Conservative Party,Water pollution,House of Lords",
      "text": "The government says it will force water companies to make a \"progressive reduction\" in the sewage it dumps in rivers, amid pressure from the Lords. \nPeers proposed a change to the Environment Bill last week in an attempt to cut the pollution, but it did not win enough support from MPs.\nIt led to a backlash on social media, and Lords promising to try again. \nBut Environment Secretary George Eustice has now promised to bolster measures by making them a legal duty.\nHe said the government already had plans in place to require water companies to act on sewage, but added: \"We've listened to the debate in Parliament [and] we will write what was already government policy into [law] to give people the reassurance they seek.\"\nThe crossbench peer who put forward the Lords amendment, the Duke of Wellington, said he met Mr Eustice earlier on Tuesday ahead of a debate in Parliament on the Environment Bill. \nSpeaking in the Lords, he said was \"grateful for the gesture\", but he had yet to form an opinion on the language of the government's proposal, so would be pushing ahead with his own plan to end the \"revolting practice\".\nThe duke's amendment passed in the Lords by 213 votes to 60, and will now be debated by MPs at a later date.  \nHowever, due to parliamentary rules, his amendment would have to be approved by the Lords anyway to allow the government to replace it with its own plan when the bill returns to the Commons. \nThe environmental issue has come to a head days before the start of the COP26 climate summit, being hosted by the UK in Glasgow.\nThe Environment Agency allows water utilities to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather events, such as prolonged heavy rain.\nThis protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes.\nBut according to the public body's own figures, water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times last year, with untreated effluent - including human waste, wet wipes and condoms - released into waterways for more than three million hours in 2020.\nThe Lords agreed an amendment to the Environment Bill that would put a legal duty on water companies and the government to demonstrate progressive reductions in discharges of untreated sewage and required them to \"take all reasonable steps\" to avoid using combined sewer overflows.\nBut when the proposal was voted on by MPs last week, it lost by 265 votes to 202 - even with 22 Tories rebelling against the government to vote in favour of the plan. \nThe government had said the amount of sewage discharged by water companies was \"not acceptable\" and that it had made it \"crystal clear\" to firms that significant reductions must be a priority. \nBut a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the intentions of the Lords' amendment, which it said would involve an overhaul of the UK's Victorian sewerage system - would cost upwards of \u00a3150bn.\n\"That would mean that individuals - every one of us as taxpayers - paying potentially thousands of pounds each as a result,\" they added. \nShortly before the issue was brought up again for debate in the Lords, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs proposed its own amendment for when the bill returns to the Commons.\nThe new legal duty would be placed directly on water companies to make a \"progressive reduction\" in the sewage it dumps into rivers. \nIt follows on from advice it gave the industry's financial regulator, Ofwat, earlier this year, saying water companies must take steps to significantly reduce storm overflows and that the regulator should ensure funding should be approved for them to do so.\nAnd the firms would need to produce \"comprehensive statutory Drainage and Sewerage Management Plans, setting out how they will manage and develop their drainage and sewerage system over a minimum 25-year planning horizon - including how storm overflows will be addressed\".\nA number of peers welcomed the move by the government, but some warned it still may not go far enough, with Labour's Baroness Quin saying she hoped the government would move even further now people across the country were \"waking up to the problem\".\nLabour's shadow environment secretary, Luke Pollard, also said the \"screeching u-turn\" on the issue due to the public backlash would \"do little to convince the public that the health of our rivers, rather than the health of Conservative polling, is at the forefront of ministers' minds\".\nHe added: \"The government still has no clear plan and no grip on the issue of raw sewage being pumped into our seas and rivers.\""

These orders were granted to National Highways.\nIn addition, Transport for London was granted a civil banning order earlier this month to prevent activists obstructing traffic on the city's roads - an order which was extended last week.\nBreaches of the injunctions could lead to jail terms. However, so far, the injunctions have failed to put a stop to the protests.\nEarlier this month, the group, whose actions have led to angry exchanges with members of the public caught up in traffic disruption, suspended its campaigning for 11 days, from 14 October.\nBut protesters vowed to restart its action if Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not deliver \"a meaningful or trustworthy statement\" on improving the insulation in some British homes.\nIn a statement following the most recent arrests on Monday, Insulate Britain said: \"We won't stand by while the government kills our kids.\""

      "text": "The Duke of York must answer questions in a civil sex assault case in the US by mid-July next year, a US judge ruled.\nVirginia Giuffre, 38, has accused Prince Andrew of sexually assaulting her in New York in 2001.\nThe duke, the Queen's 61-year-old second son, has consistently denied the allegation.\nDepositions - out-of-court testimony - in the case must be submitted by 14 July, district judge Lewis Kaplan said.\nIn the US depositions see witnesses interviewed under oath by the other side's lawyers about their version of events.\nThe judge also ruled in the scheduling order, which is signed by lawyers for both parties, that a pre-trial order, which sets out the course of the case, is due by 28 July.\nNo additional parties will be allowed to join the case after 15 December, the order says.\nIn September the duke's US lawyers accepted he had been served with legal papers relating to the case, after a dispute over whether he had been formally notified of the civil claim against him.\nMs Giuffre, who was also an accuser of the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, claims she was sexually assaulted by the prince at three locations, including in New York City.\nIn 2019 US financier Epstein was found dead in his cell in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center.\nMs Giuffre, who was then known as Virginia Roberts, says she was assaulted by the prince at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little Saint James, in the US Virgin Islands.\nHer case claims Prince Andrew engaged in sexual acts without Ms Giuffre's consent, including when she was 17, knowing how old she was, and \"that she was a sex-trafficking victim\".\nThe prince has consistently denied the claims and, in 2019, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"It didn't happen.\n\"I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened.\n\"I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\"\nEarlier this month the Metropolitan Police said it would not take any further action against the duke after a review prompted by Ms Giuffre."

      "title": "Rust: Assistant director had previously been sacked over gun safety",
      "tags": "Alec Baldwin,Film",
      "text": "The assistant director of Rust, Dave Halls, had been sacked from a previous production over gun safety violations.\nActor Alec Baldwin accidentally shot dead Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western last week.\nThe producers of Freedom's Path confirmed to press agency AFP on Monday that Halls had been dismissed in 2019.\nIt came after a crew member \"incurred a minor and temporary injury when a gun was unexpectedly discharged\", the statement said.\nRocket Soul Studios said Halls could not be reached for a comment. There is no suggestion that Halls was at fault for the Rust incident.\nThe studio's producers said in a statement sent to the BBC: \"First of all, our condolences go out to everyone affected by the recent tragic event in New Mexico.\n\"Halls was removed from set immediately after the prop gun discharged. Production did not resume filming until Dave was off-site. An incident report was taken and filed at that time.\"\nAn affidavit filed over the Rust incident said Halls had handed the gun to Baldwin during a rehearsal and called out \"cold gun\" as he did so, meaning the weapon had no live ammunition.\n\"The assistant director (Dave Halls) did not know live rounds were in the prop gun,\" the affidavit said. \nThe description \"prop gun\" can refer to a range of items, from non-functioning weapons to cap guns. It can also mean a real gun, as in this case. \nSpeaking on Monday, Juan Rios, spokesman for the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department which is investigating the incident, described it as \"a complicated case\".\nHe said investigators had interviewed Hannah Gutierrez, who was responsible for the safety of weapons on the set, but gave no further details.  Gutierrez has not yet commented publicly and the BBC has been unable to reach her. \nAn inventory of seized items that was released on Monday also showed that detectives had recovered loose and boxed ammunition from the set, though they would not say which kind. \nInvestigators hope a forensic analysis of ballistic evidence will shed light on what kind of projectile was fired from the gun and how it got there.\nHutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was injured when a revolver that Baldwin was using during rehearsal discharged. \nBaldwin, the director and other members of the cast and crew have also been interviewed. No charges have been brought yet.\nBefore the incident, camera operators had walked off the set to protest against working conditions.\nIn her first public statement about the incident, Baldwin's wife Hilaria said on Monday that \"it's impossible to express the shock and heartache of such a tragic accident.\"\n\"My heart is with Halyna. Her husband. Her son. Their family and loved ones. And my Alec,\" she posted on Instagram.\nElsewhere, a T-shirt which declares: \"Guns Don't Kill People, Alec Baldwin Kills People\" is being sold for $27.99 (\u00a320.32) on a merchandise site linked to Donald Trump Jr, the son of the former US President - who Baldwin has routinely mocked on Saturday Night Live.\nMany have criticised the T-shirts but Trump Jr has defended the product, tweeting: \"Spare me your fake sanctimony.\"\nMeanwhile, Flint: Who Can You Trust?, an environmental documentary narrated by Baldwin, has been postponed, its director said, following the fatal shooting.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
