      "text": "Boris Johnson has fired a string of cabinet ministers - and promoted new faces to replace them - in a major reshuffle.\nThe prime minister sacked under-fire Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and moved Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to the justice department.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel keep their jobs.\nBut there are promotions for Liz Truss, who goes to the Foreign Office, and Nadine Dorries, who gets culture.\nDowning Street said the aim of the reshuffle was to \"put in place a strong and united team to build back better from the pandemic\".\nMore moves are expected over the coming hours, as Mr Johnson seeks to fill vacant positions. \nIn addition to justice secretary and Lord Chancellor, Mr Raab has also been given the title of deputy prime minister, after what is understood to have been a lengthy and difficult conversation with the prime minister. \nA source denied Mr Raab was angry with the move from the Foreign Office, but he is understood to be unhappy with the way his handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan was portrayed.\nIn other moves:\nThe big winners from the reshuffle include Ms Dorries, a junior health minister and best-selling novelist who has never sat in the cabinet before, and Ms Truss, who moves into one of the top three jobs in government from the Department for International Trade.\nNew Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Michael Gove will get the added responsibility of the government's \"levelling up\" agenda - spreading wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum.\nThe way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. \nFor weeks, ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: \"Is it on?\"\nPeople in the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know.\nBut, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings.\nAnd Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet - the most significant switch coming in one of the chunkiest jobs of all.\nRead more from Laura\nLosers from the reshuffle include Mr Williamson, who has faced repeated opposition calls to quit, or be sacked, over his handling of disruption to schools and exams during the pandemic.\nHe said he was \"proud\" of the \"transformational reforms I've led in post-16 education: in further education colleges, our skills agenda, apprenticeships and more\".\nFor Labour, shadow education secretary Kate Green said Mr Williamson had \"failed children and young people, their parents and our hard-working education staff throughout one of the most testing periods in our history\".\nRobert Buckland also looks set for a return to the backbenches after being replaced by Mr Raab as justice secretary and Lord Chancellor.\nBBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said Mr Buckland was a respected figure in the legal profession, but leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. \nLabour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: \"Appointing a failed foreign secretary who was fired for being missing in action to be the sixth justice secretary in six years shows how little this government cares about victims of crime.\""

      "title": "Covid booster vaccine rollout to begin across UK next week",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid booster jabs will begin to be offered across the UK from next week.\nIt follows a recommendation from the government's vaccine advisers, the JCVI, who said about 30m people should be offered a third dose.\nThey said the booster should be given at least six months after a person had their second dose - with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab recommended.\nThose eligible include over-50s, younger adults with health conditions and frontline health and care workers. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid made the announcement in the Commons as part of an autumn and winter plan for managing Covid in England.\nScotland will begin offering booster jabs for the broader group from Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. \nShe said the programme \"was intended to prolong the protection\" of vaccines and will run alongside the flu vaccination programme.\nThe go-ahead was also confirmed in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe recommendation from the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) comes amid concern about waning immunity.\nThere are some signs protection offered by the vaccine may start dropping off several months after the second dose - with the most vulnerable groups most at risk of this.\nIn his statement, Mr Javid told MPs: \"There is evidence that the protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines reduces over time, particularly older people who are at greater risk, so booster doses are an important way of keeping the virus under control for the long term.\"\nThe JCVI said it was still unclear exactly how much protection does slip, but it wanted to take a precautionary approach and ensure the most vulnerable people maintain high levels of protection.\nThe advice is separate to the recent recommendation of third doses for people with severely weakened immune systems - something that is already being rolled out. \nThose eligible for a booster jab include:\nThere is a huge amount of uncertainty about what winter will bring. In fact, it's not even clear what the next month will bring.\nIt was feared September could see Covid cases rise, but there are no signs of that happening yet.\nBig surges in infection levels are probably behind us, given the amount of immunity built up in the population.\nBut if current levels are sustained throughout winter, the NHS will struggle. And even a small dip in vaccine effectiveness could make a big difference to admissions - hence the booster announcement.\nThen there is the concern about the return of other respiratory viruses. They were kept at bay last year by lockdowns and social distancing, but that has meant immunity to them has waned.\nA virus called RSV - the leading cause of respiratory illness in young children - is already circulating at very high levels. Flu could also take off. \nIt is why the NHS is having to prepare for the worst, while hoping for the best.\nTrials have been carried out in the UK looking at the use of booster jabs.\nThe JCVI said these showed Pfizer was well-tolerated and provoked a good immune response, including against new variants of the virus, such as Delta, regardless of which Covid vaccine had been given for the first two doses.\nIt said where Pfizer was not available a half-dose of Moderna could also be used.\nFor people who cannot have the Pfizer or Moderna because of issues like allergies, the AstraZeneca vaccine can be used as a booster.\nA gap of six months between the second dose and the booster shot was considered the most effective for boosting protection.\nThe trials also showed the flu vaccine can also be given at the same time as the booster jab where that is practical - some people will be offered a flu jab before they become eligible for a Covid booster.\nJCVI chairman Prof Wei Shen Lim said: \"The UK's Covid vaccination programme has been hugely successful in protecting people against hospitalisation and death, and the main aim of the booster programme is to prolong that protection and reduce serious disease as we head towards the colder months.\"\nHe said even a small tip in vaccine effectiveness could have a big impact on hospital admission numbers given the size of the population.\nHe said those under 50 were likely to have a more long-lasting immune response to the first two doses of vaccine so may not need a booster - although he did not rule it out happening completely.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam said the UK was likely to be in for a \"bumpy winter\" with Covid, coupled with other respiratory viruses, such as flu, returning - previously lockdowns and social distancing meant these were kept at very low levels.\nHe said the booster programme was about \"staying on top of Covid\" and could make a \"very substantial impact\" on hospitalisations and deaths.\nAbout 85% of deaths in recent weeks have been among the over 60s.\nBut Prof Van Tam added it was also important that those who had not yet come forward for jab did so - more than five million adults have not yet had their first dose yet.\nThe announcement comes after the government confirmed on Monday that all children aged 12 to 15 in England would be offered one dose of the Pfizer jab, with invitations going out from next week. \nIt follows advice from the UK's chief medical officers, who say the jab will help reduce disruption to education.\nA rollout is yet to be confirmed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn a statement before the announcement on the booster programme, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said while the pandemic \"is far from over\", the \"phenomenal vaccine programme, new treatments and testing\" mean the UK is \"able to live with the virus without significant restrictions on our freedoms\". \nThe PM, who is holding a coronavirus press conference later, said he would lay out a strategy for the months ahead \"when the virus has a natural advantage, to protect the gains we have made\".

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Elizabeth Truss",
      "text": "At the age of 46, Liz Truss has become the UK's second female foreign secretary - following a trail blazed previously only by Labour's Margaret Beckett 15 years ago.\nIn a relatively short time in Parliament, she has held a wide variety of posts, dealing with high-profile domestic and international issues.\nBut her new role will bring a new level of scrutiny, as her predecessor Dominic Raab found when he faced widespread criticism for remaining on holiday during the Afghanistan crisis.\nMs Truss, who has a husband and two daughters, has plenty of big issues in her Foreign Office in-tray, her promotion coming at a time when China, Russia, the UK's place in a post-Brexit world and Iran's nuclear programme are provoking many questions in diplomatic circles.\nBorn in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss describes her parents, a mathematics professor and a nurse, as \"left-wing\". \nIt was not a characteristic inherited by their daughter.\nShe moved to Paisley, in Scotland, aged four, and, in 1983 - in a hint of her future political proclivities - played the part of Margaret Thatcher in a school dramatic production.\nThe family then decamped to Leeds, where she attended a state secondary school.\nMrs Truss went on to Oxford University, where she read philosophy, politics and economics and was active in student politics, initially for the Liberal Democrats and later for the Conservatives.\nAfterwards she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, but her heart was set on Westminster.\nShe was the Tory candidate for Hemsworth and Calder Valley in the 2001 and 2005 general elections, failing to win either seat. But she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, from 2008 also working as deputy director of the right-of-centre Reform think tank.\nPart of Conservative leader David Cameron's \"A-list\" of priority candidates, Ms Truss was finally elected MP for for the safe Tory seat of South West Norfolk in 2010, with a 13,140-vote majority.\nWhile in Parliament she co-authored a book called Britannia Unchained, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches.\nIn 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister.\nShe clashed with Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg over schools reform, but Mr Cameron promoted her to the cabinet in 2014, as environment secretary.\nAt the 2015 Conservative conference, Ms Truss was mocked for giving a speech including an impassioned section on UK cheese imports, but this did not impede her progress.\nIn 2016, she became justice secretary under Theresa May, the following year moving on to become chief secretary to the Treasury, a position at the heart of the government's economic programme.\nAfter Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which means meeting political and business leaders to promote UK PLC.\nAs foreign secretary she will rack up just as many, if not more, air miles, with an awful lot more people watching her every move."

The paper also said that the research had repeatedly found it is harmful for a large proportion of users, especially teenage girls.\nIn a lengthy statement, Instagram acknowledged the existence of research reported by The Wall Street Journal but said the story \"focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light\".\nThe social media firm also said it stood by the research and that: \"It demonstrates our commitment to understanding complex and difficult issues young people may struggle with, and informs all the work we do to help those experiencing these issues.\"\nThe BBC Action Line has details of organisations offering information and support if you, or someone you know, has been affected by the issues raised in this story"

      "text": "Haiti's Prime Minister Ariel Henry has been banned from leaving the country amid an investigation into his alleged involvement in the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse. \nA prosecutor is seeking charges against Mr Henry, who has been asked to explain his links with a key suspect in the killing, Joseph Felix Badio.\nRecords show the two men had multiple phone calls just hours after the assassination, prosecutors say.\nMr Mo\u00efse was killed at home on 7 July.\nHe was shot dead after gunmen stormed his private residence in a suburb of the capital, Port-au-Prince. His death triggered a political crisis which was exacerbated when a huge earthquake struck the south of Haiti a month ago. \nOn Monday, Mr Henry sent a letter purportedly sacking Chief Prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude and accusing him of a \"serious administrative offence\". He later nominated a replacement. \nHowever, on Tuesday Mr Claude appeared to remain in his post as he asked a judge investigating the murder of Mr Mo\u00efse to charge the prime minister over his \"suspected\" involvement in the case.\nSources with knowledge of Haiti say it is not in the prime minister's remit to dismiss the prosecutor.\nHaiti's justice minister has ordered extra police protection for Mr Claude following a number of reported threats. \nProsecutors say records obtained from phone operator Digicel have confirmed that Mr Badio - a justice ministry official accused of planning the assassination - and Mr Henry spoke twice shortly after Mr Mo\u00efse's killing.\nGeolocation data also showed that Mr Badio, who disappeared after the murder and is currently being sought by police, was speaking from somewhere close to the scene of the crime. He has not publicly commented on these claims.\nThe prime minister recently rejected what he called \"diversionary tactics\" intended to \"sow confusion\" without responding to the specific accusations against him.\nMr Henry has previously told local media that he knew Mr Badio. He has defended him and said that he did not believe he was involved because he did not have the means.\nThe prime minister was reportedly given a deadline of Tuesday 14 September to supply the investigation with information.\nIt comes as authorities step up their efforts to arrest additional suspects in the assassination.\nPolice say there are now 44 people held in custody in connection with the plot, including 18 retired members of the Colombian military."

      "text": "Influencers are to be signed up by the City regulator in a campaign to warn people about the pitfalls of high-risk investments.\nSome celebrities have been criticised for their part in promoting trading apps which have proved popular among young people drawn into investing.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants to reach these risk-takers in a planned \u00a311m awareness campaign.\nIt is part of a wider strategy to ensure investors are well-treated.\n\"Investors have never had more freedom. Technology has democratised the market, new products have become available and people have better access to their life savings than before,\" said Sarah Pritchard, executive director of markets at the FCA.\n\"But that freedom comes with risk. We want to give consumers greater confidence to invest and to help them do so safely, understanding the level of risk.\"\nIn the strategy, the FCA has repeated its warning that some people have invested money for the first time during the pandemic in products which have unsuitably high risks for their financial circumstances.\nIt has warned they are getting involved in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange owing to the thrill of investing, rather than for long-term savings goals.\nAlongside that, there has been concern that some celebrities have been endorsing certain products without making their own gain clear.\nIn August, an Instagram post by TV star Lauren Goodger was banned because she did not clearly mark it as an advert.\nA survey by investment platform Interactive Investor found that 45% of young investors aged 18 to 29 said their first ever investment was in cryptocurrency, while many were funding this through a cocktail of credit cards, student loans, and other loans.\nAs a result, the FCA is planning a campaign to help people make well-informed decisions.\n\"We plan to use a range of channels to reach our audience, including partnerships with influencers, social media, online videos, paid ads on Google and more,\" the strategy said.\nThe FCA also points out that nearly 8.6 million people currently hold more than \u00a310,000 of investible assets in cash.\nIn a major boost for the investment industry, in the next five years the regulator aims to reduce the number of consumers by a fifth who could benefit from investment earnings but are missing out.\nThis could potentially mean 1.7 million people, each with more than \u00a310,000 put away, making the jump from cash savings to investments.\nLaura Suter, from investment company AJ Bell, said: \"For many of these individuals, investing is a logical route, as they don't need the safety of cash or immediate access to their money, but it's often a job on the to-do list that people don't get around to.\"\nLiz Field, of the Personal Investment Management and Financial Advice Association, said that the FCA should have been more ambitious in its supervisory role."

      "tags": "UK government,Boris Johnson,Cabinet reshuffles",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson carried out a reshuffle of his cabinet on Wednesday, removing several key ministers including Gavin Williamson. \nThis is the second major reshuffle since Mr Johnson became leader of the Conservative party and took over as prime minister from Theresa May in July 2019. The last one took place in February 2020.\nSome of the big moves included Liz Truss to foreign secretary, the Tories' first woman in that role; Nadhim Zahawi moved from leading the vaccine rollout to education - at the expense of Mr Williamson; and Nadine Dorries stepped up from health minister to culture secretary.\nWho's in the other posts? Here's a guide to the people that make up Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces and who's changed places.\nNote: BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) is a term widely used in the UK to describe people of non-white descent, as defined by the Institute of Race Relations.\nClick here if you cannot see the Cabinet Guide\nAs well as Mr Williamson, Mr Johnson removed three other members of the cabinet: Robert Jenrick, who was housing secretary; Robert Buckland, who was justice secretary; and Amanda Milling, who was Conservative Party co-chair - although she has been handed a ministerial role at the Foreign Office. \nDominic Raab, who had been the foreign secretary, was demoted to justice secretary. \nAccording to data from ConservativeHome, Mr Williamson was the least popular member of the cabinet with Conservative party members. Liz Truss, who has been promoted to foreign secretary from international trade secretary, was the most popular.\nThe make-up of the cabinet has also changed with all the comings and goings. \nThere are two more women then there had been before the reshuffle, but the proportion has stayed about the same because the overall number of people attending cabinet has also increased slightly. \nAs for the education of those now in cabinet, about 63% of them went to private schools, down slightly when compared to Mr Johnson's previous reshuffle last year - but still a stark contrast to his predecessor's.\nJust 30% of Theresa May's first cabinet in 2016 attended independent schools, which was fewer than both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's original cabinets. \nAccording to the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at Oxford - except for Mr Brown.\nAt 43%, Mr Johnson's new cabinet has slightly fewer members who were educated at Oxford or Cambridge compared to his last reshuffle - but it's still more than double what is was in Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1997.

      "tags": "Economics,Inflation,UK economy,Bank of England",
      "text": "Price rises have seen the biggest jump since records began in 1997 as the economy continued to reopen.\nOfficial figures show that the increase in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, hit 3.2% in the year to August.\nHigher prices in restaurants and for recreation and food were behind the spike, up from 2% the previous month.\nThe cost of living rose less rapidly in July because of lower clothing and footwear prices.\nHowever, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) urged caution in reading too much into August's price increases, which it described as \"temporary\".\nEating and drinking out cost more last month in comparison with August last year, when the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme was running and diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals up to \u00a310 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.\nAt the same time, business owners in the hospitality and tourism sectors received a VAT discount, designed to help some of the industries worst hit by the pandemic.\nJonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: \"August saw the largest rise in annual inflation month-on-month since the series was introduced almost a quarter of a century ago.\n\"However, much of this is likely to be temporary, as last year, restaurant and cafe prices fell substantially due to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, while this year, prices rose.\"\nIn August this year, transport costs also increased. \nAverage petrol prices stood at 134.6 pence a litre, compared with 113.1 pence a litre a year earlier, when travel was reduced under lockdown restrictions.\nUsed car prices were also partly to blame for price rises - they increased by 4.9% in just one month. Since April, they have gone up by more than 18% amid a shortage of new models.\nHow will price rises affect you? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk\nSimply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a \u00a31 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%.\nIt applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted.\nYou may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money.\nRead more about inflation here.\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that price rises seen in August were \"almost unavoidable\" because of the discounts available in 2020.\n\"Inflation, which is a year-on-year comparison, was always going to look strong compared to last year,\" she said.\n\"Some of that rise reflected genuine factors too. In particular, we are now seeing the effects of higher global shipping costs and shortages of staff driving up food price inflation.\"\nShe also expects, however, that the cost of living could continue to increase rapidly, with inflation exceeding 4% by November.\nThe latest official figures will add to the debate about whether interest rates need to go up to curb consumer spending and moderate prices.\nInflation now exceeds the Bank of England's 2% target, aimed at keeping cost increases steady.\nBut Capital Economics points out that inflation is likely to fall back almost as sharply next year and that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is not expected to raise interest rates until 2023.\nThe central bank's deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, insisted in July that it would not stop its efforts to boost the economy, despite the forecast of higher costs.\n\"While we know [inflation] is going to go further over the next few months, I'm not convinced that the current inflation in retail goods prices should in and of itself mean higher inflation 18 to 24 months ahead, the horizon more relevant for monetary policy,\" he said.\nMost of the inflation in goods prices was down to oil price rises and supply chain issues, he said, which was likely to \"fall away\" in the early part of 2022.\nBut given that Wednesday's latest figures breach the Bank's target, it must now write to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to explain what it will do to ensure that price prices are steady in future.\nJames Lyon Shaw, who owns the Greene Oak Pub in Windsor, Berkshire, told the BBC the rise in inflation had to be taken in context and that businesses, including his own, needed to \"ride the storm\".\nHe is paying his employees 10 to 20% more an hour compared to last year due to the wider workforce shortages.\nHe said increases in food prices depended on where restaurants and pubs source their food, with rises in haulage and logistics costs hitting profit margins.\n\"We just have got to get through, you've got to be pragmatic, get on and adapt your business.\"\nHe questioned if people had enjoyed access to \"cheap food\" for too long and whether there needed to be a shift in attitudes to pay for more sustainably produced products.\nYael\u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, added: \"Higher inflation will inevitably raise questions for the Bank of England on the timing of tightening monetary policy and interest rate hikes to contain inflationary risks further down the line.\"\nShe added: \"However, any tightening now risks scuppering the recovery before it has a chance to take hold, so a delay until the middle of next year is likely.\"\nUK businesses are reporting difficulties in sourcing goods and recruiting staff because of disruption caused by the pandemic and problems such as HGV driver shortages, exacerbated by Brexit.\nAccording to a survey of 2,000 people by Retail Economics, more than half of consumers are concerned about rising costs as a result.\nThe market research firm said on Wednesday that worries about the cost of living had reached their highest point in more than five years.\nA record monthly spike in inflation, up to levels not seen for more than eight years, reflects a spluttering restart to the economy. Demand has rebounded, but the supply of goods and labour has not. \nIn August, there were one-off factors from the discounts and support measures last year. \nAs inflation is above 3%, the Bank of England governor has to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why. Stripping out the impact of Eat Out to Help Out last year would have meant this was not necessary.\nThis inflation number will go higher still in the coming months because of rising home energy bills. Alongside the rise in petrol prices and frankly incredible increase in used car prices, these inflationary pressures are becoming very visible. \nThe maths suggests that inflation could top 4% and then fall just as sharply, as long as there are no further economic shocks. Public perceptions matter significantly in regard to wage settlements for next year.\nWhile the number is high and rising, this is still consistent with a \"transitory\" post-lockdown reopening inflation spike, predicted by the central bank."

      "text": "Plans for tackling Covid during autumn and winter in England have been unveiled, with Boris Johnson warning the disease \"remains a risk\".\nThey include booster jabs for millions - but hold in reserve measures like vaccine passports for certain settings.\n\"Plan A\" is designed to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed, and promotes vaccines and testing.\n\"Plan B\", to be used if the NHS is coming under \"unsustainable pressure\", includes measures such as face masks.\nUnder Plan A of the autumn and winter plan, announced by Health Secretary Sajid Javid, ministers will:\nThe plan will also include continuing testing, tracing of cases and self-isolation for those who catch the virus.\nBusinesses will also be encouraged to consider using the NHS Covid Pass to check the vaccination or test status of customers. \nUnder Plan B - which ministers say would only be enacted if further measures are needed to protect the NHS:\nGuidance on working from home may also be issued under this plan.\nMr Johnson, discussing the plan at a Downing Street news conference, said he was confident vaccinations could protect the gains made so far.\nThe prime minister said he hoped the vaccination programme meant the UK could remain \"one of the most free societies\" in Europe, with only limited restrictions to keep the disease in check.\nAsked in what circumstances he would consider moving from Plan A to the stricter Plan B, Mr Johnson said he would consider the risks, the state of the disease and factors like hospital pressure.\nPlan B made use of \"a number of different shots in the locker\", he said.\n\"You wouldn't necessarily play them all at once, far from it, you would want to do things in a graduated way,\" he said.\n\"Because so many of the population have some degree of immunity, smaller changes in the way we're asking people to behave can have a bigger impact.\"\nHe added that this would \"give us the confidence that we don't have to go back to the lockdowns of the past\".\nSir Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser, said that if the country had gone into last winter with the current level of restrictions, cases would have gone \"through the roof\".\nHe said it underlined the importance of getting the vaccine to as many people as possible.\n\"There are five million or so people who are eligible for vaccines now who haven't been vaccinated,\" he said.\n\"Trying to persuade those people it is the right thing to do to get vaccinated would make a significant difference.\"\nProf Chris Whitty, chief medical adviser, warned that \"winter is coming\" and that respiratory viruses such as flu and others would be \"hugely advantaged\".\n\"If you've not had your vaccination, now is a very good time to do so,\" he said.\nThe government wants to avoid bringing back restrictions in England.\nNot just the big ones - like closing down shops or pubs. But the smaller ones too - like telling people they must wear face coverings in certain venues or that they should work from home.\nThe autumn and winter plan keeps the latter on the table. The prime minister gave us an idea of why. He doesn't want Covid vaccine passports, he says, but if it prevents having to close certain venues in future, he's prepared to keep the prospect alive. \nThe plan also says \"more harmful economic and social restrictions\" are a last resort - ministers are desperate to avoid them. \nBut the uncertainties of the next few weeks and months mean they cannot be taken off the table completely. \nEarlier, Mr Javid told MPs it was highly likely frontline NHS staff and those in wider social care settings will need to have Covid-19 and flu vaccinations so they can be deployed.\nThe health secretary said the government would be \"keeping an open mind\" and waiting for the results of a consultation but he believed this would be \"an important step in protecting those at greatest risk\". \nHe described Plan B measures as those \"that we can call upon only if they are needed and supported by the data to prevent unsustainable pressure on the NHS\". \nUnder that plan, the government expects proof of vaccination would be mandatory for nightclubs, crowded indoor venues with more than 500 attendees, crowded outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, such as festivals, as well as any settings with more than 10,000 people. \nPlan A or Plan B - what could happen this winter?\nMr Javid said the government would remove more of its powers in the Coronavirus Act, including those directing the temporary closure of schools. \nHowever, those that are \"critical\" to the pandemic response, such as supporting statutory sick pay for those self-isolating, will remain.\nMr Javid suggested PCR tests for fully vaccinated travellers would be scrapped in favour of cheaper lateral flow tests - with a review of rules around international travel due by 1 October.\nA further 26,628 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Tuesday, alongside another 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe message from ministers in England is clear - we are going to try to rely almost entirely on the vaccines to protect us this winter.\nBut what is not spelt out is how bad it will have to get before we need to change course and move to Plan B.\nThe winter plan talks about \"unsustainable pressure\" on the NHS as the trigger, rather than too many deaths. \nSo what can the NHS cope with? The document does not spell that out.\nCurrently 7% of hospital beds are filled by Covid patients. That may not sound a lot, but hospitals are run close to capacity so Covid cases quickly impact on other care that can be provided.\nThe amount of non-emergency treatment being done is already nearly a fifth down on normal levels.\nIf Covid admissions keep growing or other respiratory illnesses take off, it will mean more rationing - from knee and hip replacements being delayed to people waiting longer for an ambulance.\nNone of this, though, is unusual - it happens every winter. But the scale of it could be very different. "

      "text": "Facebook-owned Instagram has been criticised for keeping secret its internal research into the effect social media had on teenager users.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, its studies showed teenagers blamed Instagram for increased levels of anxiety and depression. \nCampaign groups and MPs have said it is proof the company puts profit first.\nInstagram said the research showed its \"commitment to understanding complex and difficult issues\".\nThe Wall Street Journal's report, not disputed by Facebook, finds:\nIn response to the WSJ report, Instagram published a lengthy blog defending its research. \nThe WSJ story focused \"on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light\", it said, but the issue was far more complex.\n\"We've done extensive work around bullying, suicide and self-injury, and eating disorders, to help make Instagram a safe and supportive place for everyone,\" the company said in its post.\n\"Based on our research and feedback from experts, we've developed features so people can protect themselves from bullying, we've given everyone the option to hide 'like' counts and we've continued to connect people who may be struggling with local support organisations.\"\nIt was working on prompts to encourage people repeatedly dwelling on negative subjects to look at different topics, it said.\nAnd it promised to be more transparent about its research in future.\nBut National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children head of child safety online Andy Burrows said it was \"appalling they chose to sit on their hands rather than act on evidence\".\n\"Instead of working to make the site safe, they've obstructed researchers, regulators, and government and run a PR [public-relations] and lobbying campaign in an attempt to prove the opposite.\"\nMP Damian Collins, who is chairing the UK parliamentary committee looking at how big technology should be regulated to protect users' safety, said it was time to \"hold them to account\".\n\"The Wall Street Journal Facebook files investigation has exposed how the company, time and again, puts profit before harm,\" he said.\n\"Its own research is telling it that a large number of teen Instagram users say the service makes them feel worse about themselves - but the company just wants to make sure they keep coming back.\"\nThe Online Safety Bill aims to give regulator Ofcom the power to fine companies that fail to act on content that could cause harm.\nUS campaign group Fairplay (formerly the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood) said the news showed Instagram was no place for children.\n\"In a move straight out of big tobacco's playbook, Facebook downplayed the negative effects of its product and hid this research from the public and even from members of Congress who specifically asked for it,\" it said.\n\"And in the ultimate display of chutzpah and disregard for children, the company now wants to hook young kids on Instagram.\"\nFairplay also called on the US government to demand Facebook released its research and blocked its plans to launch Instagram Youth.\nIt was revealed earlier this year Facebook planned to create an advert-free Instagram for under-13s, designed to keep them safe.\nJonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University's Stern School of Business, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had met Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg to discuss the social network's effect on mental health.\n\"He was interested but he believes the research is ambiguous and does not point to harm,\" Mr Haidt said.\n\"Of course, now we know they had their own research which did suggest harm.\"\n\"They had focus groups, online surveys, diary studies - so this was not one chance finding. \n\"I wouldn't expect them to come forward the first time they find evidence of harm and say, 'Oh my God our product is harmful,' but if they have multiple sources of evidence and there is evidence outside the company too, then I think the picture is pretty clear.\"\nBut, he added, it would take root-and-branch changes at the company to make any difference.\n\"The platform encourages children to post photos of themselves, to be raided by others including strangers around the world,\" he said.\n\"If this is the business model, there is no way to fix it.\""

      "title": "Covid: Can England avoid 'lockdown lite' this winter?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government's approach in England is clear - it's going to try to rely almost entirely on the vaccines to protect the country from Covid this winter. \nThe winter plan published on Wednesday says vaccines, including the rollout of boosters and jabs for children, are the Plan A.\nThere is, however, a Plan B. This includes greater use of face coverings, Covid passports and working-from-home orders -  a \"lockdown lite\" as it has been dubbed. \nWhat are the chances of avoiding this?\nThe government has one criterion for moving to Plan B - unsustainable pressure on the NHS.  Although, the plan does not spell out exactly what this entails.\nCurrently, 7% of hospital beds are filled by Covid patients. This may not sound a lot - but hospitals are run close to capacity, so Covid cases quickly impact on other care.\nThe amount of non-emergency treatment being given is already nearly a fifth down on normal levels.\nAnd if Covid admissions keep growing or other respiratory illness take off, it will mean more rationing - from knee and hip replacements being delayed to people waiting longer for an ambulance.\nNone of this is unusual - it happens every winter. But this year, it could be on a very different scale. \nCurrently, the numbers in hospital are pretty flat, however. They have risen by only a fifth in six weeks.\nIf this trajectory remains constant, it will certainly put hospitals under strain - but it would be hard to argue the Covid pressure was unsustainable.\nInfection levels could go up however. Case numbers have been bobbling around since the rapid rise stopped in mid-July.\nEssentially, the epidemic has been stable. That is a pretty remarkable achievement given how infectious the Delta variant is and the fact society is fully open.\nIt suggests we are on our way out of the pandemic. But, as the prime minister and leading scientists have kept stressing this week, it is not completely over. \nOne model suggests infection rates could rise so much that admissions may hit 7,000 a day in England by mid-October, nearly 10 times what it is now. Most experts do not think that is a realistic scenario though.\nThe main drivers of what comes next are immunity levels and the amount people mix.\nWith summer over and people returning to work and school, contact levels may rise and those contacts may increasingly be indoors, where the virus spreads more easily. To counteract this, immunity levels need to increase.\nAnd while the vaccines are incredibly good at reducing the risk of people becoming seriously ill and dying, they are not perfect. And over time their effectiveness may wane.\nThis is where the boosters come in. Topping up protection among the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions could make a crucial difference.\nMuch more so than vaccinating healthy 12- to 15-year-olds, also announced this week, who are at so much lower risk of becoming seriously ill.\nWhat is also essential, however, is getting more of the five million or so adults who have not even had one dose of the vaccine jabbed.\nIf immunity cannot keep hospital admissions at bay, this is where Plan B comes in. The measures may not seem that significant considering the nature of lockdowns previously. But they are based on the assumption that if infection levels do take off the growth will not be as fast as it was last winter and therefore relatively minor changes, such as working from home, can make a big difference. \nWith so many unknowns though, predicting what happens next is tricky. \"There is huge uncertainty,\" Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the government's modelling committee, says.\nHe does not think we will see the big surges that marked the early waves and would lead to a huge growth in hospital admissions. \nBut nor does he think there will be significant reduction in infection levels. \"I don't think anyone is expecting that,\" he adds.\nThis is not all about Covid, though. Experts have been warning the normal winter viruses are likely to return.\nLast year, viruses such as flu were hardly seen, because of lockdowns and social distancing.\nBut this has lowered our immunity to them - and prevented some young children developing any immunity at all.\nA virus called RSV - the leading cause of under-fives being admitted to hospital for respiratory illness - is already circulating at very high levels.\nAnd if flu follows suit, the number of admissions for other respiratory viruses could easily top those currently being seen for Covid - about 750 a day.\nProf Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, says the conditions are \"ripe\" for this to happen. \nBut she believes the government is right to try to find a balance that \"maximises risk reduction while minimising the impacts on our lives\".\nMinisters, she say, have to be prepared to act if need be. For now it's a matter of planning for the worst, while hoping for the best.\nFollow Nick on Twitter.\nRead more from Nick."

      "tags": "US politics,California,Joe Biden",
      "text": "California Governor Gavin Newsom appears to have survived a rare state-wide vote to remove him with a clear majority, US media report.\nRepublicans launched the election over his handling of the pandemic.\nThe Democrat, currently in the third year of his four-year term, had faced a field of 46 candidates, and was expected to win by a large margin.\nBoth President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris campaigned with Mr Newsom ahead of the contest.\nThe BBC's US partner CBS projects that the governor will prevail, with about two-thirds of voters backing him and more than 70% of the vote tallied. \n\"I'm humbled and grateful to the millions and millions of Californians that exercised their fundamental right to vote,\" Mr Newsom said in a victory speech in Sacramento.\nThe outcome has been closely watched as a bellwether for national 2022 elections.\nMr Newsom's main rival, conservative radio host Larry Elder, claimed that the vote was rigged before polls even opened. \nOn the eve of the recall vote, Mr Biden appeared at a rally with Mr Newsom - a former San Francisco mayor - to tell voters that their choice will \"reverberate around the world\".\nThe effort to unseat Mr Newsom has been driven by increasingly partisan politics, but gained steam after he was photographed dining at a fancy restaurant while urging Californians to stay home to avoid spreading Covid-19.\nHe apologised for the \"bad mistake\" but some voters found his actions to be hypocritical. \nNearly 1.5 million signatures were gathered by petition (equal to 12% of the 2018 vote), meeting the bar for an election to decide whether Californians wanted to keep Mr Newsom in office, or replace him for the remainder of his term.\nMr Newsom faced a ragtag group of mostly conservatives hoping to take his place, including reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, who vanished from the campaign trail to film Celebrity Big Brother in Australia. \nRepublican John Cox drew attention for travelling with a live Kodiak brown bear as part of his \"unleash the beast\" campaign - he cast himself as the \"beast\" to Mr Newsom's \"beauty\". \nWith the largest state population in the US, California has some 22 million registered voters and the fifth largest global economy.\nThe Golden State has been firmly Democratic in national elections, but the state does have large Republican regions. Six million voters cast ballots for Donald Trump in 2020, leaving Mr Biden with a 29-point victory in the state.\nThere have been consistent efforts to remove California governors through the recall process since the 1960s, though many have not qualified for a vote.\nIn 2003, the last time California held a gubernatorial recall election, voters booted an unpopular Democratic governor and replaced him with Republican bodybuilder-turned-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nFellow Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan also got his political start as a Republican governor of California before later serving eight years as US president from 1981 to 1989. \nSophie Long, BBC News, Los Angeles\nAs the polls closed across California, the governor of the Golden State was probably breathing a little more easily than he would have been a couple of months ago. At the beginning of August, the polls indicated that this could be an unexpectedly tight race. \nAnd it wasn't just Gavin Newsom who was sweating in the intense Californian summer heat. \nIf he were to lose this recall election, it wouldn't just end his political career - it would result in a handbrake turn for the political trajectory of California, with a new Republican Governor elected by a tiny proportion of the state's 22 million voters. And that could have major national implications. \nCalifornia's senior Senator Diane Feinstein is 88 years old. If she were, for any reason, unable to complete her term after a new Republican Governor had been inaugurated, they would appoint her replacement and, in doing so, immediately eliminate the Democrats voting majority of just one in the Senate. \nWhat began as a grassroots recall effort effectively became a referendum on the Democrats' handling of the coronavirus. Strategists on both sides will now be looking for indications of how their national pandemic policies are playing in marginal congressional districts. \nThis is, if you like, a training run ahead of next year's mid-term marathon."

      "text": "The main defendant in the November 2015 Paris attacks trial has sought to justify the murder of 130 people as retaliation for French military action against Islamic State (IS) jihadists.\nProsecutors say Salah Abdeslam, 32, is the only surviving member of the IS cell that targeted Paris that night.\n\"We attacked France, targeted its population, civilians, but there was nothing personal,\" he told the trial.\nHis remarks shocked and upset survivors and victims' relatives in court.\nLast week, he disrupted the trial with two outbursts, but this time the judge had given the defendants permission to make a brief statement and reporters said his conduct was more measured.\nLater this month, some of the survivors of the 13 November bomb and gun attacks will start giving evidence, which is expected to take five weeks.\nAlthough there are 20 defendants on trial, Salah Abdeslam is the chief suspect and only 13 others are in court. Most of the others are presumed dead.\nHe singled out former President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, saying that when he had authorised air strikes on IS militants in Syria he knew that French citizens would meet their deaths.\nFrench warplanes had not distinguished between men, women and children, he said, and \"we wanted France to go through the same pain\". While he knew his words might upset \"sensitive souls\", he said his aim was to be sincere and not lie.\nRelatives and survivors in the courtroom cried and hugged as the main defendant spoke for four to five minutes. Rejecting the terms \"terrorists\" and \"radicalism\", he told the court that theirs was an \"authentic Islam\".\nReporters described shock and gasps of breath in the courtroom. Among those who heard him was David, a survivor of the Paris attacks.\n\"I get the impression he's managed to dissociate himself from what he did six years ago - wearing an explosive belt and killing people,\" David told news channel BFMTV.\n\"It's odd because, as victims, we went through this. We were targeted and personally affected, then suddenly he comes out and says openly it wasn't your fault but you were there, so tough luck. The disgrace of it. It just shows a lack of respect to what all the victims went through.\"\nEighteen hundred civil plaintiffs are taking part in the trial.\nThe 10-man squad of heavily armed jihadists first targeted the Stade de France stadium, then attacked cafe-terraces and restaurants in the central 10th and 11th arrondissements before bursting into the packed Bataclan concert hall.\nNine of the attackers either blew themselves up or were shot dead. Salah Abdeslam threw away his bomb belt and fled to Belgium. He was captured months later after a shootout in the Molenbeek area of Brussels.\nMany of the other defendants also have a Belgian connection:"

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pressure on the NHS is the main factor that would lead to tighter Covid restrictions in England, the health secretary has said.\nSajid Javid told the BBC there was not a \"single trigger\" for the government moving to its \"Plan B\" measures. \nBut he said how the NHS was coping was the number one issue to watch.\nGovernment scientists have warned that there could be a large jump in Covid hospital admissions if restrictions are not tightened soon. \nThe Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said its modelling suggested hospitalisations could reach 2,000 to 7,000 per day next month. \nCurrently there is an average of just over 750 Covid admissions per day in England.\nThe scientists said a \"relatively light set of measures\" could keep case numbers down if they were brought in early enough.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to avoid the need for additional restrictions by getting more people vaccinated.\nAs he announced his winter plan for tackling Covid in England on Tuesday, he said some measures would be kept in reserve for if the NHS faced unsustainable pressure - including vaccine passports, mandatory face masks and advising people to work from home.\nMr Javid told BBC Breakfast: \"We don't want to get to a position ever again where there's unsustainable pressure on the NHS so it's not able to see people in the usual way when it needs to, particularly emergency patients. \n\"So in my mind that is the number one issue that we need to always, always keep an eye on.\"\nThe health secretary said factors would include hospital admission numbers, pressures on A&E and staffing levels. \nAppearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Javid was pressed on why the government was not acting early to prevent a rise in hospital admissions. \nHe said the UK now had \"much better defences\" than it did a year ago, including vaccines, new treatments and an improved testing and surveillance system. \nPapers released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on Tuesday, dated 8 September, said there was \"potential for another large wave of hospitalisations\".\nVirus modellers advising the committee - the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) - said it was possible the virus would spread more rapidly after the return of schools and more people going back to their workplaces.  \nThey said high levels of home-working had been very important for curbing the epidemic in recent months, with a significant decrease \"highly likely\" to lead to a rapid increase in hospital admissions.\nAs well as encouraging working from home, they suggested \"light-touch measures\" such as clear messaging telling people to \"act cautiously\", more widespread testing, a return to requiring all contacts of cases to isolate, and more mask-wearing.\nIf hospitalisation rates were allowed to get too high then much more stringent and disruptive measures would be needed, they said.\nHowever, the body acknowledged its previous warning - that lifting all restrictions over the summer might prompt a large scale outbreak - had not been borne out by events.\nDaily Covid cases have also been falling in England over the past week.\nThe modellers who report into the Sage committee were too pessimistic back in July when they assumed the opening up of society would lead to a surge in infections and hospital admissions. \nThe latest set of papers notes that the closure of schools, warm weather and large numbers of people being required to self-isolate played a bigger than expected role in curbing infections. \nBut they go on to say that the peak time for cases expected previously from August has now simply been pushed back to October through to December. \nThe return of schools and colleges could push up case rates. Another large wave of hospitalisations looms, they say. \nThey lean towards early light touch intervention by ministers, for example getting more people to work from home again.  \nIn effect this is calling on the government to enact Plan B for England soon. \nSceptics will say modellers have got it wrong before and a pinch of salt is needed with the latest papers. But few would deny the possibility of a very difficult winter ahead.\nEpidemiologist Prof Andrew Hayward says the focus should now be on the number of hospital admissions and the ability of the NHS to cope, rather on the number Covid cases, because of the impact of vaccines. \nProf Hayward, who is a member of Sage but was speaking in a personal capacity, also said working from home would make \"a significant difference to transmission if we get into trouble\". \n\"The most important and effective way of reducing spread of the virus is not to be in contact with other people,\" he told the Today programme.\nProf Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which feeds into Sage, said the number of contacts people had per week had risen to the highest number for a year - but this was mostly down to people going into work.\nHe told Times Radio people should be allowed to continue to work from home if they can, rather than being forced back into the office. \nThe country is entering the autumn with a much higher level of cases, hospital admissions and deaths than last year. \nOn Tuesday, the UK reported a further 26,628 cases and another 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The most recent data showed there were 8,413 Covid patients in hospital.\nOn 15 September last year, there were 3,105 daily cases and 27 deaths reported, along with 1,066 Covid patients in hospital.\nHowever, vaccines are now offering extensive protection against severe illness. Some 81.2% of people aged 16 and over in the UK are fully vaccinated. \nAll over-50s in the UK - as well as those in other vulnerable groups - are to be offered a booster shot at least six months after their second dose, with 12 to 15-year-olds also being offered a single dose. \nWhat questions do you have about this story?

No one there knew she would be there,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"I was getting set up and someone came over to tell me Taylor Swift had just walked in.\n\"The back of my knees just dropped. I was excited because any other singer-songwriter would dream of this moment - so I just thought 'let's do it'.\n\"My heart was beating so fast. I just went for it and I had her up singing and dancing to 'Tell My Ma' - she was having a blast.\"\nSwift even asked Mr Heffron for a selfie.\n\"She came up to me in the middle of it with a big smile and said: 'You're so good - how can I follow you?' Mr Heffron said.\n\"I told her my name and that I worked in a special needs school but I had been working hard on my music and she asked me for a selfie.\n\"She tipped me for playing, told me she enjoyed my music and said: 'You deserve this'.\"\nWhen he went to say goodbye to her and thank her for the tip she told him she had heard him singing Ed Sheeran songs and that the two were best friends.\n\"She said: 'Right now are putting in your 10,000 hours - this is not your first gig - you're confident and you're going to do great',\" Mr Heffron said.\nIn a Facebook post, the Tipsy Bird said: \"The one and only Taylor Swift graced us with her presence last Friday night.\n\"We can confirm she is just as lovely as you would expect and was kind enough to take a picture with our team.\n\"Taylor, if you fancy being a Tipsy Bird another night in the future, you know where to find us\".\nShe was also spotted at Shu restaurant on the Lisburn Road in south Belfast, where she posed for photos with the team.\n\"On Thursday evening we had the pleasure of serving Taylor Swift,\" Shu said.\n\"Taylor was so lovely and really is a beautiful person inside and out and she kindly agreed to photos with all of our team,\" the restaurant added in a post on social media.\nSwift released the first re-recording of her back catalogue, Fearless (Taylor's Version) in April.

      "text": "The UK, US and Australia have announced a historic security pact in the Asia-Pacific, in what's seen as an effort to counter China.\nIt will let Australia build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time, using technology provided by the US.\nThe Aukus pact, which will also cover AI and other technologies, is one of the countries' biggest defence partnerships in decades, analysts say.\nChina has condemned the agreement as \"extremely irresponsible\".\nForeign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it \"seriously undermines regional peace and stability and intensifies the arms race\".\nChina's embassy in Washington accused the countries of a \"Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice\".\nThe pact also created a row with France, which has now lost a deal with Australia to build 12 submarines.\n\"It's really a stab in the back,\" France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio. \nThe new partnership was announced in a joint virtual press conference between US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday.\nAnd while China was not mentioned directly, the three leaders referred repeatedly to regional security concerns which they said had \"grown significantly\".\nSpeaking to the BBC, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said China was \"embarking on one of the biggest military spends in history\".\n\"It is growing its navy [and] air force at a huge rate. Obviously it is engaged in some disputed areas,\" he said. \"Our partners in those regions want to be able to stand their own ground.\"\nIn recent years, Beijing has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea.\nOn Thursday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pact would \"preserve security and stability around the world\" and generate \"hundreds of high-skilled jobs\".\nHe also said the relationship with France was \"rock solid\".\nThe Aukus alliance is probably the most significant security arrangement between the three nations since World War Two, analysts say.\nThe pact will focus on military capability, separating it from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance which also includes New Zealand and Canada.\nWhile Australia's submarines is the big-ticket item, Aukus will also involve the sharing of cyber capabilities and other undersea technologies.\n\"This is an historic opportunity for the three nations, with like-minded allies and partners, to protect shared values and promote security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,\" the joint statement read.\n\"This really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter [China's] aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific,\" said Guy Boekenstein from the Asia Society Australia.\nWestern nations have been wary of China's infrastructure investment on Pacific islands, and have also criticised China's trade sanctions against countries like Australia.\nAustralia had in the past maintained good relations with China, its biggest trading partner. But the relationship has broken down in recent years amid political tensions.\nBut there is tension now too with France, after Australia tore up the A$50bn (\u20ac31bn; \u00a327bn) deal to build 12 submarines.  \n\"We had established a relationship of trust with Australia, this trust has been betrayed,\" Mr Le Drian said.\nThese submarines are much faster and harder to detect than conventionally powered fleets. They can stay submerged for months, shoot missiles longer distances and also carry more.\nHaving them stationed in Australia is critical to US influence in the region, analysts say.\nThe US is sharing its submarine technology for the first time in 50 years. It had previously only shared technology with the UK. \nAustralia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines, after the US, UK, France, China, India and Russia.\nAustralia has reaffirmed it has no intention of obtaining nuclear weapons.\nMeanwhile New Zealand said it would ban Australia's submarines from its waters, in line with an existing policy on the presence of nuclear-powered submarines.\nNew Zealand, although a Five Eyes member, has been more cautious in aligning with either the US or China in the Pacific.\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her nation had not been approached to join the pact."

      "text": "Comedian Norm Macdonald has died at the age of 61, nine years after being diagnosed with cancer, according to his family and representatives. \nThe Canadian comic was born in Quebec City in 1959 and got his start in Canadian clubs before moving to the US to pursue TV comedy writing. \nHe worked for the Roseanne programme before joining Saturday Night Live to host news parody skit Weekend Update.\nKnown for his dry delivery, Macdonald had fans in the US and worldwide.\n\"He was most proud of his comedy. He never wanted the diagnosis to affect the way the audience or any of his loved ones saw him. Norm was a pure comic,\" Lori Jo Hoekstra, Macdonald's long-time producing partner, said in a statement.\n\"He once wrote that 'a joke should catch someone by surprise, it should never pander.' He certainly never pandered. Norm will be missed terribly.\"\nMacdonald was also known for his roles in comedy films such as Dirty Work, Billy Madison and Dr Doolittle. \nAccording to Deadline, he was slated to appear in the New York Comedy Festival in November. \nMacdonald was known for his deadpan delivery style, and impressions of Hollywood stars such as Burt Reynolds, Clint Eastwood and Quentin Tarantino.\nAfter leaving Saturday Night Live, he starred in his own comedy series, Norm, from 1999 to 2001. \nHe also hosted a Netflix programme called Norm Macdonald Has a Show in 2018.\nThe Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid tribute to Macdonald last night. He wrote on Twitter: \"The world was a much funnier place because Norm Macdonald was in it. We've lost a comedic genius, and a great Canadian. Sending my condolences to his loved ones and countless fans mourning his passing.\"\nComedian and actor Jim Carrey tweeted: \"He was one of our most precious gems. An honest and courageous comedy genius.\"\nSaturday Night Live also celebrated its former star, calling him \"one of the most impactful comedic voices of his or any other generation\". \n\"I am absolutely devastated about Norm Macdonald,\" wrote late night host Conan O'Brien. \"I will never laugh that hard again. I'm so sad for all of us today.\"\nFamily Guy creator Seth MacFarlane remembered his time working with Macdonald: \"You always hoped he would hang around after the work was done, just so you could hear his stories and get a laugh. So hilarious and so generous with his personality.  I'm gonna miss him.\"\nFormer Daily Show host Jon Stewart wrote online: \"No one could make you break like Norm Macdonald. Hilarious and unique.\"\nSeth Rogen recalled his own beginning as a Canadian comic, saying: \"I essentially ripped off his delivery when I first started acting.\"\n\"We lost a comedy giant today. One of the all time greats,\" Rogen added."

      "text": "Dominic Raab has become deputy prime minister, justice secretary and Lord Chancellor, leaving behind his job as foreign secretary. \nOver the summer, Mr Raab was at the centre of speculation about his future, when he was heavily criticised for his handling of the aftermath of the fall of Afghanistan.\nThe then-foreign secretary was criticised for remaining on holiday in Crete while the Taliban marched back to power. \nHe insisted he'd been across the detail throughout and in touch with the key players.\nHe rejected opposition calls for him to quit after it emerged that neither he, nor any other minister, had called the Afghan government to discuss the evacuation of translators stranded in the country.\nThe Conservative MP, who was a leading member of the campaign to get the UK out of the EU, is no stranger to controversy, having hit the headlines for his statements on topics as diverse as poverty and \"taking the knee\".\nHe even quit the cabinet once, over former Prime Minister Theresa May's policies on Brexit.\nDate of birth: 25 February 1974 (age 47)\nJob: Justice secretary, deputy prime minister, lord chancellor, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton\nEducation: Dr Challoner's Grammar School, Amersham, Oxford and Cambridge universities\nFamily: Married to Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive. Two sons\nBefore politics: Foreign Office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague\nMr Raab was born in 1974, the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938.\nHe was was brought up in Buckinghamshire and attended Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, before studying law at Oxford University and switching to Cambridge for his masters degree.\nHe worked as a lawyer in the commercial sector and the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide to Brexit-supporting Conservative MP David Davis, and then Remain-backing Dominic Grieve.\nFirst elected to Parliament in 2010, the following year Mr Raab angered then-Home Secretary Theresa May by describing some feminists as \"obnoxious bigots\" in an online article also claiming men were getting \"a raw deal\".\nMrs May accused him of fuelling \"gender warfare\".\nMr Raab remained on the back benches for five years after becoming an MP.\nBut the karate black-belt became a junior justice minister following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015.\nHe played a prominent role in the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked by Mrs May when she took over as prime minister.\nIn 2017, Mr Raab was branded \"offensive\" by then-Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying \"the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty; it's someone who has a cash flow problem\".\nBut in June that year he returned to government, as a justice minister, this time middle-ranking rather than junior.\nIn Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle he became housing minister - one of the highest-profile non-cabinet roles in government.\nAnd in July that year, when David Davis quit, the prime minister promoted Mr Raab to Brexit secretary, a cabinet post.\nYet his improved relationship with Mrs May did not last long. In November 2018, he quit, arguing that he could not \"in good conscience\" support the \"backstop\" arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.\nAs an influential Brexiteer, his comments were seen as significant in increasing opposition to Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs repeatedly rejected.\nAfter Mrs May announced she was standing down, Mr Raab entered the contest to become Conservative leader, and prime minister.\nIn a crowded field, he failed to get the 33 MPs' votes he needed to progress to the third round. Fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove outlasted him.\nMr Johnson, to whom Mr Raab gave his support after his elimination from the the race, promoted him to foreign secretary and first secretary of state - effectively deputy prime minister.\nBut he only narrowly managed to hold on to his Esher and Walton seat at the 2019 general election, seeing off a strong Liberal Democrat challenge by 2,743 votes.\nThe overall Conservative landslide, however, on a promise to \"get Brexit done\", meant he saw his dream of leaving the EU come true on 31 January 2020.\nAs foreign secretary and first secretary of state, he was the UK government's de-facto second-in-command.\nHe was left in charge of running much of the government when the prime minister was hospitalised with Covid-19 in April last year.\nColleagues, including Mr Johnson's arch-critic and former aide Dominic Cummings, have praised Mr Raab's performance under extreme pressure.\nBut he has continued to anger opponents with some of his comments, in 2020 telling talkRadio's Julia Hartley-Brewer he would only \"take the knee\" - go down on bended knee - for \"the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me\".\nHe later qualified his remarks - following opposition criticism of his \"insulting\" and \"flippant\" tone - saying he \"fully\" supports Black Lives Matter campaign."

Over the summer months we lost a tonne of money because of reduced capacities.\"\nMr Dougan said he has cancelled 30 events which were booked to go ahead in the month of September.\n\"This is an expensive business and this is simply not commercially viable.\" \nMany of those working in the events sector remain on furlough, which is due to end at the end of the month. \nA spokesperson for the Executive Office said: \"Further consideration will be given to the remaining restrictions when the executive next meets. \n\"Any decisions will take full account of the health, economic and social context.\""

      "text": "Fashion firms Asos and Primark have announced new sustainability commitments, with both saying they will keep prices affordable.\nAsos says it is aiming to achieve a net-zero impact on the environment by 2030.\nPrimark says its clothes will be made using recycled or \"more sustainably sourced materials\" by the same date.\nThe budget retailer has also promised to halve carbon emissions across its operations. \nCritics warned, however, that these goals will be hard to track as fast-fashion supply chains often lack transparency.\nOn Thursday, Asos set out new environmental and social targets. They include:\nIts chief executive, Nick Beighton, told the BBC's Today programme: \"We need to work with our partners on this to offset any minimal cost increases we anticipate from doing this.\"\nHe added that he expects more consumers to choose to shop with Asos based on those commitments. \n\"The responsibility for a sustainable future lies with all of us and businesses must lead the way,\" he said.\nIn a statement, Primark also said it would design its clothes to be more durable so they can be recycled and last longer - without increasing its prices. \nIt said it would \"pursue a living wage for workers in its supply chain\", but did not specify how much this wage would be in the countries where it has employees or when this would happen. Primark has 397 stores across 14 countries and employs about 70,000 people. \nThe company's chief executive, Paul Marchant, said: \"Sustainability shouldn't be priced at a premium that only a minority can afford.\n\"Because of who we are, we believe we have the opportunity to make more sustainable fashion choices affordable to all.\"\nPrimark said it would eliminate single-use plastics in its own operations, but it does  not own the majority of factories which manufacture its clothes. \nHowever, Noelle Hatley, lecturer in fashion business at Manchester Metropolitan University's Fashion Institute, said that using language such as \"ambitions\" and \"pursuing\" was vague. \n\"They need to be setting measurable targets, how many suppliers and factories and by what date will living wages be paid?\"\nOver the next year, Primark said it would make all men's, women's and kids' entry price point T-shirts from sustainably sourced cotton. \nBut Ms Hatley said that \"without transparency of costings it is difficult to know how they can achieve this as the fast fashion business model relies on 'unsustainable' or 'below real cost' prices\". \nThough she said the announcement is encouraging, Ms Hatley added that if prices are being maintained, it \"would be good for them to share how they are achieving this; for example, are they accepting a lower margin, or is the factory being paid the same for what could be more expensive materials?\"\nKate Fletcher, research professor at the Centre for Sustainable Fashion at the University of the Arts London, said that the problem of fast-fashion is volume and questions remain about how Primark is going to put limits around how many pieces it produces. \n\"The real change comes with the detail not in the commitments and aspirations,\" she said. \n\"What I'd like to see are details on what the real and living wages would be in different countries.\" \nPrimark was one of a number of retailers that attracted strong criticism in 2013 after more than 1,100 workers were killed in the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh. \nThe Irish firm - which was one of 23 brands being produced at the garment factory - extended payments to victims and families affected. A worker in a Bangladeshi factory typically earns around 10p an hour. \nIt was one of the worst industrial accidents in recent memory and prompted more scrutiny of working conditions in garment factories.\nThe global fashion industry produced an estimated 2.1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2018, and uses more energy than both aviation and shipping combined. It also accounts for nearly 20% of waste water. \nAsos was also criticised in a recent report by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) that found that more than a third of items listed on its website were made entirely from new plastics. \nThe RSA pointed out that Asos had performed better than other firms such as Boohoo and Missguided, but said that fast fashion firms had more work to do.\nIn the UK, citizens buy more new clothes than any other European country and an estimated 350,000 tonnes of clothes end up in landfill every year."

Fifteen women, so far, have given statements to French authorities alleging sexual assault or rape against him.\nAnother former model agent, Jean-Luc Brunel, who has been investigated over the sexual harassment and rape of minors, is the other man some of the women appearing at the senate have accused.\nMr Brunel, who is currently on remand, has denied any wrongdoing.\nLaurie Marsden claims that in 1982, Marie attempted to rape her after a party.\nNow a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist, she says it is important to highlight the trauma victims go through before they're ready to talk to anyone. \n\"I have worked with trauma survivors for the last 24 years and I intend to speak about why women don't come forward and how it can take many, many years to get over the shame and fear and the overwhelming feelings that are triggered over sexual assault.\n\"And many people will not talk about it and will not disclose it, really because they are not psychologically capable of doing so. And that's a really important point that has not been taken into account when the laws were written.\"\nGerald Marie said in a statement, he \"refutes with dismay these false and defamatory allegations\".\nFormer BBC reporter, Lisa Brinkworth also took part in the senate discussion. She posed as a model in a documentary for the BBC's Donal McIntyre Investigates series in 1998. \nShe alleges she was sexually assaulted by Gerald Marie during filming.\nHave you been personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "text": "Alanis Morissette has distanced herself from what she describes as a \"salacious\" new film, in which she appears to address being sexually exploited by five men when she was 15.\nThe singer said she agreed to take part in a HBO film celebrating 25 years of her classic album Jagged Little Pill.\nHowever, the film, which also addresses the alleged exploitation, \"is not the story I agreed to tell,\" she added.\nThe director of Jagged has not yet responded to the singer's comments.\nIn her statement, Morissette noted she had been dealing with post-natal depression at the time.\n\"I agreed to participate in a piece about the celebration of Jagged Little Pill's 25th anniversary, and was interviewed during a very vulnerable time (while in the midst of my third postpartum depression during lockdown),\" the 47-year-old said in a statement.\n\"I was lulled into a false sense of security and their salacious agenda became apparent immediately upon my seeing the first cut of the film. This is when I knew our visions were in fact painfully diverged.\n\"This was not the story I agreed to tell,\" she continued. \"I sit here now experiencing the full impact of having trusted someone who did not warrant being trusted.\"  \nThe Canadian star went on to confirm she has chosen not to attend any promotional events around the movie, firstly because she is currently on tour, and secondly as she believes the film \"includes implications and facts that are simply not true\".\n\"While there is beauty and some elements of accuracy in this/my story to be sure - I ultimately won't be supporting someone else's reductive take on a story much too nuanced for them to ever grasp or tell.\"\nOn Tuesday, before the new statement was issued, the film's director Alison Klayman told the Washington Post it was \"a privilege\" to make the film and that she was \"really proud of it\".\n\"Hopefully there will be other opportunities in the future for her to come to film events,\" she said.\nThe BBC has asked Klayman for further comment in light of Morissette's latest statement.\nAccording to the Washington Post, the film sees the singer open up about being sexually exploited by unnamed people within the music industry at the time - a topic she previously addressed in the lyrics to one of her songs, Hands Clean.\nCanada's legal age of consent is 16, although it was 14 when Morissette was a teenager. However, the law says that even if both parties are over the formal age of consent, it should still be considered whether the relationship involved an abuse of power or trust.\n\"It took me years in therapy to even admit there had been any kind of victimisation on my part,\" Morissette says in the film.\n\"I would always say I was consenting, and then I'd be reminded like 'Hey, you were 15, you're not consenting at 15.' Now I'm like, 'Oh yeah, they're all paedophiles. It's all statutory rape.\"\n\"I did tell a few people and it kind of fell on deaf ears,\" she says. \"It would usually be a stand-up, walk-out-of-the-room moment.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Scotland is to begin vaccinating children aged between 12 and 15 from Monday of next week.\nThe jabs will initially be available at drop-in centres, with parents and carers being asked to accompany their children.\nLetters will be sent everyone in the age group the following week, inviting them to an appointment.\nThere will also be a vaccination programme in schools after the scheduled appointments.\nThis will allow anyone who has not yet been vaccinated to have a further opportunity to do so.\nIt comes after the Chief Medical Officers of each of the four UK nations concluded that the additional benefits were sufficient to justify vaccination of children over the age of 12.\nThey said it would help to reduce disruption to their schooling this winter and benefit those growing up in the poorest areas.\nScotland is also to join the other UK nations in offering a booster shot of the Pfizer vaccine to all adults over 50, frontline health and care workers, younger adults with health conditions that put them at higher risk, and adult household contacts of people with suppressed immune systems.\nThe JCVI advisory group said the move was needed amid concern about waning immunity ahead of winter. \nThe boosters programme will also begin next Monday, when frontline health and social care workers will be able to book their appointment online through NHS Inform.\nResidents in care homes for older people will be offered both flu and Covid booster vaccines from next week.\nAnd adults aged 70 years or over, and everyone aged over 16 on the highest risk list, will be contacted shortly either by letter or by their GP. \nOther eligible groups - all adults over 50, all those aged 16 to 49 with underlying health conditions, adult carers, unpaid and young carers, and adult household contacts of people who are immunosuppressed - will be able to book online from October.\nAnnouncing the expansion of the vaccination programme, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said both measures would \"help us considerably in our ongoing efforts against this virus\".\nAnd she stressed the importance of \"informed consent\" for young people considering whether to have the jab.\nChildren able to overrule the decision of their parents on whether or not they should have the vaccine if they are deemed to be competent and understand the health implications. \nMs Sturgeon said: \"I know that these are important decisions for young people and their parents, and that many will have questions. \n\"I would encourage everyone to read the information that will be provided, and do not hesitate to visit a drop in clinic to ask any questions or raise any concerns.\n\"Vaccination is a vital part of our overall protection against this virus. That is why it is important to support people - especially young people - to make informed choices that they feel comfortable with\".\nMs Sturgeon also confirmed that secondary schools pupils will continue to have to wear face coverings in class until at least the October holidays, when the measure will be reviewed again. \nShe acknowledged that this would be unpopular with many pupils, but said it remained a \"prudent and necessary precaution\".\nAnd with university terms now starting, she said no large in-person lectures will be held for now. \nInstead, there will be a mix of online and in-person learning - with universities and colleges deciding themselves the level of in-person teaching that they will offer during this term. \nIn addition, physical distancing will remain in place on campuses and face coverings will be required in indoor public spaces.\nNearly 70% of Scotland's population has now had two jabs. But almost a quarter are still completely unvaccinated. That includes around 230,000 people aged 12-15. Experts say opening up vaccination to this group will help increase population coverage and slow the spread of the virus.\nBut ministers still want the rest of the highly sociable 18-29 age group to get vaccinated too, with drop-in clinics for students during freshers' weeks.\nOf course, young people remain unlikely to become seriously unwell with Covid. But widespread community infection is having knock-on effects causing wider harm, for example in schools and hospitals.\nBoosters will also go ahead for health and care workers, and adults over 50 and with some health conditions.\nHopefully this will head off further pressure over the winter - if the NHS can keep its head above water for the next few weeks.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds and offering booster shots had the potential to be \"game-changing in halting the spread of Covid this winter\".\nBut he said more answers were needed on how the schemes would be delivered, and called for mobile vaccination units at every school to encourage uptake - particularly those in areas where vaccination rates are low.\nMr Ross added: \"We have seen almost every year, like clockwork, the SNP's flu jag programme descends into chaos. They cannot let the country down by allowing Covid booster jags to go the same way.\"\nScotland has seen a surge in the number of cases in recent weeks, with the country having the highest infection rate of any UK nation last week and the number of people being hospitalised with the virus also increasing dramatically. \nBut there are signs that the sharp increase has levelled off and may be starting to fall slightly, with the country recording an average of 5,506 new cases in the week to 11 September - lower than the figure of 6,290 a day for the previous week.\nMore than 70% of all cases last week were among those under the age of 45. \nThe latest daily figures showed that 3,375 positive cases were reported on Monday - 11.4% of all tests carried out.\nThe number of people in hospital with the virus has increased by 16 to 1,064, with 89 patients in intensive care - one fewer than yesterday.\nThe deaths of a further 21 people who had recently tested positive for the virus have also been recorded, taking the total by that definition to 8,263."

      "tags": "Prisons,Polmont",
      "text": "A study of almost 200 fatal accident inquiries into deaths in custody found the sheriff made no recommendation to improve practice in 90% of cases.\nAcademics at Glasgow University looked at 196 deaths in prisons covering almost 15 years from 2005 to 2019.\nThe authors said FAIs often took three or four years to complete but in most cases found no action that would have led to a different outcome. \nThe Scottish government said mental health was a priority for prisons.\nFatal accident inquiries (FAI) are official hearings into the circumstances of unexpected deaths. They are usually held in Sheriff courts and are aimed at preventing future deaths. \nThe study found the average time between the death of a person in custody and the publication of the FAI determination was 509 days between 2005 and 2008.\nHowever, since legislation in 2016 aimed at making the process more efficient and fairer, the time has increased to almost 700 days.\nThere was also less chance of the FAI concluding with a finding about the circumstances of the death, the report said.\nThe team behind the report said the sheriff had the power to make findings on whether there were any defects in any system that resulted in the death and on whether any reasonable precautions could have prevented it.\nIn nine out 10 cases, however, there was no finding of a reasonable precaution and no recommendations to improve practice or prevent death.\nLinda Allan's daughter Katie died in Polmont Young Offenders Institute in 2018 and there has not yet been an FAI into her death. \nKatie took her own life after being sentenced for drink-driving and knocking a 15-year-old boy unconscious. \nLinda Allan said she had assumed her daughter was safe in state care and was horrified to discover that was not the case. \nShe said she was \"flabbergasted\" to discover the number of \"preventable\" deaths in custody, especially among young people.\nMs Allan started researching the details of the FAIs into deaths in custody to try to understand what happened to her daughter. \nShe told the BBC she wanted to \"see if we could prevent this happening to anybody else\". \nMs Allan said she did not really understand what the point of the FAI was if it was not to prevent future deaths.\n\"The FAI system in Scotland is broken and needs a complete overhaul,\" she said.\n\"Lots of these young people are in for minor offences but really it is irrelevant why they are in prison. People should not die for the crime they have committed,\" she said. \nThe initial work she and her husband did has been taken on by Glasgow University academics. \nThe report said that families were rarely involved in FAIs in terms of being legally represented, present at inquiries or providing evidence.\nIt also highlighted concerns about the provision of healthcare in prisons. \nIn one example a man complaining of pain and claiming to have a recurrence of previous meningitis, died of the condition while staff initially ignored him, then treated him with the drug used for overdoses, and shackled him after he had lapsed into a coma.\nThe report authors also question the value of the current FAI system in Scotland.\nSarah Armstrong, professor of criminology at Glasgow University, said: \"If you were to design a system to maximise the suffering of families who have lost someone to death in prison, a system that would resist any change and is lacking in public access and transparency because most of the evidence is decided before it even gets to court, it is hard to imagine something more suited to those purposes than what we have right now.\"\nIn November 2019 the former Justice Secretary announced an independent review into deaths in custody. It is being led by Wendy Sinclair-Gieben, HM chief inspector of prisons for Scotland, and is expected to report back next month. \nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Every death in custody is a tragedy. The safe treatment and mental health of all those in custody is a key priority for Scotland's prisons, which care for people with higher levels of risk and vulnerability than the general population as a whole.\n\"We are determined any lessons that need to be learned will be learned, and that all appropriate agencies must look closely at the outcome of Fatal Accident Inquiries.\"\nScottish Conservative justice spokesman Jamie Greene said: \"The SNP have created a broken system that moves at a snail's pace and makes absolutely no effort to correct itself.\n\"It is wrong to leave families in the dark like this. The Scottish Conservatives would introduce a legal time limit so that investigations are carried out promptly and ensure that lessons are learnt whenever an FAI concludes.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Women,Periods,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Changes to periods and unexpected vaginal bleeding after having a Covid vaccine should be investigated to reassure women, says a leading immunologist specialising in fertility.\nWriting in the BMJ, Dr Victoria Male, from Imperial College London, said the body's immune response was the likely cause, not something in the vaccines.\nThere is no evidence they have any impact on pregnancy or fertility.\nThe UK's regulator has received more than 30,000 reports of period problems.\nThese suspected side-effects include heavier than usual periods, delayed periods and unexpected bleeding after all three Covid vaccines, out of more than 47 million doses given to women in the UK to date.\nAfter reviewing the reports, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it \"does not support a link\" between Covid vaccines and the symptoms.\nMenstrual disorders are extremely common, can be caused by many different things, and the numbers of women affected are low, it says.\nPeriod changes have also been reported by some women after infection with the virus itself, and with long Covid.\nHowever, writing in an opinion piece in the BMJ, Dr Male says \"robust research\" into reports of period problems would help to counter misinformation around the vaccines.\n\"Vaccine hesitancy among young women is largely driven by false claims that Covid-19 vaccines could harm their chances of future pregnancy.\n\"Failing to thoroughly investigate reports of menstrual changes after vaccination is likely to fuel these fears. \n\"If a link between vaccination and menstrual changes is confirmed, this information will allow people to plan for potentially altered cycles,\" she said.\nDr Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology, said \"clear and trusted information\" was important for women who rely on being able to predict their cycles. \nAnd she said the effects of any medical intervention on menstruation should not be \"an afterthought\" in future research.\nScientists don't yet understand exactly how vaccines could cause period changes. They may be linked to the impact of the immune system - which is stimulated by the vaccine - on hormones driving the menstrual cycle, but they could also be caused by immune cells acting differently in the lining of the uterus.\nOther vaccines, such as HPV or human papillomavirus, have also been linked to similar menstrual changes - but there has been little research carried out on how and why it happens.\nScientists agree that women's ability to have a baby is not affected by the vaccines. Trials show that vaccination did not change women's chances of becoming pregnant naturally or during fertility treatment. Research into male fertility after vaccines also shows no impact on sperm quality.\nDr Jo Mountfield, vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said changes to periods could be concerning, but generally lasted only one or two cycles.\nShe encouraged anyone who experiences heavy bleeding which is unusual, especially after the menopause, to speak to a healthcare professional for advice, but she emphasised there was no risk of long-term harm.\n\"There is no evidence to suggest that these temporary changes will have any impact on a person's future fertility, or their ability to have children,\" Dr Mountfield said. \nThe RCOG said vaccination was the \"best protection\" against coronavirus, especially if planning a pregnancy, because unvaccinated pregnant women are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid than other women of the same age.\nIt also called for more research into why women may experience changes to their menstrual cycle after the vaccine."

      "text": "Scotland's health secretary has been warned he could put lives at risk after urging people to \"think twice\" before calling an ambulance.\nHumza Yousaf said people should only call for an ambulance when it is \"absolutely critical\". \nOpposition politicians condemned the comments, which were made in a BBC radio interview, as \"reckless\".\nThe health secretary told Good Morning Scotland the country is in for \"an extraordinarily difficult winter\".\nThe NHS in Scotland is already under increasing pressure and people are facing long waits for ambulances. \nThe recent surge in virus cases has resulted in rising numbers of patients in hospital, with more than 1,000 being cared for across the country.\nBBC Scotland this week highlighted the pressure ambulance crews are under and revealed call handlers are dealing with about 10,000 more 999 calls a month than last summer. \nMr Yousaf said: \"We are in for an extraordinarily difficult winter.\n\"We know that the flu season could be extremely challenging, we know that people that are presenting - whether it is presenting to the ambulance service or GPs or A&E - they are presenting more sick because they haven't presented for the last 18 months.\n\"Looking at the data the last time we had 1,000 patients in hospital with Covid was December 2020, our A&E presentations now, when we have the same number of Covid patients, is 40% higher.\"\nWhen asked directly if people should \"think twice\" before calling for ambulance, Mr Yousaf said: \"Yes is the short answer to that.\"\nHe stated: \"I don't doubt that people do that because they are in distressing situations, I think most people only call when they are in that extreme distress.\"\nMr Yousaf said people who were \"picking up the phone to call 999 to call an ambulance\" should consider if this is \"absolutely critical\".\nBut he stressed if it was they should \"of course make that call and the ambulance service will get to you as quickly as they possibly can\".\nScottish Conservative public health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane described the health secretary's comments as \"astonishing\".\nHe said: \"Humza Yousaf is making people feel guilty about dialling 999 and seeking urgent help.\n\"This sort of reckless messaging could put lives at risk. When people suffer conditions like heart attacks or strokes, they might think twice about calling an ambulance, which could lead to unnecessary deaths.\"\nScottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: \"Ambulance services are in crisis due to the SNP's failure to support frontline workers and paramedics. \n\"Humza Yousaf should focus on fixing the problem rather than shaming Scots who are fearing for their health. There is no time to delay.\"\nAnd Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \"Humza Yousaf is proving a reckless health secretary. Encouraging people not to seek treatment is a huge gamble.\n\"Winter pressures come around every year. It is the job of health secretary to ensure that the NHS has the resources it needs to cope with demand.\"\nAhead of the roll-out of vaccinations to 12 to 15-year-olds from Monday, Mr Yousaf said children who opt not to have the jab should not be stigmatised. \nThe UK's chief medical officers have recommended the vaccine be extended to young people to help reduce disruption to education. \nMr Yousaf also said it would help address the mental health impact on children from missing school.\nAsked about how he ensure children are not singled out if they don't get the jab, Mr Yousaf said: \"As the health secretary I will be encouraging as many young people, and as many people in general, to get vaccinated because I believe in the protection of the vaccine.\n\"But we are going to have to work really, really hard to say that there is no stigma here. It is people's choice.\" \nThe jab is not compulsory and Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, has described it as an \"offer\" of vaccination.\nHe also said young people and their parents needed to be supported and there should be no stigma attached to their choice.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for under-12s in the UK.\nGlobally the vaccination programme has also focused on those aged 12 and above.\nIn the US, for example, more than 10 million over-12s have received the jab after experts concluded the benefits of protecting against Covid illness and its complications \"far outweigh\" the small potential risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine.\nFrance, Italy, Canada, Spain and Israel are all vaccinating this age group for the same reason.\nFind the answers to more of your questions about coronavirus here.

His family moved to the UK in 1976 when he was aged nine, attending independent schools in London and then studying chemical engineering at University College London.\nHe will now be responsible for schools, colleges and universities in England, as they recover from the disruption of the pandemic.\n\"Education is a crucial part of our levelling up agenda so it's an honour to be back at the Department for Education as secretary of state,\" said Mr Zahawi.\n\"Children and young people have had a tough time during this pandemic and I'll be listening to them and their families as we accelerate our work to build back better and fairer.\"\nMary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union with Mr Courtney, urged the incoming education secretary to push for extra funding in next month's public spending review. \n\"The money promised to schools to date is a small fraction of the amount judged to be needed by the government's former education recovery tsar,\" said Ms Bousted.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"One of the most pressing tasks facing Mr Zahawi will be to ensure that the government now fulfils its promise to deliver a properly funded recovery package so that every pupil in the country receives the support they need and deserve. \n\"With the comprehensive spending review only weeks away, there really is no time to waste.\"\n\"The Department for Education may now be under new management but the same challenges remain,\" said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. \n\"More ambition is needed on post-Covid education recovery, investment in schools and colleges, support for children with special educational needs, and closing the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers,\" he said.\nMr Williamson's departing message said it had been a privilege to serve as education secretary \"despite the challenges of the global pandemic\". And he highlighted his efforts to raise the status of further education and skills.\n\"I'm particularly proud of the transformational reforms I've led in Post-16 education: in further education colleges, our skills agenda, apprenticeships and more,\" tweeted Mr Williamson.\nMr Williamson - the first big casualty of the reshuffle - had faced much criticism during the pandemic, with particular problems around last summer's exams, which saw protests and U-turns over how grades were decided.\n\"He failed to engage with our suggestions on how to make schools safer during Covid - and thereby kept them closed longer,\" said Mr Courtney.\nBut David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, commended Mr Williamson's support for further education, despite the disruption of the pandemic.\n\"It was always going to be a bumpy ride for Gavin Williamson. Despite that, he helped convince the prime minister and chancellor that post-16 education and skills should be a priority,\" said Mr Hughes.\nJo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, described his time in office as \"disastrous\".\n\"Rather than responding to the challenges of a global pandemic, he led the charge in a completely pointless culture war against university staff and students. \n\"A culture war that was entirely fabricated and led to no positive change in the sector,\" said Dr Grady.\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: \"Two years of exams chaos and staff abandoned, unsupported and demoralised. That is Gavin Williamson's legacy.\n\"The prime minister has allowed this to happen, keeping a failing education secretary in post for months and refusing to fight for children's futures.\""

      "tags": "Michigan,Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal,#MeToo campaign",
      "text": "Former Olympic doctor Larry Nassar has been handed a jail sentence of 175 years in Michigan for abusing female athletes he was supposed to be treating.\nHere, the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan, who was in court, and Roland Hughes detail the extraordinary testimony given in court by the survivors of his abuse.\nThis article contains graphic details of sexual abuse\nOne hundred and fifty-six young women - mothers, sisters, daughters, Olympians.\nAll say they were abused by the same man: former Team USA gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.\nOver seven days, they took to the stand one by one to do what few survivors of sexual abuse ever get the chance to do - directly confront their attacker.\nNassar had already pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual assault for abusing young girls under the guise of medical treatment.\nWomen who filed criminal complaints against Nassar spoke out at his sentencing hearing in Lansing. But they were followed by close to 150 others, many of whom chose to do so without the anonymity to which they were entitled.\nKyle Stephens was the first to tell her story.\nFor years she was known only as Victim ZA, but as she stood before Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, she calmly shared her name.\nIn doing so, she waived her anonymity in public just as she was about to testify to the damage her abuser had done.\n\"I was ready to speak,\" Kyle said in an interview with the BBC after her testimony. \"I think it was really empowering to get up there and give my story from start to finish.\"\nFor decades, Larry Nassar abused young women. It was Kyle's call to police that led to him finally being arrested.\nUnlike many of the other women who shared their stories in this case, Kyle wasn't a gymnast and a patient of Nassar's. Her parents were friends with his family.\nAs she stood in the small courtroom, photos of her as a smiling child were projected on to a screen. Nassar first abused her when she was six, \"when I still had not lost all my baby teeth\".\nIt began with him exposing himself. Later, he would masturbate before her. Then, he physically abused her - all while both their families were in the same house.\nWhen Kyle, aged 12, told her parents that Nassar would rub his erect penis on her bare feet, he denied it. Back then, her parents did not believe her, and urged her to apologise to him.\n\"He forced me to grow up really fast,\" Kyle told the BBC after the hearing. \"It was such a benign action until you grow up and realise it was a vile thing.\"\nSeven minutes into her testimony, delivered alongside her mother, Kyle looked up at Judge Rosemarie Aquilina and politely asked if she could address Nassar directly.\nShe reminded him of how her parents invited him round to their home after she had accused him. Sitting in her living room, he had denied abusing her and had said that if she was ever really abused, she should remember to report it.\n\"Well Larry, I'm here,\" she told him in court. \"Not to tell someone, but to tell everyone.\n\"Perhaps you have figured it out by now, but little girls don't stay little forever. They grow into strong women who return to destroy your world.\"\nIn her teens, Kyle was asked to babysit Nassar's two daughters. Doing so helped her protect them, she told the court, and allowed her to save enough money to pay for counselling.\nHaving reached a point where she had started to question whether the abuse had indeed occurred, she tried again to explain to her parents what had happened.\nThis time, they believed her.\nNassar, 54, graduated from the University of Michigan in 1985 and joined the medical staff of the US national gymnastics team based in Indianapolis a year later.\nIn 1997, alongside his work with the national gym team, he began working as a team physician at Michigan State University (MSU). He began abusing Kyle Stephens a year later.\nHe worked for the US gymnastics team in four Olympic Games, regularly rushing to the help of gymnasts who might have fallen awkwardly.\nCarrie Hogan, a former softball player at MSU, told the court it was seen as a \"privilege\" to be treated by Nassar. Successful treatment could make a difference to the university's stars on the brink of a sports career.\n\"I was very aware of the signed photographs of the Olympic gymnasts he had treated,\" she said. \"He was the best of the best.\" Others said he was seen as a \"god\" in the gymnastics world.\nIn an episode of a gymnastics podcast broadcast in December 2013, Nassar spoke about how important it was to look after young athletes.\n\"Not just physically but mentally, you have to protect your athletes,\" he told GymCastic, speaking uncharacteristically slowly. \"You have to let them know they will be cared [for].\"\nHe also warned of the danger of mental injury to athletes, saying \"the physical injuries almost always they can recover from. The mental injury leaves the scars that keep coming back and haunt them later.\"\nMany of the women who spoke in court said that after he abused them, they were intimidated by his powerful status.\nReporting the offence - if they understood that they had been subject to an offence at all - felt almost impossible.\nNassar had a strikingly similar pattern of how he abused young women, the vast majority of whom were gymnasts.\nThey came to him often in pain, looking for help.\nAt their most vulnerable moment, he tried to convince them what he was doing was normal - even talking about everyday life and joking as he touched them.\nBy projecting a sense of normality from his position of authority, Nassar made his victims feel they were wrong to believe this was abuse, and that they would be in the wrong if they complained.\n\"I remember having the option of keeping my spandex on, which I was very grateful for and chose,\" said Jennifer Rood Bedford, a volleyball player at MSU between 2000 and 2003.\n\"He had me lay down face down on the medical table. When he started treatment, I remember him saying his treatment relied upon applying pressure to areas around the pelvis and that this was normal.\n\"So when he went down there, I just told myself it was normal, that he knows what he's doing and don't be a baby.\n\"I remember laying there and thinking 'Is this OK? This doesn't seem right'.\"\nRachael Denhollander, a former gymnast from Michigan, was the first victim to speak up publicly in 2016.\nShe told the BBC that Nassar abused her during every visit she made to his clinic over a year after she turned 15.\nNassar would position Rachael's mother at the head of the table so she was not able to see what he was doing.\nWith one hand, he would carry out sports massage. With the other, covered by a towel, he would insert his fingers into Rachael's vagina or anus. In one of their last sessions, he unhooked her bra and fondled her breast - the only time Rachael said she knew she was definitely being assaulted and not treated.\nMany of the women said their trust in male relatives, partners, doctors, strangers, friends and teachers was destroyed as a result of Nassar's actions.\n\"My first reaction was to question myself, to blame myself,\" said Jennifer Rood Bedford.\n\"I wanted to believe the best in people, but no matter how much I rationalised - he's a doctor, he's treating you, he didn't mean for that to happen - I couldn't shake the voice in my head that something wasn't right.\"\nIf you have been affected by child sexual abuse, sexual abuse or violence, help and support is available.\nIf you are in the UK, you can find links here: BBC Action Line\nIf you are in the US, you can contact Rainn, the national sexual abuse hotline, here, or by calling 800.656.HOPE \nFor Gwen Anderson, a former gymnast who competed for her state of Michigan, the abuse began when she was just 12.\nNow, as a teacher to girls of the same age, she says she sees Nassar's actions in an even starker light.\n\"I teach 12, 13, 14-year-olds every day,\" she told the court. \"And every single day, when I look at them, I am faced with the reality of how young and defenceless we were when you molested us.\n\"I look at them every single day and I think to myself 'I am their safe place. I am their protector. I am their encouragement. I am their motivator. I am their rock'.\"\nIt is unclear when and how Nassar's abuse of his patients started, though the first allegations date to 1994.\nIn August 2016, the Indianapolis Star published a story detailing allegations of sexual abuse committed by coaches working for USA Gymnastics. It claimed that the sporting body did not report allegations of abuse to relevant authorities.\nThe initial article did not name Nassar. But after it was published, Rachael Denhollander realised this was her chance to speak up.\nThe newspaper published allegations against him from two named former gymnasts, including Rachael, a month later.\n\"I knew this was how it was going to have to be done,\" she told the BBC outside court. \"When you have a predator who is surrounded by two very powerful institutions, one anonymous voice is never going to be enough.\n\"When you have a predator who is manipulative, gregarious and as engaging as Larry is, you have to be willing to meet him where he is the most comfortable - on very public ground. And never flinch.\"\nRachael's bravery helped encourage other women to come forward. In the corridors outside the sentencing hearing, countless women cited Rachael's actions as inspiration for their own decision to speak up.\nAs a result, instead of 90 survivors sharing their stories of abuse over four days - as had been expected at the start of the hearing - 156 women and girls ended up doing so over seven days.\nThe feeling in the courtroom throughout was one of collective empowerment and solidarity built through a shared experience of horror.\nFour-time Rio Olympic champion Simone Biles issued a statement to say she too had been abused by Nassar. Then, Olympic gold medallists Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber came to court to detail what he did to them during the 2012 Games in London.\nNassar was eventually arrested on 21 November, 2016.\nHe was sentenced to 60 years in jail a year later for three counts relating to child sex abuse images on his computer. \nHe then pleaded guilty to molesting females at his home, at a gymnastics club and in his MSU office, a plea that led to the 156 pre-sentence testimonies.\n\"I realise what I am feeling pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotional disturbance that I have wreaked,\" Nassar told the survivors as the hearings drew to a close.\n\"There are no words that can describe the depth and breadth of how sorry I am for what has occurred.\n\"I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days.\"\nAt the start of the hearings, Nassar had stared blankly down at his hands, avoiding eye contact with all those who came forward to speak.\nHis former colleague, gym coach Tom Brennan, stood alongside Gwen Anderson while she was testifying. \"Look at her,\" he yelled at the man he called his former mentor, ordering him to pay attention to the women as they testified.\nAfter that, Nassar appeared to look up and listen to the survivors with greater frequency.\nThe question of how repentant he was remained unanswered at the end of the hearings, however: Judge Aquilina read excerpts of a letter he sent her, saying he was a good doctor, and that the media had convinced the young women to believe he had acted wrongly.\nJudge Aquilina's role in this case was crucial. Almost every testimony began with survivors thanking her for her support and encouragement.\nGiven that Nassar had admitted his guilt months before, Judge Aquilina had no obligation to be impartial. As she took on the role of therapist, advocate and friend to the women who stood before her, she condemned his actions. \n\"The monster who took advantage of you is going to wither, much like the scene in the 'Wizard of Oz' where the water gets poured on the witch and the witch withers away,\" she told one woman after her testimony.\nShe also encouraged a number of the abuse survivors not to kill themselves when they said they had considered suicide - taking their own lives would hand Nassar victory, she said.\n\"I know you're a little nervous, pretend you're talking to me and your mum,\" she told another woman as she prepared to deliver her testimony.\nA crime writer in her spare time, Judge Aquilina's words were a powerful force throughout the hearing. She described the women as \"sister survivors\" and \"warriors\" who had demonstrated \"superwoman steel.\"\n\"I didn't want even one victim to lose their voice,\" she told the court, as she explained why she was prepared to let the hearing go on for as long as it took to hear all of the survivors who wanted to speak.\nThe survivors, in turn, responded. One after the other waived their anonymity and came to realise this was a chance to take charge of their own story.\nNot all the women knew each other, but many acknowledged the invisible bond between them, and the strength they had gained from the others who had spoken in court.\nOne former MSU softball player, Tiffany Thomas Lopez, told Nassar she was part of \"the army you created when you violated us\", going on to say: \"Your actions have had me by the throat for years. I'm ready to be released from your clench.\"\nAs the hearings went on past the four days that were initially scheduled, anger gradually built towards the institutions where Nassar worked.\nAly Raisman, part of the gold medal-winning gymnastics team in the 2012 Olympics, demanded an independent investigation into how Nassar was allowed to continue abusing girls even after complaints were made.\nShe attacked both USA Gymnastics - an organisation she said was \"rotting from the inside\" - and the US Olympic Committee for their lack of support. Three senior USA Gymnastics board members subsequently quit.\nThe focus has now shifted on to who knew what, and when.\nThe Lansing State Journal newspaper reports that seven women or girls made complaints about Nassar to coaches, trainers, police or university officials between 1997 and 2015.\nIn 2014, an investigation by MSU even cleared Nassar of wrongdoing after a recent graduate accused him of molesting her. Two years later, he was under arrest.\nThe university has put aside $10m (\u00a37.2m) to reimburse former students for counselling, but is being sued by about 140 women. MSU President Lou Anna Simon has also quit.\nMeanwhile, MSU's board of trustees asked the Michigan attorney general's office to conduct an outside review into how it handled the allegations.\nAs Nassar starts his jail sentence - brought about by a team of female investigators, prosecutors and judges - the battle to seek answers from the authorities is only just starting. Why did they not listen to survivors' stories sooner?\nRachael Denhollander, now a mother of three and a lawyer, was the last to give her testimony. Judge Aquilina called her \"the five-star general in the army of survivors\".\nFor Rachael, the sentence has been a vindication of her decision to speak out publicly 16 months ago.\n\"I'm so deeply grateful for where we are,\" she told the BBC. \"But it's absolutely heartbreaking to me.\n\"To know that the vast majority of those little girls could have been saved from what they went through is devastating.\"\nIf you have been affected by child sexual abuse, sexual abuse or violence, help and support is available.\nIf you are in the UK, you can find links here: BBC Action Line\nIf you are in the US, you can contact Rainn, the national sexual abuse hotline, here, or by calling 800.656.HOPE "

      "text": "Jess Brammar has been appointed to a senior role in BBC News, despite an impartiality row over her old tweets.\nA former editor of HuffPost UK, she will now oversee the BBC's domestic and international news channels.\nIt comes after weeks of wrangling, during which time BBC board member Sir Robbie Gibb was said to have objected to her appointment.\nSome media outlets drew attention to her now-deleted tweets, which were critical of Brexit and the government.\nSir Robbie was said to have warned that hiring Brammar would anger ministers, at a time when the BBC is about to enter negotiations for the licence fee that funds its operations. \nBut her appointment was confirmed by BBC chairman Richard Sharp at the Royal Television Society's Cambridge Convention on Wednesday, \nBrammar said she was \"looking forward to cracking on with the job\".\nThe newly-created role of executive editor will involve oversight of the BBC News channel and its international equivalent, BBC World.\nBrammar has previously worked at BBC programmes Question Time and Newsnight, as well as at ITN.\nBut her appointment was mired in controversy for several weeks, after it emerged she had criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson on social media.\nIn July, the Financial Times reported Sir Robbie had warned the BBC's outgoing director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, that the government's \"fragile trust in the BBC will be shattered\" were Brammar to be appointed.\nSir Robbie, who previously worked as communications director to former prime minister Theresa May, was appointed to the BBC board in April.\nJacob Rees-Mogg agreed, commenting later that month that Brammar's potential appointment \"damages the whole perception of independence and impartiality at the BBC\".\nHe added: \"They really do damage themselves\".\nBrammar previous tweets included accusing the PM of lying in a TV interview, and also compared Brexit to the TV series Better Call Saul, \"but less funny or interesting or enjoyable\".\nEarlier this year, she criticised the Society of Editors' response to claims by Meghan Markle of racism in the British press.\n\"I'm aware I won't make myself popular with my peers,\" Brammar tweeted, \"but I'm just going to stand up and say it: I don't agree with [the] statement from my industry body that it is 'untrue that sections of the UK press were bigoted'.\"\nUnsworth confirmed Brammar's appointment in an email to staff on Wednesday, while addressing the recent controversy. \n\"Jess is an award-winning editor with wide-ranging experience in broadcasting,\" she wrote.\nAddressing the recent controversy, she added: \"BBC News has to be impartial and independent. BBC journalists are hired from a variety of different backgrounds, but while working at the BBC, they leave any personal opinions at the door.\"\n\"Any individual should be judged on how they do their job at the BBC, not on what they have done in different organisations with very different objectives,\" she added.\n\"It is extremely disappointing that anyone should receive public and personal criticism - or online abuse - simply for applying for a job at the BBC.\"\nWriting on Twitter for the first time in several weeks, Brammar added that \"couldn't be more thrilled to be joining such an incredibly talented team\".\nIt was announced last week that Unsworth herself would be leaving the BBC early next year, after more than 40 years with the broadcaster.\nBrammar's appointment was confirmed alongside that of Paul Danahar, who will become executive news editor of the World story team."

      "tags": "Prince Andrew, Duke of York,Virginia Giuffre,United States",
      "text": "The High Court in London will formally contact the Duke of York about allegations of sexual assault filed in a US court.\nLawyers for Virginia Giuffre, who has accused Prince Andrew, requested the High Court contact the prince about the civil case launched in New York.\nThe prince's lawyers have argued he has not been properly served notice of the case. \nPrince Andrew has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's allegations. \nHis spokeswoman has declined to comment on the latest development.\nThe Hague Service Convention, a treaty that governs requests between countries for evidence in civil or commercial matters, allows Ms Giuffre's legal team to ask the High Court in London to formally notify Prince Andrew about her civil action.\nThe High Court had initially rejected their request, citing an issue with the application, but later said: \"The lawyers acting for Ms Giuffre have now provided further information to the High Court, and the High Court has accepted the request for service under the Hague Service Convention.\n\"The legal process has not yet been served but the High Court will now take steps to serve under the convention, unless service is arranged by agreement between the parties.\"\nAt the first pre-trial hearing in New York, on Monday, the prince's lawyer, Andrew Brettler, argued he had not been properly served under either UK or international law. \nMs Giuffre's lawyers had claimed papers had been left with a police officer at the gates of Prince Andrew's Windsor home last month - and so successfully \"served\".\nThe prince does not face the prospect of an extradition hearing, as this applies only to criminal charges and not civil cases.\nIt is now becoming very, very hard for the Duke of York to avoid being served with documents and having to file a response to the courthouse in New York.\nAn international agreement between British and US courts means the High Court is now under an obligation to find the most practical way to serve the Giuffre case on Prince Andrew. \nEnglish law sets out clear but flexible rules on how that should happen - and the court will ultimately decide how best to proceed. \nIt could order an officer of the court to take the documents once more to Windsor, where Prince Andrew lives. \nBut the US lawyers could ask the High Court to approve an alternative method, such as posting or emailing them, or leaving them with one of his known lawyers. \nIn practice, many defendants presented with this situation ultimately accept they have to be served and consent to it, so they can focus on how they will respond and attempt to have the case dismissed.\nDuring the hearing, held via telephone conference, Mr Brettler also described the civil case against the prince as \"baseless, non-viable [and] potentially unlawful\". \nAnd he said a 2009 settlement between Ms Giuffre and billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had released the prince from \"any and all liability\".\nMs Giuffre, now 38, was an accuser of Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, and claims she was sexually assaulted by the prince at three locations, including New York City.\nMs Giuffre - then known as Virginia Roberts - says she was assaulted at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little Saint James, in the US Virgin Islands.\nHer case claims Prince Andrew, 61, engaged in sexual acts without Ms Giuffre's consent, including when she was 17, knowing how old she was, and \"that she was a sex-trafficking victim\".\nThe Queen's second son has consistently denied the claims and, in 2019, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"It didn't happen.\n\"I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. \n\"I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Plans for tackling Covid during autumn and winter in England have been unveiled, with Boris Johnson warning the disease \"remains a risk\".\nThey include booster jabs for millions - but hold in reserve measures like vaccine passports for certain settings.\n\"Plan A\" is designed to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed, and promotes vaccines and testing.\n\"Plan B\", to be used if the NHS is coming under \"unsustainable pressure\", includes measures such as face masks.\nUnder Plan A of the autumn and winter plan, announced by Health Secretary Sajid Javid, ministers will:\nThe plan will also include continuing testing, tracing of cases and self-isolation for those who catch the virus.\nBusinesses will also be encouraged to consider using the NHS Covid Pass to check the vaccination or test status of customers. \nUnder Plan B - which ministers say would only be enacted if further measures are needed to protect the NHS:\nGuidance on working from home may also be issued under this plan.\nMr Johnson, discussing the plan at a Downing Street news conference, said he was confident vaccinations could protect the gains made so far.\nThe prime minister said he hoped the vaccination programme meant the UK could remain \"one of the most free societies\" in Europe, with only limited restrictions to keep the disease in check.\nAsked in what circumstances he would consider moving from Plan A to the stricter Plan B, Mr Johnson said he would consider the risks, the state of the disease and factors like hospital pressure.\nPlan B made use of \"a number of different shots in the locker\", he said.\n\"You wouldn't necessarily play them all at once, far from it, you would want to do things in a graduated way,\" he said.\n\"Because so many of the population have some degree of immunity, smaller changes in the way we're asking people to behave can have a bigger impact.\"\nHe added that this would \"give us the confidence that we don't have to go back to the lockdowns of the past\".\nSir Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser, said that if the country had gone into last winter with the current level of restrictions, cases would have gone \"through the roof\".\nHe said it underlined the importance of getting the vaccine to as many people as possible.\n\"There are five million or so people who are eligible for vaccines now who haven't been vaccinated,\" he said.\n\"Trying to persuade those people it is the right thing to do to get vaccinated would make a significant difference.\"\nProf Chris Whitty, chief medical adviser, warned that \"winter is coming\" and that respiratory viruses such as flu and others would be \"hugely advantaged\".\n\"If you've not had your vaccination, now is a very good time to do so,\" he said.\nThe government wants to avoid bringing back restrictions in England.\nNot just the big ones - like closing down shops or pubs. But the smaller ones too - like telling people they must wear face coverings in certain venues or that they should work from home.\nThe autumn and winter plan keeps the latter on the table. The prime minister gave us an idea of why. He doesn't want Covid vaccine passports, he says, but if it prevents having to close certain venues in future, he's prepared to keep the prospect alive. \nThe plan also says \"more harmful economic and social restrictions\" are a last resort - ministers are desperate to avoid them. \nBut the uncertainties of the next few weeks and months mean they cannot be taken off the table completely. \nEarlier, Mr Javid told MPs it was highly likely frontline NHS staff and those in wider social care settings will need to have Covid-19 and flu vaccinations so they can be deployed.\nThe health secretary said the government would be \"keeping an open mind\" and waiting for the results of a consultation but he believed this would be \"an important step in protecting those at greatest risk\". \nHe described Plan B measures as those \"that we can call upon only if they are needed and supported by the data to prevent unsustainable pressure on the NHS\". \nUnder that plan, the government expects proof of vaccination would be mandatory for nightclubs, crowded indoor venues with more than 500 attendees, crowded outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, such as festivals, as well as any settings with more than 10,000 people. \nPlan A or Plan B - what could happen this winter?\nMr Javid said the government would remove more of its powers in the Coronavirus Act, including those directing the temporary closure of schools. \nHowever, those that are \"critical\" to the pandemic response, such as supporting statutory sick pay for those self-isolating, will remain.\nMr Javid suggested PCR tests for fully vaccinated travellers would be scrapped in favour of cheaper lateral flow tests - with a review of rules around international travel due by 1 October.\nA further 26,628 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Tuesday, alongside another 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe message from ministers in England is clear - we are going to try to rely almost entirely on the vaccines to protect us this winter.\nBut what is not spelt out is how bad it will have to get before we need to change course and move to Plan B.\nThe winter plan talks about \"unsustainable pressure\" on the NHS as the trigger, rather than too many deaths. \nSo what can the NHS cope with? The document does not spell that out.\nCurrently 7% of hospital beds are filled by Covid patients. That may not sound a lot, but hospitals are run close to capacity so Covid cases quickly impact on other care that can be provided.\nThe amount of non-emergency treatment being done is already nearly a fifth down on normal levels.\nIf Covid admissions keep growing or other respiratory illnesses take off, it will mean more rationing - from knee and hip replacements being delayed to people waiting longer for an ambulance.\nNone of this, though, is unusual - it happens every winter. But the scale of it could be very different. "

      "text": "Most people do not believe workers will return to the office full-time after the coronavirus pandemic, an exclusive survey for the BBC suggests.\nA total of 70% of 1,684 people polled predicted that workers would \"never return to offices at the same rate\".\nThe majority of workers said that they would prefer to work from home either full-time or at least some of the time.\nBut managers raised concerns that creativity in the workplace would be affected.\nHalf of 530 senior leaders also surveyed by polling organisation YouGov for the BBC said that workers staying at home would adversely affect both creativity and collaboration - against just 38% of the general public.\nBosses at big firms such as investment bank Goldman Sachs and tech giant Apple have rejected calls for more flexibility, with the former even calling working from home an \"aberration\".\nManagers and members of the public surveyed for the BBC agreed, however, that neither productivity nor the economy would be harmed by continuing work-from-home policies.\nBT's chief executive Philip Jansen, for example, told the BBC that it is planning to let most of its office workers work on-site three or four days of the week in future - although thousands of its engineers won't be offered the same flexibility.\n\"We are a people business so collaboration, dynamism, teamwork, creativity... is really important to us,\" he said.\nAccording to the research, more than three-quarters of people believe their boss will allow them to continue working from home some of the time.\nAccording to the latest official figures, the proportion of workers who did at least some work from home in 2020 increased to 37%, up from 27% the previous year.\nMaisie Lawrinson joined TalkTalk through the government's Kickstart jobs scheme in July. Under the scheme, Jobcentre work coaches match young people aged between 16 and 24 who are on Universal Credit to new, temporary, roles.\nWhile Maisie is grateful for the six-month contract, she's keen to be in the office as much as possible so she can make a good impression.\n\"I've never had a job where I'm speaking to people online or emailing,\" she says, referring to her past experience in retail.\nShe adds: \"I'm more productive when I am in the office because it's more of a professional environment and you get to see people.\"\nHaving started the role remotely, she only got to meet her colleagues for the first time in-person recently.\n\"We recently had team drinks and I finally got to meet everyone. It was really nice, I got to see everyone in person and get an idea of who they are, rather than just what their email is.\" \nShe says she will still take the opportunity to work from home some days, though, perhaps towards the end of the week.\nMore than 60% of those surveyed thought young people would struggle to progress without face-to-face contact or in-person mentoring.\nAs experts have pointed out, under-25s in particular were hit hard by job losses or reduced hours at the onset of the pandemic.\nThe bespoke research for the BBC suggests that some inequalities may be exacerbated by the pandemic, while others might have improved.\nHalf of the workers surveyed thought that women's careers might be boosted by home-working, with childcare duties being less of a hindrance. \nOne enthusiastic home-worker is Antony Howard, who works in procurement for a large defence company in Manchester.\nHe's found big benefits to logging on remotely for the last 16 months, from avoiding expensive coffee shops to cutting down on travel time.\n\"My health and carbon footprint have never been better. I'm no longer commuting 92 miles a day and I'm more productive,\" he says.\n While he's also been saving money by shopping more locally, he does worry about those newer to the company.\n\"We've had 17-year-old apprentices starting in September who have never been on-site,\" he says.\n\"For me as a 57-year-old, hybrid working is a great scenario, but for the younger ones starting out, they need that workplace experience, that structure.\"\nEven so, he hopes that the pandemic will \"recalibrate\" the workplace. Rather than being a novelty, he says, \"I think this is the new now.\"\nRecruiters are finding it tricky to navigate the expectations of candidates demanding hybrid and remote working, and companies who want people back in the office for at least some of the time.\nKam Vara, a consultant at Katie Bard recruitment, says it has been a very challenging few months.\n\"It used to be that people would fit their lives around their work. Covid is teaching people that it doesn't work that way any more\", she says. \n\"People are turning down opportunities because they don't offer remote working, and they would rather sit tight and wait for the right job to become available\".\nShe adds: \"It feels quite messy right now. What an employer is looking for is some sort of order. To get people into the office and have some structure. But what employees are looking for is something very different. It's going to be like this for a while until the jigsaw fits together.\"\nIn England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson recommended a \"gradual return to work\" over the summer as coronavirus restrictions eased. Across the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep clocking on remotely where possible.\nAnd working remotely full-time for office staff could well become the norm again.\nOn Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs that advising people in England should work from home again would be part of the government's contingency plans if there was considerable pressure on the NHS this winter.\nProf Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, added that the policy could make \"a significant difference to transmission if we get into trouble\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday: \"The most important and effective way of reducing spread of the virus is not to be in contact with other people.\" \nThe BBC commissioned polling organisation YouGov to survey 1,684 working adults and 530 senior leaders in business about their predictions and opinions on working from home. YouGov also re-ran a previous survey of 4,041 British adults, first conducted in March 2021, about their current working from home situation.\nHave your working arrangements changed?

      "tags": "Companies,Competition and Markets Authority,Personal finance,Housing market",
      "text": "Thousands of leaseholders who bought homes from a major housebuilder will no longer be subjected to ground rents that double every 10 or 15 years. \nCountryside Properties will keep rents at the same level as when they first bought their home after a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority.\nCountryside is the latest housebuilder to scrap the \"unfair\" contract terms.\nMillions of buyers signed leasehold contracts that campaigners say make homes impossible to mortgage or sell.\nThe regulator launched its investigation into leaseholds in 2019 because it was worried that leaseholders were facing huge and unexpected increases in the cost of buying a freehold or massive increases in ground rents, which kick in every 10 to 15 years.\nThe commitment from Countryside comes after the CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers in September 2020. \nThese were Countryside and Taylor Wimpey, for using \"possibly unfair contract terms\", and Barratt Developments and Persimmon Homes over the possible mis-selling of leasehold homes. The watchdog's investigation into Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey is continuing.\nAndrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said Countryside leaseholders could breathe a \"sigh of relief\", following the contract changes.\n\"No one should feel like a prisoner in their home, trapped by terms that mean they can struggle to sell or mortgage their property,\" he said.\n\"We will continue to robustly tackle developers and investors - as we have done over the past two years - to make sure that people aren't taken advantage of.\"\nSome of the biggest names in property have changed their terms recently, while others remain under investigation. \nIn June, Persimmon agreed for its leaseholders to buy the freehold of their property at a discount, while Aviva, which buys freeholds from house builders, pledged to repay homeowners who saw their ground rents double.\nWith a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property, but they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes.\nWhen a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold.\nHowever, leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell.\nThere were an estimated 4.6 million leasehold dwellings in England between 2019 and 2020, which equated to 19% of the English housing stock. More than two thirds (3.2 million) of the leasehold dwellings were flats and 1.5 million were houses, official figures said.\nKatie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC), said the changes would help people \"escape onerous ground rents that make their homes unmortgageable and unsellable\".\n\"We are delighted that Countryside are the next domino to fall in this whole sorry saga of doubling ground rents,\" she added.\nCountryside Properties confirmed it no longer sells leasehold homes with doubling ground rents. It will also remove terms which converted clauses which meant ground rent increased in line with the Retail Prices Index (RPI). \nIain McPherson, chief executive of Countryside, said the housebuilder had \"engaged extensively and constructively with the CMA throughout the course of its review to reach this positive outcome for affected leaseholders\".\nFor Baz Jafar, the leaseholder of a one-bedroom flat which was sold to him by Countryside, the agreement to scrap ground rent increases has been a \"long time coming\".\nThe 31-year-old, along with many others living in the same block of flats in north London, discovered the onerous clauses \"one or two years\" after buying the properties.\nHe told the BBC most leaseholders in the building had used solicitors recommended by Countryside.\n\"We found we could not really move to different mortgage companies,\" said Mr Jafar. \"We could not really sell [the homes] because mortgage companies found these increased terms unacceptable.\"\nMr Jafar said when he and others raised the issue with Countryside, the company said rising ground rent payments were \"industry standard\".\n\"The whole thing stank from the beginning,\" said Mr Jafar. \"Countryside say they are really happy to come to a solution for leaseholders. People are only affected because Countryside wrote these leases in the first place.\n\"I'm disappointed that they [Countryside] have not given any admission of liability. I do not think they should be given any credit for what they are doing.\"\nDr Coscelli said Taylor Wimpey and freehold investors had the \"opportunity to do the right thing\" to remove \"problematic clauses from their contracts\".\n\"If they refuse, we stand ready to step in and take further action - through the courts, if necessary,\" he said.\nNCL co-founder Jo Darbyshire, who lives in a Taylor Wimpey house that was sold in 2010 with ground rent of \u00a3295, doubling every 10 years, said it was \"about time\" for the housebuilder to \"do the right thing and match what Countryside are doing\".\nTaylor Wimpey declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.\nHousing secretary Robert Jenrick said said new legislation would \"put an end to this practice\" by housebuilders for future homeowners, by setting ground rents in new leases at zero.\nGround rents typically start at about \u00a3250 a year. Doubling clauses mean that this amount escalates over time. Campaigners often say the leasehold system was not properly explained to them when they bought their properties, leaving them trapped in unsellable homes.\nThree firms have now agreed to change their ways, but the CMA is continuing to investigate the use of ground rent by Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Homes. The government is introducing new legislation to scrap ground rent on new leases, but homeowners who have already paid high charges in the past want compensation. \nFor the four million leaseholders across England and Wales, ground rent is only part of the problem. They do not own a single brick of the building, so they need permission to do any work on the property and can be charged a fee for it. \nDevelopers can also sell on the freehold of your home to investors without telling you. Housebuilders say leasehold does work for some developments, but the system remains controversial and reforms slow."

      "tags": "North Korea missile tests,North Korea",
      "text": "North and South Korea have tested ballistic missiles hours apart from each other, highlighting an arms race on the peninsula as nuclear talks with the North remain stalled. \nThe North fired two ballistic missiles across its east coast, its first test with such missiles in six months and a fresh breach of UN resolutions.\nThe tests came as South Korea and China discussed the North's nuclear issue.\nHours later, the South tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile.\nThe test of the missile known as SLBM was pre-planned and not in reaction to the North's latest launches. It makes South Korea the seventh country in the world with such technology.\nPresident Moon Jae-in, who attended the test, said South Korea now had\u00a0\"sufficient deterrence to respond to North Korea's provocations at any time\", urging the South to continue increasing its weapons programmes to \"overwhelm North Korea's asymmetric power\".\nThe comments were criticised by Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who described them as illogical and regrettable, warning that they could lead to a breakdown in ties, state news agency KCNA reported.\nIn North Korea's test, the short-range missiles flew around 800km (500 miles) at a maximum altitude of 60km, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.\nThey were launched from central inland areas of the country, and flew east towards the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, the JCS added. South Korea and the US were conducting analysis to determine which type of missile was used.\nThe Japanese defence minister said later the missiles had landed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone.\nUN resolutions ban North Korea from carrying out tests with ballistic missiles - which can carry either nuclear or conventional warheads - in efforts to curb the country's nuclear programme. \n\"It's extraordinary timing that you have not one but two Koreas testing ballistic missiles on the same day,\" Prof John Delury at Yonsei University told AFP news agency. \"It does speak to the fact that there's an arms race in this region.\"\nThe recent launches show North Korea has continued to develop its weapons despite a severe economic crisis. Experts say Pyongyang carries out such tests to improve its technology while trying to increase its leverage in negotiations with Washington. \nThe US wants the country to give up its nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for sanctions relief, but the North has refused.\nJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the North Korean launch \"outrageous\" while the US said it posed a threat to the neighbours and the international community.\nEarlier, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks with his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, in Seoul, and said all parties should work to promote peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.\nBallistic missiles are classed according to how far they can travel, the furthest of which being an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\nNorth Korea has in the past tested ICBMs said to be capable of reaching nearly all of Western Europe and about half of the US mainland. \nLast weekend, Pyongyang said it tested a long-range cruise missile capable of hitting much of Japan, calling it \"a strategic weapon of great significance\". Experts say it could possibly carry a nuclear warhead. \nThe UN Security Council does not forbid the test of cruise missiles. But it considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening because they can carry bigger and more powerful payloads, have a much longer range, and can travel faster.\nNorth Korea is facing food shortages, and has spent more than a year in isolation. It cut off most trade with its closest ally China to stop the spread of Covid-19.\nLast March, Pyongyang defied sanctions and tested ballistic missiles, which triggered a strong rebuke from the US, Japan and South Korea.\nAnd last month the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a \"deeply troubling\" development."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid booster jabs will begin to be offered across the UK from next week.\nIt follows a recommendation from the government's vaccine advisers, the JCVI, who said about 30m people should be offered a third dose.\nThey said the booster should be given at least six months after a person had their second dose - with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab recommended.\nThose eligible include over-50s, younger adults with health conditions and frontline health and care workers. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid made the announcement in the Commons as part of an autumn and winter plan for managing Covid in England.\nScotland will begin offering booster jabs for the broader group from Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. \nShe said the programme \"was intended to prolong the protection\" of vaccines and will run alongside the flu vaccination programme.\nThe go-ahead was also confirmed in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe recommendation from the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) comes amid concern about waning immunity.\nThere are some signs protection offered by the vaccine may start dropping off several months after the second dose - with the most vulnerable groups most at risk of this.\nIn his statement, Mr Javid told MPs: \"There is evidence that the protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines reduces over time, particularly older people who are at greater risk, so booster doses are an important way of keeping the virus under control for the long term.\"\nThe JCVI said it was still unclear exactly how much protection does slip, but it wanted to take a precautionary approach and ensure the most vulnerable people maintain high levels of protection.\nThe advice is separate to the recent recommendation of third doses for people with severely weakened immune systems - something that is already being rolled out. \nThose eligible for a booster jab include:\nThere is a huge amount of uncertainty about what winter will bring. In fact, it's not even clear what the next month will bring.\nIt was feared September could see Covid cases rise, but there are no signs of that happening yet.\nBig surges in infection levels are probably behind us, given the amount of immunity built up in the population.\nBut if current levels are sustained throughout winter, the NHS will struggle. And even a small dip in vaccine effectiveness could make a big difference to admissions - hence the booster announcement.\nThen there is the concern about the return of other respiratory viruses. They were kept at bay last year by lockdowns and social distancing, but that has meant immunity to them has waned.\nA virus called RSV - the leading cause of respiratory illness in young children - is already circulating at very high levels. Flu could also take off. \nIt is why the NHS is having to prepare for the worst, while hoping for the best.\nTrials have been carried out in the UK looking at the use of booster jabs.\nThe JCVI said these showed Pfizer was well-tolerated and provoked a good immune response, including against new variants of the virus, such as Delta, regardless of which Covid vaccine had been given for the first two doses.\nIt said where Pfizer was not available a half-dose of Moderna could also be used.\nFor people who cannot have the Pfizer or Moderna because of issues like allergies, the AstraZeneca vaccine can be used as a booster.\nA gap of six months between the second dose and the booster shot was considered the most effective for boosting protection.\nThe trials also showed the flu vaccine can also be given at the same time as the booster jab where that is practical - some people will be offered a flu jab before they become eligible for a Covid booster.\nJCVI chairman Prof Wei Shen Lim said: \"The UK's Covid vaccination programme has been hugely successful in protecting people against hospitalisation and death, and the main aim of the booster programme is to prolong that protection and reduce serious disease as we head towards the colder months.\"\nHe said even a small tip in vaccine effectiveness could have a big impact on hospital admission numbers given the size of the population.\nHe said those under 50 were likely to have a more long-lasting immune response to the first two doses of vaccine so may not need a booster - although he did not rule it out happening completely.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam said the UK was likely to be in for a \"bumpy winter\" with Covid, coupled with other respiratory viruses, such as flu, returning - previously lockdowns and social distancing meant these were kept at very low levels.\nHe said the booster programme was about \"staying on top of Covid\" and could make a \"very substantial impact\" on hospitalisations and deaths.\nAbout 85% of deaths in recent weeks have been among the over 60s.\nBut Prof Van Tam added it was also important that those who had not yet come forward for jab did so - more than five million adults have not yet had their first dose yet.\nThe announcement comes after the government confirmed on Monday that all children aged 12 to 15 in England would be offered one dose of the Pfizer jab, with invitations going out from next week. \nIt follows advice from the UK's chief medical officers, who say the jab will help reduce disruption to education.\nA rollout is yet to be confirmed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn a statement before the announcement on the booster programme, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said while the pandemic \"is far from over\", the \"phenomenal vaccine programme, new treatments and testing\" mean the UK is \"able to live with the virus without significant restrictions on our freedoms\". \nThe PM, who is holding a coronavirus press conference later, said he would lay out a strategy for the months ahead \"when the virus has a natural advantage, to protect the gains we have made\".

      "tags": "Economics,Personal finance,Inflation,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Inflation is at its highest rate for 30 years, having risen to 5.4% in the 12 months to December. \nThe jump in the cost of living, driven largely by rising fuel and energy costs, puts further pressure on households across the UK.\nInflation is the rate at which prices are rising. If the price of a bottle of milk is \u00a31 and it rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. \nYou may not notice price rises from month to month. But right now, prices are rising so quickly that average pay is not keeping up.\nIt means that the money people earn does not go as far.\nIn the year to November 2021, regular pay, excluding bonuses and adjusted for inflation, fell 1%.\nThere are workers in a few sectors - such as lorry drivers - who are in high demand, and whose wages are rising faster than prices.\nAnd in April, the lowest-paid will see the National Living Wage rise by 6.6% to \u00a39.50 an hour - which is higher than the current inflation rate.\nBut many people are seeing a noticeable drop in their \"real\" wages.\nThe main reason is the rising global price of energy. This has meant higher energy and transport bills for businesses, many of whom pass on the extra costs to customers. \nSupply problems and higher shipping costs also continue to hurt businesses. \nNext, the High Street retailer, has admitted its prices could rise by up to 6% this year to keep up with higher costs.\nStaff shortages are a particular problem in the UK, due to Brexit and the pandemic, and are prompting some employers to raise wages.\nHowever, this can itself contribute to inflation. Greggs, for instance, has raised the price of some foods in order to cover increased labour costs. \nA number of measures will hit UK households:\nUK cost of living squeeze in 2022, says think tank\nInflation is measured by a body called the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which notes the prices of hundreds of everyday items.\nThese items are called the \"basket of goods\", and they're being constantly updated. For instance, in 2021 hand sanitiser and men's loungewear bottoms were added, but sandwiches bought at work were removed. \nThe ONS releases its measure of inflation each month, showing how much these prices have risen since the same date last year. This is known as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI).\nThe Bank of England's traditional response to rising inflation is to raise interest rates.\nThat means anyone who has borrowed money could see their monthly payments go up, especially on mortgages tied to the Bank of England's rates.\nThe idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend. As a result, they will buy fewer things, and prices will stabilise in response. \nBut if inflation is caused by external forces, such as the global squeeze on energy prices, then this might not be the answer.\nThe government might choose instead to cut taxes for consumers on items that are rising quickly - such as VAT on energy bills. \nOr, it might target support at those who need it most. It has been reported that it is considering expanding the Warm Homes discount scheme, for example, which offers those in receipt of certain benefits the option to apply for a one-off \u00a3140 payment.\nHow have you adapted to rising prices?

He took his hat off and he held it by there and he said, 'Can I have your attention',\" she said.\n\"And he closed the doors and he closed the windows, and he looked at us and he said, 'There's no way I can say this other than I'm really sorry but we've found a body'.\n\"And the whole place just collapsed.\" \nMr Breslin, 62, was just two months off retirement.

      "title": "Covid: Can England avoid 'lockdown lite' this winter?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government's approach in England is clear - it's going to try to rely almost entirely on the vaccines to protect the country from Covid this winter. \nThe winter plan published on Wednesday says vaccines, including the rollout of boosters and jabs for children, are the Plan A.\nThere is, however, a Plan B. This includes greater use of face coverings, Covid passports and working-from-home orders -  a \"lockdown lite\" as it has been dubbed. \nWhat are the chances of avoiding this?\nThe government has one criterion for moving to Plan B - unsustainable pressure on the NHS.  Although, the plan does not spell out exactly what this entails.\nCurrently, 7% of hospital beds are filled by Covid patients. This may not sound a lot - but hospitals are run close to capacity, so Covid cases quickly impact on other care.\nThe amount of non-emergency treatment being given is already nearly a fifth down on normal levels.\nAnd if Covid admissions keep growing or other respiratory illness take off, it will mean more rationing - from knee and hip replacements being delayed to people waiting longer for an ambulance.\nNone of this is unusual - it happens every winter. But this year, it could be on a very different scale. \nCurrently, the numbers in hospital are pretty flat, however. They have risen by only a fifth in six weeks.\nIf this trajectory remains constant, it will certainly put hospitals under strain - but it would be hard to argue the Covid pressure was unsustainable.\nInfection levels could go up however. Case numbers have been bobbling around since the rapid rise stopped in mid-July.\nEssentially, the epidemic has been stable. That is a pretty remarkable achievement given how infectious the Delta variant is and the fact society is fully open.\nIt suggests we are on our way out of the pandemic. But, as the prime minister and leading scientists have kept stressing this week, it is not completely over. \nOne model suggests infection rates could rise so much that admissions may hit 7,000 a day in England by mid-October, nearly 10 times what it is now. Most experts do not think that is a realistic scenario though.\nThe main drivers of what comes next are immunity levels and the amount people mix.\nWith summer over and people returning to work and school, contact levels may rise and those contacts may increasingly be indoors, where the virus spreads more easily. To counteract this, immunity levels need to increase.\nAnd while the vaccines are incredibly good at reducing the risk of people becoming seriously ill and dying, they are not perfect. And over time their effectiveness may wane.\nThis is where the boosters come in. Topping up protection among the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions could make a crucial difference.\nMuch more so than vaccinating healthy 12- to 15-year-olds, also announced this week, who are at so much lower risk of becoming seriously ill.\nWhat is also essential, however, is getting more of the five million or so adults who have not even had one dose of the vaccine jabbed.\nIf immunity cannot keep hospital admissions at bay, this is where Plan B comes in. The measures may not seem that significant considering the nature of lockdowns previously. But they are based on the assumption that if infection levels do take off the growth will not be as fast as it was last winter and therefore relatively minor changes, such as working from home, can make a big difference. \nWith so many unknowns though, predicting what happens next is tricky. \"There is huge uncertainty,\" Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the government's modelling committee, says.\nHe does not think we will see the big surges that marked the early waves and would lead to a huge growth in hospital admissions. \nBut nor does he think there will be significant reduction in infection levels. \"I don't think anyone is expecting that,\" he adds.\nThis is not all about Covid, though. Experts have been warning the normal winter viruses are likely to return.\nLast year, viruses such as flu were hardly seen, because of lockdowns and social distancing.\nBut this has lowered our immunity to them - and prevented some young children developing any immunity at all.\nA virus called RSV - the leading cause of under-fives being admitted to hospital for respiratory illness - is already circulating at very high levels.\nAnd if flu follows suit, the number of admissions for other respiratory viruses could easily top those currently being seen for Covid - about 750 a day.\nProf Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, says the conditions are \"ripe\" for this to happen. \nBut she believes the government is right to try to find a balance that \"maximises risk reduction while minimising the impacts on our lives\".\nMinisters, she say, have to be prepared to act if need be. For now it's a matter of planning for the worst, while hoping for the best.\nFollow Nick on Twitter.\nRead more from Nick."

      "title": "Faroe Islands: Anger over killing of 1,400 dolphins in one day",
      "tags": "Dolphins,Hunting,Faroe Islands",
      "text": "The practice of dolphin hunting in the Faroe Islands has come under scrutiny after more than 1,400 of the mammals were killed in what was believed to be a record catch.\nThe pod of white-sided dolphins was driven into the largest fjord in the North Atlantic territory on Sunday.\nBoats herded them into shallow waters at Skalabotnur beach in Eysturoy, where they were killed with knives.\nThe carcases were pulled ashore and distributed to locals for consumption.\nWarning: This article contains graphic details and images some may find distressing.\nFootage of the hunt shows dolphins thrashing around in waters turned red with blood as hundreds of people watch on from the beach.\nKnown as the grind (or Grindadrap in Faroese), the hunting of sea mammals - primarily whales - is a tradition that has been practised for hundreds of years on the remote Faroe Islands.\nThe Faroese government says about 600 pilot whales are caught every year on average. White-sided dolphins are caught in lower numbers, such as 35 in 2020 and 10 in 2019.\nSupporters say whaling is a sustainable way of gathering food from nature and an important part of their cultural identity. Animal rights activists have long disagreed, deeming the slaughter cruel and unnecessary.\nSunday's hunt was no different, as international conservation groups rounded on the hunters to condemn the killing.\nBut the scale of the killing at Skalabotnur beach has shocked many locals and even drawn criticism from groups involved in the practice.\nBjarni Mikkelsen, a marine biologist from the Faroe Islands, put the reported death toll into perspective.\nHe said records showed that this was the largest number of dolphins ever killed on one day in the Faroe Islands, a autonomous territory of Denmark.\nHe said the previous record was 1,200 in 1940. The next-largest catches were 900 in 1879, 856 in 1873, and 854 in 1938, Mr Mikkelsen said.\nIn an interview with the BBC, the chairman of the Faroese Whalers Association, Olavur Sjurdarberg, acknowledged that killing was excessive. \nWhy were that many dolphins killed, then?\n\"It was a big mistake,\" said Mr Sjurdarberg, who did not participate in the hunt. \"When the pod was found, they estimated it to be only 200 dolphins.\"\nOnly when the killing process started did they find out the true size of the pod, he said.\n\"Somebody should have known better,\" he said. \"Most people are in shock about what happened.\"\nEven so, according to Mr Sjurdarberg, the catch was approved by the local authorities and no laws were broken.\nSuch hunts are regulated in the Faroe Islands. They are non-commercial and are organised on a community level, often spontaneously when someone spots a pod of the mammals.\nTo take part, hunters must have an official training certificate that qualifies them to kill the animals.\nKilling white-sided dolphins is \"legal but it's not popular\", said Sjurdur Skaale, a Danish MP for the Faroe Islands.\nHe visited Skalabotnur beach to speak to locals on Monday. \"People were furious,\" he said.\nStill, he defended the hunt, which he said was \"humane\" if done in the right way.\nThat involves a specially designed lance, which is used to cut the spinal cord of the whale or dolphin before the neck is cut.\nUsing this method, it should take \"less than a second to kill a whale\", Mr Skaale said.\n\"From an animal welfare point of view, it's a good way of killing meat - far better than keeping cows and pigs imprisoned,\" he said.\nCampaign group Sea Shepherd has disputed this, arguing that \"the killing of the dolphins and pilot whales is rarely as quick as Faroese government\" makes out.\n\"Grindadrap hunts can turn into drawn-out, often disorganised massacres,\" the group says.\n\"The pilot whales and dolphins can be killed over long periods in front of their relatives while beached on sand, rocks or just struggling in shallow water.\"\nSurveys suggest that most people are opposed to the mass slaughter of dolphins in the Faroe Islands.\nOn Sunday, the national reaction was \"one of bewilderment and shock because of the extraordinarily big number\", said Trondur Olsen, a journalist for Faroese public broadcaster Kringvarp Foroya.\n\"We did a quick poll yesterday asking whether we should continue to kill these dolphins. Just over 50% said no, and just over 30% said yes,\" he said.\nIn contrast, he said, a separate poll suggested that 80% said they wanted to continue with the killing of pilot whales.\nThe polls provide a snapshot of public opinion towards the killing of sea mammals.\nCriticism of the Faroese hunt has ebbed and flowed over the years. The hunt is brought to wider attention from time to time, as it was by the popular Seaspiracy documentary on Netflix earlier this year.\nThis time, though, locals say the reaction - especially within the whaling community - has been unusually damning.\n\"There's been a lot of international attention. My suspicion is that people are bracing themselves for a big backlash,\" Olsen said.\n\"This is a good time for campaigners to put even more pressure on. It will be different this time because the numbers are very big.\""

      "tags": "Commercial space travel,SpaceX,Human spaceflight,Astronauts,Space exploration,United States",
      "text": "Four amateur astronauts have blasted off from Florida on their private mission to orbit.\nThe Inspiration4 crew, comprising one billionaire and three \"ordinary citizens\", rode out of the Kennedy Space Center in a Dragon capsule provided by the SpaceX rocket company.  \nThe quartet will spend the next three days circling the Earth.\nIt's another milestone in the space tourism market, which is experiencing a resurgence after a decade's hiatus.\nEarlier this summer, billionaire businessmen Sir Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos went above Earth's atmosphere in their own space vehicles.\nAnd following this latest mission, there'll be three privateer visits to the International Space Station (ISS) - one in October, carrying a Russian movie director and an actress, and two either side of the New Year.\nThe Inspiration4 crew of Jared Issacman, Hayley Arceneaux, Sian Proctor and Chris Sembroski have had six months of intensive training with SpaceX. However, onboard computer systems will be in control of their Dragon capsule, overseen by SpaceX teams on the ground. \nThe Dragon is not going anywhere near the ISS. It's on a \"free flight\" to a target altitude of 575km (360 miles). That's about 150km above the orbiting laboratory, and roughly the height from where the Hubble Space Telescope views the cosmos.\nEven if they don't have a destination as such, the foursome will have plenty to keep them occupied. They've taken up scientific experiments to be conducted inside their Dragon capsule, and SpaceX has modified their temporary home to include a big window, which the crew is sure to be using during downtime to wonder at the Earth below.\nThe Inspiration4 venture was purchased from SpaceX by Mr Isaacman, 38, who made his fortune developing systems to process credit card payments. But rather than go on an \"outing with fishing buddies\", he decided, as he saw it, to inject real purpose into the flight.\nSo, he gifted the three adjacent seats to people with inspirational stories.\nThis is perhaps best illustrated in 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. She overcame bone cancer as a child and as an adult has gone back to work for the medical facility that cured her - the St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Mr Isaacman wants to raise $200m for St Jude's work.\nDr Sian Proctor, 51, is a geoscientist and science communicator. She actually came close to being a Nasa astronaut in 2009 but missed out in the final round of selection. Dr Proctor won her seat through her role as an artist and by demonstrating her entrepreneurial skills. She plans to paint while looking out the Dragon's domed window.\nChris Sembroski, 42, is a US Air Force veteran and works as an engineer with aerospace company Lockheed Martin. He'd made a donation to St Jude that also entered him into a lottery draw for the fourth position in the crew.\nMr Sembroski didn't win the lottery - but a friend did, and asked him to take the place.\nSpaceX and Inspiration4 have described Wednesday's launch as the first \"all-civilian mission to orbit\". That depends very much on your definition of \"civilian\". The first man to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, was technically a civilian, having resigned his Navy commission in 1960, nine years before Apollo 11.\nBut there's no doubting the Dragon flight commanded by Mr Isaacman has significance.\nSpace activity - even human spaceflight - is becoming ever more commercial, and the idea that people can go to orbit outside of the purview of the major national space agencies will increasingly look normal.\nThe 2000s saw several super-wealthy individuals spend a fortnight on the ISS. That particular era of space tourism ended in 2009 when spare seats on Russian rockets were bought up for the exclusive use of Nasa astronauts. But this second era looks as though it will be more resilient, simply because there are many more private space companies chasing the business, and this should bring down prices for a wider pool of customers.\nElon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, is intent on making humans \"a multi-planet species\".\nAnd Mr Isaacman regards Inspiration4 as a signpost of where things are going. He was very keen that his Dragon go higher than astronauts usually go. And not since the final shuttle servicing mission of Hubble in 2009 have people been to an altitude above 570km.\n\"We've been going to the space station (420km) for some time, and there's just unbelievable science and research and great contributions that are coming out of there. But if we're going to go to the Moon again, and we're going to go to Mars and beyond, we've got to get a little outside of our comfort zone and take that next step in that direction,\" he said before launch. \"So that was really the rationale (for our choice of altitude).\"\nSome commentators have voiced concern about the collective impact on the Earth's climate of spaceflights like this one.\nSpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket uses highly refined kerosene fuel which produces the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), along with nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to warming. Emissions from rocket launches remain tiny compared with the aviation industry, though they are projected to grow."

      "title": "What's Boris Johnson's reshuffle really all about?",
      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Cabinet reshuffles",
      "text": "\"This is a mad way to run the country,\" confessed a member of the government.\nWhether prime ministers wield sharp knives or attack with blunt spoons, reshuffle days like this are indeed a strange mixture of bravado and farce.\nBravado when, earlier, one cabinet minister told me, \"I think I'm OK,\" as, ashen-faced, looking nauseous and clammy, they were en route to see the prime minister before promptly being sacked.\nAnd farce when, as legend has it, on several occasions, would-be ministers end up jobless, because the post-it notes with their name on fell off the board. Forgotten, their career plunged to the floor too. \nThe way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: \"Is it on?\" And inhabitants of the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. \nBut, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. \nAnd Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet. The most significant switch came in one of the chunkiest jobs of all.\nRemoving the foreign secretary is a big deal. Dominic Raab's always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected, suggesting he fought his move pretty hard. Sources suggest he managed to wangle the ill-defined title of deputy prime minister out of Mr Johnson.\nBeing justice secretary, running prisons, courts, and the legal system, is of course a huge job. Downing Street insists it's not a demotion, and that it doesn't want this move to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, like a debacle in Afghanistan.\nBut even with the DPM bauble, Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government.\nThere are some other slightly puzzling aspects. Steve Barclay was, until the reshuffle, chief secretary to the Treasury, wielding the calculator on what is a hugely important Spending Review, when cash for departments for the next few years is fixed. That review is coming in just a few weeks' time, so you might wonder at the wisdom of moving Mr Barclay right now.\nHe's being replaced by Simon Clarke, a previous inhabitant of a Treasury role, a strong supporter of Mr Johnson and North East MP. He's also, at 6ft 7ins, around a foot taller than his new boss in Number 11 - cue the inevitable jokes about Number 10 wanting to make the chancellor feel small.\nIn a similar vein Anne-Marie Trevelyan, also a strong Johnson backer, returns to cabinet as trade secretary. Irrespective of the merit of her move to that department, Ms Trevelyan had been part of the government's team preparing for COP26, a major international event that starts in about 50 days. If it's a true priority, unpicking a part of the team right now may raise a few eyebrows. \nThere are many more jobs to be allocated, more intrigue to come when middle-ranking and junior ministers get their P45s or offers. But the shape of the cabinet itself is clear.\nWhat's harder to divine is any one strong political ideology, or any radical guiding idea. Certainly, politicians popular with the Tory party like Truss seem to have prospered. Loyalty to the prime minister himself seems to have been rewarded.\nBut it's not a Brexit cabinet, or a small-state cabinet, or to use Tory verbiage, a \"one-nation\" cabinet for those more in the middle.\nIt's a Johnson cabinet, with no particular bent towards any one faction or tribe. For some of his backers, that is one of Mr Johnson's attributes - he's not wedded to principle, but staying on top. For other Tories, that's rather the problem - with no one strong ideology other than a desire to win, it begs the question of what it's all really for.\nFor Downing Street, though, this is a day for the doers. After the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done.\nWhether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case.\nNearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister. And while the shuffling of his cabinet pack has passed, so far largely without incident, there is no doubt about the scale of the challenge, individual and collective, that they face. "

      "tags": "Youth and disability,Disability",
      "text": "For mum Princess Bell, the one time each week her children spend together is very special.\nBut the siblings don't live separately. They're in the same house - but they can't spend more time together because a combination of their disabilities and unsuitable accommodation means they have to stay on different floors.\nThey are one of the 4,100 families who responded to a survey by the charity Contact surveyed in June and July of this year.\nParents of disabled children reported worries that inappropriate housing was having a negative impact on their health.\nMore than 40% who took part in the poll said their home didn't meet their child's needs.\nSpeaking to BBC Newsnight, some parents even said they struggled to even get their children in and out of their property.\nPrincess lives in temporary accommodation in south London with her 13-year-old son, 11-year-old daughter and a baby.\nThe older children both have a rare genetic condition that means they are unable to walk or speak and have breathing problems. \nThe family are living in a three-bedroom house - every inch of each room packed with specialist equipment - while they wait for the council to find them a new home. \nDue to a lack of space, the two older children with disabilities sleep on different floors. Once a week, Princess takes one child up to see the other. She says she doesn't feel safe doing this more often. \n\"They've always been very, very close. And they're in the same house and they don't see each other... so when it's then time for her to go back to her room, she cries and they lay together on the mat entwined because they're best friends and they don't see each other and they're in the same house. And it is heartbreaking to see that because we're already housebound.\"\nLambeth Council said it had been working hard to meet the very complex housing medical needs of the family and apologised for delays in resolving the issue.\n\"However, we face a real shortage of available homes,\" said a spokesman.\nData from Contact's survey, shared with Newsnight, suggested 27% of respondents said they felt their home made their child's condition worse or put them at risk.\n\"We were really taken aback by the proportion of families who weren't only saying that the housing was unsuitable, but that their home environment was actually having a negative effect on their child's disability,\" said Amanda Batten, Contact's chief executive. \n\"There's no doubt that poor and inappropriate housing is having a hugely detrimental impact on the health and the lives of many disabled children and their families,\" she said.  \nWhile the majority of the respondents lived in private or privately rented accommodation, 31% lived in social housing. \nThe government has been consulting on improving access to accessible housing. The report is due in December. \nCampaigners say this is a vital opportunity to drive up standards of housing and potentially transform the lives of some of our most vulnerable children. \nAmanda Batten says there's a window of opportunity for change. \n\"Fundamentally, the problem is that there is not enough social and affordable housing full stop and, in particular, not enough social and affordable housing that is accessible to disabled children and their families,\" she says. \nAnd the lack of housing is costly to other sectors. \nThe government's own data shows that delayed hospital discharges cost the NHS about \u00a3285m per year and the evidence suggests that up to 14% of these delayed discharges could be reduced by accessible housing.\nBertille Chuipa's son Anderson, now 16, had a head injury while go-karting. He uses a wheelchair and needs a lot of space for his medical equipment. \nBertille gave up her job as a teacher and translator in Manchester to look after Anderson. \"He needs somebody all the time at his side to keep an eye on him,\" she says. \nAnderson's former home wasn't suitable for a wheelchair and he spent more than a year in hospital while the council looked for an appropriate property. \nTara Parker, a paediatric nurse who works for the charity WellChild, says its research shows Anderson's experience isn't that unusual.\n\"Some young people will be delayed in an intensive care unit for approximately 12 months. And the cost of that is eye-watering. You could have bought and built them three houses by the time you've done that,\" she says. \nLocal authority money is available to make improvements to properties, but the charity says it has more than 700 families on its waiting list for property improvements, 90% of whom live in social housing. \nManchester City Council said that occupational therapists searched for some months to find an appropriate home for Anderson due to the size of the wheelchair in question. \nThe family's current bungalow has been extensively adapted. \nAt its starkest, inadequate housing can play a part in the circumstances surrounding a child's death. \nNewsnight has been investigating the reasons behind the deaths of young people, using evidence generated by the country's first national database of child deaths, the National Child Mortality Database, which was published in May. \nPoor housing was identified as a contributing modifiable factor in child deaths in this country. \nIn 2016, Mollie Wells's son Harlie was born with a brain injury and cerebral palsy. Mollie, who lives in Ipswich, was only 17 at the time and was responsible for the majority of his care.\n\"He needed round-the-clock care. He couldn't walk, talk, couldn't sit up,\" she says.\nIn 2017, Harlie and Mollie had to move after her private landlord gave her notice. The council found them a flat but the wheelchair wouldn't fit through the door and had to be left outside in a communal area.\n\"I had to lift him everywhere. I had to do ground lifts. I had to do everything because he had no equipment,\" Mollie says. \nThe lack of space and equipment in the flat meant Mollie couldn't follow his care plan or medical advice properly. \n\"He couldn't do physio, which possibly could have strengthened his legs, his back, his posture,\" she says. \nHarlie's doctors and occupational therapists wrote to the council to say he needed to be rehoused urgently. \n\"They [the council] said that they'd look into it and it went on for two-and-a-half years,\" Mollie says. \nIn October 2019, Harlie died unexpectedly. Mollie found him in his bed. She tried, in vain, to resuscitate him. Harlie was five years old.\nThe conditions surrounding his death fed into an analysis by experts on the national child mortality database.  \nJacquelyn Wood is an NHS child death review nurse who looked at the circumstances around Harlie's death to see what lessons could be learned. \nMs Wood says they looked at the impact that the pressure of being carried throughout the property might have had on his body. \"And I think it's really about asking that question. Does that then affect kind of life expectancy and mortality?\" \nShe says Mollie fought to give Harlie the best care that she could afford and could access. \n\"When it came down to housing, there wasn't anything else that she could do,\" she says. \n\"It really isn't an isolated incident.\n\"Ultimately the problem we have across the whole of the UK is there isn't enough suitable disabled housing to meet the needs of these cohorts of children,\" she says. \nMollie also believes his housing affected Harlie. \"He wasn't given a chance,\" she says. \nIpswich Borough Council said it had provided the best accommodation it could for Harlie Beau-Wells. \nBut \"it was acknowledged by all\u2026 that the property did not meet all of Harlie's needs\". \nIt said it was building a specifically adapted bungalow for the family when Harlie died.\n\"Like all councils with housing, we have a large shortfall of suitable adapted property to meet demand from people with needs due to their disability,\" a spokesman said.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told Newsnight:  \"We recognise the importance of improving accessibility, and the number of accessible homes has nearly doubled in a decade. \n\"Since 2010, we have invested over \u00a34bn into the Disabled Facilities Grant, providing adaptations to almost 450,000 homes, including stairlifts, wet rooms and ramps. Councils are best placed to decide how much accessible housing is needed in their area, and set these requirements in their local plans.\"\nWatch the full report on BBC Newsnight on BBC Two or catch-up later on iPlayer."

It was the first time a serving royal had spoken so frankly about life in the Royal Family. \nMillions of viewers heard her speak about an unhappy marriage to the Prince of Wales, their affairs and her bulimia.\nIn a statement, Scotland Yard said: \"In March 2021, the Metropolitan Police Service determined it was not appropriate to begin a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful activity in connection with a documentary broadcast in 1995.\n\"Following the publication of Lord Dyson's report in May, specialist detectives assessed its contents and looked carefully at the law - once again obtaining independent legal advice from Treasury Counsel as well as consulting the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\"As a result, the MPS has not identified evidence of activity that constituted a criminal offence and will therefore be taking no further action.\"\nThe BBC has issued what it described as a \"full and unconditional apology\" for the way the interview was obtained.\nTim Davie, the BBC director general, said in May: \"While today's BBC has significantly better processes and procedures, those that existed at the time should have prevented the interview being secured in this way.\""

      "text": "Apple has announced its new iPhone 13, which can film \"portrait mode\" videos with a depth of field effect.\nThe new cinematic mode \"anticipates when someone is about to enter the frame\" and shifts focus to them, Apple said - something known as \"pull focus\".\nIt is the only smartphone that lets users edit this effect after shooting, Apple boss Tim Cook said.\nHowever, most other features on the new model were incremental updates over previous versions.\nThe event was also overshadowed by news of a new security flaw in Apple devices which could expose users' messages.\nApple released a security patch on Monday for the previously-unknown flaw, which could let attackers access its iMessage service without the user clicking on a malicious link or file.\nThe new iPhone includes a faster A15 chip, a brighter display, and a battery life of up to 2.5 hours longer, and comes in new colours including pink, blue, midnight, starlight and red.\nThe new iPhone will also have up to 500GB of storage with its lowest available storage rising to 128GB from previous models' 64GB.\nApple was also keen to stress its green credentials, saying the phone used many recycled materials - including antenna lines made from plastic water bottles, it said.\nThe launch comes as buyers are keeping their phones for longer before upgrading. Investment firm Wedbush Securities estimates that around 250 million iPhone users have not upgraded their phones in 3.5 years.\nPaolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said many have yet to experience modern features.\n\"While many will see some upgrades as incremental, there are millions of users who have yet to upgrade to 5G. Therefore, this so called 'supercycle' moment is still relevant,\" he said.\nThe 5G connectivity is only available on the iPhone 12, released last year, and the newly-announced models.\nIn the second quarter of this year, Apple shipped 25.9% of all 5G handsets in the world, according to analyst firm IDC.\nMarta Pinto, senior research manager at IDC, said: \"With the new portfolio, this number will grow and consolidate the dominance of Apple in that space.\"\n\"Not being the first [to launch a 5G phone] paid off.\"\nApple also launched an iPhone 13 Mini, Pro and Pro Max. \nThe iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max contain three cameras and what Apple calls \"its most advanced camera system yet\".\nIts premium models include a Super Retina XDR display and ProMotion - which delivers adaptive refresh rates of up to 120Hz.\nThis allows for smoother scrolling, animations, and gameplay.\nThe iPhone 13 mini starts at \u00a3679, with the iPhone 13 starting at \u00a3779. The iPhone 13 Pro starts at \u00a3949, and the larger Pro Max \u00a31,049.\nApple has a reputation for innovation. But if this launch was anything to go by, that reputation is outdated.\nNothing especially new or visionary was announced here. The updates to its iPhone, Apple Watch and iPad feel conservative, uninspired, safe. \nBarring a new improved cinematic camera (which to be fair looks good) these are iterative updates. Even the presentation, though slick, had no particularly memorable or creative moments. Rumours of more interesting updates, iPhones with satellite capabilities for example, turned out to be false. \n\"What a spectacular set of announcements,\" said Apple's Tim Cook - referring to products like the new iPhone 13, which looks almost identical to the iPhone 12. \nSome had speculated that maybe Apple would stop numbering the new iPhone (13 being an unlucky number for some) - but no such radical move. \nStill, Apple will sell a lot of these gadgets - they always do.\nBut look past the bombastic marketing and this was a pretty uninteresting launch - particularly from a company that likes to describe itself as innovative. \nApple also announced a new version of its wearable Apple Watch. \nThe Series 7 brings the first redesign to the watch since 2018, and will be slightly larger. \nThe new size can fit almost 50% more text on screen, and has a keyboard to input text. It is also dust-resistant for the first time. \nApple Watch iOS 8 will also be able to automatically detect bicycle rides, including e-bikes.\nBut manufacture of the Apple Watch Series 7 could face production delays, reported Bloomberg.\nApple said the new model would be available \"later this fall\", whereas other products such as the new iPad and iPhone - announced at the same event - are available from next week.\nApple accounts for 47% of the global smartwatch market, according to research from CCS Insight.\n\"At first glance the latest Apple Watch is another iterative update, but the larger screen allowing bigger virtual buttons and a full qwerty keyboard should certainly improve usability,\" Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight said.\nHe said he had expected to see a longer battery life, as \"owners continue to clamour for smartwatches to last longer\", but that was not announced - even if faster charging was.\n\"Despite these concerns, the Apple Watch continues to sell in record numbers and dominates the smartwatch market by a distance,\" he added.\nApple has also launched a new version of its iPad. Tim Cook said its iPad sales had grown by 40% in the past year.\nIt will be powered by the A13 chip, with 20% faster performance from its previous iteration. Apple said this was up to \"three times faster than the Chromebook\".\nThose cheap styles of laptop exploded in popularity last year as schools shut down during the pandemic.\nThe new iPad starts at $329 (\u00a3319) and has a discounted price of $299 for schools.\nA new iPad mini was also launched, with USB-C functionality, Apple pencil support and no home button - using a lock button on the top for Touch ID instead. Prices start at \u00a3479."

      "tags": "Economics,Inflation,UK economy,Bank of England",
      "text": "Price rises have seen the biggest jump since records began in 1997 as the economy continued to reopen.\nOfficial figures show that the increase in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, hit 3.2% in the year to August.\nHigher prices in restaurants and for recreation and food were behind the spike, up from 2% the previous month.\nThe cost of living rose less rapidly in July because of lower clothing and footwear prices.\nHowever, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) urged caution in reading too much into August's price increases, which it described as \"temporary\".\nEating and drinking out cost more last month in comparison with August last year, when the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme was running and diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals up to \u00a310 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.\nAt the same time, business owners in the hospitality and tourism sectors received a VAT discount, designed to help some of the industries worst hit by the pandemic.\nJonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: \"August saw the largest rise in annual inflation month-on-month since the series was introduced almost a quarter of a century ago.\n\"However, much of this is likely to be temporary, as last year, restaurant and cafe prices fell substantially due to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, while this year, prices rose.\"\nIn August this year, transport costs also increased. \nAverage petrol prices stood at 134.6 pence a litre, compared with 113.1 pence a litre a year earlier, when travel was reduced under lockdown restrictions.\nUsed car prices were also partly to blame for price rises - they increased by 4.9% in just one month. Since April, they have gone up by more than 18% amid a shortage of new models.\nHow will price rises affect you? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk\nSimply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a \u00a31 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%.\nIt applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted.\nYou may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money.\nRead more about inflation here.\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that price rises seen in August were \"almost unavoidable\" because of the discounts available in 2020.\n\"Inflation, which is a year-on-year comparison, was always going to look strong compared to last year,\" she said.\n\"Some of that rise reflected genuine factors too. In particular, we are now seeing the effects of higher global shipping costs and shortages of staff driving up food price inflation.\"\nShe also expects, however, that the cost of living could continue to increase rapidly, with inflation exceeding 4% by November.\nThe latest official figures will add to the debate about whether interest rates need to go up to curb consumer spending and moderate prices.\nInflation now exceeds the Bank of England's 2% target, aimed at keeping cost increases steady.\nBut Capital Economics points out that inflation is likely to fall back almost as sharply next year and that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is not expected to raise interest rates until 2023.\nThe central bank's deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, insisted in July that it would not stop its efforts to boost the economy, despite the forecast of higher costs.\n\"While we know [inflation] is going to go further over the next few months, I'm not convinced that the current inflation in retail goods prices should in and of itself mean higher inflation 18 to 24 months ahead, the horizon more relevant for monetary policy,\" he said.\nMost of the inflation in goods prices was down to oil price rises and supply chain issues, he said, which was likely to \"fall away\" in the early part of 2022.\nBut given that Wednesday's latest figures breach the Bank's target, it must now write to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to explain what it will do to ensure that price prices are steady in future.\nJames Lyon Shaw, who owns the Greene Oak Pub in Windsor, Berkshire, told the BBC the rise in inflation had to be taken in context and that businesses, including his own, needed to \"ride the storm\".\nHe is paying his employees 10 to 20% more an hour compared to last year due to the wider workforce shortages.\nHe said increases in food prices depended on where restaurants and pubs source their food, with rises in haulage and logistics costs hitting profit margins.\n\"We just have got to get through, you've got to be pragmatic, get on and adapt your business.\"\nHe questioned if people had enjoyed access to \"cheap food\" for too long and whether there needed to be a shift in attitudes to pay for more sustainably produced products.\nYael\u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, added: \"Higher inflation will inevitably raise questions for the Bank of England on the timing of tightening monetary policy and interest rate hikes to contain inflationary risks further down the line.\"\nShe added: \"However, any tightening now risks scuppering the recovery before it has a chance to take hold, so a delay until the middle of next year is likely.\"\nUK businesses are reporting difficulties in sourcing goods and recruiting staff because of disruption caused by the pandemic and problems such as HGV driver shortages, exacerbated by Brexit.\nAccording to a survey of 2,000 people by Retail Economics, more than half of consumers are concerned about rising costs as a result.\nThe market research firm said on Wednesday that worries about the cost of living had reached their highest point in more than five years.\nA record monthly spike in inflation, up to levels not seen for more than eight years, reflects a spluttering restart to the economy. Demand has rebounded, but the supply of goods and labour has not. \nIn August, there were one-off factors from the discounts and support measures last year. \nAs inflation is above 3%, the Bank of England governor has to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why. Stripping out the impact of Eat Out to Help Out last year would have meant this was not necessary.\nThis inflation number will go higher still in the coming months because of rising home energy bills. Alongside the rise in petrol prices and frankly incredible increase in used car prices, these inflationary pressures are becoming very visible. \nThe maths suggests that inflation could top 4% and then fall just as sharply, as long as there are no further economic shocks. Public perceptions matter significantly in regard to wage settlements for next year.\nWhile the number is high and rising, this is still consistent with a \"transitory\" post-lockdown reopening inflation spike, predicted by the central bank."

      "text": "Female players from Afghanistan's junior national soccer team have crossed the border into Pakistan. \nThe girls had spent the past month in hiding amid fears of a crackdown on women's rights by the Taliban. \nMembers of the women's side flew out of Kabul last month but the youth team were reportedly left stranded as they lacked passports and other documents. \nThirty-two players and their families won visas after the charity \"Football for Peace\" lobbied Pakistan. \nAn official with Pakistan's Football Federation said the group, totalling 81 people, would be housed at the federation's headquarters in the eastern city of Lahore. A further 34 people will arrive on Thursday he said.\nThe  players will remain in Pakistan under tight security for 30 days before applying for asylum in third countries, the official said. \nThe Independent recently revealed that the players had written to Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan to ask for permission to urgently enter the country. \nThe letter claimed that the girls were at risk of \"grave threats\" from the Taliban. \nAfter the fall of Kabul a month ago, players were warned by the national team's former captain, Khalida Popal, to delete pictures of themselves playing on social media and to burn their kits to protect themselves from potential reprisals from the new regime. \nLast week the deputy head of the Taliban's cultural commission, Ahmadullah Wasiq, cast doubt over the future of women's sport in the country when he said it was considered neither appropriate nor necessary in response to a question about the fate of the women's cricket team. \n\"In cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered. Islam does not allow women to be seen like this,\" Wasiq said.\n\"It is the media era, and there will be photos and videos, and then people watch it. Islam and the Islamic Emirate [Afghanistan] do not allow women to play cricket or play the kind of sports where they get exposed.\"\nWomen were barred from participating in sports during the Taliban's last spell in power from 1996-2001. \nTheir departure is part of a wider exodus of Afghan sports and cultural stars amid fears of a crackdown on women's rights following the takeover of the country by the Taliban after foreign forces withdrew. \nAs well as the departure of the women's football teams, the country's biggest pop singer Aryana Sayeed and the famed film director Sahraa Karimi both left during the evacuation last month."

      "tags": "Royal Navy,UK defence spending,HMS Queen Elizabeth",
      "text": "Britain is about to embark on a world tour - in the shape of the Royal Navy's aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by a fleet of warships. \nThe Royal Navy says it will be the most powerful UK naval deployment in a generation.\nThe government sees the fleet, named the Carrier Strike Group, as a potent symbol of \"Global Britain\" - and as proof of Boris Johnson's promise to restore the Royal Navy as Europe's foremost naval power and end what he called an \"era of retreat\".\nThe prime minister spent this morning on board HMS Queen Elizabeth in Portsmouth naval base, ahead of its maiden operational deployment.\nBut is this world tour more than a symbol of national virility or a flag-waving exercise?\nAnd what's the point of sailing halfway across the world?\nOver the next 28 weeks the Carrier Strike Group will cover 26,000 miles - further than the distance around the world at the equator.\nHMS Queen Elizabeth will first sail into the Mediterranean. From there, she is planning to launch her F-35 jets to conduct airstrikes over Iraq against the group known as Islamic State.\nIt would be the carrier's first combat operation - even though the RAF has been doing the same mission for the past seven years from its land base on Cyprus. \nPerhaps more controversial is the decision to then go east. The strike group will sail through the Suez Canal, out to the Indian Ocean and on to the Philippine Sea.\nHMS Queen Elizabeth is scheduled to make a number of port stops along way - including Oman, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.\nLike the US, Britain is responding to the rise of China. But unlike America, Britain has less influence and fewer resources to match.\nFor UK foreign policy it means a more modest \"tilt\" to Asia rather than the US \"pivot\".\nHMS Queen Elizabeth will be accompanied by two Royal Navy Frigates, two Destroyers, two supply ships and -  beneath the surface - an Astute Class Submarine.\nAn American Navy Destroyer and a Dutch Frigate will be part of the strike group.\nThere'll also be more American jets on board the carrier: 10 US Marine Corps F-35s compared to the Britain's eight.\nThe government insists the addition of allies is a sign of strength rather than weakness. But it is also an indication that Britain's Armed Forces are now smaller and can do less on their own. \nThe strike group will sail through the South China Sea where China has been expanding its claim to territorial waters.\nBut Defence Secretary Ben Wallace insists Britain is not looking for a \"confrontation\". Instead, he says the carrier group will exercise its right to freedom of navigation.\nSo do not expect a repeat of what happened in 2018 when another Royal Navy Warship, HMS Albion, deliberately sailed close to the disputed Paracel Islands, prompting an angry response from Beijing. \nThese sensitivities highlight ambiguities in Britain's policy towards China. The British government says it still wants a constructive relationship - not least on trade.\nTwo former defence chiefs have questioned the decision to send the strike group east.\nLord Nicholas Houghton recently told MPs that \"it was not necessarily the best way of seeking an accommodation\" with Beijing, while Lord David Richards said Britain should be focusing its attention closer to home \"on Nato and the Euro-Atlantic area\". \nBut the deployment has as much to do with boosting trade and strengthening diplomatic ties in the region.\nAt sea it'll be conducting military exercises with allies, including Japan, Australia and the US. During her port visits, HMS Queen Elizabeth will become a giant floating trade and diplomatic mission.\nIn the words of the head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Tony Radakin: \"Navies follow trade and trade follows navies.\"\nHe says this deployment shows the Navy is \"flying the flag for Britain and carrying forward the prime minister's vision\" of a \"Global Britain\".\nSome argue there might have been better ways of sending a strong message to China.\nDr Peter Roberts, director of military sciences at RUSI, a defence and security think tank, says that instead of what he calls \"a predictable, long and slow deployment\", the Royal Navy could have dispatched two of its hunter-killer submarines.\nIf they set off north, under the Arctic ice, and then popped up in the Pacific, he suggests, that would have had a greater impact on challenging both Russian and Chinese behaviour.\nThe former national security adviser, Lord Peter Ricketts, believes it still makes sense to send the carrier east as a \"symbol of working closely with allies\".\nThis is not least to get a return on the significant investment in the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers. But, he adds, \"this is a piece of diplomatic theatre, not a military strategy\". "

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's winter Covid plan comes amid a warning that there could be a large jump in hospital admissions in England. Government scientists say they could reach 2,000 to 7,000 per day next month if restrictions aren't tightened. The number currently stands at about 1,000. They say a \"relatively light set of measures\" could curb infections but Mr Johnson's plan only imposes restrictions such as face coverings if pressure on the NHS becomes unsustainable. He hopes increasing vaccinations means fresh restrictions can be avoided.\nAs the economy continued to reopen, UK inflation hit 3.2% in the year to August making it the biggest increase since records began in 1997. It's been driven by higher food costs - with eating and drinking out costing more last month in comparison with August last year, when the \"Eat Out to Help Out\" scheme was running. The Office for National Statistics describes the price increase as \"temporary\".\nAlthough the government's going to try to rely almost entirely on the vaccines to protect people from Covid this winter, there is a Plan B if pressure on the NHS is unsustainable. It's been dubbed \"lockdown lite\" and includes face coverings, Covid passports and working from home. So what are the chances of England avoiding another lockdown? Our health correspondent Nick Triggle has investigated.\nAlthough there is no official data on absence due to school anxiety, parents groups are warning of a \"tsunami\" of crippling cases. They claim it will lead to persistent and debilitating absence from education - and one lawyer says the pandemic has made an \"unprecedented crisis\" even worse. The government says it's investing \u00a317m in school mental health.

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All children aged 12 to 15 in the UK are to be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab. \nIt follows a recommendation from the UK's four chief medical officers that vaccinating them would help reduce disruption to their schooling this winter and benefit those growing up in the poorest areas.\nThe UK's advisory body, the JCVI, said there was only a marginal benefit to vaccinating adolescents on health grounds alone and stopped short of recommending it - but it did advise vaccinating children over 12 with specific underlying health conditions who are at greater risk.\nThere is general agreement that this was a really tricky call to make.\nStrong opinions have been expressed on all sides, by scientists, doctors, teachers and parents alike.\nThe JCVI focused squarely on the health benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on the impact to their schooling or other people.\nChildren's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. Deaths among healthy children are extremely rare - most have life-limiting health conditions.\nThat means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. \nHowever, a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has made that calculation a lot more complicated. \nPaul Hunter, professor of medicine at University of East Anglia, says there's been intense pressure on the JCVI and he can understand why they have been cautious.\nResearch on millions of people who've had the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) shows there's a tiny risk of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, which is more common in young people - and particularly younger boys - after a second dose. It can cause chest pain and a pounding heart, but symptoms usually clear up in days. \nNo vaccine or drug is ever 100% safe, and data from the US shows the numbers of children affected are very small. \nFor every million Pfizer second doses given to 12-17-year-old-boys, around 60 had the condition (compared with eight in a million among girls). The rates in this age group are higher than in older ones - and it's why only one dose for 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK has been recommended, for now.\nBut being infected with Covid has consequences for teenagers' health too - including their hearts - so how big is that risk?\nA recent US study suggests having Covid-19 could be six times more likely to trigger myocarditis in young men than the vaccine, with a rate of about 450 per million infections. \nHowever, the long-term effects of myocarditis after vaccination and the wider health impacts of Covid in children in the short and long-term are still not known.\nJust because countries have access to the same data doesn't mean they will reach the same standpoint on this finely-balanced question.\nCountries are influenced by a variety of different factors - from vaccination rates in adults to political pressure and fears over another wave of Covid. \nThe US, for example, has vaccinated more than 10 million over-12s and concluded that the benefits of protecting against Covid illness and its complications  \"far outweigh\" the small potential risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. \nFrance, Italy, Canada, Spain, Israel and many other countries are all vaccinating this age group for the same reason.\nVaccinating secondary-school-age children wouldn't stop the virus circulating in schools or in society more generally.\n\"Even if 100% of people in the UK were vaccinated - and their pets - the virus would still spread,\" Prof Hunter says.\nBut vaccines for teens are still likely to reduce infections in that age group, and could help keep more children in school over winter, although it's unclear how much it would limit wider community spread.\nThe government's scientific advisers recently said that 40-70% of children in secondary schools may already have been infected by the start of term, meaning many have some in-built protection.\nThen there's the question of whether encouraging more over-18s to have a vaccine would be a more productive aim, given their greater risk, with more than 12% still reluctant to even have one? \nIn the end it comes down to choice, and a fine balance between a very rare side-effect from the vaccine, and a very low risk to children themselves from Covid."

These are the ironies of life.\"\nHe added that almost everyone at the Vatican was now vaccinated, and that they were \"studying how to help\" those who were hesitant.\n\"As children [we were vaccinated] for measles, polio - all the children were vaccinated and no one said anything,\" he exclaimed.\nBut the pontiff did recognise that some vaccine debates could increase fears and uncertainty about the jabs, to which he said \"we should clarify things and speak calmly\".\nSome religious leaders, especially in the United States, believe Catholics should be allowed to claim conscientious objection to the Covid-19 vaccines on religious grounds. However Pope Francis has disagreed with this, and said the vaccines were \"morally acceptable\" and could be used \"in good conscience\"."

      "text": "Next month's \u00a320-a-week cut in universal credit risks pushing working people into poverty, a senior Conservative MP has warned.\nThe government says the \u00a320 top-up was always a temporary measure to help people through the pandemic.\nBut former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb says the government risks repeating the mistake it made in 2015 when it froze working age benefits.\nLabour is calling for the cut to be axed during a debate in the Commons. \nIts leader, Sir Keir Starmer, attacked the government during Prime Minister's Questions, saying it was \"clobbering working people\" with the cut, coupled with the rise in National Insurance to cover the new health and social care tax. \nBut Boris Johnson said he wanted to \"encourage high wages and high skills\", and the government was focused on supporting people into work with better pay. \nLabour plans to force a vote on the cut on Wednesday, but the result will not be binding on the government.\nMr Crabb has joined a growing number of Tory MPs - including five other former work and pensions secretaries - who are against removing the \u00a320 uplift. \n\"I was part of the team that took that decision to freeze benefits - and wages didn't go up in the way that we believed they would. Levels of poverty increased,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We should seek to learn the lessons of that rather than just repeat it.\" \nThe-then Chancellor George Osborne said low-paid workers would be better off despite the four-year freeze, thanks to tax changes and increases in the minimum wage.\nBut Mr Crabb - who was Welsh Secretary at the time - said it had amounted to a \"real-terms cut\" in benefits, which had been \"a contributing factor to the rise of in-work poverty\".\nEmployment reached record levels before the pandemic, but the UK also saw a significant increase in the number of households with at least one adult in paid work falling into relative poverty, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nThere are 5.9 million people receiving universal credit payments across the country, according to the latest government figures - almost double the three million making claims before the pandemic.\nWhile some are seeking jobs and others are unable to work, 40% of claimants are already employed.\nThe Resolution Foundation think tank said workers would have to put in an nine extra hours a week to make up for the loss of \u00a320, once pension contributions, childcare and travel costs had been taken into account.\nMr Crabb is not the only Conservative calling for the \u00a320 universal credit top-up - which will disappear on 6 October - to be made permanent.\nWest Midlands metro mayor Andy Street told the i paper he was \"very concerned\" about the potential impact of the cut - and Amber Valley MP Nigel Mills said the government \"would be in trouble\" if there was a Commons vote on it.\nOpening Labour's Opposition Day debate in the Commons, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said removing the top-up would be \"the single biggest overnight cut in the history of the welfare state\", affecting one in 14 British workers.\nHe added: \"The human cost of taking this money away cannot be overstated - \u00a320 might not seem like much to some people but it's the difference between having food in the fridge and still being able to put the heating on, or being able to get their kids new school shoes without worrying how you'll pay for it.\"\nBut his government counterpart, Therese Coffey - who was criticised over comments on the cut earlier this week - said more people were getting back into work under the Conservative government, and there was \"a record number\" of vacancies for those seeking jobs.\n\"It was right that we took prompt and decisive action to support our nation during this challenging time,\" she added. \"[But] this was a temporary uplift recognising the financial impact of people newly unemployed so that it would be somewhat of a cushion in regards to their financial circumstances.\n\"As our economy continues to recover, it is right that we are investing in jobs and skills to boost pay, prospects and prosperity for people right across the UK as part of our plan to level up and build back better.\"\nCatherine, a mature student training to be a primary school teacher, is a client of Pembrokeshire Action to Combat Hardship, a food bank in Stephen Crabb's constituency.\nShe says the prospect of losing so much weekly income is \"quite scary\". \n\"Do we put the heating on, or do we put a jumper on? Can we manage to make this week's shopping to stretch a bit further?\"\nCatherine is in receipt of student finance as well as universal credit, as a single parent. She says the \"stereotype\" that people on benefits are not making an effort, is \"absolute rubbish\". \n\"I'm doing everything I can to better my prospects for myself and my family. I've paid into the system in the past I will pay into the system in the future.\" \nThe number of people claiming universal credit has nearly doubled since the start of the pandemic, which Mr Crabb says undermines a key government argument for axing the \u00a320 top-up.\n\"Almost half of people on universal credit have only known this level of benefit. The idea of this being people going back to a level of benefit they were used to - that's completely false.\"\nHe suggested that introducing the \u00a320 top-up was effectively a \"recognition that the current level of working age benefits was too low\". \nAnd with 40% of people on universal credit using it to top up their wages, he feared the \"very sharp\" cut would hurt \"people who are trying to do the so-called 'right thing' by going out to work\". \n\"As a Conservative that is deeply problematic for me,\" the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP added.\nA government spokesperson said the universal credit uplift had achieved its aim of helping claimants through the \"economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic\".\n\"Universal credit will continue to provide vital support for those both in and out of work and it's right that the government should focus on our Plan for Jobs, supporting people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more,\" the spokesperson added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Thursday morning.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid has said pressure on the NHS will be the main factor that could lead to Covid restrictions in England being tightened this winter. There was not a \"single trigger\" for the government moving to its \"Plan B\" measures, he said, but how the NHS was coping was the one to watch. The government's plan B includes the use of vaccine passports and mandatory face masks. Meanwhile, government scientists have warned there could be a large jump in Covid hospital admissions if restrictions are not tightened soon.\nThe prime minister is carrying out a long-awaited shake-up of his top team with plans to put in place a \"strong and united\" Cabinet following the turbulence of the pandemic. (You can follow the latest here.) Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was among those to get the sack. \"We can't pretend we are sorry that he's gone,\" said teachers' union leader Kevin Courtney. As our education correspondent Sean Coughlan writes, Mr Williamson became the political fall guy for the pandemic, often the lightning rod for irritation and exasperation from families facing disruption and seeing U-turns on schools and exams.\nScotland's health secretary Humza Yousaf has been warned he could put lives at risk after urging people to \"think twice\" before calling an ambulance. Following reports that the health service in Scotland is under pressure like never before, he said people should only call for an ambulance when it is \"absolutely critical\". Opposition parties called his comments reckless.\nLast year, Christmas was a damp squib for many as Covid restrictions stopped us meeting up with family and friends. With fewer restrictions expected this year, retailers are hoping for a bumper festive period. And the John Lewis Partnership has gone all out, with plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers in its UK John Lewis and Waitrose stores and distribution centres. \"We know that as the first Christmas after lockdown, customers will want to make it really special,\" said Nikki Humphrey from John Lewis. The move comes after the number of job vacancies in the UK surged past one million for the first time. Read here for more about which sectors are looking for workers and how to find a new job. \nIt wasn't the usual stuff of Downing Street press conferences, so when rapper Nicki Minaj and her talk of vaccine and impotence links cropped up, there was always going to be some sort of fallout. Newsbeat colleagues kept an eye on the story that ended up involving Prof Chris Whitty, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Piers Morgan, the health secretary and Nicki Minaj - again (doing a very funny British accent). Read all about it here.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWith all the talk of the government's Plan B, which includes greater use of face coverings, Covid passports and working from home orders - or a \"lockdown lite\" as it has been dubbed, what are the chances of avoiding this?

      "tags": "Shipbuilding,Ferries,Isle of Islay,CalMac,Port Glasgow",
      "text": "The nationalised Ferguson shipyard has missed out on an order to build two new CalMac ferries. \nThe Inverclyde yard was among 11 bidders for the order to replace ships on the Islay route, but failed to make the shortlist. \nThe four shipyards which will now submit detailed tenders are based in Poland, Romania and Turkey. \nFerguson Marine said it was \"disappointed\" but would learn lessons as it looks for future work. \nThe new ships will be the first major order by CMAL, which procures vessels for CalMac, since Glen Sannox and an as-yet unnamed ship, known as Hull 802, which are still under construction at the Ferguson shipyard. \nGlen Sannox is currently due to be delivered in the second half of next year, more than four years late, with the two ships costing the taxpayer more than double the original contract price. \nProblems with the order dragged the yard back into administration in 2019 and since then it has been wholly-owned by the Scottish government, which also owns CMAL and CalMac.\nThe new order for the Islay route will be for two 94.8m long vessels to replace MV Hebridean Isles - which is 36 years old - and MV Finlaggan which was launched in 2011. MV Finlaggan would then be redeployed to a different route. \nThe new ships will be larger but more fuel efficient than the current vessels and will have greater vehicle capacity. \nUnlike the order for Glen Sannox and Hull 802, they will not use liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the engines but will instead have diesel-electric propulsion systems, making use of lithium batteries where possible, for instance when manoeuvring in port. \nThe four shortlisted shipyards which will now submit more detailed bids are Damen Shipyard in Romania, Remontowa Shipbuilding in Poland, and Turkish shipyards Sefine Denizcilik Tersanecilik Turizm, and Cemre Marin Endustri.  \nJim Anderson, director of vessels at CMAL, said: \"We received interest from many shipyards across the world, and carried out robust assessment of their technical and financial suitability to take on this project. \n\"Four shipyards scored the highest across both criteria and have now been issued an ITT (invitation to tender) for the contract. \n\"This stage of the procurement process will take around six months, and we hope to award the contract to the winning shipyard at the end of March 2022.\"\nThe GMB union, which represents the Ferguson workforce, said Scotland's commercial shipbuilding sector was \"mirroring the failure of our offshore wind sector\".\n\"Ferries paid for by the public purse will be manufactured in Eastern Europe or Turkey, that's jobs and value that should be coming to Inverclyde going abroad,\" said GMB Scotland organiser Gary Cook.\nScottish Labour's transport spokesman Neil Bibby said it was \"hammer blow\" to Scottish shipbulding, adding: \"This announcement means more jobs and more money going overseas at a time of economic crisis.\"\nScottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson said: \"It's humiliating for the SNP that ships which could be built in the west coast of Scotland are instead going to be welded together in Eastern Europe.\n\"The SNP let down our shipyards so badly that they are missing out on work to Romania, Poland and Turkey.\"\nFor the Liberal Democrats, economy spokesman Willie Rennie said: \"It is a damning indictment of the Scottish government's utter failure to secure high tech, high wage jobs that there is no shipyard in Scotland on this shortlist.\"\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"While it is disappointing that Ferguson Marine have been unsuccessful on this occasion, we are fully committed to supporting the yard to secure a sustainable future, including a pipeline of future work, to help protect jobs and commercial shipbuilding on the Clyde.\"\nFerguson Marine said it had put forward a \"robust bid\" for the new order but it respected CMAL's decision. \nA spokesperson added: \"Scotland's public sector ferries will, of course, continue to be future business targets for the shipyard, but they are not the sole focus. \n\"We believe there is a significant opportunity for contracts and business growth in the build of complex vessels in the 40 to 100m range, which includes offshore patrol vessels and service operation vessels.  \n\"We are actively pursuing opportunities of this nature, which exist in Scotland and around the world, and we remain highly focused on completion of the dual fuel ferry project, which is a top priority.\"\nThe Port Glasgow shipyard has been extensively modernised since it first went into administration in 2014 and was taken over by businessman Jim McColl. Its workforce has risen to more than 450. \nMr McColl and CMAL have blamed each other for problems with the previous ferry order which led to the yard going into administration again five years later. \nThe \"turnaround director\" appointed by the Scottish government, Tim Hair, recently told the BBC that investment was continuing at Ferguson Marine and he was confident the yard would be competitive by the time it wins its next major order.

      "text": "At Afghanistan's border with Uzbekistan a cargo train rolls over a bridge and into the newly created \"Islamic Emirate\". The Taliban's white and black flag flutters next to the Uzbek one. Some traders have welcomed the group's return to power. The driver of a truck being loaded with wheat tells me in the past he was regularly forced to pay bribes to corrupt police officials whenever passing their checkpoints. \"Now, it's not like that,\" he says. \"I could drive all the way to Kabul and not pay a penny.\" \nIt's been exactly one month since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. Now cash is in short supply, and the country is facing a mounting economic crisis. \nOne source in the business community tells us trade levels have dropped significantly, as Afghan importers aren't able to pay for new goods. The Taliban's head of customs at Hairatan port, Maulvi Saeed, tells us the group is cutting duty rates to promote trade, and wants to encourage wealthy traders to return to the country. \"It will create jobs for the people, and the businessmen will be rewarded in the afterlife,\" he says.\nAround an hour's drive away is Mazar-i-Sharif, the country's fourth largest city. On the surface life appears to be continuing as normal, though many are suffering financially. \nI head to the intricately tiled Blue Mosque, the cultural heart of the city. I was last here in August, shortly before the Taliban takeover. Back then, the grounds were teeming with young men and women posing for selfies. \nNow the Taliban have allocated separate visiting times according to gender: women can come in the mornings, men the rest of the day. When we visit, there are plenty of women strolling around, but there seem to be significantly fewer than before. \"Things are alright, but maybe people still need more time to get used to the new government,\" one woman suggests timidly. \nI'm meeting Haji Hekmat, an influential local Taliban leader. \"You might have brought security,\" I put to him, \"but your critics say you're killing the culture here.\" \n\"No,\" he replies emphatically, \"Western influences have been here for the past 20 years\u2026 Control of Afghanistan has passed from one foreign hand to another for 40 years, we have lost our own traditions and values. We are bringing our culture back to life.\" \nAccording to his understanding of Islam, the mixing of men and women is prohibited. \nHaji Hekmat seems genuinely convinced the Taliban enjoy the support of the people. Out of his earshot, however, one female visitor whispered to a colleague, \"These are not good people.\" \nWhilst the Taliban's interpretation of Islam might clash less with the values of those in more rural, socially conservative villages - in bigger Afghan cities, many remain deeply suspicious of the group. Haji Hekmat puts this down to years of \"propaganda\" but a history of suicide bombings and targeted assassinations in urban areas is clearly also responsible. \nAs we leave the Blue Mosque, we spot a large and excited crowd by the main road, and elbow our way to the centre. Four dead bodies with bullet wounds are laid out on display. One has a small handwritten note on top of it describing the men as kidnappers, warning other criminals their punishment will be the same. \nDespite the smell of the bodies under the hot sun, the crowd snap photos and try to push past each other for a better look. Violent crime has long been a major problem in Afghanistan's big cities, and even their critics credit the Taliban with improving security. One onlooker tells us, \"If they are kidnappers it's a good thing. It will be a lesson for others.\"  \nBut lots of others in the city don't feel safe. Law student Farzana, tells us, \"Every time I step out of my house and I see the Taliban, I shiver with fear.\" \nPrivate universities like hers are open, but those run by the government remain shut for now. Under the new Taliban rule, male and female students who are studying in the same classroom must be separated by a curtain. \nFor Farzana, that's not the priority though. She's concerned that the Taliban may not let women work - something the group has denied. For the moment, though, women in Afghanistan are being told to stay at home for their own safety, unless they are teachers or medics. \n\"Right now I feel hopeless,\" Farzana says, \"but I'm doing my best to stay optimistic for the future.\" \nThe last time the Taliban were in power, they introduced far more restrictive measures than they have so far on this occasion, banning women from leaving home without a male companion for example. Much of the fear in Afghan cities today is that similar laws could eventually be introduced again. \nWhilst the Taliban are in firm control of the country, they're yet to win the hearts and minds of many residents. Haji Hekmat acknowledges, \"Taking over the country militarily was hard, implementing the rule of law and protecting it is even harder.\" \nAdditional reporting by Malik Mudasir and Shams Ahmadzai."

      "text": "One penny coins were back in production last year after none were minted for general circulation in the previous two years, Royal Mint figures show.\nCovid lockdowns meant that many coins were hoarded at home requiring some to be produced for use in the economy.\nBanks recently called on people to donate unused loose change to charities after the pandemic hit fundraising.\nSome 88 million new 1p coins were minted in 2020 - still well below the levels seen before the two-year pause.\nThe figures show that no new \u00a32 coins have been minted for four consecutive years, and no new 2p coins have been produced for three years.\nThe Royal Mint has previously stated that it had no plans to resume production of these coins for 10 years, owing to a coin mountain that exists while demand has dropped.\nMany more one penny coins have been produced over the years than 2p coins, for practical reasons. The general trend is a fall, owing in part to the rise in use of contactless cards for low-value purchases.\nThe limit for a single purchase on a contactless card will increase from \u00a345 to \u00a3100 in October.\nA spokeswoman for the Royal Mint said: \"The volume and variety of coins which enter circulation is determined by demand from UK banks and Post Offices. When demand rises we consult with HM Treasury before manufacturing more coins.\"\nThe Mint has published full details of the variety of coins produced during 2020.\nIt said that 330 million coins were released into circulation, which is well down on production levels seen in recent history.\nAmong them were new 50p designs commemorating \"Diversity Built Britain\" and the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. Ten million of each of those designs entered circulation, making them relatively widely accessible.\nThe most desirable coin for collectors is still the 2009 Kew Gardens 50p.\nThe design was created by Christopher Le Brun and features the famous Chinese Pagoda at Kew with a decorative leafy climber twining in and around the tower.\nOnly 210,000 were released into circulation. \nAlmost all of them are now in collectors' hands, so the chances of coming across one in your change are slim."

      "text": "Shamima Begum, who left the UK for Syria as a teenager, says she will regret joining the Islamic State group for the rest of her life and has offered to help the UK fight terrorism.\nShe told the BBC she could be \"useful to society\" and it would be a waste to let her \"rot\" in a Syrian camp.\nThe 22-year-old is accused of playing an active role in IS - she denies that.\nSajid Javid is standing by his decision to revoke her citizenship. \nShamima Begum was 15 when she and two other east London schoolgirls travelled to Syria to join IS. \nThere, she married a Dutch recruit and lived under IS rule for more than three years. In 2019, she was found, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp. Her baby later died of pneumonia and Ms Begum said she had previously lost two other children.\nThe then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Ms Begum of her UK citizenship on national security grounds. \nMs Begum has previously said the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, in which 22 people - some of them children - were killed in a bombing claimed by IS, was similar to military strikes on IS strongholds and called the terror attack \"retaliation\".\nAsked by BBC reporter Josh Baker how it made her feel to think back to being part of a group that committed genocide and murder around the world, she said: \"It makes me sick to my stomach really. It makes me hate myself.\"\nIn the interview for BBC Sounds and BBC 5 live, Ms Begum also said she only now felt comfortable talking about her true feelings. \nOur reporter asked whether she had changed her opinion on IS because it had not created a caliphate.\n\"I have had these opinions for a very long time but only now I feel comfortable to express my real opinion,\" she replied.\nShe said if allowed back into the UK, she could advise on the tactics used by IS to persuade people to go to Syria and could share ways to speak to people who are at risk of being radicalised.\nShe said she felt \"an obligation\" to do so, adding that she did not want any other young girls to destroy their lives like she had.\nOn Wednesday, Ms Begum spoke to ITV's Good Morning Britain and made a direct offer to Boris Johnson to become \"an asset\" in the fight against terror.\nSpeaking from a Syrian refugee camp, she said there was \"no evidence\" she was a key player in preparing terrorist acts and was prepared to prove her innocence in court.\n\"I know there are some people, no matter what I say or what I do, they will not believe that I have changed, believe that I want to help,\" she said.\n\"But for those who have even a drop of mercy and compassion and empathy in their hearts, I tell you from the bottom of my heart that I regret every, every decision I've made since I stepped into Syria and I will live with it for the rest of my life.\n\"No one can hate me more than I hate myself for what I've done and all I can say is 'I'm sorry' and just give me a second chance.\"\nShe said she would \"rather die than go back to IS\" and added: \"The only crime I committed was being dumb enough to join IS.\"\nMs Begum says she wants a trial, saying she is \"willing to go to court and face the people who made these claims and refute these claims, because I know I did nothing in IS but be a mother and a wife\".\nBut Sajid Javid, now health secretary, suggested there was no likelihood Ms Begum would be allowed to return and fight her citizenship case.\nHe told GMB that the decision to strip her of her UK citizenship was \"both morally right, absolutely right, but also legally correct and the right one to protect the British people\".\n\"I won't go into details of the case, but what I will say is that you certainly haven't seen what I saw,\" he added.\n\"If you did know what I knew, because you are sensible, responsible people, you would have made exactly the same decision - of that I have no doubt.\"\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"The government's top priority remains maintaining our national security and keeping the public safe.\"\nLiberty, a human rights group, previously called the decision to revoke Ms Begum's citizenship \"an extremely dangerous precedent\" and said the right to a fair trial was not something democratic governments should take away on a whim.\nOne of the other girls who travelled with Ms Begum, Kadiza Sultana, was reportedly killed in a bombing raid, but the fate of the third - Amira Abase - is unknown.\nMs Begum has previously said her husband had been held in a prison where men were tortured and had surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters.\nJosh Baker from the I'm Not A Monster podcast spoke to Shamima Begum for a forthcoming BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 5 Live podcast series."

      "text": "China's ambassador to the UK has been told he cannot come to Parliament while sanctions remain in place against a number of MPs and peers.\nZheng Zeguang was due to attend a Commons reception on Wednesday, hosted by the all-party group on China.\nBut after protests, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Lord Speaker Lord McFall ruled this out.\nThe Chinese embassy said it was a \"despicable and cowardly\" decision that would harm both countries' interests. \nThe ban, which was first reported by the Daily Telegraph, comes at a time when tensions between the two governments are high.\nIn March, China imposed travel bans and asset freezes on five MPs and two peers whom it accused of spreading lies about the country.\nThis was in response to the UK's decision to impose its first sanctions against Chinese officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang.\nDespite this, the China parliamentary group still decided to invite Mr Zheng to its summer party on the Commons terrace pavilion overlooking the Thames. \nLast week, the five Conservative MPs who were sanctioned - Sir Iain Duncan-Smith, Tom Tugendhat, Nusrat Ghani, Neil O'Brien and Tim Loughton - wrote to the Speaker voicing their concerns.\nThe two sanctioned peers - crossbencher Lord Alton and Labour's Baroness Kennedy - wrote to the Lord Speaker.\nThey said: \"The sanctions imposed by the Chinese government represent an attack not just on members directly targeted but on Parliament, all parliamentarians, select committees, and parliamentary privilege.\n\"We should never allow our place of work to become a platform to validate and promote such sanctions. \n\"We know that this is a view shared by a great many Right Honourable and Honourable Members who will wish their protests to be heard if this visit is to go ahead.\"\nThey added: \"It is unthinkable therefore that parliamentarians should have to suffer this infringement on our liberties whilst the prime representative of the Chinese government in the UK is still apparently free to come to Westminster and to use facilities here as a mouthpiece for his regime.\"\nNusrat Ghani welcomed the \"unprecedented\" ban on the ambassador, telling BBC News: \"Sanctioning MPs is a direct threat to Parliament and our democracy. \n\"We will not be silenced nor intimidated by any regime, and our Parliament will not be become a tool of propaganda for Chinese Communist Party absurd sanctions.\"\nAnother sanctioned MP, Tim Loughton, tweeted: \"If the genocidal Chinese regime think they can shut down free speech by parliamentarians in a democracy there are consequences and in this case it is that the Chinese regime must not have a platform in the Mother of Parliaments.\"\nIn a statement, Sir Lindsay said he held regular meetings with ambassadors to \"establish enduring ties between countries and parliamentarians\".\nBut he added: \"I do not feel it's appropriate for the ambassador for China to meet on the Commons estate and in our place of work when his country has imposed sanctions against some of our members. \n\"If those sanctions were lifted, then of course this would not be an issue.\"\nLord McFall's spokeswoman said the \"meeting should take place elsewhere, considering the current sanctions against members including two members of the Lords\".\nA Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: \"Parliament is independent of government. It is for the Speaker to decide who is allowed on the parliamentary estate.\"\nA spokesman for the Chinese embassy said: \"The despicable and cowardly action of certain individuals of the UK Parliament to obstruct normal exchanges and cooperation between China and the UK for personal political gains is against the wishes and harmful to the interests of the peoples of both countries.\""

      "tags": "Department for Education,Universities,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children",
      "text": "Gavin Williamson has been the highest-profile education secretary for England since Michael Gove - but probably not for the right reasons.\nIf the pandemic had a political fall guy, it was always likely to be Mr Williamson - often the lightning rod for irritation and exasperation from families facing disruption and U-turns on schools and exams.\nNow he has become one of the big casualties of the prime minister's reshuffle - tweeting on his departure that it had been a privilege to serve \"despite the challenges of the global pandemic\".\nIt might seem a long time ago now, but before the pandemic Mr Williamson was seen as the bringer of good news. \nHis predecessors as education secretary had faced constant maulings over school funding shortages - but Mr Williamson arrived with the promise of a \u00a37bn increase. It was big bucks and big ambitions.\nThe trouble only really began when his department collided with the giant iceberg of Covid.\nThe first dent was a major U-turn on getting all primary school pupils back to school, and then there were self-defeating battles with Marcus Rashford over free meals in the holidays.\nOnline learning at home tested parents' patience and fed into worries about lost learning and annoyance at the hokey-cokey of going in and out of school, with hundreds of thousands of pupils regularly having to isolate.\nBut the biggest disaster was the chaos of last year's exams, with multiple U-turns and late-night lurches in policy that saw grades go through the roof and his department's most senior civil servant and the head of the exams watchdog both go out the door.\nThat such senior staff had to step down while he stayed put didn't add to the lustre of his reputation.\nThere has never been a full independent inquiry into what went wrong with the 2020 exams - so it's hard to know who was really to blame. But it did serious harm to Mr Williamson's credibility - and there was no shortage of people on his own side who were privately ready to point the finger.\nAnd his poll ratings among Conservative supporters remained resolutely negative.\nAs a former chief whip, it was said his survival chances were boosted by knowing where the bodies were buried. But he also made political enemies ready to come back to haunt him.\nMr Williamson, who has never appeared to complain about the criticism directed at him, could also feel aggrieved that he was taking the blame for decisions that were never down to an individual minister.\nThat was encapsulated in the plans to get schools back in January 2021, when his determination to open classrooms was reversed almost immediately by another lockdown. \nExams, which he'd wanted to go ahead, were again cancelled and the long-awaited catch-up plans turned to dust when the catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins walked out over a lack of funding.\nThe education secretary doesn't write the cheques but he was left holding a punctured balloon of a policy.\nThis year's replacement exam results, with much responsibility outsourced to teachers and schools, didn't have any of the major problems of last year. There would have been cause for quiet celebration that it had all gone relatively smoothly - not an easy achievement in what remain unprecedented circumstances.\nBut after a successful re-opening of schools this autumn, there was another tripwire moment when in an interview with the London Evening Standard he seemed to confuse two black sportsmen, Marcus Rashford and Maro Itoje. It was another gift for his critics on social media.\nIt's hard to know what the legacy will be of his education plans, because he never really got a chance to start them, beyond pushing for a greater emphasis on skills and further education. The pandemic overshadowed everything else.\nWill he bounce back to a big post in government again? At 45 he is still young by political standards, and has the northern, state-school, non-Oxbridge credentials for the government's levelling up plans. \nHe certainly seems ready to fight on, describing himself as having the hide of a rhino.\nBut there were times when he looked distinctly weary - such as an online talk with head teachers where he extolled the virtues of getting a dog who would always be there for you.\n\"Not every day has been brilliant,\" he told them."

      "text": "Elite US gymnast Simone Biles has testified before the Senate about abuse she suffered at the hands of disgraced former team doctor, Larry Nassar. \nFormer teammates Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney also appeared before the committee, along with FBI Director Christopher Wray.\nThe committee is examining shortcomings in the FBI's investigation into Nassar, later convicted of sexually abusing girls.\nHe is serving a life sentence in jail.\n\"I blame Larry Nasser, and I also blame an entire system that enabled and perpetrated [sic] his abuse,\" said Ms Biles, the most decorated Olympic gymnast of all-time.\n\"If you allow a predator to harm children, the consequences will be swift and severe,\" she added.\nGymnast Maggie Nichols - the first victim to report her abuse to USA Gymnastics - also testified. \nIn emotional testimony on Wednesday, the four women told the Senate Judiciary Committee they had \"suffered and continue to suffer\" from the abuse they experienced and its bungled handling.\nFour-time Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles - one of the most famous figures in world sports - called for the agents involved to be federally prosecuted.\n\"How much is a little girl worth?\" she asked. \nAly Raisman, who served as captain of the 2012 and 2016 US Olympic gymnastics teams, expressed disgust that she was \"still fighting for the most basic answers and accountability\" more than six years after first reporting her abuse.\n\"Over the past few years it has become painfully clear how a survivor's healing is affected by the handling of their abuse,\" she testified. \nShe criticised the FBI investigation as being \"like guesswork\", warning that not addressing its serious flaws would result in a recurring \"nightmare\" for many more women.\nMcKayla Maroney, who won gold at the London 2012 Olympic Games, described the experience of being interviewed by the FBI as replete with \"silence and disregard for my trauma\".\n\"They chose to fabricate, to lie about what I said and protect a serial child molester,\" she told senators.\n\"What is the point of reporting abuse if our own FBI agents are going to take it upon themselves to bury that report in a drawer?\"\nThe four athletes were among more than 200 women who gave powerful impact statements to a court in 2018, detailing Larry Nassar's abuse as the sports doctor of the United States women's national gymnastics team.\nIn total, Nassar was accused of sexual abuse by more than 330 women and girls at USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University.\nA long-awaited report into the FBI's investigation, which was published in July, found numerous missteps, delays and cover-ups by FBI agents, which allowed Nassar's abuse to continue for several more months after the case was first opened.\nThe 119-page report by the Department of Justice Inspector General found that, despite the seriousness of the allegations against Nassar, the FBI field office in Indianapolis had been slow to respond.\nThe agency initially interviewed only Ms Maroney while declining to interview other young women who had come forward with their stories.\nConfronted by their mistakes, two FBI officials lied during interviews to cover up their errors, the report said. According to the FBI, one of those officials was fired last week.\nFBI Director Christopher Wray apologised profusely to those present for the \"reprehensible conduct\" and \"fundamental errors\" detailed in the July report.\nMr Wray only took the agency's top job in 2017, but pledged to prevent a repeat of the mishandled case under his leadership.\nHe pointed to last week's removal of the supervising official involved, while noting the other official - who led the field office in Indianapolis - had retired long before he could be disciplined.\nHe acknowledged the work of both agents had \"violated the FBI's long-standing code of conduct\" but was \"inconsistent\" with the vast majority of his team.\nAt a news conference later on Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the president \"supports\" the recommended steps outlined for the FBI in the Department of Justice report.\nBut both lawmakers and witnesses called out the department for being a \"no-show\" at the hearing despite being invited. Speaking after the hearing, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal noted the department must still answer more questions."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pressure on the NHS is the main factor that would lead to tighter Covid restrictions in England, the health secretary has said.\nSajid Javid told the BBC there was not a \"single trigger\" for the government moving to its \"Plan B\" measures. \nBut he said how the NHS was coping was the number one issue to watch.\nGovernment scientists have warned that there could be a large jump in Covid hospital admissions if restrictions are not tightened soon. \nThe Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said its modelling suggested hospitalisations could reach 2,000 to 7,000 per day next month. \nCurrently there is an average of just over 750 Covid admissions per day in England.\nThe scientists said a \"relatively light set of measures\" could keep case numbers down if they were brought in early enough.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to avoid the need for additional restrictions by getting more people vaccinated.\nAs he announced his winter plan for tackling Covid in England on Tuesday, he said some measures would be kept in reserve for if the NHS faced unsustainable pressure - including vaccine passports, mandatory face masks and advising people to work from home.\nMr Javid told BBC Breakfast: \"We don't want to get to a position ever again where there's unsustainable pressure on the NHS so it's not able to see people in the usual way when it needs to, particularly emergency patients. \n\"So in my mind that is the number one issue that we need to always, always keep an eye on.\"\nThe health secretary said factors would include hospital admission numbers, pressures on A&E and staffing levels. \nAppearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Javid was pressed on why the government was not acting early to prevent a rise in hospital admissions. \nHe said the UK now had \"much better defences\" than it did a year ago, including vaccines, new treatments and an improved testing and surveillance system. \nPapers released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on Tuesday, dated 8 September, said there was \"potential for another large wave of hospitalisations\".\nVirus modellers advising the committee - the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) - said it was possible the virus would spread more rapidly after the return of schools and more people going back to their workplaces.  \nThey said high levels of home-working had been very important for curbing the epidemic in recent months, with a significant decrease \"highly likely\" to lead to a rapid increase in hospital admissions.\nAs well as encouraging working from home, they suggested \"light-touch measures\" such as clear messaging telling people to \"act cautiously\", more widespread testing, a return to requiring all contacts of cases to isolate, and more mask-wearing.\nIf hospitalisation rates were allowed to get too high then much more stringent and disruptive measures would be needed, they said.\nHowever, the body acknowledged its previous warning - that lifting all restrictions over the summer might prompt a large scale outbreak - had not been borne out by events.\nDaily Covid cases have also been falling in England over the past week.\nThe modellers who report into the Sage committee were too pessimistic back in July when they assumed the opening up of society would lead to a surge in infections and hospital admissions. \nThe latest set of papers notes that the closure of schools, warm weather and large numbers of people being required to self-isolate played a bigger than expected role in curbing infections. \nBut they go on to say that the peak time for cases expected previously from August has now simply been pushed back to October through to December. \nThe return of schools and colleges could push up case rates. Another large wave of hospitalisations looms, they say. \nThey lean towards early light touch intervention by ministers, for example getting more people to work from home again.  \nIn effect this is calling on the government to enact Plan B for England soon. \nSceptics will say modellers have got it wrong before and a pinch of salt is needed with the latest papers. But few would deny the possibility of a very difficult winter ahead.\nEpidemiologist Prof Andrew Hayward says the focus should now be on the number of hospital admissions and the ability of the NHS to cope, rather on the number Covid cases, because of the impact of vaccines. \nProf Hayward, who is a member of Sage but was speaking in a personal capacity, also said working from home would make \"a significant difference to transmission if we get into trouble\". \n\"The most important and effective way of reducing spread of the virus is not to be in contact with other people,\" he told the Today programme.\nProf Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which feeds into Sage, said the number of contacts people had per week had risen to the highest number for a year - but this was mostly down to people going into work.\nHe told Times Radio people should be allowed to continue to work from home if they can, rather than being forced back into the office. \nThe country is entering the autumn with a much higher level of cases, hospital admissions and deaths than last year. \nOn Tuesday, the UK reported a further 26,628 cases and another 185 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The most recent data showed there were 8,413 Covid patients in hospital.\nOn 15 September last year, there were 3,105 daily cases and 27 deaths reported, along with 1,066 Covid patients in hospital.\nHowever, vaccines are now offering extensive protection against severe illness. Some 81.2% of people aged 16 and over in the UK are fully vaccinated. \nAll over-50s in the UK - as well as those in other vulnerable groups - are to be offered a booster shot at least six months after their second dose, with 12 to 15-year-olds also being offered a single dose. \nWhat questions do you have about this story?

He was an example to many of us in his relentless quest for truth and justice.\n\"Our investigation into Stuart's death will not end with Terry's - as long as the case remains open, we will do all we can to deliver justice for him and his family. \n\"To this end we urge anyone who has information about Stuart's death to please now, more than ever, do the right thing and come forward.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "The John Lewis Partnership is looking to fill thousands of seasonal jobs to meet increased demand around Christmas.\nIt plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers in its UK John Lewis and Waitrose stores and distribution centres.\nThe employee-owned business said this was 2,000 more temporary roles than the previous year.\nNew joiners will be offered free food and drink to \"help ensure we can attract the help we need\", it said.\nThe partnership is hiring people for its supermarkets, department stores and warehouses, including delivery drivers for its online grocery division.\nIt has 34 John Lewis department stores and 331 Waitrose supermarket stores alongside its online operation.\nThe partnership is also looking to fill 550 permanent, full-time, driver and warehouse jobs.\nNikki Humphrey, people director at the John Lewis Partnership, said: \"We know that as the first Christmas after lockdown, customers will want to make it really special and we're throwing everything we can into helping them celebrate - our festive team will have a crucial role to play.\"\n\"We look forward to welcoming people into our team across the country,\" she added.\nThe jobs will be advertised online from Thursday, with 4,700 temporary roles available in Waitrose stores and 2,300 in John Lewis.\nThe move comes after the number of job vacancies in the UK surged past one million for the first time.\nAccording to new official figures released on Wednesday, the number of jobs in the three months to August rose above one million for the first time since records began in 2001.\nThe most popular sectors in terms of vacancies were social work, hospitality, science, retail and manufacturing.\nBut business lobby groups warned that demand for more staff had reached a critical point.\nSuren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that firms faced an \"acute hiring crisis\".\n\"With Brexit and Covid-19 driving a more deep-seated decline in labour supply, the end of furlough is unlikely to be a silver bullet to the ongoing shortages,\" he said.\n\"These recruitment difficulties are likely to dampen the recovery by limiting firms' ability to fulfil orders and meet customer demand.\"\nSupermarket bosses have said that it is vital to fix the labour shortage problems before key trading over the Christmas period.\nThe John Lewis Partnership will also launch Christmas promotions in shops from October and will use a new 300,000 sq-ft distribution centre in Leicestershire to ensure it can meet demand ahead of the Black Friday sales.\nLast year, the UK's Christmas celebrations were hindered by restrictions on the number of people allowed to meet up due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWith fewer restrictions expected this year, retailers are hoping for a bumper festive period."

      "text": "Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has survived a confidence vote in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) following a controversial appointment.\nFor weeks, he has been criticised for his handling of the appointment of former government minister Katherine Zappone as a UN special envoy.\nHe denied he was lobbied to appoint her but apologised for not informing members of the cabinet.\nHe won a confidence motion by 92 votes to 59.\nAhead of the vote, Mr Coveney said he regretted the \"preventable controversy\" over Ms Zappone's appointment, admitting he should have taken the issue more seriously when he was first questioned about it in the summer.\nHowever, he insisted the appointment was \"in no way corrupt or dishonest\".\nMs Zappone later turned down the job, saying the controversy had undermined the legitimacy of the envoy role. \nMr Coveney's party, Fine Gael, is in a coalition government with both Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party.\nOn 27 July 2021 he informed cabinet ministers that Ms Zappone would become the new \"Special Envoy to the UN for Freedom of Opinion and Expression\".\nHowever, the job had not been advertised and it later emerged that neither Fianna F\u00e1il nor Green Party ministers knew about her appointment, including the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin.\nThe Republic's biggest opposition party, Sinn F\u00e9in, tabled a motion of no confidence in Mr Coveney on Wednesday - the first day the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) returned from its summer recess.\nBut the government put down a counter confidence motion to be voted on by TDs (members of parliament).\nThe taoiseach has described Mr Coveney's failure to inform his government colleagues before the appointment as an \"oversight\".\nMr Martin warned Fianna F\u00e1il TDs that they faced a six-month suspension from the parliamentary party if they did not support Mr Coveney in Wednesday's vote. \nThe taoiseach's response caused internal divisions within his own party. \nBefore the vote on Wednesday evening, Fianna F\u00e1il TD Marc MacSharry resigned from the parliamentary party and insisted he would be voting no confidence in Mr Coveney.\nMr MacSharry, who is a long-time critic of Mr Martin, claimed Fianna F\u00e1il policy was currently being \"determined in a fashion consistent with an undemocratic totalitarian regime\". \nEarlier in the controversy, it emerged Mr Coveney's party leader Leo Varadkar had not been aware of the special envoy appointment until a week before cabinet, when Ms Zappone texted him about it. \nIn messages released by Mr Varadkar in September, he showed that he subsequently asked Mr Coveney about the role before the cabinet meeting in July.\nMs Zappone replied her contract was soon to be finalised.\nOn 4 August, Ms Zappone announced she would not take on the special envoy position as she believed \"it is clear that criticism of the appointment process has impacted the legitimacy of the role itself\".\nSinn F\u00e9in President Mary Lou McDonald has called for Mr Coveney to be sacked, branding his actions as not being \"of the standard expected of a minister\".\nThe Labour Party indicated it did not have confidence in the government but leader Alan Kelly said there were \"bigger issues\" than the row.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Coveney told a party conference he was \"embarrassed\" the appointment had led to a \"fiasco\".\n\"It's not been my finest month in politics,\" he said.

      "text": "The families of four miners who died in a south Wales colliery disaster 10 years ago are calling for an inquest.\nCharles Breslin, 62, David Powell, 50, Phillip Hill, 44, and Garry Jenkins, 39, died when water flooded the Gleision drift mine in September 2011. \nThe mine's manager and owners were cleared of manslaughter charges in 2014. \nCharles Breslin's widow, Mavis, said she felt \"cheated\" of a husband and an inquest. \nThe Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said it could not comment because the investigation into the inrush and subsequent trial were led by the police and Crown Prosecution Service.\nLynette Powell, whose husband David celebrated his 50th birthday in the weeks before he died, said all she had was a temporary death certificate.\n\"That is no closure for me,\" she said. \"I haven't got an inquest. Not only for me, for all the families.\"\nIt comes as two survivors of the Gleision mine tragedy told the Wales Investigates programme they felt their colleagues' deaths in 2011 had been \"swept under the carpet\".\nIn their first media interview since the tragedy, Jake Wyatt, 68, and Nigel Evans, 49, spoke of alleged illegal workings in the mine, and said they felt authorities had failed to get to the bottom of what might have caused the four miners' deaths.\nWhile it's not known what, if any, impact these alleged illegal workings had on the inrush, Lee Reynolds, a former surveyor for Gleision mine who gave evidence in the trial, questioned whether they had been noticed or acted on by the HSE.\nMr Reynolds has been working with Maria Seage, the co-owner of Gleision mine, to get more information on the HSE's role over the years and its subsequent investigation.\nHe called on authorities to look into whether opportunities to improve safety at the mine prior to the inrush had been missed.\nHe said: \"When you get a major incident - and I believe four people getting killed tragically is a major incident - they have a prior role investigation. It should be undertaken independently. \n\"With what we're finding in our investigation, a prior role investigation should have been undertaken, but wasn't.\"\nThe water inrush at the Gleision drift mine, near Cilybebyll, Neath Port Talbot, on 15 September 2011, happened after the men blasted through to old, disused workings in an effort to improve air circulation in the mine.\nThe mine manager Malcolm Fyfield said he had checked the old workings for water prior to the accident and found none, but in court he was accused of gross negligence manslaughter for failing to notify the HSE of his intentions to knock through to the old workings, which was a legal requirement.\nMr Fyfield, 58, and owners MNS Mining were found not guilty of manslaughter charges [gross negligence manslaughter and corporate manslaughter, respectively] following a three-month trial in 2014.\nThe jury in the multimillion-pound trial reached not guilty verdicts after just 30 minutes of deliberation.\nFollowing the trial, the acting coroner for Swansea decided not to not to hold full inquests for the four men.\nA subsequent factual report, published by the HSE in 2015, gave details of the underground investigation undertaken by its inspectors after the tragedy, but was unable to explore issues that had not been raised in court.\nAn HSE spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment on the points raised by Mr Reynolds and the families because it did not lead the investigation into the tragedy.\nThe spokesman added: \"Our thoughts are with the families on this poignant anniversary. We supported the South Wales Police investigation at the time which ended in a manslaughter trial, but HSE did not bring any charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 in addition to their prosecution.\""

      "tags": "Literacy,Employment,Pay",
      "text": "Steve Scovell, 56, had been working at a bakery for several years when he decided to improve his reading and writing skills.\n\"It was difficult at the start in terms of reading ingredients... but I got used to it.\n\"Then about three or four years ago I started getting quite depressed, so I went to find help.\"\nAn estimated nine million UK adults have poor literacy skills, which could affect their job and pay prospects.\nNew research from non-profit consultancy Pro Bono Economics has found that a worker with literacy skills classed as \"very poor\" would have to work an extra 18 months in their lifetime to earn the same amount as someone with basic communication skills.\nThe charity said that around four million workers could receive an estimated \u00a36bn national pay rise if their literacy skills improved.\nThose workers on average earn around \u00a31,500 less per year than they would if they had a basic level of literacy, according to the research.\nAdults with low-level literacy have limited vocabulary and cannot read lengthy texts on unfamiliar topics, which means they find it hard to do things most people take for granted - like filling out a job application. \nBut fortunately support was available to Steve. He was helped with his reading and writing by a charity, Read Easy, and has since found a new job with higher pay and preferable hours.\n\"The hourly rate is better, and it's 8am-3pm rather than 5pm to 3am,\" he says.\n\"My quality of life is so much better.\n\"I don't think without learning to read I would have got this job.\"\nJason Vit of the National Literacy Trust (NLT), which worked with PBE on the study, said the findings showed \"the major economic disadvantage of workers having low literacy.\"\nHe said one of the big challenges for those workers was exclusion from jobs.\n\"Many require workers to read chemical labelling or have specific instructions. Increasingly, jobs that may not traditionally have required literacy now need it, as the business environment gets more literate.\"\nThe NLT has asked companies to sign up to a pledge to tackle the issue.\n\"The vision for the literacy business pledge is getting businesses of all sizes to think of what they can do. \nHe explained that some employers are focusing on adult literacy and are trying to be more literacy friendly by normalising it so employees can seek help, support and advice. \n\"Other businesses are looking at children and young adults, to improve their employability before they enter the workforce.\n\"We need businesses to be open and honest about the scale of the problem, and have an environment where workers can be open about when they struggle and can offer solutions,\" he added.\nFor Sue Mann, who works at Blackpool Transport, improving her literacy skills was a daunting prospect at first.\n\"I was quite nervous and I thought, 'God I'll look such a fool if I fail this'.\"  \nWhen she was at school, Sue felt discouraged and left with no qualifications.\n\"Teachers used to tell you things like, 'you'll always be thick', 'you'll never achieve anything'\".\nBut after returning to learning, she took a certificate, passed the maths part 100%, and was \"over the moon\".\n\"I thought if I can do that, I can do anything.\"\nSue was encouraged by her employer to become a union learning rep - helping others to improve their skills. She believes improving her literacy has given her career a boost as well.\n\"It gave me the confidence to apply for jobs within my own company.\"\nJames Sykes says he had always \"got by\" with his English and Maths.\n\"I left school without anything really, I can't remember exactly. I did the exams but I wasn't interested in any of that.\n\"I have never been very academic, sitting in a classroom environment wasn't for me. I just wanted to get out of school and get a job, I wanted to join the army - my whole aim in life was to be a soldier.\"\nHis parents weren't keen on his career choice, so James took an apprenticeship to later become a joiner. He joined the army reserves instead. \nBut the birth of his son eight years ago prompted him to improve his literacy skills at the age of 40.\nHaving recently started working for Kirklees Council as a joiner, he got help from his employer and his union to take GCSE English last year.\n\"I went to college and for some bizarre reason I fell into it quite nicely, it just clicked.\n\"I've never been a good speller, but I have a good command of the language and can use big words in the right places and not sound daft.\"\nHe ended up getting a 6 in his exam - the equivalent of just above a B in the previous grading system.\n\"It completely blew me away, I was so shocked.\"\nHe says improving his literacy skills will likely help him at the Territorial Army.\n\"It's a tick in the box that you've got to have to allow you to progress, so it will potentially help me in the future with my military career.\"\nFor more information, visit BBC Radio 5 Live's Word Matters website or join in the conversation at #BBCWordMatters."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "A major row broke out between leaders of the Taliban just days after they set up a new government in Afghanistan, senior Taliban officials told the BBC.\nSupporters of two rival factions reportedly brawled at the presidential palace in the capital Kabul.\nThe argument appeared to centre on who did the most to secure victory over the US, and how power was divided up in the new cabinet.\nThe Taliban have officially denied the reports.\nThe group seized control of Afghanistan last month, and have since declared the country an \"Islamic Emirate\". Their new interim cabinet is entirely male and made up of senior Taliban figures, some of whom are notorious for attacks on US forces over the past two decades.\nThe dispute came to light after a Taliban co-founder, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, disappeared from view for several days.\nOne Taliban source told BBC Pashto that Mr Baradar and Khalil ur-Rahman Haqqani - the minister for refugees and a prominent figure within the militant Haqqani network - had exchanged strong words, as their followers brawled with each other nearby. \nA senior Taliban member based in Qatar and a person connected to those involved also confirmed that an argument had taken place late last week. \nThe sources said the argument had broken out because Mr Baradar, the new deputy prime minister, was unhappy about the structure of their interim government. \nThe row also reportedly stemmed from divisions over who in the Taliban should take credit for their victory in Afghanistan. \nMr Baradar reportedly believes that the emphasis should be placed on diplomacy carried out by people like him, while members of the Haqqani group - which is run by one of the most senior Taliban figures - and their backers say it was achieved through fighting. \nMr Baradar was the first Taliban leader to communicate directly with a US president, having a telephone conversation with Donald Trump in 2020. Before that, he signed the Doha agreement on the withdrawal of US troops on behalf of the Taliban.\nMeanwhile, the powerful Haqqani network is associated with some of the most violent attacks that have occurred in Afghanistan against Afghan forces and their Western allies in recent years. The group is designated by the US as a terrorist organisation.\nIts leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is the interior minister in the new government. \nRumours about a fallout have been spreading since late last week, when Mr Baradar - one of the best-known faces of the Taliban - disappeared from public view. There was speculation on social media that he might have died. \nThe Taliban sources told the BBC that Mr Baradar had left Kabul and travelled to the city of Kandahar following the row. \nIn an audio recording purportedly of Mr Baradar released on Monday, the Taliban co-founder said he had been \"away on trips\".\n\"Wherever I am at the moment, we are all fine,\" he said.\nThe BBC was not able to verify the recording, which was posted on a number of official Taliban websites.\nThe Taliban have maintained that there was no argument and that Mr Baradar is safe but have released conflicting statements on what he is currently doing. A spokesman said Mr Baradar had gone to Kandahar to meet the Taliban's supreme leader, but later told BBC Pashto that he was \"tired and wanted some rest\". \nMany Afghans will feel they have good reason to doubt the Taliban's word. In 2015, the group admitted covering up their founding leader Mullah Omar's death for more than two years, during which time they continued to issue statements in his name.\nSources told the BBC that Mr Baradar was expected to return to Kabul and might appear on camera to deny that any argument had happened.\nSpeculation remains over the Taliban's supreme commander, Hibatullah Akhundzada, who has never been seen in public. He is in charge of the Taliban's political, military and religious affairs. \nMeanwhile, Afghanistan's acting foreign minister on Tuesday called for international donors to restart aid, saying the international community should not politicise their assistance.\nMore than $1bn (\u00a3720m) in aid was pledged for the country on Monday, following warnings from the United Nations of a \"looming catastrophe\"."

      "text": "The FBI disregarded allegations about a prolific USA Gymnastics child abuser and later made serious errors in the investigation, a watchdog has found. \nThe long-awaited report gave a scathing assessment of the FBI's investigation into former team doctor Larry Nassar. \nNassar was sentenced to over 300 years in jail in 2018 for molesting gymnasts.\nNumerous missteps and cover-ups by FBI agents allowed his abuse to continue for months after the case was first opened, the report found.\nRachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of abuse, said that while the US justice department's internal review exposed serious failings, there was a lack of accountability. \n\"This report lays bare the corruption, but its conclusion says 'doesn't matter'. Because nothing happens now,\" she wrote in a series of tweets. \"These agents retire on government pensions while survivors fight to stay alive.\"\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the FBI acknowledged the findings of the report, calling the handling of the Nassar file \"inexcusable and a discredit to this organisation\". \n\"We will take all necessary steps to ensure that the failures of the employees outlined in the report do not happen again,\" the agency said.\nThe 119-page report by the Department of Justice Inspector General found that despite the seriousness of the allegations against Nassar, the FBI field office in Indianapolis dragged its feet in responding. \nIn July 2015, following an internal review into Nassar, USA Gymnastics reported a number of allegations to the FBI in Indianapolis. After some \"limited follow-up\" that summer, the agency \"did not undertake any investigative activity\" on the case for more than eight months.\nDuring that time, the report said, Nassar's sexual assaults continued. \nConfronted by their mistakes, two FBI officials lied during interviews to cover up their errors, the report said. \nAt the time the allegations surfaced, one of the FBI agents, Jay Abbott, had been in discussions with USA Gymnastics officials about a job with the Olympic Committee. Mr Abbott retired from the agency in 2018. \nThe other, an unnamed employee, \"is no longer a supervisor\", the FBI said on Wednesday, and will not work on FBI matters until an internal investigation is complete. \nMr Abbott's lawyer, Josh Minkler, said in a statement to Reuters news agency that his client \"thanks the law enforcement officers and prosecutors who brought Larry Nassar to justice\".\nThe internal review into the FBI's handling of the Nassar case was launched in 2018 when the disgraced doctor was sentenced to decades behind bars. \nHe has been accused of sexual abuse by more than 330 women and girls from USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, including Olympic stars Simone Biles and Aly Raisman."

      "text": "A 30-year-old man has been found guilty of the murder of Brian Phelan on the outskirts of Newry in July 2018.\nMr Phelan was stabbed three times in the neck and twice in the body during an attack on a remote Carrivekeeney Road, near to the village of Camlough.\nHe had gone there with Daniel Martin James Carroll, of Edward Street in Portadown, but originally from Newry.\nCarroll was found guilty of Mr Phelan's murder at Newry Crown Court on Wednesday.\nDuring a two-week trial, the court heard that on the day of his death Mr Phelan had met Carroll in Bessbrook before travelling to the road with the intention of buying quad bikes.\nThe road, which runs up the side of Camlough mountain, effectively comes to a dead end for vehicles, however a path does lead across the mountain.\nIt was the defence's case that three men with paramilitary links had appeared from a nearby field, attacked Mr Phelan, threatened him and then made off in the direction of the mountain. \nAlthough he said he knew them, Carroll would not name the men stating that his life and that of his family was at risk.\nThe defence said that the mountain path could have been accessed by small vehicles such as quadbikes.\nHowever, the prosecution said this version of events, which Carroll put forward 15 months after Brian Phelan's death, was complete nonsense. \nIt said the defendant had attacked the victim and then fled the scene, changing his T-shirt before being arrested nearly two hours later at a family member's home in Newry.\nAlthough no definite motive was identified, the jury had been told of Carroll's previous record, which included unprovoked violence.\nGiving evidence, a police officer had also suggested there could have been a financial disagreement between the two men.\nA jury of six men and five women took less than 90 minutes to reach a unanimous guilty verdict.\nSocial distancing meant that only a small number of Brian Phelan's friends and family were permitted inside the courtroom. \nThere were emotional scenes from those in the public gallery with a loud cheer from the adjoining foyer.\nBefore being sent down, the judge told Carroll that he would be sentenced to life imprisonment. \nA tariff hearing to determine the minimum amount of time he will spend in prison before being considered for parole will be set in November."

      "text": "Microsoft has announced users can now delete all passwords from their accounts and instead login using an authenticator app or other solution.\nThe technology giant made passwordless accounts available for business users of its products in March. \nAnd that system is now being made available to all Microsoft or Windows users. \nIt said \"nearly 100% of our employees\" were already using the new, more secure system for their corporate accounts.\nIf passwordless login is enabled, users re-logging in to a Microsoft account will be asked to give their fingerprint, or other secure unlock, on their mobile phone.\nAnd this is far more secure than using passwords, which can be guessed or stolen, according to Microsoft.\n\"Only you can provide fingerprint authentication or provide the right response on your mobile at the right time,\" it said. \nWindows users will still be able to use quick-login features such as a Pin code, though.\nSome rare exceptions will still need passwords, such as Office 2010, Xbox 360 consoles, and Windows 8.1 or earlier machines. \nAnd if access to the authenticator app is lost - for example, if the phone it is installed on is lost or stolen or a user forgets when upgrading - backup options can be used, including: \nBut SMS and email are two of the most common channels for cyber-criminals targeting specific individuals\nAnd Microsoft says security-conscious users who have two-factor authentication set up will need to have access to two different recovery methods. \nProf Alan Woodward, part of a research team investigating passwordless authentication, at the University of Surrey, called it \"quite a bold step from Microsoft\". \n\"This isn't just logging into PCs, it's logging into online services as well\" - including important ones such as cloud storage, he said.\nMicrosoft laid out its reasons for the new system in a series of blog posts. \nSecurity vice-president Vasu Jakkal wrote: \"Passwords are incredibly inconvenient to create, remember, and manage across all the accounts in our lives.\n\"We are expected to create complex and unique passwords, remember them, and change them frequently - but nobody likes doing that.\"\nInstead, people tended to create insecure passwords that technically cleared the bar for using symbols, numbers or case sensitivity - but in order to remember them, used a repeated formula or the same password on multiple websites. \nAnd that led to hackers guessing them or revealing them in a data breach and reusing them. \n\"Hackers don't break in, they log in,\" the blog post read. \nThe new passwordless feature greets users with a box saying: \"A passwordless account reduces the risk of phishing and password attacks.\" \nAnd once the feature is set up, a confirmation tells users: \"You have increased the security of your account and improved your sign-in experience by removing your password\". \nMicrosoft's claims about poor password use were largely true, Prof Woodward said.\n\"The message has been pummelled home about what good password hygiene looks like - but it's easier said than done,\" he said. \nPasswords were a decades-old concept \"and maybe the time is now right to start looking for something different\". \nBut there were no currently agreed standards.  \n\"There are a number of different ways this could be done - and it would be good if everybody moved on, really, and tried to find a way of doing this,\" Prof Woodward said."

      "tags": "Unemployment,Economics,Job Retention Scheme,Employment,UK economy",
      "text": "Job vacancies have hit a record high as the economic recovery continues, according to official figures.\nThe number of vacancies in the three months to August rose above one million for the first time since records began in 2001.\nFigures also showed employee numbers were back at pre-Covid levels in August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nAugust payrolls showed another monthly increase of 241,000 to 29.1 million.\nBusiness groups said, however, despite the return of staffing levels to pre-pandemic rates there remained high demand for more staff, and there was a risk labour shortages would dampen growth.\nThe ONS deputy statistician, Jonathan Athow, said: \"Early estimates from payroll data suggest that in August the total number of employees is around the same level as before the pandemic, though our surveys show well over a million are still on furlough.\"\nBut Mr Athow pointed out that the recovery was not even, with areas such as London and sectors like hospitality and the arts still down.\nThe ONS also cautioned that young people had been badly affected by job losses. \n\"The overall employment rate continues to recover, particularly among groups such as young workers who were hard hit at the outset of the pandemic, while unemployment has fallen,\" he said.\nOverall, the unemployment rate fell from 4.7% to 4.6% in the three months to July.\nSuren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said, however, that firms were currently facing an \"acute hiring crisis\".\n\"With Brexit and Covid-19 driving a more deep-seated decline in labour supply, the end of furlough is unlikely to be a silver bullet to the ongoing shortages,\" he said.\n\"These recruitment difficulties are likely to dampen the recovery by limiting firms' ability to fulfil orders and meet customer demand.\"\nThe food and accommodation sectors saw the biggest jump in the number of jobs available in August, increasing by 57,600.\nSome companies in the food industry, which has already seen a shortage of fruit pickers and lorry drivers, have been unable to provide normal service recently.\nSupermarket bosses have also warned that it is vital to fix the labour shortage problems before key trading over the Christmas period.\nDairy giant Arla, meanwhile, has also had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets because of the driver shortages.\n\"We advertised locally for 70 fruit-pickers and we had nine applications. On follow-up, only one was still available... in terms of recruiting locally, we failed completely,\" says Ali Capper, the owner of Stocks Farm in Suckley and chair of British Apples and Pears.\nAt her orchard, harvest has just started. It must be done quickly and requires many pairs of hands.\nAli had to turn to specialist recruitment firms and has brought in seasonal workers from Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia.\nShe told the BBC's Today programme: \"This sector at the moment is at crisis point.\n\"Our peak is from April to October and at the moment the whole industry is running between 10 and 35% short of labour... it means there is food waste on our farms.\"\nShe added that there is \"deep concern\" over how fruit will be picked and roles for packers will be filled in the run-up to Christmas.\n\"It feels at the moment that the government is presiding over chaos in our food and drink manufacturing sectors.\"\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, warned that there could be more pain to come.\n\"While the pressure should ease as more people look to return to work and the furlough scheme ends, the UK labour market is set to remain choppy with vacancies taking time to fill due to skills shortages and reduced availability of overseas workers,\" she said.\nNeil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said there was a number of things the government could do \"to solve this crisis\".\n\"Government must work with business to improve training opportunities for workers to transition into the most crucial sectors, and allow some flexibility in the immigration system at this time of need,\" he said.\nHe added that firms must think about how they will retain staff beyond increasing salaries or offering sign-on bonuses, through improving working conditions, for example.\nThe jobs market recovery continues to recover strongly, reflecting the unique nature of last year's lockdown recession and the extension of rescue measures. A full recovery by now, and unemployment below 5% and falling, was in nobody's forecast - including the government's.\nThe confirmation of a record number of vacancies is the other side of the story. The consequences of this are beginning to be seen across the economy.\nAs it happens, there is also likely to be about one million workers still on the furlough scheme when it ends later this month. These two problems will not solve one another. It is still unknown what proportion of those still on furlough will have jobs to return to. \nAnd while some who do not have jobs on hold may fill vacancies, such as airport logistics workers sought after by the freight industry, others will have the wrong skills or be in the wrong place.\nSo a good set of numbers, with an unprecedented double challenge about to hit.\nBut Chancellor Rishi Sunak praised the new figures on Tuesday: \"Today's statistics show that our plan for jobs is working.\n\"As we continue to recover from the pandemic, our focus remains on creating opportunities and supporting people's jobs,\" he said.\nThe figures come as the furlough scheme, which was introduced by the government at the start of the pandemic to stop people being laid off, starts to wind down.\nIn July, employers were required to start paying 10% of salaries - with the government's contribution falling to 70%.\nThe government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them - up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Department for Education",
      "text": "Parent groups are warning of a \"tsunami\" of crippling school-anxiety cases leading to persistent and debilitating absence from education.\nThere is no official data on absence due to school anxiety and many affected pupils are labelled truants but support groups are being flooded with calls.\nAnd an education lawyer in north-west England says the pandemic has made an \"unprecedented crisis\" even worse.\nThe education department said it was investing \u00a317m in school mental health.\nChildren with school anxiety may experience physical symptoms such as stomach pain, nausea and headaches before school or have immobilising anxiety, panic attacks or something that seems like a tantrum. \nThey may even threaten to harm themselves if parents make them go to school, and yet their parents can still be threatened with fines and court action.\nFran Morgan, whose daughter experienced school anxiety, set up support organisation Square Peg to help other families in similar situations.\n\"We are seeing a tsunami on the horizon,\" she says.\nThe issue is poorly understood and often incorrectly labelled \"school refusal\".\n\"It's not about refusal - it's not a child that won't do something. It's about a child that physically can't,\" Fran says.\n\"It's a debilitating level of anxiety which prevents attendance and the consequences to families are catastrophic.\"\nMany parents are being prosecuted and fined under legislation put in place to stop parents taking children on holiday in term time.\n\"But it's penalising all those parents whose children are stuck in the system,\" Fran says.\n\"We know all the problems with the special educational needs and disability system, we know the problem accessing children mental health services - a lot of those children are the ones who are struggling to attend and parents are being penalised for that.\"\nMatty, 16, from West Yorkshire, missed 18 months of schooling, after struggling with his mental health and having panic attacks.\n\"I don't think people understand it,\" he says.\n\"If I broke my leg, people would understand it - but they don't understand it because it's not visible.\n\"I just didn't want to go in - just like dread, almost, of going in.\" \nMatty's mother, Heidi Mavir, says: \"It was really tough for both of us, all of us really. \n\"He was desperate to go to school - he really wanted to be in school. \n\"He kept saying, 'I'll try again Mum. I'll try really hard.'\n\"But I think what people don't understand about mental health and anxiety in particular is, like any health problem, if you can't do something, you can't do something.\n\"No amount of trying to think yourself out of it will make any difference to that.\"\nMatty is now at a specialist school.\nSinclairs Law chief executive Mike Charles, a specialist solicitor in education law, says he is dealing with about 50 requests for help with the issue a week.\n\"We are facing an unprecedented crisis of proportions we have never seen in certainly my experience, spanning 30 years,\" he says.\n\"School anxiety and generally the mental health of our children has been a massive issue for many years but it's particularly more pronounced since the pandemic, because the impact this has had on children has undoubtedly affected their mental health in a very substantial way.\"\nBeth Bodycote founded the support group Not Fine In School nearly four years ago.   \nBut over the year to September 2021, coinciding with school lockdowns and the pandemic, its membership grew by nearly 50% - to 17,924.\nIncreasing numbers of children and young people are struggling with mental-health issues, including anxiety, stress, and depression, but many schools are adopting a stricter approach to attendance, Beth says.\n\"For instance, we have seen families who had organised a temporary part-time timetable being told it is now no longer possible,\" she says.\n\"Fines and court action remain a threat for many parents even though these punitive actions do nothing to resolve the underlying causes of absence from school.\n\"There needs to be a move away from strict blanket policies about attendance and behaviour, to adopt a much more flexible and child-led approach, especially for children and young people who are struggling.\" \nParents are often asked to provide evidence of mental ill health causing absence - but a GP's letter is often insufficient. \nAnd many families may still be waiting for mental-health support or have had it refused.\nA Department for Education official said: \"In exceptional circumstances, head teachers have discretion to authorise absence - and fines should only be used as a last resort. \n\"Where a pupil does not attend, the school, family and council should work together to agree a plan for attendance, because the classroom is the best place for their education, development and wellbeing.\""

      "tags": "Dominic Raab,Boris Johnson,Cabinet reshuffles,Robert Buckland,Gavin Williamson",
      "text": "Boris Johnson is overseeing a reshuffle of his cabinet. \nBBC editors and correspondents look back at the performances of the politicians leaving their job - and the challenges facing those who are taking over.\nDominic Raab is always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. \nAnd given that his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected suggests that he fought his move pretty hard. \nBeing justice secretary, running prisons, courts and the legal system, is of course a huge job. And it matches his legal experience too. \nBut there's no doubt that it is a demotion, losing out on one of the most prestigious jobs in government as foreign secretary. \nDowning Street doesn't want this to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, as a debacle in Afghanistan, Mr Raab even taking his family holiday during the crisis. \nBut even with the bauble of deputy prime minister as part of his title (you wonder if title was a product of the tetchy conversations), Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government.\nThe new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post.\nAs a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit.\nShe will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy.\nLike the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: \"I don't think anyone would describe me as diplomatic.\"\nNext week, Ms Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York.\nShe will play a key role in the government's efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair.\nFor the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting.\nGavin Williamson found himself in the hot seat when schools closed their classrooms, and moved to on-and-off remote learning. It put him in the firing line for criticism from overstretched and exasperated head teachers and parents, as government policy led to sudden changes in direction. \nAs schools in England geared up to support the poorest families through hard times, they faced delays, first with food vouchers, then with devices. Confusing England footballer Marcus Rashford with another black sportsman added to the perception of being prone to gaffes.\nBut it was in the days before and after A-level results of 2020 in England when the chaos peaked. The education secretary defended the system, before a massive U-turn that felt inevitable. \nMr Williamson has said he is most proud of his contribution to giving skills a higher profile. The cost of implementing an eye-catching promise of a life-long learning loan will be in his successor's in-tray, as will looming decisions about future university funding.\nFor a government committed to levelling up, the long-term impact of the pandemic on the poorest children's education is the other big challenge. The \u00a33bn promised for catch-up fell so far short that the government's own adviser resigned earlier this year. \nThere have been eight justice secretaries since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 - and Robert Buckland's two years, one month and 22 days makes him the third-longest holder of a post that the entire legal establishment regards as having being treated as an afterthought. \nMr Buckland, a respected lawyer and former judge, leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. \nThat's 4,000 more than in January, when official watchdogs warned that the backlog was already of grave concern. \nThe upshot is that some victims will be waiting four years for justice. Incoming Justice Secretary Dominic Raab may not have actually been appointed to deal with this problem - but to take on an ideological challenge. \nMr Raab has credentials for speaking up on some human rights legal issues, yet he is also one of the most vocal critics of the Human Rights Act, one of the cornerstones of the modern British constitution. \nHe's long called for it to be replaced or repealed - and the government's long-promised review of human rights law is now in his hands. We'll soon find out where Mr Raab ultimately stands on one of the most important but misunderstood legal issues of our times.\nShe's the 10th culture secretary in 10 years.\nNadine Dorries, a successful novelist, a former contestant on I'm a Celebrity (which led to a brief suspension of the Conservative whip) and a strong advocate of gender equality on the BBC certainly has a track record in taking an interest in cultural matters.\nIn 2017 she tweeted: \"Left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy, tearing down historic statues, removing books from universities, dumbing down panto.\"\nHer move to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) came on the day her predecessor, Oliver Dowden, was due to deliver his opinions on the future of Channel 4. That speech was instead made by media minister John Whittingdale.\nSport, gambling, the future of the BBC, broadband services: the DCMS has a broad remit that covers everything from dealing with the tech giants to helping to alleviate loneliness.\nAnd over recent months Mr Dowden has increasingly entered debates about so-called \"woke culture\", statues and removing \"contested heritage\". \nThis is political territory on which the new culture secretary has already expressed strong views."

The charity's trustees oversee its day-to-day activities.\nAn investigation has been launched into the allegations relating to Mr Fawcett, by an independent team on behalf of the foundation's trustees.\nA Clarence House spokesman said of that investigation: \"The Prince of Wales fully supports the investigation now under way at the foundation.\""
