      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic,GP",
      "text": "The rate of face-to-face GP consultations in England has changed little since the winter lockdown, data shows. \nJust 58% patients were seen face-to-face in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions.\nThat compares with 54% in January and over 80% before the pandemic. \nAnalysis of the NHS Digital data by the BBC also shows significant variation with some areas seeing less than half in-person, but others close to 75%.\nGPs said rising demand and shortages of staff meant they were struggling to see more people face-to-face. \nThe problems have started to have a knock-on effect on A&Es, with emergency care doctors saying a lack of GP access is a key factor in the high numbers turning up at hospital.\nMinisters and NHS England have both demanded more patients should have in-person consultations - and say GPs are being given the money to provide them. \nKatie Awdas lives with endometriosis, a painful chronic condition. \nThrough the pandemic she's needed surgery and other medical treatment. \nIt disrupted her work as a teacher and is a period she describes as \"the most difficult of my life\". \nKatie, who is in her mid 30s and lives in Manchester, needs regular check-ups as her symptoms change - but has not seen a GP face-to-face since the pandemic began. \n\"I've had to describe where the pain is - you can't really show somebody where 'here' is over the phone.\n\"It's frustrating. There were times where I thought this would be so much easier face-to-face. \n\"They had to guess on what was happening based on my description, and had to use a process of elimination in some cases - 'try this and see if it works, if not we'll try something else'. This caused excruciating pain on top of what was going on already.\"\nBefore the pandemic, it was reported that more than 80% of patients were seen face-to-face in the surgery or via home visits. \nBut during the first lockdown last spring, that dropped below 50% and has struggled to recover significantly since.\nFor all of this year it has been hovering between 50% and 60%. \nIn areas such as South East London, East Staffordshire and South Sefton in Merseyside reporting under half of their consultations are done in-person.\nBut in North Tyneside 74% are.\nGP leaders admitted they would like to hold more face-to-face consultations, but there was simply not enough staff. Data shows the number of full-time GPs has fallen by 7% in the past five years, despite a government drive to increase the numbers. \nThe Covid vaccination programme, rising demand partly driven by people needing support as they have to wait longer for hospital treatment and the increased frailty in older populations because of the pandemic have all increased workload. \nRoyal College of GPs chair Prof Martin Marshall said: \"The workforce is simply not big enough to manage.\" \nHe said remote consultations did work for many, but added GP knew many more patients wanted to see their doctors face-to-face, particularly those with complex health needs. \nThe problems accessing GPs have had a knock-on effect on to other services. \nA&Es saw some of their busiest months ever over the summer, and ambulance response times have deteriorated. \nAn analysis by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) said a lack of access to GPs was a key factor with some, such as older people, those with disabilities and families on low incomes, struggling with remote appointments in particular.\n\"A&Es are always open, so if patients do struggle to get a face-to-face appointment with their under pressure GP they may feel the need to attend their emergency department,\" added RCEM president Dr Katherine Henderson.\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government was \"hugely grateful to GP practices for their hard work and dedication\".\nBut he added: \"We're clear GP practices must provide face-to-face appointments to those who want them.\""

      "text": "A police boss whose comments on the Sarah Everard case sparked outrage has resigned hours after a no-confidence vote.\nNorth Yorkshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Philip Allott had faced sustained criticism for urging women to be \"streetwise\" in a radio interview.\nThe backlash culminated in the unanimous vote passed by the county's Police, Fire and Crime panel.\nIn response Mr Allott said he would \"do the decent thing\" and leave his post.\nThe Conservative commissioner had faced multiple calls to stand down since 1 October, when he told BBC Radio York that women should educate themselves about powers of arrest, saying they should know \"when they can be arrested and when they can't be arrested\".  \nHe made the comments after it emerged serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens had used his warrant card to falsely arrest Ms Everard for breaching coronavirus guidelines.\nMembers of North Yorkshire's Police, Fire and Crime panel had echoed calls for Mr Allott to quit and urged him to \"go now\" at a meeting prior to Thursday's no-confidence vote.\nIn an open letter issued hours later, Mr Allott said he had spent the past two weeks trying \"to rebuild trust and confidence in my work as commissioner\".  \nAnnouncing his resignation, he wrote: \"Following this morning's meeting of the Police and Crime Panel it seems clear to me that the task will be exceptionally difficult, if it is possible at all.\n\"It would take a long time and a lot of resources of my office and the many groups who do excellent work supporting victims.\"\nCarl Les, the Conservative leader of North Yorkshire County Council and chair of the panel, said Mr Allott had done the right thing.\n\"Clearly the remarks he made had a catastrophic effect on trust and confidence in his role and him personally,\" he said.\nMr Allott, in his resignation letter, said he apologised \"unreservedly\" for his remarks, which did not reflect his views.\n\"I misspoke and I am devastated at the effect that this has had on victims of crime and the groups that support them,\" he said.\n\"I have tried to say this again and again but I recognise that what I have said has not always been heard as I intended.\"\nThe letter will be submitted to officials, kicking off the process of installing a temporary replacement for Mr Allott. \nAfter his resignation letter was made public, Mr Allott tweeted that he had \"become the story\" and was a \"distraction\" to protecting victims of violence.\nHe added: \"Doing what's right is hard!\"\nHis resignation has highlighted the difficulties of removing a commissioner from office.\nMr Les said he thought it was \"perverse\" that the commissioner could remove a chief police officer, but could not himself be removed.\n\"I think in the same way that MPs are subject to a recall mechanism I think commissioners should be subject to something similar.\"\nLabour's Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said it was \"absolutely right\" that Mr Allott had resigned.\nMr Thomas-Symonds added: \"His awful comments show that misogyny needs tackling and the community response to them shows it will no longer be tolerated.\" \nHe said there was a lack of leadership from the Conservative Party which should have pushed him to resign earlier.\nThe Women's Equality Party said Mr Allott's resignation showed the \"power of protest\", but added he should have resigned earlier after making the remarks.\nYork Central Labour MP Rachael Maskell said the government had been too slow to respond to the furore that had engulfed Mr Allott following his remarks. She tweeted: \"Women must be listened to.\"\nMeanwhile, West Yorkshire's Labour mayor Tracy Brabin said her thoughts were with Ms Everard's family, who live in York and were Mr Allott's constituents. She tweeted: \"Finally. The right decision.\"\nThe North Yorkshire branch of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), which had earlier said members were \"outraged\" by Mr Allott's comments, also welcomed his resignation.\nIn a tweet, the FBU said: \"Hopefully his resignation will offer some comfort for Sarah Everard's Family and friends and all those affected by his disgraceful comments.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "Brexit: What has the European Court of Justice got to do with the NI Protocol?",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,European Court of Justice,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Simon Coveney,Reality Check,European Union",
      "text": "The UK government has said it wants to remove the European Court of Justice from its oversight role as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol, saying as long as it continues the protocol will never survive. The EU, on the other hand, has said it would be very hard for the protocol to continue without the court's oversight. So what is the ECJ, what is its role in the protocol and what are the possible alternatives?\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg.\nIt is actually composed of two separate courts - the Court of Justice and the General Court. From 2004 to 2016 there was a third court, the Civil Service Tribunal, but its work is now done by the General Court.\nTo avoid confusion this article will refer to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to describe the work of the entire institution.\nIf you want to know more detail, or look up a specific case, you can do so here.\nIt's not to be confused with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which is a separate institution and is not part of the European Union.\nIt decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and it settles disputes between them.\nIt ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties and it allows member states to challenge EU legislation.\nIt interprets EU law at the request of national courts.\nTaken all together, this means that the ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, and pretty much everything else that the EU does.\nUnder the terms of the protocol - agreed jointly by the UK and EU as part of the Brexit deal - Northern Ireland continues to follow EU rules on product standards, which enable the free movement of goods in the EU's single market.\nMany goods need to be inspected when they arrive at Northern Ireland's ports and customs documents have to be filled in.\nThe agreement that created the protocol states that representatives from the EU have the right to oversee its implementation and application.\nIt also states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland. \nIf there was a dispute around compliance with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ, which would rule on whether the UK was in breach of its obligations under the terms of the protocol.\nIn any cases brought before the ECJ, the UK would participate in proceedings in the same way as an EU member state.\nBrexit Minister Lord Frost wants the ECJ's role in overseeing the protocol to be removed.\nIn a paper published in July, the government said it had only agreed to the ECJ's role because of the \"very specific circumstances\" of the protocol negotiation.\nIt now wants a new governance arrangement in which disputes should be \"managed collectively and ultimately through international arbitration\".\nThis objection to the ECJ's role can be linked back to the Brexit referendum. In fact it goes right back to one of the problems that British Eurosceptics have always had with the EU - the fact that European courts were able to rule on matters of EU law in the UK.\nDuring the Brexit campaign a key slogan for the leave campaign was \"take back control\".\nThen at the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, the new Prime Minister Theresa May said: \"We are not leaving (the EU) only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen.\"\nVague promises to take back control of our laws suddenly became a very specific promise to end the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK. It became a government red line.\nBut that did not stop the government signing up to the NI Protocol, complete with ECJ oversight. It is that which Lord Frost now wants to change.\nThe EU is bringing forward its own proposals on Wednesday, but these will focus on easing practical problems with the movement of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, rather than changing oversight arrangements.\nSpeaking early in October, European Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d  said: \"I find it hard to see how Northern Ireland would stay or would keep the access to the single market without oversight of the European Court of Justice.\"\nThere was also a strong response from Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney after Lord Frost reiterated that he wanted the ECJ removed from its oversight role.\nMr Coveney said the UK's demands on the protocol could \"cause a breakdown in relations\" with the EU.\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland programme he added that the UK's dismissals were now \"more serious\", given the comprehensive compromise proposals the EU is bringing forward.\n\"Each time the EU comes forward with new ideas, new proposals to try to solve problems, they are dismissed before they are released and that is happening again this week,\" Mr Coveney said.\nHe said dismissals were being seen across the EU as \"the same pattern, over and over again\" by the UK.\nWe need to wait and see what exactly the UK government is proposing, but some hypothetical alternatives have been mooted.\nOne alternative that has been suggested is the model associated with dispute resolution used in the main withdrawal treaty with the EU and bilateral treaties the EU has concluded with neighbouring countries like Ukraine.\nUnder these treaties, proceedings go to an arbitration panel before proceedings in front of the ECJ, but only for questions of interpreting EU law.\nDavid Phinnemore, professor of European politics at Queen's University Belfast, says one problem with this from the EU's point of view is that the EU is clear that the only body that can interpret EU law is the ECJ - not an intermediary such as the arbitration panel.\nBut Anton Spisak, trade policy lead at the Tony Blair Institute, suggests it could provide a \"landing zone\" for the UK government and the EU.\nHe says that while the ECJ is the only body that can interpret EU law, the arbitration panel acts as the \"default arbiter\".\nIn his view the UK is ultimately prepared to accept a \"more narrow role for the ECJ not as a default, but only in those circumstances where EU rules apply\".\nHe says: \"The arbitration panel is the one making the ultimate decision, but the panel has to take the views of the ECJ into account.\n\"This is the way the EU has dealt with other third countries applying EU law in the past and the reason why I think it is a realistic proposition is that the EU recently put it on the table with Switzerland.\"\nAnother possible alternative is something along the lines of the EFTA Court, which is responsible for the three countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA): Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\nProf Phinnemore says: \"In theory that is a a possible alternative, but it would mean setting up a dedicated court for Northern Ireland.\"\nHe also points out that the EFTA Court rules in line with the jurisprudence of the ECJ.\nMr Spisak also does not believe the EFTA Court is a practical solution.\nProf Phinnemore says: \"There is no precedent that allows anything other than the ECJ to rule on EU market rules.\n\"If you want to be part of the single market for goods you have to follow EU rules and I cannot see the EU moving away from that\".\nMr Spisak says: \"In a sensitive debate like this it is useful to start from the first principals. If there are EU rules in the protocol, whether now or in some kind of renegotiated agreement, it is simply unavoidable for the ECJ to be an arbiter of those rules. \n\"And because it is unlikely to have a protocol where EU rules don't feature at all, both sides have to find a way of accommodating the ECJ within that agreement.\"\nBut he believes there is a possible compromise to be struck.\nHe says: \"There is a technical solution that looks like a more standard international treaty but involves the ECJ in specific circumstances. The real difficulty is political.\n\"The EU compromising on the ECJ would signal to the UK that it is ready to renegotiate a key part of the protocol, which it has said it wouldn't do.\"\nAt the moment, things remain uncertain.\nBBC News NI's Economics and Business Editor John Campbell says there are two schools of thought about how this latest negotiation is shaping up.\nThe first is that Lord Frost's hard line on the ECJ is standard pre-negotiation tactics, aimed at grinding out another concession or two.\nAfter all the Brexit process has always delivered a deal, even at times when it seemed improbable.\nThere is another view, hinted at by Mr Coveney, that maybe the UK doesn't want a deal unless it's total victory.\nUnder that scenario the UK would go through the motions before triggering Article 16.\nIt would use this to gut the protocol while calculating that the EU's ability to retaliate is limited or or at least would take a long time to amount to anything.\nWe should find out which view is right by the end of this year."

      "tags": "Social care,Home care,Employment,Care homes,NHS England,NHS",
      "text": "Shortages of care staff, who support older or disabled people in the community, are causing major problems for hospitals, the BBC has learned. \nNHS chief executives say rising numbers of patients are stuck in hospitals in England due to a lack of care staff. \nThe situation is \"dire\", according to NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts.\nThe government says extra funding and a regular recruitment drive will help boost the care workforce. \nCare companies are facing acute problems in recruiting and retaining staff, according to a report which suggests there are now more unfilled care jobs than before the pandemic. \nThe annual Skills for Care workforce report is based on data provided by a representative sample of employers of England's 1.54 million care workers.\nThe researchers calculate that employers were failing to fill 8% of posts before the pandemic.\nFigures obtained since suggest this had fallen to below 6% by June 2020 - but by August this year the trend had reversed with 8.2% of care sector roles unfilled. \nThis amounts to more than 100,000 posts with no-one to fill them, says Skills for Care. \nIncreasingly, care companies are forced to turn down work supporting patients as they move from hospital back to their own homes or care homes. \nThose patients have to stay in hospital longer, putting more pressure on an NHS already struggling with Covid-19 and the waiting list backlog. \n\"We've just tipped over the point where delayed discharges are a bigger problem than Covid,\" said one hospital boss who asked not to be named. \n\"Roughly 100 beds blocked and domiciliary care providers are handing dozens of [patient care] packages back to the council as they don't have staff to deliver them,\" said another. \nA third manager had 140 patients ready to leave hospital, but the carer shortage meant \"patients are dying in hospital when their choice was home, a hospice or nursing home\".\nThe anonymous comments from more than 20 hospital bosses were gathered by NHS Providers, in response to a BBC request for information. \nThe organisation's deputy chief executive, Saffron Cordery, said the delays are particularly worrying as winter is about to put extra pressure on services. \nNot being able to leave hospital when they are ready can delay a patient's recovery and rehabilitation, said Ms Cordery, while those waiting for treatment face backlogs.\n\"It's vital that government delivers its commitment to place vital social care services onto a sustainable footing.\"\nShe also highlighted the need for \"crucially - a sustainable workforce, properly valued and respected for this vitally important work\". \nCare companies say the main factors making it hard to find and keep staff are: \nIn Sheffield, Tracey Hobson, a clinical manager at Northfield Nursing Home, says: \"Recruitment is an absolute nightmare\". \n\"You wake up in the morning and you're thinking, you know, I'm not going to be able to ensure that these people get the care that they deserve, and have enough staff to do it.\"\nTracey says the sector faces a national staff shortage. She personally receives about 20 messages each day from recruitment agencies, desperate to hire her. \n\"You know, I've got a job. I'm looking after people to the best of my ability.\"\nIn Buckinghamshire, Dr Kris Owden runs Caremark Aylesbury and is also a doctor who worked on hospital wards during the pandemic. \nThe firm pays relatively well and has managed to recruit enough new staff to replace most of those leaving but Dr Owden says they are still overstretched and have to refuse up to eight new people needing care each day.\n\"For us to be in this position before the winter, before the Christmas period is terrifying,\" he said. \nHe says a properly resourced care system would take pressure off the NHS and wants to see carers paid better, with a proper career structure and recognition of their skills. \nAmong his senior staff, supervisor Charlotte Backhouse and manager Vicky Hartgill - who are both normally office-based - are having to step in and do front-line work.\nOn top of her regular job, Vicky worked through the weekend and on Monday had an 05:00 start. Although she loves seeing clients, she says she is \"shattered\". \nShe added: \"We need to be able to recruit, we need to be able to recruit in a safe way and just have a bigger workforce.\n\"We do have to pick up the phone and change times. We do have to be creative with the care that we provide - and until we can get some more people through the door to support us, that's the way things will have to stay.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"We appreciate the dedication and tireless efforts of care workers throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. \n\"We are providing at least \u00a3500m to support the care workforce as part of the \u00a35.4bn to reform social care.\n\"We are also working to ensure we have the right number of staff with the skills to deliver high quality care to meet increasing demands. \n\"This includes running regular national recruitment campaigns and providing councils with over \u00a31bn of additional funding for social care this year.\""

      "text": "Shoppers can be reassured ministers are doing \"absolutely everything we can\" to fix supply chain issues in the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said.\nIn recent days, several retailers have warned of potential shortages during the Christmas shopping season.\nSpeaking to the BBC at the end of G7 meetings in Washington, Mr Sunak blamed global factors for delays seen at ports such as Felixstowe.\nIt comes as G7 finance ministers agreed to work together to address the issues. \nMr Sunak said: \"I'm confident there'll be a good amount of Christmas presents available for everyone to buy.\"\nHis comments came after a container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked concerns among businesses, ahead of the most important period of the year for retail spending.\nOn Wednesday, the UK's largest commercial port said the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers.\nThe Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages.\nHowever, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days.\nMeanwhile, shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it was rerouting some of its biggest ships away from the port.\nAt the same time, one of biggest ports in the US will start operating 24 hours a day to try to clear long queues of cargo ships.\nThe Port of Los Angeles in California said it will handle more goods at night after a similar move by nearby Long Beach port.\nThe ports - which handle 40% of all cargo containers entering the US - have faced months of problems.\nMajor US firms such as Walmart and FedEx have also committed to increasing their round-the-clock operations to help clear the jam, the White House said on Wednesday.\nMr Sunak was speaking after the G7 agreed to work more closely together to monitor issues facing the movement of goods around the world.\nThe meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors discussed the importance of global co-operation to ensure that supply chains are more resilient as the world emerges from the pandemic.\nThe G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. Ministers and officials from the member countries hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events.\nIn the BBC interview, Mr Sunak largely focused on the situation for industry in the UK - and he said he completely rejected the assertion of the head of UK Steel that the government had created a \"hostile environment\" for industrial investment and levelling up.\nBut when asked if he, as chancellor, was prepared to accept that high gas prices would put some heavy industry out of business he said he had to make sure taxpayers' money was protected and that \"it's not the government's job to come in and start managing the price of every individual product\". \nMr Sunak said the government would work constructively with businesses after Prime Minister Boris Johnson blamed shortages on UK firms \"mainlining\" migrant labour, pointing to the appointment of the former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis as a supply chain tsar.\nHowever, the chancellor also said \"everyone\" including Mr Johnson accepts that increasing wages without increasing productivity would be inflationary. \nHe said the move to a high wage, high-skill economy advocated by Mr Johnson would \"obviously take time\"."

      "tags": "Oslo,Norway",
      "text": "Four women and a man were killed and two others wounded when a man used a bow and arrow to attack them in Norway.\nPolice first received word of an attack in the town of Kongsberg, south-west of the capital Oslo, at 18:12 local time (16:12 GMT).\nA Danish man aged 37 has been arrested and questioned for hours overnight.\nPolice said they had previously been in contact with him over fears of radicalisation after he converted to Islam. \nThe victims were all aged between 50 and 70, regional police chief Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters on Thursday morning.\nHe said they were most likely killed after the police first confronted the attacker at 18:18.\nReports of the incident were \"horrifying\", said Prime Minister Erna Solberg, hours before she was due to leave office.\n\"I understand that many people are afraid, but it's important to emphasise that the police are now in control,\" she said.\nThe attacker is said to have launched the assault inside a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. One of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the shop at the time.\nA spokesperson for the chain later confirmed a \"serious incident\" at their store, adding that none of their staff were physically injured. \nLocal police chief Oyvind Aas confirmed that the attacker had managed to escape an initial confrontation with police before an arrest was finally made at 18:47 local time, 35 minutes after the attack began.\nOne witness told local outlet TV2 she had heard a commotion and seen a woman taking cover, then a \"man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand\".\n\"Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,\" she added.\nPolice have told Norwegian news agency NTB that the attacker also used other weapons during the incident, without giving more details on what they were.\nThe suspect moved over a large area, and authorities cordoned off several parts of the town. Residents were ordered to stay indoors so authorities could examine the scene and gather evidence. Surrounding gardens and garages were searched with the help of sniffer dogs.\nThe attack was Norway's deadliest since far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 people, most of them at a children's Labour Party summer camp on the island of Utoya in July 2011.\nKongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack that had taken place in an area where many people lived, and that a crisis team would help anyone affected.\nDescribing the town as \"a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people\", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by \"this very tragic situation.\"\nThe suspect was taken to a police station in the town of Drammen, where his defence lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, said he was questioned for more than three hours and was co-operating with authorities.\nThe suspect had a Danish mother and Norwegian father, he explained.\nNorway's outgoing justice minister Monica Maeland told reporters the police did not yet know whether or not it was act of terrorism and could not comment on details emerging about the suspect.\nPolice prosecutor Ann Ir\u00e9n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man had lived in Kongsberg for several years and was known to police. \nThe attack came on the final day of Erna Solberg's conservative government, and a new justice minister takes over the case on Thursday under a centre-left coalition led by Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store.\nMr Store said it was a \"gruesome and brutal act\", hours before announcing his new cabinet.\nNorwegian police are not usually armed and after the attack the police directorate ordered all officers nationwide to carry firearms as an extra precaution.\nPolice were searching the Huseby area of north-western Oslo on Thursday following reports of a man being seen carrying a bow and arrow. Police stressed no-one had been hurt and there was no threat.\n\"The police have no indication so far that there is a change in the national threat level,\" the directorate said in a statement (in Norwegian).

      "text": "The European Commission will later bring forward its much-anticipated proposals for resolving problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol. \nThe protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed in 2019 to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nIt keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, but that creates a trade border for some products travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \nUnionists say this undermines their place in the UK, but also creates fundamental problems for Northern Ireland firms. \nBBC News NI has spoken to a number of businesses across Northern Ireland which say they have been affected by the protocol. \nAndrew Lynas - Lynas Foodservice, County Londonderry\nThe Coleraine-base company says it has had to employ two people to specifically deal with protocol-related paperwork as well as find alternative suppliers.  \nIt delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers across the UK and Ireland. \nMr Lynas believes labour shortages, particularly with Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers in Great Britain, means many businesses in England, Scotland and Wales may \"cut their losses\" and reduce trade with businesses in Northern Ireland. \n\"We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, \" he says. \n\"We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives.\n\"There's just a lot of hassle and complexity and when you talk to a supplier in GB, they don't fully understand all the bits of that paperwork.\"\nMr Lynas believes scrapping the Northern Ireland Protocol \"isn't the answer\" but says a workable solution needs to be found. \nEamon McKey - Deli Lites, County Down\nEamon McKey, chief operating officer with County Down-based Deli Lites, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland, and the prospect of a hard border on the island was the company's \"greatest concern\".\nHe says the protocol has produced new opportunities for the firm.\n\"We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,\" he says. \nHe says he believes more people are now shopping locally, and Deli Lites has won a number of accounts that were previously serviced by competitors in Great Britain. \nHowever, challenges include a loss of some of the firm's suppliers in Great Britain. \n\"There are ongoing threats to our GB supply chain,\" he says. \nMr McKey says that, on one occasion, one of its suppliers lost \"valuable\" produce because of delays due to temperature checks during shipping.\n\"This has impacted on our service to our customer and we are waiting on a replacement delivery,\" he adds. \n\"That type of incident is likely to further restrict GB supply into Northern Ireland. We do see opportunities, but we also have had problems.\"\nJohn McGuinness - Garden Depot, County Tyrone\nThe Strabane-based garden firm is struggling to stock Christmas trees for the upcoming festive season. \nMr McGuiness sells about 600 Christmas trees each December, the majority of which in previous pre-Brexit years have been sourced from suppliers in Scotland. \nBut that's not the case this year. \nMr McGuinness says trees coming from Great Britain are now subject to \"protocols, customs and paperwork\" that complicates a process that had worked well before the UK and EU parted ways. \nA product like Christmas trees have a limited shelf life, he says, and any process that delays their delivery is not good for business. \n\"You only have a certain amount of time from when you cut a tree until it gets to someone's house and before it dies, so all of that has to be taken into consideration,\" he says. \nLarger stores than his that also sell trees are in a similar position, he adds, and businesses are looking to get trees from local suppliers. \nThat means \"there's less trees available and the price has gone up as well\", he says.\n\"I think we will get them, maybe not all the quantity, or all the different sizes that we would normally get, but we will be grateful to get what we do get.\"\nMichael and Lesley Cairnduff - Oscar Pet Foods, County Down\nThe Cairnduffs are the local nutritional advisers for Oscar Pet Foods in County Down, and have been providing a home delivery service for pet food and supplies for more than 25 years. \nThe company's head office is in Lancashire.\nMrs Cairnduff says their shipping costs have more than doubled in the first six months of this year compared to the same period in 2020. \n\"The first six months of this year were extremely worrying,\" says her husband.\nHe says the amount of administration time that head office now spends on Northern Ireland has increased by a factor of 50. \n\"For us here, it's gone up, our delivery work, the paperwork and red tape, by a factor of about 10. Obviously we'd prefer to spend that on customer service and marketing, and not using it for the Northern Ireland Protocol,\" he adds. \nMrs Cairnduff says food pallets coming from England are now taking 10-12 days, whereas it would have taken about four days pre-Brexit. \nShe says the EU should repurpose the trusted trader scheme, as they can prove they don't sell any of their produce on to the EU. \n\"If that was put in place, it would make life a lot simpler for us. Treat us the same as our counterparts in England are being treated,\" she says. "

      "tags": "Companies,Christmas,Retailing,Shipping industry,Felixstowe,Haulage",
      "text": "One of the UK's biggest toy retailers is warning delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. \nGary Grant, boss of The Entertainer, said it would get harder to get stock to the right places at the right time.\nBarbie dolls and Paw Patrol toys are among the children's favourites he expects to run out fast.\nThe government said that Felixstowe had reported \"improved capacity over the past few days\". \nA container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked widespread concern among retailers about future stocks.\nMr Grant said his 170 shops are looking \"very full right now\". But he added that demand \"will outstrip availability\" because there aren't enough drivers to move the company's stock. \n\"There'll never be toy shops with no toys. There will be toy shops without all the toys that they would normally expect to have due to the shortages, and that is largely down to transportation and warehouse issues, rather than there being a shortage of toys.\"\nThe shortage of drivers means that shipment containers are being offloaded but left stacked on the quayside waiting for collection. The dearth of drivers also means there is a delay in returning empty containers for re-use.\nThe problems come at the busiest time of the year for retailers, when most goods are imported from Asia to sell during Christmas trading. \nThomas O'Brien, managing director of Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, said there's \"plenty of stock\" but the real problem is that \"everything takes longer and is horrendously more expensive\" which means the company \"will be struggling to keep price increases to anything lower than 10%\".  \nItems that are in short supply include a sloth soft toy and the moody cow stress ball.\n\"Ironically the moody cow which we're short of is almost a nice acronym for how feel at the moment,\" he added.  \nWhile there are alternative toys, Mr O'Brien said the firm has lost six weeks of \"planning time\" to be able to re-stock at short notice. \nHe said containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $15,000 (\u00a311,003) rather than the normal rate of $2,500 in 2020.\nEntrepreneur Jack Griffiths, co-founder of loungewear company Snuggy, said he is expecting containers on five different ships, holdings \u00a31m worth of Christmas items, to arrive over the next week but they will now be delayed by three weeks. \n\"We're seasonal and we have to make the most of these months, 80% of our turnover comes from October to February.\"\nIn November, the business usually takes \u00a3500,000 worth of sales which Mr Griffiths said he \"probably won't be able to get in if we don't get that stock in time\". \nThe company has already run out of the SnuggyPod product which was due to arrive two weeks ago. Mr Griffiths said the product \"probably won't arrive for three weeks at Felixstowe and then it'll take three weeks to get them out of the port due to the driver issues\". He added that because the SnuggyPod is the firm's original design, there aren't any alternatives. \n\"As the weeks go by I can only see it getting worse which is just something we don't want to think about\". \nMr Griffiths anticipates he will have to get products shipped by railway and air rather than sea. It comes after \u00a3400,000 worth of his stock was delayed earlier in the year when it got stuck on the Ever Given ship which blocked the Suez Canal.\nSteve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas as well as other goods, says moving products from Rotterdam port to Felixstowe is delaying goods by two to three weeks.\n\"So things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China.\"\nWhile Mr Parks said Britain's shortfall in HGV drivers is \"largely\" to blame for the congestion at the port, other countries are experiencing problems, including the US and China.\n\"This is absolutely the worst period I have known, ever,\" he said. \"We can't get space on ships coming out of the Far East.\"\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said that fluctuating capacity at ports \"has been exacerbated by the ongoing global container and HGV driver shortages\".\n\"All ports across the UK remain open to shipping lines with Felixstowe reporting improved capacity over the past few days and the government continues to work closely with the freight industry, to tackle the challenges faced by some ports this autumn,\" the spokesperson said.\nAndrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said there was \"no need to panic buy\" but advised customers to start their normal shopping process earlier.\n\"If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks\".\n\"It's a challenge for small retailers because they don't have the cash to stockpile,\" he added.  \nThe UK's biggest commercial port Felixstowe told the BBC that it currently had 50,000 containers which were waiting to be collected, due to a shortage of HGV lorry drivers. \nOfficials at the port have asked the shipping lines to reduce their empty container stocks as \"quickly as possible\".\n\"It's not the port of Felixstowe affecting the supply chain, it's the supply chain affecting the port of Felixstowe,\" it said, adding that the problems are \"similar at all major UK ports\". \nDanish shipping giant Maersk has been forced to divert some of its larger ships from Felixstowe to ports in the Netherlands and Belgium to avoid delays. Smaller ships are then transporting the goods to the UK.\nA spokesman for the port of Rotterdam said it has been busy over the last couple of weeks, but said: \"It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place.\"\nThe pandemic is also being blamed in part for bottlenecks at US ports. President Joe Biden will meet with major US retailers as well as the bosses of ports on Wednesday to address the issues.\nSultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chief executive Dubai-based DP World, the global logistics giant which operates out of Southampton and London Gateway, said \"nobody knows how long it's going to take\" to resolve the congestion and shipping container shortages. \n\"I think it's going to take a long time,\" he said, adding: \"The problem is complicated because you have a backlog of cargo.\"\nThe UK Ports Association trade group, said most UK ports were operating normally but that the shortage of drivers meant \"some delays\".\n\"This has meant that some freight is not being collected as rapidly as it would normally. The situation is impacting all types of ports, not just container terminals. \nIndustry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit and a backlog of HGV driver tests.\nThe government recently drafted in military personnel to help with the driver shortages and deliver fuel. Emergency temporary visas have also been issued to foreign drivers.\nConservative Party chair Oliver Dowden told the BBC that the government was increasing the number of people having tests and that he would \"expect that number to increase as we approach Christmas\". \nAsked about potential Christmas shortages, he told Sky news: \"The situation is improving, I'm confident that people will be able to get their toys for Christmas.\""

      "text": "The Queen praised the spirit of the people of Wales during the pandemic as she opened the sixth term of the Senedd on Thursday.\nIn her first visit to Wales in five years, she told the Welsh Parliament that everyone owes a \"debt of gratitude\" to those who have served their communities.\nShe was accompanied by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.\nA 21-gun salute in Cardiff Bay marked the Queen's arrival in the city.\nPupils from nearby Mount Stuart Primary School greeted the royal party as they arrived at the Senedd steps.\nPeople nominated as Covid community champions for how they helped others during the pandemic were among the guests, as well as an Afghan family which fled the Taliban and is now living in Wales.\nPresiding Officer Elin Jones called the ceremony a celebration \"of the diverse communities\" across the country.\nThe event marks the ceremonial start of the term since May's Senedd election, which returned Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford to power.\nAfter meeting Mr Drakeford and Ms Jones, mace bearer Shaz Khan led the Queen into the debating chamber. The mace was placed in its sconce in the Senedd to signify the official opening.\nWelsh National Opera's (WNO) youth branch performed traditional folk song Ar Lan yr M\u00f4r at the opening of the event.\nAddressing the Senedd, the Queen said: \"We all owe a debt of gratitude to those who have risen so magnificently to the challenges of the last 18 months, from key workers to volunteers who have done so much to serve their communities. \n\"They are shining examples of the spirit for which the Welsh people are so renowned, a spirit which I have personally encountered so many times.\n\"It is a source of pleasure that both the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, together with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have had homes in Wales, and experienced its very special sense of community. \n\"The Welsh people have much to be proud of.\"\nShe said the decision to change the name of the institution from National Assembly for Wales last year \"demonstrates your status as a national parliament\".\nIts move to virtual meetings at the start of the pandemic was also praised.\nPoliticians now meet in what's known as a hybrid format, where some members use Zoom and others attend in person.\nThe Queen added: \"The fact that all parties showed a determination that you should continue to meet is commendable, and testament to your commitment to scrutinise the government, on behalf of the people of Wales.\"\nIn his speech, Mr Drakeford said the opening of the sixth session was \"a time for all of us to look to the future\". \n\"People from all corners of Wales, including those most distant from this building, have chosen 60 members to represent our collective ambitions and to steer a course for our country.\n\"I'm sure that we will argue and disagree about what is best for Wales, but always in this Senedd with the interests of those we represent at the centre of everything that we do.\"\nPresiding Officer Elin Jones opened the ceremony in the chamber, thanking \"all the people of Wales, health care workers in particular, for their extraordinary efforts during this time\".\nShe said work in the next term \"will undoubtedly focus on recovering from the Covid pandemic, but there will also be many other challenges and opportunities, from playing a leading role in tackling climate change to promoting equality and fairness for all in Wales\".\nDuring the official opening Eleri Griffiths and Oliver Edwards Davies of the Welsh Youth Parliament read a poem to the Senedd called Ein Llais.\nWritten by children from 24 primary schools, it spoke about their hopes for the future.\nOn her arrival the Queen met Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, senior Welsh Conservative Paul Davies and Welsh Liberal Democrat MS Jane Dodds.\nRoyal harpist Alis Huws performed for the guests.\nAfter the ceremony finished the Queen met the Covid community champions - people nominated by Members of the Senedd (MSs) for their work during Covid.\nT\u00e2n Cerdd, a group which includes black Welsh artists, performed an original song called Ymuno.\nAfter the queen left the Prince of Wales remained to take part in a reception, meeting a family recently relocated from Afghanistan.\nMace bearer Shaz Khan, from Cardiff and part of the Senedd's security team, said: \"It is just once in a lifetime, I'm very proud.\"\nAll 60 members of the Senedd were invited to the ceremony - the first time that all were allowed to be present in the chamber since the pandemic took hold.\nCovid has delayed this year's opening ceremony, which has been held soon after an election for every new term since the opening of the National Assembly in 1999.\nIt is not like the Queen's Speech in the Houses of Commons where she lays out the government's legislative programme; it is purely ceremonial.\nBut it does emphasise the role of devolution within the British constitution.\nThe event is not required by law, but has become convention to mark the start of a new term after a Senedd election.\nA key part is the mace, which was donated to the Senedd in 2006 by the parliament of New South Wales in Australia.\nIt is the first time it has been held since the law-making body changed its name to Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament."

      "tags": "CCTV,Amazon,Oxfordshire County Council,Voice-activated technology,Privacy",
      "text": "A judge has ruled that security cameras and a Ring doorbell installed in a house in Oxfordshire \"unjustifiably invaded\" the privacy of a neighbour.\nDr Mary Fairhurst claimed that the devices installed on the house of neighbour Jon Woodard broke data laws and contributed to harassment.\nThe judge upheld both these claims.\nMr Woodard now faces a substantial fine. He claimed he installed the devices in good faith as a deterrent against burglars.\nThe origin of the row stems from an invitation from Mr Woodard to his neighbour Dr Fairhurst to have a tour of his home renovations, during which she claimed he showed off his new security system. \nThe judgment reads that Dr Fairhurst was \"alarmed and appalled\" to notice that he had a camera mounted on his shed and that footage from it was sent to his smartphone.\nA series of disputes about the cameras followed, which resulted in Dr Fairhurst moving out of her home.\nIn the judgement it was found that the Ring doorbell captured images of the claimant's house and garden, while the shed camera covered almost the whole of her garden and her parking space. \nJudge Melissa Clarke found that audio data collected by cameras on a shed, in a driveway and on the Ring doorbell was processed unlawfully. She noted that at the time it was not possible to turn off the audio recording facility - that happened in an update in 2020.\nShe said that she found the audio data that could capture conversations \"even more problematic and detrimental than video data\".\n\"Personal data may be captured from people who are not even aware that the device is there, or that it records and processes audio and personal data,\" she said in her judgement.\nThat, she said, was in breach of UK data laws - both the UK Data Protection Act and UK GDPR.\nAmazon, which made both the doorbell and the cameras, said that customers must \"respect their neighbours' privacy, and comply with any applicable laws when using their Ring device.\"\n\"We've put features in place across all our devices to ensure privacy, security and user control remain front and centre - including customisable privacy zones to block out 'off-limit' areas, motion zones to control the areas customers want their Ring device to detect motion, and Audio Toggle to turn audio on and off.\"\nBut the judge added: \"Even if an activation zone is disabled so that the camera does not activate to film by movement in that area, activation by movement in one of the other non-disabled activation zones will cause the camera to film across the whole field of view.\"\nThe Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: \"Lots of people use domestic CCTV and video doorbells. If you own one, you should respect people's privacy rights and take steps to minimise intrusion to neighbours and passers-by.\"\nBut it added: \"In the vast number of cases, there are no issues.\"\nHannah Hart, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy, said: \"Whilst this case doesn't set a legal precedent, it does continue an ongoing conversation about our changing attitude towards domestic surveillance - and how normalised it has become in our communities.\n\"The fact remains that anyone with a Ring doorbell can turn their area of the neighbourhood into a surveillance space due to its video recording functionality and audio processors which are able to pick up sound 40 feet away. \n\"This means a small number of residents can effectively transform public spaces into surveillance hotbeds, and even share their recordings with police.\" "

      "tags": "Vietnam,Asia,Animal rights,Dogs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "As Covid infections spike, a Vietnamese couple left Long An province on a motorbike along with their pack of pet dogs. \nThey later tested positive for Covid-19. From their hospital beds, they found out 12 of their pets had been killed by authorities over fears the animals could spread the virus. \n\"My wife and I cried so much that we couldn't sleep,\" Pham Minh Hung, a 49-year-old bricklayer told the BBC.\n\"I didn't want to believe that really happened\u2026 I couldn't do anything to protect my kids,\" he said, referring to his dogs.\nTheir story, documented on social media app TikTok, has sparked huge backlash in Vietnam, and a petition calling for an end to the practice has gathered more than 150,000 signatures.\nThe latest wave of Covid-19 has been the worst to hit Vietnam since the start of the pandemic. \nA harsh lockdown in recent months has meant many migrant workers have been unable to make a living, prompting at least a million to flee big cities.\nPham Minh Hung and Nguyen Thi Chi Em, 35, were among them.\nOn 8 October they embarked on an 280km (173 mile) journey along with their dogs and three relatives, who also brought three dogs and one cat.\nThe couple headed for Khanh Hung in Ca Mau province, the hometown of a relative, as Covid cases are not as high there. \nMany witnesses posted videos about the couple's journey online, showing them on their motorbike with their dogs and belongings all piled on. The couple became popular with many social media users who cheered them on and wished them a safe journey. \nSome said their hearts melted a little when the couple used raincoats to cover their dogs in the pouring rain. A few even delivered water and food to them.\nThe couple started out with 15 dogs, but as their trip went on, they gave two dogs to a volunteer after entering Ca Mau province, while another died. The rest continued on.\nBut the couple and their three relatives tested positive for Covid after reaching Khanh Hung. It is mandatory for anyone travelling across provinces to undergo testing. They were transferred to a hospital for treatment - the animals were left at a quarantine centre.\nBut local authorities killed their 12 dogs and their relatives' pets without informing them, state media said. The article was later removed.\nIt's unclear how the animals were killed. The official police newspaper carried an image indicating they were burned.\n\"Disease control must be prioritised in the first place and the decision to kill the animals immediately was a necessary preventive measure,\" local official Tran Tan Cong said during a press conference on Sunday.\nThere was swift reaction online with many calling the decision \"cruel\" and \"heart-breaking\". \nActress Hong Anh, a member of global animal welfare organisation Four Paws, called it \"barbaric\" and said she would send a petition to the organisation.\nThe killings were \"unethical\" and \"ridiculous\" because there are no guidelines dictating pets must be killed if owners are infected, said Nguyen Hong Vu, a staff scientist of the City of Hope National Medical Centre in the US.\n\"There is no scientific evidence dogs and cats can be an intermediary for the transmission of Covid to humans. However, people with Covid can sometimes infect them,\" Dr Nguyen said.\nA study in Texas surveyed 76 dogs and cats from 39 households with Covid patients, and found three cats and one dog were infected. The animals were asymptomatic, or only displayed mild symptoms. They all rapidly recovered.\n\"There are multiple ways to make it right in this situation, such as quarantining them in a cage; contacting the owners' relatives or engaging a social organisation to take care of them until the owners recover,\" Dr Nguyen said.\nVietnam was lauded as a virus success at the start of the pandemic winning praise from the World Health Organization (WHO) with its quick response and widespread contact-tracing. But the Delta variant has brought the country to its knees.\nIt has reported 840,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths in total. The majority of cases were detected during the latest wave.\nVietnam has been heavy-handed in its virus control effort - even though Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said last month there should be a plan to \"live with the virus\".\nMany people have been charged and convicted for spreading the virus, with some jailed for five years.\nLast month, a video showing several police officers breaking into a flat in the southern Binh Duong Province went viral. They dragged out a woman thought to have been exposed to Covid to do a test as her young son cried. It led to massive public backlash.\nThe authorities' decision to cull the pets was not surprising, observer Le Anh said.\n\"The Vietnamese government has been putting the highest priority on the fight against the coronavirus. There is this slogan 'Fighting this pandemic is like fighting the enemy'. It means the country is at war. You cannot expect rational and humane behaviour during a war.\"\nThe hardest thing for Mr Pham was that he found out his beloved animals had been killed from others.\nHe is determined to hold authorities accountable. \n\"I raised my kids for about six years, I definitely want justice for my kids,\" he said from the hospital.\nAdditional reporting by Tran Vo."

      "text": "At least six people have been killed and 32 others injured by gunfire in the Lebanese capital, Beirut.\nIt began during a protest by the Shia Muslim groups Hezbollah and Amal against the judge investigating last year's huge blast at the city's port.\nThey said Christian snipers from the Lebanese Forces (LF) faction fired at the crowd to drag Lebanon into strife - a claim denied by the LF.\nHuge tension surrounds the probe into the port explosion that killed 219. \nHezbollah and its allies claim the judge is biased, but the victims' families support his work.\nNo-one has yet been held accountable for the August 2020 disaster, in which swathes of the city were devastated.\nIn response to Thursday's shooting, some of Lebanon's worst violence in years, Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced a day of mourning on Friday.\nMeanwhile, President Michel Aoun said: \"We will not allow anyone to take the country hostage to their own interests.\"\nWhat began as a protest outside the Palace of Justice - the main court building - by hundreds of people arguing the investigation had become politicised and demanding the removal of Judge Tarek Bitar escalated remarkably quickly, reports the BBC's Anna Foster in Beirut.\nHeavy gunfire erupted in the streets as the crowd passed through a roundabout in the central Tayouneh-Badaro area.\nLocal residents had to flee their homes and schoolchildren ducked for cover under their desks as men armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers - believed to have been members of Shia and Christian militias - exchanged fire in the streets.\nThe clashes continued for several hours before calm was restored.\nAt a nearby school, teachers instructed young children to lie face down on the ground with their hands on their heads, a witness told Reuters news agency.\nHospital and military sources said some of those killed were shot in the head. They included a woman who was hit by a stray bullet while inside her home.\nHezbollah and Amal accused a staunch opponent, the Christian Lebanese Forces party, of being behind the attack on the protesters.\nThe two Shia organisations said demonstrators were \"subject to an armed attack by groups from the Lebanese Forces party that deployed in neighbouring streets and on rooftops, and engaged in direct sniping activity and intentional killing\".\nLebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea condemned the violence and appealed for calm. \n\"The main cause of these developments lies in the presence of uncontrolled and widespread weapons that threaten the citizens at any time and in any place,\" he tweeted.\nMr Mikati called on everyone to \"calm down and not be drawn into sedition for any reason whatsoever\".\nThe army said it had deployed troops to search for the assailants, and warned that they would \"shoot at any gunman on the roads\".\nEarlier on Thursday, a court dismissed a legal complaint brought by two former government ministers and Amal MPs - Ali Hassan Khalil and Ghazi Zaiter - whom Judge Bitar has sought to question on suspicion of negligence in connection with the port explosion.\nThe two men, who deny any wrongdoing, accused the judge of bias.\nFamilies of the victims had condemned the complaint, which caused the probe to be suspended for the second time in three weeks. \nThey have accused the country's political leadership of trying to shield itself from scrutiny.\n\"Keep your hands off the judiciary,\" they warned the cabinet on Wednesday after ministers allied to Hezbollah demanded that Judge Bitar be replaced.\nThe port blast happened after a fire detonated 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a combustible chemical widely used as agricultural fertiliser, that had been stored unsafely in a port warehouse for almost six years.\nSenior officials were aware of the material's existence and the danger it posed but failed to secure, remove or destroy it."

That is untrue. \n\"The reality is that Brexit does not command the support or consent of the assembly,\" she said. \nThe proposals are a \"starting point\", but appear to fall \"far short of the fundamental change needed\", Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said. \nMr Donaldson said the party will \"take time to study the detail of the papers produced\".\nHowever, he said there was \"no escaping the reality that the Northern Ireland Protocol has harmed Northern Ireland, both in economic and constitutional terms\".\n\"The imposition of the protocol has harmed the balances created by the Belfast Agreement and subsequent agreements and were the situation to remain unaltered would undo the political progress of the last 20 years,\" he said. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood has urged political leaders to embrace the new proposals. \nThe Foyle MP said the measures \"go further than expected\" and demonstrate that EU leaders are \"stretching themselves in the interests of people and businesses in Northern Ireland\". \nHe said political leaders, particularly those of unionist parties, should \"reflect on the very serious efforts made by the European Commission\" in easing challenges to trade and \"addressing their concerns about democratic deficits\". \n\"The DUP, in particular, need to decide if they're on the side of people and businesses here or in the pocket of Boris Johnson,\" he said. \n\"There is now a clear landing zone that will address the protocol challenges, allow us to maximise the opportunities and most importantly, expend political energy dealing with the crisis in our health service, our crumbling schools estate and managing the pandemic. \n\"We need to grasp that opportunity.\"\nIt would be an \"act of folly\" for opponents of the NI Protocol to \"squander the opportunity to provide certainty and stability given by the EU's proposals\", Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry MP has said.\nDr Farry said he hoped the EU's proposals could form the basis for an agreement between the UK and EU which \"addresses practical issues around the protocol in a pragmatic way\". \n\"The challenges facing Northern Ireland come from Brexit,\" he said, adding that the protocol is \"the symptom of the problem, not the cause\".\n\"It would be an act of supreme folly to squander this chance to move on and indeed to impose even more delusional red-lines,\" he said. \nIt is \"a step forward but there remains a long way to go\", according to UUP leader Doug Beattie.\n\"We were told the protocol negotiations could not be reopened, but we have now proven otherwise. This has been achieved through negotiation, not threats; through engagement not disengagement.\n\"The fact that the EU recognises that the protocol isn't working and needs substantial change is a positive development.\n\"However, I am genuinely disappointed by what I heard from European Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and the supporting non-papers.\n\"Expectations were raised, but the proposals do not match them.\"\nThe EU's latest proposals \"utterly fail the sovereignty test\", TUV leader Jim Allister has said. \nMr Allister described the protocol as \"an instrument delivering both economic dislocation and constitutional dislocation within the UK\".\nHe said the proposals \"retain us in a foreign single market for goods, under a foreign customs code and VAT regime, ruled by foreign laws and adjudicated upon by a foreign court.\" \n\"GB would continue to be decreed a 'third country' vis-a-vis Northern Ireland's trade,\" he said, adding that this \"can never be acceptable\". \nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said both the UK and EU had listened to businesses and are aware of the technical solutions needed to protect trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\n\"Both sides must now grasp this opportunity to get back round the table - and agree sustainable long-term solutions that work for businesses and communities in Northern Ireland,\" CBI Europe Director Sean McGuire said.\nThe Northern Ireland Retail Consortium (NIRC) has welcomed \"signs of movement from both sides\". \nHowever, a spokesperson said if the proposals are to work they must provide \"stability, certainty, simplicity and affordability\" to Northern Ireland's business community. \nThey said the NIRC will \"reserve judgement\" on whether these requirements have been met \"until both legal and technical texts have been seen\". \n\"As an umbrella group for business, we will have meetings with both the UK Government and the European Commission to discuss these proposals in full and we look forward to understanding how they would keep NI business competitive and ensure choice and affordability for consumers,\" the spokesperson added. \nThe FSB in NI's Roger Pollen said there is now an onus on both sides to negotiate a new trade solution relatively quickly.\n\"In terms of the timescale as to when we need to get this sorted, yesterday would have been very nice,\" he said\nMr Pollen said under current arrangements many businesses in Northern Ireland are faced with \"vast amounts of bureaucracy\" when bringing goods across from GB.\nShould new arrangements be agreed by the UK and EU before Christmas, \"businesses would heave a fairly big sigh of relief\". \nSeamus Leheny, a representative of trade body Logistics UK, said companies across the UK are not concerned about the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) role in the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe UK Government has demanded that the ECJ is removed from its role in the protocol as the arbitrator of trade disputes.\nBut Logistics UK policy manager Mr Leheny told BBC News: \"We have got 18,000 members across the UK and we haven't had any representation from any member regarding the ECJ.\n\"What people want is solutions to the protocol, they want the protocol to work and that is what we are interested in.\"\nHe added: \"What people are looking for, we are in solution mode here, and the logistics industry, we are solution seekers. We want to get these fixes that the EU have proposed.\n\"We need to see the legal text obviously to make sure the safeguards are there but people just want to build on this because they see the best way for peace in Northern Ireland is improve people's prospects and livelihoods. That's when I speak to businesses, that's what they want.\" \nEuropean Commissioner and former MEP Mairead McGuinness said the offer was a \"significant step forward\" by the EU and a \"huge opportunity\" for people in Northern Ireland. \n\"Of course there will be difficult issues and there will be a lot of debate and commentary around this,\" she told the BBC.\n\"However, I do believe that the idea of getting this resolved by Christmas is attainable and it would be very desirable.\"\nThe Shadow Minister for Task Force Europe Baroness Jenny Chapman said that \"today could be a day where we take a step forward\" in the process to achieve stability to people in NI and across the UK.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Baroness Chapman said the Labour Party would not get rid of the protocol entirely, but would instead look at the proposals \"in good faith\" and talk to businesses, leaders and elected politicians in Northern Ireland to see if they were sufficient. \n\"What isn't the right way is to be antagonistic and pick a fight,\" she added.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Two more UK energy firms have ceased trading amid soaring wholesale energy prices.\nPure Planet, which is backed by oil giant BP, and Colorado Energy join a number of small energy firms that have gone bust recently.\nPure Planet said it had been caught between rising costs and the UK's energy price cap, which limits what companies can charge consumers. \nThis had left its business \"unsustainable\", it said.\nCustomers of both companies will be moved to new suppliers.\nPure Planet and Colorado Energy are the latest casualties of a global spike in gas prices. \nPure Planet supplies gas and electricity to around 235,000 domestic customers, while Colorado Energy has around 15,000 domestic customers.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem will now find a new supplier for those customers, who are asked to do nothing until the transfer takes place in the coming weeks.\nThe demise of Pure Planet and Colorado Energy takes the number of customers affected by the current wave of energy company collapses across the UK to around two million.\nOfgem said on Wednesday that the unprecedented increase in global gas prices in recent weeks was putting financial pressure on suppliers.\n\"Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers,\" said Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem.\n\"I want to reassure affected customers that they do not need to worry: under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue.\"\nMr Lawrence added that if customers have credit, the funds are protected, so customers will not lose the money that is owed to them.\nPure Planet said that the government and Ofgem expect it \"to sell energy at a price much less than it currently costs to buy\".\n\"This is unsustainable, and therefore, sadly we have had to make the difficult decision to cease trading,\" it said.\n\"In our case, despite being hedged until next spring, and having had the backing of BP, Pure Planet faced increasing risks and large potential losses by continuing to operate in this market,\" Pure Planet said.\n\"Sadly, this led to BP taking a decision to withdraw its support and we are no longer able to continue.\"\nBP said it had worked to support Pure Planet and give financial support through wholesale supply and other funding arrangements.\n\"However, despite considerable work over an extended period, we concluded it is no longer commercially viable for BP to continue this relationship and took this difficult decision,\" a BP spokesperson said.\nNine suppliers collapsed in September, but business and energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng has ruled out supporting struggling energy firms. Last week, he said more companies could collapse.\nThe regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on default tariffs by limiting charges including how much customers pay per unit of energy.\nBut providers say they can't pass on rising wholesale gas prices to customers because of the cap.\nSuppliers that have recently gone bust include Avro Energy, People's Energy and Green Supplier Limited.\nRising prices have had reverberations throughout the supply chain.\nBBC Newsnight reported on Wednesday evening that gas shipping firm CNG has written to its energy supplier customers saying that it will no longer supply the wholesale market.\nCNG supplies roughly 46,000 small businesses, including 10-15 small domestic energy suppliers, through their wholesale business.\nNewsnight economics editor Ben Chu tweeted that CNG had recently had to supply gas to households without being paid by suppliers that have failed, including Utility Point and Avro Energy.\nThis has caused a significant amount of financial damage to CNG, Mr Chu said.\nCNG leaving the market will put further pressure on small UK energy firms and could speed up their collapse, he added.\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "A Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, is at the centre of a dispute between the UK and the European Union (EU).\nSince it came into force at the start of 2021 the protocol has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested it could suspend parts of the arrangement by triggering part of the protocol known as Article 16.\nThe protocol allows lorries to deliver goods without having paperwork and goods checked when they cross the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.\nThis arrangement was easy to maintain before Brexit. When both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, they automatically followed the same EU trade rules, which meant no checks were required.\nHowever, a new arrangement was needed after Northern Ireland (along with the rest of the UK) left the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods, such as milk and eggs, arrive from non-EU countries. Similar rules exist in other areas, such as medicine licensing. \nTo try to get round the problem the UK and the EU negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is now part of international law.\nRather than checks taking place along the Irish border, it was agreed any inspections and document checks would take place between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) instead.\nThis was allowed after it was agreed that Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on product standards (part of the EU's single market rules). \nChecks on GB goods take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, this has led to criticism that a new trade border has effectively been created in the Irish Sea. \nUnionists are strongly opposed to the checks because they don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nAlso, not all checks under the protocol have been fully implemented yet. For example, supermarkets had reduced paperwork required under a temporary \"grace period\". However, the UK decided to extend these periods - something the EU said was a breach of international law. \nDespite signing up to the agreement in 2019, the UK government now says the protocol represented a huge compromise by the UK and has accused the EU of applying it too rigidly.\nThe UK is calling for changes, which include:\nArticle 16 is a set of three paragraphs in the protocol that allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss - now the UK's lead Brexit negotiator - said she would trigger Article 16 if the UK failed to secure changes.\n\"I want a negotiated solution but if we have to use legitimate provisions, including Article 16, I am willing to do that,\" she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\nIf the UK went down this route, it could prompt the EU to respond with measures that would impose tariffs (or import taxes) on aspects of trade between the two sides.\nThe EU has warned that any such move would \"lead to instability and unpredictability\".\nThe EU has set out proposals, but says a renegotiation of the text of the Protocol is out of the question:\nIn return, the EU wants extra safeguards to prevent products from Great Britain crossing into the Republic of Ireland.\nThe border is a sensitive issue because of the history of Northern Ireland and the agreements made to bring peace, which included the removal of visible signs of the border.\nThe fear is that if any infrastructure were to be installed, such as cameras or border posts, it could become a target and lead to political instability.\nDuring negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,European Commission,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU has released its plan for a reduction of post-Brexit checks on goods and medicines arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. \nNorthern Ireland has a special Brexit deal which keeps it in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nBut it means goods arriving from Britain face checks and controls.\nThe UK government said it is studying the detail of the EU's proposals.\nThe new plan, which seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit agreement, would remove about 80% of spot checks, the EU said.\nThe EU said customs paperwork would also be cut by 50%.\nThe UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers.\nAt the start of the year, the new post-Brexit arrangement - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIt involves keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods - but this, in turn, creates a new trade border with Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK.\nBrexit Minister Lord Frost said the protocol - which the UK originally agreed to - was harming the peace process in Northern Ireland and that it undermined the Good Friday Agreement. \nThe EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and is now attempting to ease that burden with what it calls \"a different model\".\nIt has produced \"bespoke arrangements\" covering food, customs and medicines. \nEuropean Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he had listened to, and engaged with, those in Northern Ireland. \n\"Today's proposals are a direct, genuine response to their concerns,\" he said. \n\"We have put a lot of hard work into them to make a tangible change on the ground.\"\nHe said he looked forward to \"engaging earnestly and intensively\" with the UK government.\nSome firms in Northern Ireland affected by the protocol say supply chains are being disrupted, and while there may be opportunities, there are also some problems. \nOn Wednesday, a UK government spokesman said the next step should be a \"rapidly conducted\" round of intensive talks on both the UK and EU proposals.\n\"Significant changes which tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol, including governance, must be made if we are to agree a durable settlement which commands support in Northern Ireland,\" he said.\nA solution is needed that both safeguards the Good Friday Agreement and \"puts the UK-EU relationship on a stronger footing\", he added. \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme that Prime Minister Boris Johnson told him \"personally that after agreeing to the protocol he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics\".\n\"I do believe that the government didn't really want this to happen to Northern Ireland and they took a short term bet.\n\"The trouble is this has cost the business people of Northern Ireland \u00a3850m which we can't afford, so it's got to be fixed and it's got to be fixed fast.\"\nTalks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the proposals were a \"major effort\" to address the post-Brexit trade rules between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\"Meats, whether they're chilled meats or other food stuffs, can come into Northern Ireland and if they're staying in Northern Ireland then the checks that are currently required will not be required,\" he said. \nThis would be dependent on proper sharing of data and proper labelling, he added. \nThere are also plans to give Northern Ireland politicians and other interested parties greater influence over the implementation of the protocol.\nHowever, the measures will fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role.\nOn Tuesday, the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost proposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one.\nAs part of these plans, the UK government wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ, which is the EU's highest court.\nThe agreement states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland - so for example, if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ.\nThe movement of food products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have faced the biggest difficulties due to the EU's strict rules.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal: It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).\nIt means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules: As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland.\nBut some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all: EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found.\nRead more: The Northern Ireland Protocol explained\nThe EU says its new plan for food means that most products destined for consumers will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nA grace period, which means the protocol is not being fully implemented, currently means that supermarkets do not face a full range of controls.\nThe EU says its new proposals will go beyond this and cover more businesses.\nIt says the level of identity and physical checks will be up to 80% lower compared to other single market borders. \nHowever, it says for this to work it will need the UK to build properly equipped border posts at Northern Ireland's ports, allow access to real time trade data and implement \"only for sale in UK\" labelling.\nThe possibility also remains that some GB food products could be banned in Northern Ireland.\nThe EU maintains a \"prohibited and restricted\" list of food imports, which includes chilled meat products like fresh sausages.\nThe EU is proposing that \"national identity goods\", or those which do not have a non-GB supply chain, would be exempt, but that leaves open the possibility that some goods could be banned.\nOn customs, the EU is proposing what it calls a \"unique facilitation\" for paperwork, which it says will mean Northern Ireland importers can submit a greatly reduced amount of information.\nIt estimates this will halve the administrative burden.\nIt will also expand the concept of \"goods not at risk\" - this is an existing arrangement which Northern Ireland traders use so they do not have to pay EU tariffs on GB goods.\nThe EU says the combination of the agri-food and customs proposals will effectively create an \"express lane\" to help facilitate the movements of GB goods whose end destination is Northern Ireland.\nThe supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has emerged as one of the most difficult issues. \nPharmaceutical distributors have warned that if the current protocol was fully implemented they would have to withdraw hundreds of products from sale in Northern Ireland.\nThe EU is now proposing to change its laws around the regulation of medicines to keep products flowing.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d has previously said he will do \"whatever it takes\" to guarantee the supply of medicines.\nThis is a complicated area and the pharmaceutical industry will need time to assess if the plan will work.\nThe EU originally floated a version of this idea in July but the industry was unconvinced at that time.\nThe proposals for giving Northern Ireland politicians and other stakeholders a greater voice include the establishment of structured groups to provide a forum for discussion on key issues.\nIt would also see interested parties invited to some meetings of the Specialised Committee, one of the joint UK/EU bodies that oversee the protocol.\nThe EU says it also wants to create a stronger link between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the EU/UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly.\nIt also intends to create a website to track which EU legislation is applicable in Northern Ireland.

      "text": "Microsoft is shutting down its social network, LinkedIn, in China, saying having to comply with the Chinese state has become increasingly challenging.\nIt comes after the career-networking site faced questions for blocking the profiles of some journalists.\nLinkedIn will launch a jobs-only version of the site, called InJobs, later this year. \nBut this will not include a social feed or the ability to share or post articles.\nLinkedIn senior vice-president Mohak Shroff blogged: \"We're facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.\"\nAnd the firm said in a statement: \"While we are going to sunset the localised version of LinkedIn in China later this year, we will continue to have a strong presence in China to drive our new strategy and are excited to launch the new InJobs app later this year.\"\nLinkedIn had been the only major Western social-media platform operating in China.\nWhen it launched there, in 2014, it had agreed to adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate there, but also promised to be transparent about how it conducted business in the country and said it disagreed with government censorship.\nRecently, LinkedIn blacklisted several journalist accounts, including those of Melissa Chan and Greg Bruno, from its China-based website.\nMr Bruno, who has written a book documenting China's treatment of Tibetan refugees, told Verdict he was not surprised the Chinese Communist Party did not like it but was \"dismayed that an American tech company is caving into the demands of a foreign government\".\nUS senator Rick Scott called the move a \"gross appeasement and an act of submission to Communist China\", in a letter to LinkedIn chief executive Ryan Roslansky and Microsoft boss Satya Nadella.\nZhaoyin Feng, BBC News, Washington \nIt's hard to pinpoint whether LinkedIn's move was driven by the pressure from China, or that from the US. It could be both, as the Chinese government has been tightening its grip over the internet, and meanwhile, LinkedIn has drawn growing criticism in America for bowing to Beijing's censorship rules.\nLinkedIn launched its Chinese version in 2014, hoping to tap into the country's huge market. \nSeven years on, it has struggled against local competitors and run into regulatory problems. In March, LinkedIn was reportedly punished by the Chinese regulator for failing to censor political content, resulting in a suspension of new user registration for 30 days. Other than controversy over censorships, the platform has been used by Chinese intelligence agencies as a recruitment tool. \nIn a letter to the platform's users in China today, President of LinkedIn China Lu Jian pledges that the site will continue to \"connect global business opportunities\".\nBut LinkedIn's shutdown in China shows an opposite trend. The country's heavily controlled internet has drifted further away from the rest of the world, and it's increasingly challenging for global business operating in China to bridge the deep divide."

      "tags": "Doctors,NHS,GP",
      "text": "A&E waits have sunk to their worst levels in England since the four-hour target started, with doctors warning the situation is bleak ahead of winter.\nA quarter of patients waited more than four hours for treatment in September - with even longer waits being recorded elsewhere in the UK.\nIt comes as ministers and GPs clashed over demands that practices see more patients face-to-face.\nThe government has handed GP practices \u00a3250m to take on temporary staff.\nBut the British Medical Association said they were \"hugely dismayed\" with the plan, saying it would not solve the problems.\nThe winter rescue package came on the day NHS England released its latest monthly data for hospital performance.\nLack of access to GPs has been cited as one of the reasons for growing pressures on A&Es.\nThe A&E performance in England was the worst performance since 2004, when the four-hour target was brought in. \nEven greater numbers are waiting over four hours in the other nations with four in 10 patients in Northern Ireland taking over four hours to be seen.\nIn England, A&E patients who then went on to be admitted to a ward also faced record-long waits for a bed, so-called \"trolley waits\" - they tend to be the most seriously-ill and frail patients.\nOf the 386,000 who were admitted, more than a quarter waited over four hours for a bed to become free. And more than 5,000 had to wait over 12 hours.\nDr Katherine Henderson, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: \"This data is bleak and is a stark warning of the crisis that we are heading towards this winter.\"\nShe added that emergency departments were \"dangerously\" over-crowded and there were widespread reports of ambulances queuing outside hospital because of the demands being placed on the system.\nThe \u00a3250m funding plan for GPs is part of the extra \u00a35bn Covid fund announced last month to help the NHS through the winter. It comes on top of the \u00a312bn set aside for GP services this year.\nAlongside locum doctors - doctors who stand in for others temporarily - GP practices will be able to use the money to recruit other temporary staff such as physios and podiatrists. Pharmacists are also being encouraged to see people with minor illness to relieve the pressure on GPs.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the new GP rescue package would help relieve pressure on the whole system.\nOnly 58% of patients were seen face-to-face in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions.\nThat compares with 54% in January and more than 80% before the pandemic.\nPatients have also complained of long waits on phone lines to book an appointment.\nKevin Fogarty said his 84-year-old mother was initially refused face-to-face contact with a GP, despite having an infection in her leg following a biopsy. \n\"She had not been seen for two years. However, an infection developed in the wound but the GP still wouldn't see her. We had to put pressure on them.\"\nMr Fogarty, 60, said the practice in Somerset eventually agreed to see her in person and she is now getting home visits from a nurse to tend to her wound.\n\"GPs seem to be the only group not getting back to normal services, while the likes of shop workers and everyone else are getting on with it. \n\"Telephone and video calls are helpful as an initial consultation, but the GP must see the patient should they insist or there is a requirement.\"\nAlongside the extra money, social distancing rules are also expected to be relaxed in GP surgeries and responsibility for signing fitness-to-work and fitness-to-drive certificates will be able to be passed on to other staff.\nMr Javid said: \"I'm determined to ensure patients can see their GP in the way they want, no matter where they live.\n\"Our new plan provides general practice teams with investment and targeted support. This will tackle underperformance, taking pressure off staff so they can spend more time with patients and increase the number of face-to-face appointments.\"\nGP surgeries will be named in league tables if they are judged to have failed to provide an appropriate level of \"access\". \nBut Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said he was \"hugely dismayed\" with the package. \"It offers very little and shows a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis on the ground.\"\nHe said patients would \"continue to suffer\" and find it harder to book appointments.\n\"It is disappointing to see there is no end in sight to the preoccupation with face-to-face appointments.\"\nHe said in-person appointments were still a key feature of GP care but the pandemic had proven phone or video consultations were \"entirely appropriate and appreciated\" by many.\nThe rescue package comes amid the government's ongoing struggle to increase the number of GPs.\nOver the past five years the total - in terms of full-time posts - has fallen despite successive government drives to increase numbers.\nNHS Providers, which represents health bosses, said its members were particularly worried about A&Es alongside mental health and cancer services. \nDeputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: \"The NHS is fighting fires on multiple fronts as they try to recover care backlogs, increased demand for emergency care, treating patients with Covid and preparing for what is likely to be the most challenging winter yet for the NHS. \n\"In a matter of weeks, we will face our first winter where both flu and Covid are in circulation.\""

      "tags": "Ofcom,LGBT,Stonewall",
      "text": "The extent of the influence of LGBTQ charity Stonewall in public bodies across the UK has been revealed in a BBC investigation.\nGovernments, Ofcom and the BBC have had their impartiality questioned after involvement in the lobby group's diversity schemes.\nA number of high profile organisations have left Stonewall's schemes in recent months amid growing controversy about the influence of the group on public policy.\nStonewall says it works for LGBTQ equality and that it is \"deeply disappointing\" that this can still be thought of as controversial.\nStonewall operates two schemes which have come under scrutiny in recent months. The \"Diversity Champions\" programme is a service Stonewall provides to employers for a fee, to advise them on diversity and inclusion. The Workplace Equality Index is a public ranking of organisations, which is scored by Stonewall, and does not require a fee to enter.\nThe Nolan Investigates podcast sought information on the schemes under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws. The information contained within the documents revealed what the lobby group was asking organisations to do to improve their ranking on the Workplace Equality Index. \nSome organisations, including the BBC, refused to release the information on the grounds that it could \"have a detrimental impact on the commercial revenue of Stonewall\".\nStonewall declined to take part in the series.\nThe documents reveal that the media regulator Ofcom submitted rulings it had made against broadcasters to Stonewall's Workplace Equality Index, which awards points to organisations based on how well they are performing on LGBTQ equality.\nOfcom had initially defended the relationship with Stonewall, saying it only related to internal staffing issues, before leaving the Diversity Champions Scheme in August. \nHowever, Ofcom continues to submit information to the Workplace Equality Index. Stonewall scores companies and public bodies based on how well they believe they are performing on LGBTQ equality.\nFor three consecutive years, the lobby group asked Ofcom to show evidence of work they had done to \"promote LGBT equality in the wider community\". Ofcom cited examples of action they had taken in response to complaints about TV programmes including Harry Hill's TV Burp and local radio stations.\nIn 2019, Ofcom told Stonewall \"we have ruled on two instances where transphobic comments made in programmes breached the code\". One such case referred to a radio presenter who said he would be uncomfortable with his six-year-old daughter changing in an environment where the changing rooms were not segregated based on sex, and described a \"transfeminine person\" as \"him, her, him, it\" - for which he had apologised on air.\nThe regulator also cited a 2016 judgement on a re-run of Harry Hill's TV Burp on the UKTV television channel Dave, in which the programme parodied a Channel 4 documentary called The Pregnant Man. Ofcom had found the programme was in breach of its broadcasting code.\nOfcom did not release the feedback it received from Stonewall.\nOfcom told the Nolan Investigates podcast that there was no conflict of interest in its relationship with Stonewall, despite \"stepping back\" from Stonewall's Diversity Champions Scheme after considering whether there was a conflict of interest. \nOfcom said: \"Broadcast standards decisions are made by the Broadcast Standards team within Ofcom, wholly independently from any third parties. Our participation in the Stonewall Equality Index has no bearing whatsoever on any of our broadcasting standards decisions.\"\nOfcom will continue to submit to Stonewall's Workplace Equality Index scheme, saying it \"is an effective way for employers to measure their progress on LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace\".\nThe BBC did not release the information requested by Nolan Investigates around its submission to Stonewall's schemes.\nHowever, the programme has raised questions about how close the BBC's Diversity and Inclusion department was to Stonewall. Diversity and Inclusion deals with internal staffing issues at the BBC.  \nConcerns have been raised for some time from senior BBC editorial figures about the risks of the relationship with Stonewall.\nStonewall played a central role in an internal BBC \"LGBT Culture and Progression report\" by \"identifying strengths and weaknesses\" for the BBC with regards to LGBT diversity and practices. \"Weaknesses\" included the absence of an Allies programme. Allies programmes are set up with training from Stonewall when the organisations are Diversity Champions.\nIn January 2020 the BBC told staff they would \"be working closely with Stonewall over the coming months in preparation for next year's [Stonewall] index\".\nThe podcast reveals that a senior figure in the Diversity and Inclusion department described Stonewall as \"the experts in workplace equality for LGBTQ+ people\" in internal correspondence, in response to questions about the BBC's Allies scheme. \nConcerns have been expressed about Stonewall being regarded as \"the\" experts, given the diversity of opinion among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people over Stonewall's policies.\nThe department runs an \"Allies training\" course, which was set up in conjunction with Stonewall, to provide guidance to staff. In an Allies training meeting, BBC trainers used language and material around sex and gender which is contested. The \"genderbred person\" - a graphic used by groups like Stonewall to explain sex and gender issues - was presented to staff, with no alternate views presented.\nThe Nolan Investigates podcast understands that the Diversity and Inclusion department had a role in the drafting of the latest BBC News style guide around issues of sexuality and gender. The style guide sets a standard for the language used by BBC News, often in contested areas. \nThe document defines homosexuality as \"people of either sex who are attracted to people of their own gender\". This is similar to the definition used by Stonewall, and different from the standard dictionary definition, in that it defines attraction as based on gender rather than sex. \nThese definitions are at the centre of a fierce debate over sex and gender issues. The document was ultimately signed off by BBC News.\nSam Smith, an investigative journalist who left the BBC recently after working there for 25 years, told the podcast she thinks that some people within the BBC are frightened to speak out to say what they really think about Stonewall. \nShe also believes the relationship has had an effect on the corporation's output.\n\"How can it not have a chilling effect when it is writ large across the BBC that we are a [Stonewall] champion. I can't think of anything else that the BBC has done that's in the same ball park.\"\nShe says: \"The trouble is the impartiality element of this, for people who do not agree with Stonewall's campaigning position on the gender identity issue, it is not nice for an organisation to align itself with Stonewall and Stonewall's mission\".\nShe said she had queried the BBC's use of \"political\" and \"campaigning\" language but was told \"the BBC had checked this with Stonewall and Stonewall were fine they were fine with it and therefore the BBC was fine with it\".\nThe BBC did not take part in the podcast. In a statement, they said that the BBC \"acts independently in all our aspects of our operations, from HR policy to editorial guidelines and content\".\n\"We are not a member of Stonewall, we do not take legal advice from Stonewall and we do not subscribe to Stonewall's campaigning. The charity simply provides advice that we are able to consider.\n\"As a broadcaster, we have our own values and editorial standards - these are clearly set out and published in our editorial guidelines. We are also governed by the Royal Charter and the Ofcom broadcasting code.\"\nIn a statement, Stonewall told the Nolan Investigates podcast: \"It is completely normal and appropriate for charities to engage with public sector organisations to advocate for their beneficiaries to improve public policy. It is also completely normal and appropriate for charities to support public sector organisations through service provision.\n\"We are proud of work to support public sector organisations to create an inclusive workplace for their LGBTQ+ employees. Our guidance to employers supports them to understand the needs of their LGBTQ+ employees and create an inclusive workplace culture through their policies and wider activity.\"\nThe Nolan Investigates podcast also examines changes in the language used by governments across the UK after Stonewall requested changes, and looks at the advice provided by Stonewall to public bodies. \nCorrection 18th October 2021: An earlier version of this article included a picture caption which said that Stonewall had been campaigning for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights since 1989, which we have amended to make clear that Stonewall has campaigned for trans equality since 2015.\nThe Nolan Investigates podcast is available on BBC Sounds"

      "text": "Liverpool and England legends led the tributes to Roger Hunt at the funeral of the club's record league goalscorer.\nKnown as \"Sir Roger\" to Reds fans, he died at the age of 83 in September.\nHundreds of Liverpool fans gathered at Anfield as the funeral cortege paused outside the ground ahead of a service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral at 11:00 BST.\nHunt scored 244 goals for the club and the striker was part of England's 1966 World Cup-winning side.\nHis wife Rowan, children David and Julie, stepchildren Katie and Wayne and extended family were joined by about 400 mourners.\nLiverpool legends Roy Evans, Kevin Keegan, Ian Callaghan and Ian Rush also joined senior executives from the club for the hour-long service of celebration.\nThe coffin, draped in a red Liverpool flag, left the cathedral as the club's anthem You'll Never Walk Alone played before departing for a private ceremony at Anfield Crematorium.\nEx-England manager Keegan said Hunt was part of the \"exclusive\" club of players who had scored more than 200 league goals for Liverpool.\n\"He was a World Cup winner in 1966. He was Liverpool's top scorer for eight years. He scored the first goal on Match of the Day. He scored five hat-tricks in a season. I could go on and on,\" he told the congregation.\nHunt's England World Cup strike partner Sir Geoff Hurst was not present at the service but his eulogy was read by Liverpool's club chaplain Bill Bygroves.\n\"Roger was a great player, a very special person and a class act who I was privileged to have as my strike partner but - more importantly - my friend,\" he said.\nComedian and Liverpool fan Jimmy Tarbuck, who was friends with Hunt, also paid tribute at the service.\n\"To be born a gentleman is an accident, to die one is an achievement,\" he said.\n\"Thanks for all the pleasure I got from watching you, it was just a joy. I am honoured to be called a friend of yours.\"\nLiverpool fan Vince Tolley said he travelled from Southend in Essex to pay tribute to his \"idol\" Hunt. \n\"I used to have a Liverpool shirt in those days in the 60s it was just an ordinary red shirt with a white cuff and my mum actually put the number eight on the back for me,\" he said.\nPaying tribute last month, Reds manager Jurgen Klopp said Hunt \"comes second to no-one in his importance in the history of Liverpool FC\".\n\"I am told the Kop christened him 'Sir Roger' for all his achievements. A goalscorer who never stopped working to help his team-mates, I believe he would have fitted well within our current team,\" he said.\nBy BBC North West Tonight reporter Andy Gill at Liverpool Cathedral\nScores of Liverpool fans have joined former players and family members at the funeral.\nAmong those paying tribute at the service was his England World Cup strike partner Sir Geoff Hurst. \nIn a message, he said: \"What a player he was. Up there with Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, Kevin Keegan and Mo Salah.\"\nComedian and Reds fan Jimmy Tarbuck told me: \"He was our Bobby Moore. I loved him.\"\nEx-Liverpool striker David Johnson said Hunt was his hero when he was growing up, adding: \"If I scored it wasn't me scoring, it was Roger.\"\nFormer Liverpool player and England manager Kevin Keegan said the striker was one of his two favourite players of all time. \nAt the start of the funeral Rev Dr Neil Barnes described Hunt as a \"national icon\".\nOne fan said although he was never officially knighted, the Kop called him \"Sir\" Roger Hunt, and that probably meant more to him.\nBorn in Golborne in Cheshire on 20 July 1938, Hunt signed for Liverpool in 1958 and made his 492nd and final appearance for the club in 1969.\nUnder legendary manager Bill Shankly he helped the club out of the Second Division in 1962 by scoring 41 goals in as many games.\nLiverpool then won the First Division in 1964 and 1966 either side of a first FA Cup win in 1965.\nHunt also had a successful three seasons with Bolton Wanderers after leaving Anfield in 1969.\nThe forward won 34 England caps, scoring 18 international goals after making his debut in 1962 when Liverpool were in English football's second tier.\nHe played in every game of the 1966 World Cup and scored three times to help England out of their group.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "The Biden administration has unveiled plans to expand offshore wind energy in a move that could see turbines built along much of the US coastline.\nSeven areas on both coasts and the Gulf of Mexico will be auctioned for wind farms in the next few years, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said on Tuesday.\nIt comes as President Joe Biden pushes to reduce US fossil fuel use and expand the green energy economy.\nExperts say dramatic action is needed to meet Mr Biden's climate goals.\nThe wind farms are part of Mr Biden's plan to generate 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy - enough to power 10m homes - by 2030.\nThat goal falls short of the 40GW that the UK is planning. China is aiming to achieve around 73GW by the same date.\nThe White House approved the first commercial wind farm in the US off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts this summer. \n\"The Interior Department is laying out an ambitious road map as we advance the administration's plans to confront climate change, create good-paying jobs, and accelerate the nation's transition to a cleaner energy future,\" said Ms Haaland. \nThe plan is expected to meet a backlash from some coastal and fishing communities - and it needs approval from state, local and environmental groups before any construction begins. \nCommercial fishing companies have argued such offshore wind projects would make it difficult to harvest valuable seafood species, like lobsters. Some conservation groups also fear the large turbines will kill thousands of birds and affect marine life.\nPotential building sites could be crossed off the list if they are found to have a negative impact on wildlife, tourism, military activities or other commercial services. \nThe announcement comes ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference - Cop26 - which is due to begin in Glasgow on 31 October. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\nIn a related announcement, the Department of Energy said it would increase research into any harmful affects that wind turbines could have on wildlife. \n\"In order for Americans living in coastal areas to see the benefits of offshore wind, we must ensure that it's done with care for the surrounding ecosystem,\u2033 said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.\nRead more about the COP26 summit here."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Boris Johnson,Brexit",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol shortly after he made the EU deal, DUP MP Ian Paisley has claimed. \nThe PM reportedly made the remarks before MPs voted on the deal in 2019. \nThe claims followed comments from Boris Johnson's ex-adviser who said the plan was to \"ditch the bits we didn't like\". \nThat prompted the Irish deputy PM to warn countries considering trade deals with the UK that it is a nation that \"doesn't necessarily keep its word\".\nThe protocol, agreed by the EU and UK in the Brexit deal, keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nBut the UK now says the arrangement imposes too many barriers, as it means goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Britain face checks and controls.\nOn Wednesday, the EU revealed its plan to reduce checks on those goods.\nThe proposals include scrapping checks on most food products being shipped to, and remaining in, Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nThe EU said their new plan would remove about 80% of spot checks and cut customs paperwork by 50%.\nHowever, the measures fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role.\nThe UK government said it was studying the detail of the EU's proposals.\n\"Boris Johnson did tell me personally that he would, after agreeing to the protocol, he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics,\" Mr Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme.\n\"Now that comment has been verified by another source [Dominic Cummings] much closer to Boris Johnson within his own government,\" added the North Antrim MP. \nThe conversation between Mr Johnson and Mr Paisley allegedly took place just before the first House of Commons vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement in October 2019.\nOn Tuesday, Downing Street's former strategy chief Dominic Cummings tweeted that he had planned in the autumn of 2019 to get the prime minister to \"ditch bits\" of the Brexit deal. \nIn a series of tweets, Mr Cummings - who has turned against Mr Johnson since being removed from Downing Street at the end of 2020 - claimed the prime minister never understood what the withdrawal agreement really meant.\nHe also dismissed suggestions that abandoning elements of the deal would mean breaking international law.\n\"Our priorities meant e.g. getting Brexit done is 10,000 times more important than lawyers yapping re international law in negotiations with people who break international law all the time,\" he said.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal: It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).\nIt means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules: As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland.\nBut some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all: EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found.\nRead more: The Northern Ireland Protocol explained\nThe t\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy prime minister), Leo Varadkar, said Mr Cummings' claims \"must resonate around the world\".\n\"Essentially now what Dominic Cummings is saying is that this is a country that makes treaties, that strikes agreements and then intends to renege on them,\" he added.\n\"Don't make any agreement with the British government; don't sign any treaty with the United Kingdom, until you can be confident that this is a country that can honour its promises.\" \nHowever, when asked about Mr Cummings claims, Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said: \"We all understood extremely well what the deal meant, it delivered on democracy, took the UK out of the EU whole and entire, and it was a very good deal.\"\nBut he said it now had to be changed because it was \"undermining the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, not supporting it\".\n\"The problem with the protocol at the moment is that EU law, with the European Court of Justice as the enforcer, is applied in Northern Ireland without any democratic process. That has to change if we are to find governance arrangements people can live with,\" he said.\nSinn F\u00e9in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill has urged a recall the Northern Ireland Assembly to demonstrate support for the NI Protocol, following the EU's proposal.\nThe European Commission's Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d will speak with Stormont's political leaders about the plan later."

      "text": "Border force staff do not need immunity from prosecution if a refugee crossing the Channel dies, their union has said.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel is reported to be considering such a move to give legal protection to staff ordered to \"push back\" migrant boats.\nBut the ISU union said seafaring staff already complied with international laws on the protection of life.\nThey acted ethically because it was the right thing to do - not out of fear of prosecution, the union added.\nLast month, officials were authorised to use the so-called \"pushback\" tactic, if personally approved by Ms Patel. \nMore than 12,600 migrants have made the journey across the English Channel so far this year.\nMs Patel has vowed to crack down on organised crime gangs who smuggle people to the UK for profit - and said the new Nationality and Borders Bill will seek to \"break their business model\".\nIn September, the Home Office confirmed border officials will have the authority to turn boats away in limited circumstances and only with the prior approval of the home secretary.\nIt has sparked fears that border officials could be subject to prosecution if a migrant drowns.\nA report in the Guardian newspaper says Ms Patel will respond to those concerns by inserting a clause in to the Nationality and Borders Bill to give staff legal protection against prosecution. \nThe government has not yet published all the details of the Bill, although it does outline maritime enforcement measures to make \"pushbacks\" easier. \nBut critics have cast doubt on whether the new powers would ever be used in practice because Border Force commanders, like everyone else at sea, are under an international legal obligation to protect life where possible.\nLucy Moreton, of the ISU union, said Border Force staff would not \"recklessly or deliberately endanger life\" if they did not have immunity from prosecution.\n\"Ms Patel's approach appears to suggest that she believes staff are only held back out of fear of prosecution for any loss of life.  That is simply not the case.\"\nIn addition, UK law could not \"protect an officer from prosecution in another jurisdiction, for example in France or internationally\", they added.\n\"Such a measure would likely be subject to significant and lengthy legal challenge. Immunity could not, for example, be infinite.  \n\"There will inevitably, and correctly, be challenges to the extent of an officer's actions should a death result.\"  \nMinnie Rahman, interim chief executive of the the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said pushing small boats back is \"extremely dangerous\" and \"similar tactics have been linked to hundreds of deaths in the Mediterranean\".\n\"Once again it seems that government is intent on using refugees as a political football, instead of taking the practical steps needed to end dangerous crossings for good, by working with the French and establishing safe, regulated means of travel for people seeking asylum in the UK\", she added. \nLabour is still waiting to see the full proposals but Shadow Home Secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: \"The Conservatives do not respect the rule of law. These provisions would be unconscionable\". \nIn a statement, the Home Office said: \"We are seeing an unacceptable rise in dangerous Channel crossings and as part of our ongoing operational response, we continue to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options for stopping small boats. \n\"The health, safety and wellbeing of our staff is paramount when undertaking all of their operational duties.\"  \n \"That's why we provide extensive training and provide operational procedures that comply and are delivered in accordance with domestic and international law.\" \nThe statement said officials are continuing to work with trade unions representing border staff about the way ahead and that people should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, rather than attempting dangerous crossings to get to the UK\nIt said staff already have the power to intercept boats where \"facilitation is suspected in UK waters\" and that all operational procedures used at sea comply with domestic and international law. \nThe Nationality and Borders Bill is progressing through the House of Commons and will be examined in committee again next week.

      "text": "Shoppers can be reassured ministers are doing \"absolutely everything we can\" to fix supply chain issues in the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said.\nIn recent days, several retailers have warned of potential shortages during the Christmas shopping season.\nSpeaking to the BBC at the end of G7 meetings in Washington, Mr Sunak blamed global factors for delays seen at ports such as Felixstowe.\nIt comes as G7 finance ministers agreed to work together to address the issues. \nMr Sunak said: \"I'm confident there'll be a good amount of Christmas presents available for everyone to buy.\"\nHis comments came after a container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked concerns among businesses, ahead of the most important period of the year for retail spending.\nOn Wednesday, the UK's largest commercial port said the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers.\nThe Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages.\nHowever, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days.\nMeanwhile, shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it was rerouting some of its biggest ships away from the port.\nAt the same time, one of biggest ports in the US will start operating 24 hours a day to try to clear long queues of cargo ships.\nThe Port of Los Angeles in California said it will handle more goods at night after a similar move by nearby Long Beach port.\nThe ports - which handle 40% of all cargo containers entering the US - have faced months of problems.\nMajor US firms such as Walmart and FedEx have also committed to increasing their round-the-clock operations to help clear the jam, the White House said on Wednesday.\nMr Sunak was speaking after the G7 agreed to work more closely together to monitor issues facing the movement of goods around the world.\nThe meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors discussed the importance of global co-operation to ensure that supply chains are more resilient as the world emerges from the pandemic.\nThe G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. Ministers and officials from the member countries hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events.\nIn the BBC interview, Mr Sunak largely focused on the situation for industry in the UK - and he said he completely rejected the assertion of the head of UK Steel that the government had created a \"hostile environment\" for industrial investment and levelling up.\nBut when asked if he, as chancellor, was prepared to accept that high gas prices would put some heavy industry out of business he said he had to make sure taxpayers' money was protected and that \"it's not the government's job to come in and start managing the price of every individual product\". \nMr Sunak said the government would work constructively with businesses after Prime Minister Boris Johnson blamed shortages on UK firms \"mainlining\" migrant labour, pointing to the appointment of the former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis as a supply chain tsar.\nHowever, the chancellor also said \"everyone\" including Mr Johnson accepts that increasing wages without increasing productivity would be inflationary. \nHe said the move to a high wage, high-skill economy advocated by Mr Johnson would \"obviously take time\"."

      "text": "It's been described as one of the Russian capital's best-kept secrets: Moscow's restaurants are excellent. \nNow the secret is out.\nMichelin has published a Moscow Guide, heaping praise on Russian chefs and serving up its prestigious awards. Seven restaurants received one star. Two were awarded two stars.\n\"Inspectors have been particularly seduced by the high-quality local produce,\" said Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin Guide International Director. \n\"I'm super happy,\" chef Ivan Berezutsky told the BBC. \"It's the favourite moment of my professional life. It's a fantastic moment for Moscow and for Russia.\"\nIvan and his brother Sergey are the twin chefs of Twins Garden. Their restaurant received two stars, plus an extra Green star award for sustainable practices.\nHow times have changed. When I lived in Moscow in the 1980s, eating out was a chore and a challenge. Restaurants had a reputation for surly service, poor choice and less than appetizing fare. I'll never forget the \"Closed for Lunch\" sign often hung on restaurant doors.\nToday the choice of cuisine is mindboggling. Moscow has everything from gastropubs to kosher cafes. Ethiopian, Brazilian, Vietnamese - you name it, you can find it here. Soviet service (thank goodness) is a thing of the past. And food quality is generally very good.  \nMichelin believes that Moscow could become a new culinary destination for tourists and travellers. And if it does? Some think that foreigners flocking here for the food might somehow ease political tensions between Russia and the West.\n\"We are so separate right now, unfortunately,\" says chef Vladimir Mukhin of the White Rabbit restaurant, which received a Michelin star. \"It's like if you have a problem with your wife, but you have breakfast with her at the same table, then you have a future. The table can unite everyone.\"\nThe authorities here are hoping that the Michelin Moscow Guide 2022 will project a more positive image of the Russian capital. \n\"I am proud that Moscow's restaurants have become a calling card for our wonderful city,\" said Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin at a ceremony near the Kremlin.\nBut while the belief is that a gastronomic calling card can bring in more tourists, there's just one problem.\nAlthough Russia has taken a great leap forward in terms of cafes and restaurants, the picture is less positive in other areas: like the state of democracy and the high level of anti-western rhetoric here. \nIt's things like that which may reduce the appetite of foreign tourists to visit Russia."

For a small independent business that only has a small menu, it's a problem.\"\nTrading Standards said the E127 food colouring, also know as Erythrosine, is only approved for use in the UK and EU in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.\nThe ingredient has been linked to problems with hyperactivity and behavioural issues in children and a US study suggested an increased risk of thyroid tumours when tested on male rats.\n\"[The inspector] said they'd had reports of us using illegal sprinkles and I actually laughed by mistake, then realised he was being serious,\" Mr Myers said.\n\"To whoever reported us to Trading Standards, all I have to say is: 'Dear Lord, what a sad little life Jane'.\"\nHe said he sourced the US-made cake toppers from a UK-based wholesaler, adding that other products on the market were not as good.\n\"British sprinkles are rubbish,\" he said. \n\"They run and aren't bake-stable. The colours aren't vibrant and they just don't look very good.\"\nMr Myers' plight was recognised by two former Great British Bake Off contestants, who sympathised with his desire to obtain suitable ingredients.\nEdd Kimber, 2010 winner, agreed supermarket sprinkles were \"not as good\".\n\"It is what he's designing his product around, so I feel his pain,\" he added.\nFellow contestant Hermine Dossou, who was a semi-finalist in the 2020 show, called on sprinkle makers in the UK to \"step up their game\".\n\"I get where Trading Standards is coming from, but it comes back to the everything in moderation argument,\" she said.\nA spokesperson for West Yorkshire Trading Standards said: \"We can confirm that we have advised the business concerned the use of E127 is not permitted in this type of confectionery item.\n\"We stand by this advice and would urge all food business operators, when seeking to use imported foods containing additives, to check that they are permitted for use in the UK.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "An investigation has been launched into \"organised abuse\" at a special school in London after CCTV was discovered of pupils being physically assaulted and neglected, BBC News has learned.\nThe videos, found by staff, show pupils being mistreated in padded seclusion rooms between 2014 and 2017.\nOne parent said he didn't know the rooms existed until he collected his \"distressed\" autistic son from one.\nThe school said it was working with the police and supporting families.\nWhitefield School in Walthamstow, north-east London, has over 300 pupils aged between three and 19, many of whom have severe or complex needs and are unable to communicate verbally.\nBBC News has learned that in May a staff member found a significant number of videos showing children in the school's seclusion rooms. In some of the footage, pupils are physically assaulted and neglected.\nSecure or seclusion rooms are used in schools when it is thought a pupil needs to be isolated from a classroom during the school day.\nIn July, the school wrote to parents about the discovery of evidence of \"alleged child neglect\".\nThe Metropolitan Police has now reviewed a significant amount of CCTV footage and the local authority has launched an investigation into \"organised and complex abuse\" at the school, BBC News has learned.\nThis is defined as \"abuse involving one or more abusers and a number of related or non-related abused children\".\nIn January 2017 the school was rated inadequate after an Ofsted inspection found a small number of pupils had been placed in secure rooms \"for repeated and prolonged periods of time\".\nThe report said while the school referred to them as \"calming rooms\" this was \"not an accurate description of the three secure, padded and bare spaces that are used\".\nAll three rooms at Whitefield School were poorly ventilated with doors that could not be opened from the inside, while two had no natural light and children were unable to see outside or hear clearly, according to Ofsted.\n\"In a significant number of cases, pupils are placed in the rooms more frequently or for longer periods of time, as their behaviour worsens,\" the report said. It added there was no evidence parents had been told when their child had been placed in the room.\nFollowing the inspection, the school wrote to parents telling them it was ending use of the rooms. Later that year the school was inspected again and given an outstanding rating.\nOne parent told the BBC he didn't know the rooms existed until he was taken to collect his autistic son from one of the them, following problems with his behaviour.\nHe said his son appeared agitated and his shirt was ripped.\n\"He was very upset, very distressed\", he added. \"I thought it was diabolical.\"\nThe boy's mother said her son would not have been able to communicate any experiences in the rooms because of the nature of his disability. She said she was frequently called by the school about ways to manage his behaviour but use of the rooms was never mentioned.\n\"You send your child to school because you expect that they're going to be treated with dignity and respect,\" she said.\n\"I think of a 'calming room' as a safe space: beanbags, soft lighting, bubble machines - not padded cells.\"\nParents of some pupils at the school who may have spent time in the rooms have been contacted by the London Borough of Waltham Forest, but not been told whether their children have been identified in videos.\nBBC News has seen a letter written by the school's head teacher in May 2017 outlining the steps it was taking to address the Ofsted inspection.\nIt said it was closing the \"calming rooms\" but no mention was made of footage documenting their use.\nThat month a teacher at the school was sacked after a member of the public saw him kick a 17-year-old pupil with autism on a school trip.\nA BBC News investigation in 2018 discovered the use of isolation and seclusion rooms varied widely in schools. \nIt found some children spent consecutive weeks in isolation booths and more than 5,000 children with special educational needs had attended them.\nSeclusion rooms are used in many schools across the country to tackle challenging behaviour and disruption.\nBut government guidance says \"a separate room\" should only be used when it is in the best interests of the child and other pupils, and locked rooms should only be considered in \"exceptional circumstances\".\nRules around use of seclusion rooms are not strong enough, according to Paul Dix, who has campaigned to ban isolation rooms.\n\"I don't think they could be more lax\", he said. \"It seems to just rest with the culture and leadership of the individual organisation and nobody really seems too concerned about legislating.\n\"It's just ludicrously Victorian to think that putting a child in a locked room is going to do anything but exacerbate the problem.\"\nIn response to the BBC, the academy trust which runs the school said it had new leadership since the rooms were used who \"promptly\" reported the videos to the police and local authority after they found them.\nIt said it had appointed a new head teacher following the discovery and met with parents of those children who may have been affected.\nIt declined to say if the CCTV had been disclosed to Ofsted during its inspection. \nOfsted also declined to say if it had observed CCTV cameras during its inspection or asked to review footage.\nIn a statement it said it had shared some of its inspection evidence with the police at their request and could not comment further. \nThe London Borough of Waltham Forest said it visited the school after Ofsted's January 2017 inspection \"to ensure the safeguarding concerns raised were acted upon immediately\" but only learned pupils had been filmed in the seclusion rooms when the footage was discovered in May 2021.\nThe Metropolitan Police said it was investigating \"several allegations of child cruelty\" at the school between 2014 and 2017 but there have been no arrests.\nThe government said it was aware of the allegations but could not comment further while a police investigation was under way.\nFollow Noel on Twitter @NoelTitheradge"

      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) says a new taskforce may be the last chance to find the origins of Covid-19.\nIt has nominated 26 experts to join the body, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago). \nMore than a year-and-a-half since the virus was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the question of how it first emerged remains unclear.\nThe team will consider if the virus jumped from animals to humans in Wuhan markets or leaked in a lab accident.\nChina has strongly refuted the second theory.\nIn February, a WHO team tasked with investigating Covid's origins flew to China and concluded that the virus had probably come from bats but that more work was needed.\nThe team called the lab leak theory \"extremely unlikely\".\nBut the WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, later said the investigation had been hampered by a lack of data and transparency from China.\nThe proposed members of the Sago group include six experts who visited China as part of the previous team.\nAside from coronavirus, Sago will also look into the origins of other high-risk pathogens.\n\"Understanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks,\" said Dr Tedros said.\nIn a joint editorial in the journal Science, Dr Tedros and other WHO officials said \"a lab accident cannot be ruled out\".\nMichael Ryan, the WHO's emergencies director, said Sago's work may be the \"last chance to understand the origins of this virus\".\nThe announcement of the new group comes as CNN reported that China was preparing to test tens of thousands of blood bank samples taken in the early months of the pandemic. \nBut Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said Sago's work should not be \"politicised\".\n\"It is time to send teams to other places,\" he said.\nTulip Mazumdar, Global Health Correspondent\nAlmost two years since the start of the pandemic, we still don't know how or when the deadly Sars-Cov-2 virus emerged. Investigating new viruses is always extremely complex, but scientists have been able to find the source of the two previous coronavirus outbreaks - both of which have emerged from animals.  \nIt's been nine months since the last WHO-convened mission returned from Wuhan, saying a similar animal spillover was the most likely source of the pandemic. But questions continue to be raised about a potential accident at a Wuhan lab which studies coronaviruses and keeps thousands of bat samples. China has strenuously denied this. \nThe WHO says China still hasn't shared crucial data from the earliest days of the pandemic. The UN agency - which has been caught in the firing line between China and the US's bigger geopolitical fight on this issue - has been hardening its language on investigations into a lab leak theory. \nThe science is becoming increasingly politicised, with China so far refusing to allow international scientists back into the country.  \nIt's hoped this new Sago body with experts from 26 different countries will be able to break this impasse, and finally get some much needed answers so the world can better prepare for future outbreaks.

      "tags": "NI Brexit,European Commission,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU has gone the extra mile by offering a fix to the row about trade in Northern Ireland, a senior EU official has said.\nJo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida - who is the EU's ambassador to the UK - told the BBC the bloc's proposals were \"unprecedented\".\nThe EU has suggested changing part of the Brexit deal that specifically covers Northern Ireland. Both sides agree it has problems.\nThe UK and EU will now hold three weeks of talks to discuss the suggestions.\nWhen the Brexit deal was agreed less than two years ago, the two sides signed up to the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part that aimed to stop checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nInstead, the trade checks take place when goods arrive into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nBut two years on, both sides admit there are problems with the protocol. The UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers, and the EU recognises it has caused problems for businesses in Northern Ireland. \nTheir suggested solutions differ, however, with the UK wanting a completely new protocol, while the EU wants to adapt the current one.\nOn Wednesday, the EU published its plan of how the protocol could be amended - cutting the number of spot checks by 80% and also halving the amount of customs paperwork.\nSpeaking to BBC Two's Newsnight, Mr Vale de Almeida, who became the ambassador to the UK last year, said: \"What we have presented in Brussels today is unprecedented. And I have been working for the EU for almost 40 years now. \n\"What we have done today goes very far. We went the extra mile to address the problems that were created by Brexit in Northern Ireland, which the protocol tries to mitigate.\"\nHe insisted that the EU's suggestions did not represent it giving way to the UK government. \"These are not concessions, these are proposals that we make out of our own initiative,\" he said.\n\"Why should they be concessions? We're not forced to propose this, we proposed this because we realised that there are problems in Northern Ireland and we care about Northern Ireland, we want the protocol to work.\"\n\"We are not renegotiating the protocol, we are adapting the protocol,\" he said.\nAfter the EU set out its plans on Wednesday, the UK said it would study the detail and the next step should involve rapid and intensive talks to see if a solution could be found.\nBut disagreements could still remain, including over the role of the European Court of Justice - the EU's highest court - in Northern Ireland.\nBoth sides previously agreed that the ECJ can police matters of EU law in Northern Ireland, as Northern Ireland will be staying in the EU's single market for goods. So, for example if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ.\nBut the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost previously said he wants the ECJ's role to be removed.\nMr Vale de Almeida said the EU had gone to the limits of what it could offer.\nAsked about the ECJ issue on Newsnight, Mr Vale de Almeida - who is Portuguese - said: \"There is no single market without the European Court of Justice. \n\"It's the referee of the single market. \n\"So if Northern Ireland wants to have access to single market for goods... and at same time have access to the British market, it's a unique position in the world... there has to be a European Court of Justice. One does not go without the other.\"\nTalks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal: It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).\nIt means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules: As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland.\nBut some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all: EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found.\nRead more: The Northern Ireland Protocol explained"

      "text": "Stormont politicians have joined a North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting, the first since the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycott was ruled unlawful.\nIt went ahead after First Minister Paul Givan agreed to the agenda. \nHe said it was in line with his party's position, which allows for meetings on health issues.\nThe DUP refuses to attend north-south talks in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.  \nThe protocol is part of the Brexit deal agreed in 2019 and was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nThe DUP boycott, announced by party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson last month, was ruled unlawful by a high court judge on Monday. \nWhen asked on Thursday whether the DUP would continue their boycott, Sir Jeffrey told BBC Radio Foyle \"our position remains as it has been\".\nHealth Minister Robin Swann is due to meet his Republic of Ireland counterpart, Stephen Donnelly at the meeting.\nWhile Sir Jeffrey had promised health meetings would go ahead, other meetings have been cancelled.\nThe DUP has said it is considering Monday's judgement. \n\"We will take a view on how we respond to that [court ruling] and I will speak to my senior leadership team,\" he added.\nMeanwhile a \u20ac1bn (\u00a3849m) peace funding package has been approved by the NSMC after the executive.\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy welcomed the approval of the Peace Plus Programme.\nHe said it would provide fund for various projects.\n\"This will include our health sector, with significant investment in supporting healthy and inclusive communities - which is particularly important in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic,\" he said.\n\"Today's approval marks a key milestone in the Peace Plus Programme which will help deliver economic regeneration, investment in young people, the environment and further support peace and reconciliation initiatives,\" he added.  \nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis also welcomed the funding, saying, in a tweet, that it was \"great progress\"."

      "tags": "Fast food,Companies,Food industry",
      "text": "The UK's largest poultry seller has warned that the price of chicken is set to rise because of supply chain problems. \nThe chief executive of 2 Sisters Food Group, Ronald Kers, said that \"in reality food is too cheap\". \nMr Kers told the BBC that the price of chicken, the UK's most popular meat, should be higher to reflect the extra costs the business is facing. \nThe firm has 600 farms and 16 factories across the UK.\nMr Kers told the BBC's Today programme that the company has had to cope with additional costs because of Brexit, Covid, labour shortages and logistics issues. \nHe added that the \"significant\" inflated costs of packaging, energy and CO2 were also \"bulking up the price of food\". \nOn Wednesday, the founder of 2 Sisters Food Group, Ranjit Boparan, warned that chicken prices would rise by 10%.  \n\"How can it be right that a whole chicken costs less than a pint of beer?\" he said. \nMr Boparan said the days of low prices were \"coming to an end\" and that \"transparent, honest pricing\" was needed because of  mounting costs.\nThe company has seen its CO2 costs rise by more than 500% in three weeks, while energy costs have increased by more than 450% from a year earlier.\nIt also said feed costs at farms have risen by 15%, with commodity costs in the farming process also up by around 20%.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Kers said: \"If you look at the price of chicken now it is \u00a33.50, while a decade ago it was \u00a35 - it should have gone up.\n\"People on farms are struggling - we don't have enough people on our factories, farms or enough HGV drivers and as a result we're seeing empty shelves and reduced choice,\" he continued.  \n\"There's no margin in the whole supply chain\". \nThe government's visa scheme for short-term workers meant the company was able to bring in an additional 700 people to secure the volume they needed for Christmas, but Mr Kers said the scheme came \"a little too late and a little too short\". \n2 Sisters sells 60% of all turkeys in the country and while Mr Kers said the overall supply chain was \"clearly very fragile\", he advised shoppers to buy \"normally\".\nThe firm produces about a third of all the poultry products consumed in the UK and processes more than 10 million birds each week.\nChicken and turkey farmer Rod Adlington, owner of Adlington Ltd, shares Mr Boparan's concerns and has already had to raise the price of his chickens by 8%.\n\"We've never ever had to put through a price rise before, but if we don't make these changes we just won't be here in six months,\" he told the BBC. \nThe company, based in Coventry, sells premium free range chickens retailing at between \u00a315-\u00a320.  It sells about 2,000 chickens a week and 10,000 turkeys each Christmas. \nThe price of chicken feed has gone up by 20%, and the business has also been hit by higher energy bills and CO2 prices. \nTo help deal with the labour shortage, the firm has put up wages by 10-15%. But Mr Adlington says there is still not enough staff. \n\"The labour issue is catastrophic at the moment, we just have no people for the factories,\" he says. \n\"There's an awful lot of pressure on us and we just can't take it. We need to find a way out of the labour problems.\"\nEdward Cayton owns Peck and Yard chicken shop, which has two branches in Manchester and sells 550 kilo of chicken per week. \nHe said prices rises have \"already had a knock-on effect\". The firm, which was Manchester's first Asian chicken shop, has had to pay \u00a34-\u00a34.5 per kilo of chicken breast that would have usually cost \u00a32. \nMr Cayton said thigh pieces are also up by a third and wings, which usually cost \u00a32.5 from his supplier, have risen to \u00a33.5 per kilo. \n\"We can't raise menu prices because no one would pay much more for chicken and I can't reduce staff so the cost is having to come out of our margins\". \n\"We just have to do more marketing and encourage people to go out to absorb the increases\". \nOne of the key factors affecting the supply chain recently has been the shortage of HGV drivers.\nThe shortage has been blamed on a combination of factors, including the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes.\nAt the end of September, the government announced that it would allow 4,700 visas for HGV drivers to deliver food.\nHowever, the first foreign HGV food drivers might not be in the country for another month, according to a source with close knowledge of the process.\nUnder the scheme - which is separate to that for HGV fuel drivers - drivers can work in the UK until 28 February.\nThe visa scheme opened for applications on Monday. The Home Office has not confirmed the number of visas that have been applied for so far, but several agencies that are recruiting the drivers told the BBC that they were yet to apply for them.\nWhen the visa was announced there was concern from some in the industry that it was too short and would not attract drivers. \n\"The issue is the shortage of HGV drivers across Europe,\" said one source. \"Offers need to be attractive to encourage drivers to come.\""

But she is alarmed at the mismatch in power between democracies and Silicon Valley - and efforts to politicise the regulator she leaves.\nFor the past five years, stories about the harms caused by social media giants have followed a wearisome and familiar pattern. \nFirst, scandal erupts. Next, the cry goes up: Something Must Be Done! (See also: Up With This We Will Not Put!)\nThen, reflecting headlines and noise on (ironically) social media, a meeting is convened, for which ambassadors of the tech giants are summoned.\nFinally\u2026 not much happens. \nThis pattern has been seen over and over and over again. \nAnd the common theme in these stories is how some big societal harm often falls between regulators, with Ofcom, the Advertising Standards Authority, and the Competition and Markets Authority, all sticking understandably to their remits.\nElizabeth Denham, the information commissioner who steps down next month, has been something of an antidote to this pattern. \nRead more from Amol Rajan here."

      "tags": "Human spaceflight,Blue Origin,Jeff Bezos,Star Trek,Space exploration",
      "text": "Hollywood actor William Shatner has become the oldest person to go to space as he blasted off aboard the Blue Origin sub-orbital capsule.\nThe 90-year-old, who played Captain James T Kirk in the Star Trek films and TV series, took off from the Texas desert with three other individuals.\nMr Shatner's trip on the rocket system - developed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos - lasted about 10 minutes.\nThe craft safely landed just after 10:00 local time (16:00 BST).\nThose aboard got to experience a short period of weightlessness as they climbed to a maximum altitude just above 100km (60 miles). From there they were able to see the curvature of the Earth through the capsule's big windows.\n\"Everybody in the world needs to do this,\" the Canadian actor told Mr Bezos after landing back on Earth. \"It was unbelievable.\"\nIn tears, he added: \"What you have given me is the most profound experience. I'm so filled with emotion about what just happened. I hope I never recover from this. I hope I can retain what I feel now. I don't want to lose it.\"\nMr Shatner was joined on the flight by Audrey Powers, a Blue Origin vice president; Chris Boshuizen, who co-founded the Earth-imaging satellite company Planet; and Glen de Vries, an executive with the French healthcare software corporation Dassault Syst\u00e8mes.\nThey were given a couple of days' training, although there was nothing really major for them to do during the flight other than enjoy it. The rocket and capsule system, known as New Shepard, is fully automatic.\nWhen the capsule touched down in the Texan desert, it was quickly surrounded by ground teams. Mr Bezos himself opened the hatch to check everyone inside was OK.\nAfter the immediate celebrations with family and friends, the crew then lined up to receive their Blue Origin astronaut pins.\nThis was only the second crewed outing for New Shepard. The first, on 20 July, carried Mr Bezos, his brother Mark, Dutch teenager Oliver Daemen; and famed aviator Wally Funk. \nAfterwards, Ms Funk, being 82, was able to claim the record for the oldest person in space - a title she has now relinquished to Mr Shatner.\nThe launch comes amid claims that Blue Origin has a toxic work culture and failed to adhere to proper safety protocols. The mostly anonymous accusations made by former and present employees have been strenuously denied.\n\"That just hasn't been my experience at Blue,\" countered Audrey Powers, who is responsible for mission and flight operations.\n\"We're exceedingly thorough, from the earliest days up through now as we've started our human flights. Safety has always been our top priority.\"\nWilliam Shatner may have been the first person to go from Star Trek's version of space to the real thing - but three Nasa astronauts have made the opposite journey.\nMae Jemison appeared in an episode of TV sequel Star Trek: The Next Generation, while Mike Fincke and Terry Virts turned up in the final episode of Enterprise, the Star Trek prequel series.\nAlso providing a link are Gene Roddenberry, the franchise creator, and James Doohan, the actor who played Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott in the original 1960s series and subsequent films. Both men had their ashes sent into space.\nSpace tourism is going through something of a renaissance, currently.\nThroughout the 2000s a number of high-value individuals paid to visit the International Space Station (ISS). But these flights, organised under the patronage of the Russian space agency, ceased in 2009.\nNow, the sector is being rekindled, and this time it looks more resilient, simply because there are many more private space companies chasing the business, and this should bring down prices for a wider pool of customers.\nAs well as the New Shepard trips organised by Jeff Bezos, the British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson is offering rides in his Virgin Galactic rocket plane. \nAnd then, of course, there's Elon Musk, whose Dragon capsule will send people orbital, to circle the Earth for several days - as it did for the privately funded Inspiration4 crew last month. \nWhile Mr Bezos simply invites some people to fly on New Shepard, he is selling other seats. And whereas Sir Richard Branson puts a ticket price (from $450,000; \u00a3330,000) against the journey, the Amazon founder does not disclose the fees paid by the likes of Mr Boshuizen and Mr de Vries.\nBlue Origin is planning one more crewed flight this year, with several more crewed flights planned for 2022.

      "text": "The government is to allow 800 foreign abattoir workers into the UK on temporary visas, after warnings from farmers of mass culls.\nIt previously said businesses should pay higher wages and invest in skills.\nThe shortage of butchers has already seen farmers destroy 6,600 healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the National Pig Association (NPA) said.\nThe government also announced plans to allow thousands more HGV deliveries to address a chronic driver shortage.\nThe meat industry blames the butcher shortage on factors including Covid and Brexit.\nThousands of healthy pigs have been culled since last week, when the tally was about 600.\nLast week, the National Farmer's Union (NFU) warned that pig farmers were \"facing a human disaster\" due to the shortage of butchers.\nIt said that \"empty retail shelves and product shortages are becoming increasingly commonplace and Christmas specialities such as pigs in blankets are already under threat\".\nThe government is temporarily extending its seasonal workers scheme to pork butchers, it said.\nUp to 800 pork butchers will be eligible to apply until the end of the year for six-month visas.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said: \"A unique range of pressures on the pig sector over recent months, such as the impacts of the pandemic and its effect on export markets, have led to the temporary package of measures we are announcing.\n\"This is the result of close working with industry to understand how we can support them through this challenging time.\"\nThe government added that the temporary visas \"are not a long term solution and businesses must make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce to build a high-wage, high-skill economy, instead of relying on overseas labour\".\nAlongside the temporary visas, the government announced a package of measures for the industry, including:\nIt said there had been \"a suspension of approval to export to China for some UK pork establishments\" and that it was working with the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board to identify other export markets.\nThe extension of visa requirements for butchers follows the announcement of temporary visas for lorry drivers and poultry workers, as the government seeks to limit disruption in the run-up to Christmas.\nBut the first foreign HGV drivers brought in on the new visa scheme may not arrive for another month, sources told BBC transport correspondent Carrie Davies.\nThe visa scheme for HGV drivers to deliver food, opened for applications on Monday.\nThe Home Office has not confirmed the number of visas that have been applied for so far, but several agencies that are recruiting the drivers told the BBC that they were yet to apply for them.\nA chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has said is due to factors that include Covid and Brexit, has affected businesses including petrol stations and supermarkets.\nThe government announced on Thursday that it planned to temporarily allow lorries from the EU to make more deliveries, as part of efforts to address the shortage.\nAt the moment, EU lorries can only make two \"cabotage\" trips per week.\nCabotage refers to loading or unloading goods in one country when a vehicle is registered in another country.\nThe government wants to relax this rule to temporarily allow EU lorries to make unlimited pick-ups and drop-offs within a two week period."

      "text": "Coldplay's next tour will partly be powered by a dancefloor that generates electricity when fans jump up and down, and pedal power at the venues.\nIt's part of a 12-point plan to cut their carbon footprint, two years after the band pledged not to tour until they could do so in a more sustainable way.\nSinger Chris Martin told the BBC in his first interview about the plans that fans will be on \"kinetic flooring\". \n\"When they move, they power the concert,\" he said.\n\"And we have bicycles too that do the same thing,\" Martin told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson.\n\"The more people move, the more they're helping. You know when the frontman says, 'We need you to jump up and down'?\n\"When I say that, I literally really need you to jump up and down. Because if you don't, then the lights go out.\"\nColdplay will also plant a tree for every ticket sold. On their last tour in 2016-17, they played to 5.4 million people. That made it one of the biggest tours of all time, earning more than $500m (\u00a3380m).\nThe singer said he accepted there would be backlash about some of their activities, such as continuing to fly on private jets.\n\"I don't mind any backlash at all,\" he said. \"We're trying our best, and we haven't got it perfect. Absolutely. We always have backlash for everything.\n\"And the people that give us backlash for that kind of thing, for flying, they're right. So we don't have any argument against that.\"\nHe admitted there was always the question of \"why tour at all?\", saying: \"And that's where we don't really have any comeback except, we would really like to.\n\"We could stay at home and that may be better. But we want to tour and we want to meet people and connect with people - so try and do it in the cleanest way possible.\"\nMartin said their goal for a few years' time is that they will have \"slightly shifted the status quo of how a tour works\".\nThe British group announced a world tour on Thursday, starting in March in Costa Rica, which has one of the highest rates of renewable energy generation in the world.\nThe concerts will use electricity from batteries fuelled by fan power as well as solar energy, recycled cooking oil from local restaurants and mains power from 100% renewable sources where available, like in Costa Rica.\nBut the singer admitted they had not figured out how to cut the environmental impact of some some parts of touring.\n\"In some areas, there's still not enough possible, like how do you get people to a venue without consuming any power? That's still really hard,\" he said.\n\"Or flying - there's still a lot of offsetting we have to do, because even sustainable aviation fuel isn't good enough yet.\n\"So we know where we still have a long way to go. But in terms of the show itself, the whole show is powered from renewable energy, which is amazing.\"\nBy entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson\nAmman, Jordan 2019. I am perched on wall in an ancient citadel interviewing Chris Martin about their latest album \"Everyday Life\". About half-way through, I throw out a fairly innocuous question about \"How difficult is it to be an environmental band and do global tours?\"\nHis reply rather took me by surprise. He revealed that they would not be touring again until they had worked out to do so in a way that was \"not only sustainable but also be actively beneficial\" to the environment.\nBy the next day his comments were making headlines around the world. \nFast forward two years and I'm sitting with the singer in a 15th-floor restaurant looking over London's rooftops. He has asked to speak to me as Coldplay are announcing an end to their self-imposed ban on touring, with their first tour in four and a half years. \nHe laughs as he explains, \"Well last time we spoke, I sort of made that up when we were talking, because I was trying to think of something cool to say. And then it sort of became a headline. And then we thought, \"Well that's actually what we really feel.\"\nHe explains how in the following days, the band started to be contacted by organisations and businesses with ideas and offers on to help them achieve their goals. Within weeks, they were employing two people full-time to work on how to make it happen. \nThe result is today's 12-point action plan.\n\"We aren't all the way there,\" admits Martin, \"But we are way way further than we ever would have been, without you asking those questions.\"\nIn 2019, Martin said he \"would be disappointed\" if their next tour was not carbon neutral.\nThe 2022 tour, which will end in Glasgow next August, will have 50% lower carbon dioxide emissions than the 2016/17 tour, but will \"still have a significant carbon footprint\", according to the group's sustainability plan.\nHowever, it adds that they will \"draw down more CO2 than the tour produces by supporting projects based on reforestation, rewilding, conservation, soil regeneration, carbon capture/storage and renewable energy\".\nMartin said: \"We wouldn't be announcing a tour unless we felt like we're far enough along that it's OK in our hearts, but we're definitely not finished.\"\nOther measures in their plan include:\nChiara Badiali from Julie's Bicycle, a charity that advises the music industry on sustainability, said she was \"very encouraged to see this level of commitment and a plan that is as comprehensive as the one they have pulled together\".\nShe said: \"They have looked at every area of the tour. I think that decision to trial out the battery technology is going to really help make a huge change.\n\"When we think about transforming the way the live music business works, we have some of the answers. But also, we don't always know what's going to work yet. Transformation is always trial and error.\n\"So a band going out and taking those risks and trying those things out, and being very open and sharing those things, is going to help the whole industry in the long run.\""

This is a ghastly cows and National Costume affair.\" \nThe former prime minister went on to take part in the pro-devolution campaign, visiting south Wales in July 1997.\nThe documents released by the National Archives also included a confidential memo which identified a number of issues with the Yes campaign, proffering suggestions on why the result was not more clear cut.\nIt highlighted an \"absence of clear political direction\" and \"no clear campaign strategy\".\nThe memo also suggested the campaign failed to adequately counter the accusation from the \"no\" campaign that people \"will be forced to speak Welsh\".\nPeter Hain, the parliamentary under-secretary for Wales, was said to be \"particularly concerned about the need to reform Wales' Labour Party\" to ensure it was both \"better at campaigning\" and offered \"proper opportunities for women candidates\".\nAnd Pat McFadden, a Downing Street aide who would become a Labour MP in 2005, agreed attacks over cost and allegations of an assembly creating \"jobs for the boys\" were successful \"because we could not advance a good positive reason for having an Assembly\".\nHe said: \"In other words, the cost would have been more defensible if it was for something people thought was worth having.\"\nHe added, in his note to Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair's chief of staff: \"On the Welsh language you know my view - this scared people in much of Wales who already resent the language mafia.\"\nMr Blair later said he \"steamrolled\" devolution into being in Wales despite objections from many within his party.

      "tags": "Doctors,NHS,GP",
      "text": " How long do you wait to see your GP?\nMembers of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group report waits of three weeks or more are common. \nLisa Johns said: \"Ours book five weeks ahead. For the last three weeks, I've been trying to book a standard appointment and can't get one, as they go in seconds.\"\nAnother member posted: \"I booked a non-urgent appointment with my GP last week.... for 22 January 2019.\"\nTheir experiences are backed up by statistics. \nEarlier this month, NHS Digital published figures showing that, while 40% of patients were seen on the day they booked, just under a fifth waited longer than a fortnight for a routine appointment with a GP or practice nurse. \nBut what's the story behind these figures?\nHave waits actually got longer?\nThe NHS Digital figures show of 307 million appointments booked at practices in England between November 2017 and October 2018: \nIt is the first time such figures has been published - so there aren't similar figures to compare them with. But plenty of previous research has found demand on GP services has grown. And experts say they do see waits increasing.\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"This is a real problem. It's something we predicted. Unfortunately, it's the inevitable consequence of a shortage of GPs.\"\nA 2016 Lancet paper said GPs' workload had risen by 16% in the seven years up to 2014, with more frequent and longer GP consultations. \nIs it because demands on GPs have increased?\nFactors including an ageing population and an increasing number of people with complex medical needs mean the standard appointment often isn't long enough.\nDr Kamal Mahtani, a GP and an associate professor in primary care at the University of Oxford, said: \"You've got 10 minutes to talk about their diabetes, their high blood pressure, their mood and look at the patient more holistically. \n\"So a GP might end up having to say, 'We've dealt with X and Y today but I'll need to see you again.' And that has a knock-on effect.\nPeople were directed to their GP for lots of different things, he said. \"If you're not feeling well, go and see the GP. If you need a flu jab, go and see a GP - as if we're a one-stop shop.\"\nBut the RCGP said a lack of GPs was also affecting availability.\n\"We're now 1,000 short of the number of GPs we had when they promised 5,000 more - so now we're looking for 6,000,\" an RCGP official said.\nIs it safe to wait weeks for an appointment?\nSome patients are happy to wait. They might want to see a particular GP whom they know or someone who is familiar with their long-term health problem - it might be something that isn't going to alter over a few weeks.\nBut there are fears that others might be at risk from waiting.\nCatherine Churcher, another member of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group, was concerned that the most vulnerable would be least able to negotiate the system and so be worst affected, \n\"There must be lots of people out there who are falling through the net and not being seen because they don't have the strength or fight in them to go up against the current system,\" she said.\nProf Stokes-Lampard said: \"There's no hard data that shows patients are coming to harm. But that's my profound concern - that there are things that will be missed.\"\nAnd Dr Mahtani said: \"How do you know if the patient's condition isn't getting worse if patients are waiting three weeks? I can't tell you that they're not suffering until I see them. \n\"And there's always that risk that the longer waits are causing harm.\"\nAre all practices affected?\nNo - but Prof Stokes-Lampard warned that even if your practice seemed OK, it was still vulnerable to events at neighbouring GPs.\n\"All you need is for the practice down the road to close and then patients would be moved and your practice would be under pressure,\" she said.\n\"There is a domino effect. And then it's phenomenally stressful for the doctors at that practice.\"\nIs there anything that will help?\nGPs say patients can help - by calling in if they can't make an appointment, so it can be freed up for someone else, and by thinking whether they could get the advice they need somewhere else, such as the chemist's or dentist.\nThere are various ideas being tried out across general practice too, experimenting with taking some of the administration away from GPs and bringing in other professions, physiotherapists and social workers, into primary care in addition to the specialist nurses that many people are already familiar with.\nTechnology can also help - some practices have online systems where patients can book directly.\nBut Dr Mahtani said there was no single solution - because each practice had a different mix of patients and different skills among its staff.\nBetter funding was key though. \"If you invest in primary care, you will reduce your costs in secondary care - 90% of first contacts are in primary care,\" he said.\n\"We need to embrace general practice.\"\nWhat's your experience of booking a routine appointment with your GP or practice nurse?

      "text": "Climate protest group Insulate Britain, which has caused disruption to major roads during the last five weeks, is to suspend its campaigning for 11 days.\nThe activists have blocked motorways and roads in the London area, including the M1 and M25, and Thames crossings.\nIn an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the group says it will halt its \"campaign of civil resistance\" until 25 October.\nInsulate Britain said it \"profoundly\" acknowledges the disruption caused.\nAfter a member of the group attempting to deliver the letter was turned back from the gates in Downing Street, Insulate Britain said it would post it to Mr Johnson.\nInsulate Britain is a recently-launched group that calls for a national programme to ensure homes are insulated by 2030, which government experts on climate change say is essential to meet targets on reducing carbon emissions.\nHundreds of members of the group have been arrested and there have been angry exchanges with some drivers caught up in 14 separate days of protests.\nIn the latest incident, Essex Police arrested a number of the group's supporters after they blocked a slip road at junction 31 of the M25 on Wednesday, near the Dartford Crossing.\nThe government has taken out court injunctions to try to prevent further action and new powers targeting such protests have been announced.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps urged Insulate Britain to abandon campaigning.\n\"Sitting on roads & preventing everyone else from going about their lawful business is downright dangerous & counterproductive. Rather than apologising to the motorist now and returning in a week & a half, they must call off their reckless campaign forever, \" he tweeted.\nInsulate Britain says its protests were being suspended ahead of the United Nations COP26 climate conference. The UK is hosting the summit in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November, where 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030.\nReferring to the disruption caused in the past five weeks, the group says in its letter to the prime minister: \"We cannot imagine undertaking such acts in normal circumstances. But the dire reality of our situation has to be faced.\"\nInsulate Britain said it will restart its action if Mr Johnson does not deliver \"a meaningful or trustworthy statement\" on improving the insulation in some British homes.\nBiff Whipster, a retail worker and member of the group who was turned away from the gates at Downing Street, said: \"We want to now give the government a bit of breathing space so they don't feel under pressure.\"\nHe said they had \"made our voices heard\" but unless they heard from the prime minister in the next 10 days, they would would resume \"blocking roads, blocking motorways and breaking court injunctions\"."

      "text": "The Queen has spoken of her \"deep and abiding affection\" for Scotland as she officially opened the sixth session of the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood.\nHer Majesty was joined at the ceremony by Prince Charles and Camilla, The Duke and Duchess of Rothesay.\nIt was the first time she had attended the ceremony without Prince Philip, who died this year aged 99. \nAs at the last opening in 2016, The Queen was greeted by Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.\nAfterwards she met people nominated as \"local heroes\" for their work in the community during the Covid pandemic.\nAt the start of the ceremony, Her Majesty addressed MSPs gathered in the debating chamber.\nShe congratulated the parliament for being able to mark the new session safely in a \"very trying period\", and noted that it had been at the heart of Scotland's response to the pandemic.\n\"As we all step out from adverse and uncertain times, occasions such as this today provide an opportunity for hope and optimism,\" Her Majesty said.\n\"Marking this new session does indeed bring a sense of beginning and renewal.\"\nShe urged MSPs to work together despite their differences of opinion.\nCelebrating people who have made an \"extraordinary contribution\" during the pandemic, The Queen noted the \"countless examples of resilience and goodwill\" that have made a difference to others.\nShe told the chamber: \"I have spoken before of my deep and abiding affection for this wonderful country and of the many happy memories Prince Philip and I always held of our time here. \n\"It is often said that it is the people that make a place and there are few places where this is truer than it is in Scotland, as we have seen in recent times.\"\nThe monarch, who has been on her annual break at Balmoral Castle, will return to Scotland next month for COP26, when the \"eyes of the world\" will be on Glasgow. \nThe Scottish Parliament has a key role to \"help create a better, healthier future for us all and engage with the people they represent, especially our young people\", The Queen added. \nMs Sturgeon and the Scottish Parliament's presiding officer Alison Johnstone both reflected on the new diverse nature of the new parliament. \n\"I'm heartened that this parliament is the most diverse that we have ever returned,\" Ms Johnstone said in her opening remarks, noting the first women of colour elected to the chamber.\n\"I wish it hadn't taken so long,\" she added.\nMs Sturgeon said the chamber better reflected Scotland as a nation \"proud to call itself simply home for everyone who chooses to live here\". \nShe said all parties had more to do but there were more women, people of colour and people with disabilities in the Parliament than ever before.\nResponding to the Queen's speech, the First Minister offered the parliament's \"deep sympathy and shared sorrow at your loss\" and thanked her for being a \"steadfast friend of our parliament since its establishment in 1999\".\nMs Sturgeon continued: \"As we battle through the storm of a global pandemic, hope and the hankering for change is perhaps felt more strongly by more people than at any time in our recent history.\n\"That gives this Parliament a momentous responsibility and a historic opportunity.\n\"Covid has been the biggest crisis to confront the world since the Second World War - it has caused pain and heartbreak, it has exposed and exacerbated the inequalities within our society.\n\"But it has also revealed humankind's boundless capacity for inventiveness, solidarity and love.\n\"And for those of us in public service, it has reminded us that with collective political will, changes that we might previously have thought impossible or just too difficult can indeed be achieved.\n\"In the months ahead, we must take the same urgency and resolve with which we have confronted this pandemic and apply it to the hard work of recovery and renewal, to the task of building a fairer and greener future for this and the generations who come after us.\"\nDue to ongoing Covid restrictions, only invited guests were able to attend.\nThey watched a recorded programme of music and entertainment which organisers said reflected \"the rich diversity of Scotland's communities\".\nThe newly-appointed Makar, or national poet, Kathleen Jamie  recited a poem specially written for the event.\nThe Royal Conservatoire Brass performed Fanfare for the Opening of Parliament 2021 from Glasgow Cathedral.\nMichael Biggins, BBC Radio Scotland's Young Traditional Musician of the Year 2021, also performed Ae Fond Kiss by Robert Burns from the BBC Pacific Quay building in Glasgow.\nScottish Parliament clerk Rea Cris carried the mace ahead of The Queen as she entered the debating chamber.\nMs Cris said: \"It is an honour for me to take on this role within the parliament.\n\"The mace is part of the parliament's history and tradition, but the principles engraved on the mace continue to inspire our work today. Compassion is one that inspires me the most.\""

      "tags": "Earth science,Earth observation,British Antarctic Survey,World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF),Animals,Space exploration",
      "text": "A new project aims to get a better idea of the number of walruses on Earth by counting them from space.\nVolunteers are being sought to search through thousands of satellite images to see how many of the tusked animals they can spot.\nScientists need improved population data as they try to asses how this polar keystone species will be affected by climate change. \nWalruses are heavily dependent on sea-ice, which has been in sharp retreat.\nThe marine mammals will haul out on to the floes, to use them as a platform on which to rest and raise their young, and as a base from which to launch foraging trips.\nA walrus will drop to the seabed to hunt in the muds for clams and other invertebrates, such as snails, soft shell crabs and shrimp.\nAll this is being made more difficult as the extent of the seasonal sea-ice declines.\n\"We're seeing about a 13% loss in summer sea-ice per decade,\" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at environmental campaign group WWF. \n\"One of the implications of not having the sea-ice to haul out on is that we're increasingly seeing walruses spend longer on land. And that comes with a number of impacts, which include overcrowding with the potential for calves to be crushed in stampedes. This happens. But also for local food sources to be depleted,\" he told BBC News.\nWWF is running the \"Walrus From Space\" project jointly with the British Antarctic Survey, which has expertise in satellite surveys of polar wildlife.\nBAS has long counted penguins from orbit, and is also now tracking seals, albatross, and even whales under the water. \n\"It's only recently that satellites have had high enough resolution to allow us to count walruses accurately,\" said BAS remote-sensing specialist Peter Fretwell.\n\"We'll be using Maxar's WorldView satellite which has a resolution where each pixel is only about 30cm on the ground. That's about the size of an A4 sheet of paper and we can easily count individual animals at that resolution.\"\nVolunteers are being directed to an online portal where they'll be shown images and asked, in the first instance, merely to state whether or not the view contains one or more of the tusked pinnipeds.\nA second phase, once all \"empty\" pictures have been excluded, will then ask the volunteers to put a dot on every walrus they see.\nThe survey, which will run for at least five years, is concentrating on the Atlantic sub-species, and a somewhat isolated group of animals in the Laptev Sea area. \nToday's estimate is that these mammals in total probably number around 30,000. The project hopefully will narrow the uncertainties.\nSurveys of this kind naturally come with some caveats. For example, the type of satellite being used can't see the Earth's surface when it's cloudy; and walruses aren't static, they move around. But such confounding factors are all taken into account by the methodologies and models used to build population data-sets.\nAnd, of course, they're underpinned by the knowledge of indigenous communities who live side-by-side with the walruses.\nThe Walrus From Space project is receiving funding support from the People's Postcode Lottery, the Royal Bank of Canada and directly from WWF supporters.\nThe goal is to recruit more than 500,000 citizen scientists over the next five years. Early volunteers have included cub scouts, who've been testing the counting portal ahead of its live launch.\nPhoebe Overton, from the 1st Molesey scout group in Surrey, acknowledged it was tricky to identify the walruses even with the super-sharp pictures.  \n\"It's quite hard because there are rusty barrels and rocks that look really similar,\" she said.\nBut Charlotte Guise, from the nearby 9th Walton-on-Thames group, added, \"it's fun to see the way they live and how many there are, and they are kind of really cool creatures\".\nThere is no plan at the moment for the project to try to count the Pacific sub-species of walrus, which may number some 200,000 individuals. Again, this estimate is uncertain. \n\"Whilst the Pacific walruses are a lot more numerous, Atlantic walruses are probably spread out over a larger area,\" Dr Downie said.  \"And if you include both Atlantic and Laptev, then you're talking about a vast area with many more haul-out sites. So, we're focussing on them, but there'll be other research groups in the Arctic working on the Pacific sub-species.\""

      "text": "European Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d has said he is \"not ready to renegotiate\" the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nOn Wednesday, he revealed a plan to reduce post-Brexit checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\nIt seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit deal.\nHe told the BBC that the EU was ready to discuss issues and concerns with the protocol.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d added that the EU would \"respect deals we have signed which became international law\".\nBut he said he had \"no mandate to renegotiate protocol\".\nNorthern Ireland's special Brexit deal keeps it in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nThe UK says the arrangement imposes too many barriers, as goods arriving from Britain face checks and controls.\nThe EU says its new plan would remove about 80% of spot checks and cut customs paperwork by 50%.\nHowever, the measures fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) - the EU's highest court - from an oversight role.\nOn Tuesday, the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost proposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one.\nAs part of these plans, the UK government wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ.\nThe Brexit agreement states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland - so for example, if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ.\nSpeaking to BBC NI's The View programme on Thursday, Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said: \"I do not see how we can have access to the single market without oversight from the European Court of Justice.\"\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he wants to see a revised protocol agreement signed off \"before the end of the year\".\nHe said he hopes to \"start the new year with a new agreement and with a positive new EU/UK agenda\".\n\"I have demonstrated I can do a lot, I am testing flexibility within the protocol but we should respect it and look how practically we can resolve the problems linked to protocol,\" he said.\n\"I am ready to go at big lengths to achieve that.\"\nHe said the EU's proposal is \"far reaching\" and that he is \"delivering on my promise that I would do whatever it takes to deliver on concerns linked with medicine supply\".\nFormer UK Brexit secretary David Davis cast doubt on a deal made before Christmas, but said he believed Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was \"trying very hard\" to achieve this. \nBut he told The View that if the EU refused to make concessions on the oversight role of European Court of Justice, Article 16 would be triggered as a result. \nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal: It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).\nIt means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules: As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland.\nBut some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all: EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found.\nRead more: The Northern Ireland Protocol explained\nThe UK government said it was studying the detail of the EU's proposals.\nLord Frost is meeting Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d in Brussels on Friday to begin this process, and talks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are likely to go on for several weeks.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d met with four of Northern Ireland's main party leaders on Thursday.\nSpeaking after the meeting, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said agreement with the EU is possible, even though unionists believe the proposed changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol did not go far enough. \nSir Jeffrey said officials from the EU and UK would meet later this week.\n\"What the EU have put on the table falls well short of what we need,\" he said. \"But progress is being made and we need to see more progress in the next few days.\"\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the EU proposals may be attractive to some but \"to other sectors they have been oversold and will under-deliver\" as they did not deal with some core issues. \nSocial Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said the proposals demonstrated \"generous flexibility\" and called on the UK Government to show the same willingness to reach an accommodation.\nMr Eastwood called on Sir Jeffrey to withdraw his threat to collapse the devolved institutions, in light of the movement made by EU leaders.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill reiterated her support for the protocol and the EU's \"practical proposals to ensure it works more smoothly for local businesses\".\n\"It is time for the British government to put an end to the bluster and to engage constructively with the process of trying to find solutions to the practical issues that need to be addressed,\" she said.\nSinn F\u00e9in are seeking a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly, but that looks unlikely to happen as their recall petition has not been signed by any other parties.\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Alliance leader Naomi Long said there was \"a bit of gameplay going on\".\n\"It worries me that the EU have dealt with all of those issues, the practical and pragmatic things, that businesses and politicians have raised and as soon as they get within touching distance of a really improved situation, suddenly it's about the ECJ,\" she said.\nAt the start of the year, the new post-Brexit arrangement - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIt involves keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods - but this, in turn, creates a new trade border with Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK.\nBrexit Minister Lord Frost has said the protocol was harming the peace process in Northern Ireland and that it undermined the Good Friday Agreement. \nThe EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and is now attempting to ease that burden with what it calls \"a different model\".\nA UK government spokesperson welcomed Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d's efforts to address the concerns about the protocol, adding that the UK was studying these proposals with officials working closely with their EU counterparts to understand the detail. \n\"Nevertheless it is clear there is still a substantial gap between our two positions,\" said the spokesperson.\n\"We need to discuss them intensively in the days to come to see if the gaps can be bridged and a solution found which delivers the significant change needed.\"\nThere are also plans to give Northern Ireland politicians and other interested parties greater influence over the implementation of the protocol.\nThe View is on BBC iPlayer."

It has mediated between Israel and the Palestinians as well as in the Sri Lankan conflict, and has participated in military action in Afghanistan and Libya. Ex-premier Jens Stoltenberg is Nato's secretary general. \nIt defies a global ban on commercial whaling, along with Japan and Iceland.\nKing: Harald V\nCrown Prince Harald became king on the death of his father Olav V in 1991. Born in 1937, he fled with his mother and siblings to the United States after the German invasion in 1940, while his father and grandfather, the then King Haakon VII, joined the government in exile in London.\nKing Harald is a keen sportsman, and represented Norway with distinction as a yachtsman at the Tokyo, Mexico and Munich Olympics. He caused some controversy by marrying a commoner, rather than a royal princess. \nThe king has clearly defined constitutional duties. Apart from being head of the armed forces and Church of Norway, he chairs the Council of State once a week. He appoints the government according to which party commands the largest number of seats in parliament, or else on the advice of the head of parliament and the prime minister of the day.\nKing Harald has continued the royal family's tradition of unpretentious public duty, and serves as a symbol of the country's strong sense of national identity.\nPrime minister: Erna Solberg\nErna Solberg, who has been prime minister since 2013, claimed a new mandate to govern following elections in September 2017. \nShe invited non-socialist parties - the Conservatives, Progress Party, Liberals, and Christian Democrats - for talks on forming a coalition government. \nShe headed a right-wing coalition government assembled following the September 2013 elections.\nHer government ruled in a minority after failing to win over several small centrist parties. But minority governments are common in Nordic countries.\nMs Solberg is Norway's second female prime minister. She appointed women to half of the cabinet posts, in line with an unwritten rule about gender equality.\nNicknamed \"Iron Erna\" for her tough stance as local government minister in charge of asylum and regional development in 2001-2005, Ms Solberg took over leadership of the Conservative Party in 2004 and steered it to third place in the 2009 elections.\nPublic broadcaster NRK operates alongside major privately-owned TV and and radio networks\nThe media are free and journalists do not face censorship or political pressure, says Reporters Without Borders.\nAlmost all Norwegians are online. Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform. \nSome key dates in Norway's history:\nCirca 800-1050 - Viking Age, in which Scandinavians go on plundering expeditions abroad. Some Norwegians settle at their destinations, including Scotland and Greenland.\nCirca 900 - Norway is unified into one kingdom.\n1536 - Norway becomes a dependency of Denmark.\n1814-1905 - Union with Sweden.\n1905 - Independence from Sweden. Prince Carl of Denmark becomes King.\n1940 - German forces invade, facing face strong resistance during the occupation lasting until the end of the war. \nLate 1960s - Oil and gas deposits discovered in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. By the early 1980s they constitute nearly one-third of Norway's annual export earnings.\n1994 - Norwegians for the second time reject membership of the European Union in a referendum, by a margin of about 5%.\n2011 - Extreme right-winger Anders Behring Breivik carries out a bomb attack and mass shooting, killing more than seventy people in the worst massacre in Norway's modern history.

      "tags": "Companies,Christmas,Retailing,Shipping industry,Felixstowe,Haulage",
      "text": "One of the UK's biggest toy retailers is warning delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. \nGary Grant, boss of The Entertainer, said it would get harder to get stock to the right places at the right time.\nBarbie dolls and Paw Patrol toys are among the children's favourites he expects to run out fast.\nThe government said that Felixstowe had reported \"improved capacity over the past few days\". \nA container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked widespread concern among retailers about future stocks.\nMr Grant said his 170 shops are looking \"very full right now\". But he added that demand \"will outstrip availability\" because there aren't enough drivers to move the company's stock. \n\"There'll never be toy shops with no toys. There will be toy shops without all the toys that they would normally expect to have due to the shortages, and that is largely down to transportation and warehouse issues, rather than there being a shortage of toys.\"\nThe shortage of drivers means that shipment containers are being offloaded but left stacked on the quayside waiting for collection. The dearth of drivers also means there is a delay in returning empty containers for re-use.\nThe problems come at the busiest time of the year for retailers, when most goods are imported from Asia to sell during Christmas trading. \nThomas O'Brien, managing director of Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, said there's \"plenty of stock\" but the real problem is that \"everything takes longer and is horrendously more expensive\" which means the company \"will be struggling to keep price increases to anything lower than 10%\".  \nItems that are in short supply include a sloth soft toy and the moody cow stress ball.\n\"Ironically the moody cow which we're short of is almost a nice acronym for how feel at the moment,\" he added.  \nWhile there are alternative toys, Mr O'Brien said the firm has lost six weeks of \"planning time\" to be able to re-stock at short notice. \nHe said containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $15,000 (\u00a311,003) rather than the normal rate of $2,500 in 2020.\nEntrepreneur Jack Griffiths, co-founder of loungewear company Snuggy, said he is expecting containers on five different ships, holdings \u00a31m worth of Christmas items, to arrive over the next week but they will now be delayed by three weeks. \n\"We're seasonal and we have to make the most of these months, 80% of our turnover comes from October to February.\"\nIn November, the business usually takes \u00a3500,000 worth of sales which Mr Griffiths said he \"probably won't be able to get in if we don't get that stock in time\". \nThe company has already run out of the SnuggyPod product which was due to arrive two weeks ago. Mr Griffiths said the product \"probably won't arrive for three weeks at Felixstowe and then it'll take three weeks to get them out of the port due to the driver issues\". He added that because the SnuggyPod is the firm's original design, there aren't any alternatives. \n\"As the weeks go by I can only see it getting worse which is just something we don't want to think about\". \nMr Griffiths anticipates he will have to get products shipped by railway and air rather than sea. It comes after \u00a3400,000 worth of his stock was delayed earlier in the year when it got stuck on the Ever Given ship which blocked the Suez Canal.\nSteve Parks, director at Seaport Freight which deals with food shipments from overseas as well as other goods, says moving products from Rotterdam port to Felixstowe is delaying goods by two to three weeks.\n\"So things like coconut milk, frozen fish and carpets are being delayed from China.\"\nWhile Mr Parks said Britain's shortfall in HGV drivers is \"largely\" to blame for the congestion at the port, other countries are experiencing problems, including the US and China.\n\"This is absolutely the worst period I have known, ever,\" he said. \"We can't get space on ships coming out of the Far East.\"\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said that fluctuating capacity at ports \"has been exacerbated by the ongoing global container and HGV driver shortages\".\n\"All ports across the UK remain open to shipping lines with Felixstowe reporting improved capacity over the past few days and the government continues to work closely with the freight industry, to tackle the challenges faced by some ports this autumn,\" the spokesperson said.\nAndrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said there was \"no need to panic buy\" but advised customers to start their normal shopping process earlier.\n\"If you see something you want, now is the time to buy as retailers have most of their Christmas stock, but we can't guarantee having supplies of everything over the next few weeks\".\n\"It's a challenge for small retailers because they don't have the cash to stockpile,\" he added.  \nThe UK's biggest commercial port Felixstowe told the BBC that it currently had 50,000 containers which were waiting to be collected, due to a shortage of HGV lorry drivers. \nOfficials at the port have asked the shipping lines to reduce their empty container stocks as \"quickly as possible\".\n\"It's not the port of Felixstowe affecting the supply chain, it's the supply chain affecting the port of Felixstowe,\" it said, adding that the problems are \"similar at all major UK ports\". \nDanish shipping giant Maersk has been forced to divert some of its larger ships from Felixstowe to ports in the Netherlands and Belgium to avoid delays. Smaller ships are then transporting the goods to the UK.\nA spokesman for the port of Rotterdam said it has been busy over the last couple of weeks, but said: \"It's more to do with Covid than anything else because of the balance of empty and full containers being in the wrong place.\"\nThe pandemic is also being blamed in part for bottlenecks at US ports. President Joe Biden will meet with major US retailers as well as the bosses of ports on Wednesday to address the issues.\nSultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chief executive Dubai-based DP World, the global logistics giant which operates out of Southampton and London Gateway, said \"nobody knows how long it's going to take\" to resolve the congestion and shipping container shortages. \n\"I think it's going to take a long time,\" he said, adding: \"The problem is complicated because you have a backlog of cargo.\"\nThe UK Ports Association trade group, said most UK ports were operating normally but that the shortage of drivers meant \"some delays\".\n\"This has meant that some freight is not being collected as rapidly as it would normally. The situation is impacting all types of ports, not just container terminals. \nIndustry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers. It has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit and a backlog of HGV driver tests.\nThe government recently drafted in military personnel to help with the driver shortages and deliver fuel. Emergency temporary visas have also been issued to foreign drivers.\nConservative Party chair Oliver Dowden told the BBC that the government was increasing the number of people having tests and that he would \"expect that number to increase as we approach Christmas\". \nAsked about potential Christmas shortages, he told Sky news: \"The situation is improving, I'm confident that people will be able to get their toys for Christmas.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus testing,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lateral flow tests (LFTs) are very good at detecting people most likely to spread Covid-19 and positive results should be trusted, say University College London researchers.\nWhen LFTs were introduced, they were criticised for being less accurate than PCR tests, which are analysed in a lab.\nBut the study found rapid tests were \"a very useful public health tool\" for stopping the spread of the virus.\nOne third of people with Covid can spread it while showing no symptoms. \nBased on the UCL research, Prof Irene Petersen, lead study author, said people who get a positive LFT result \"should trust them and stay at home\".\nBut government guidance says people must get a follow-up PCR test after a positive LFT to confirm they have Covid - and they can end their self-isolation when they get a negative result in a PCR test.\nThere have been recent reports of this happening in south-west England, leaving people unsure whether to isolate or not.\nThe UK's Health Security Agency said it was looking into the cause, but there was no evidence of any technical issues with test kits.\nProf Petersen said: \"When [Covid is] more common, there is no need to confirm it with a PCR - it's more likely it is a positive,\" she said.\nWhen the researchers used a new formula for calculating the rapid test's accuracy, they found LFTs were more than 80% effective at detecting any level of Covid-19 infection and likely to be more than 90% effective at detecting who is most infectious when they use the test.\nThis is much higher than previously thought, they say.\nProf Michael Mina, from Harvard School of Public Health, also part of the research team, said the LFTs could \"catch nearly everyone who is currently a serious risk to public health\" when viral loads are at their peak.\n\"It is most likely that if someone's LFT is negative but their PCR is positive, then this is because they are not at peak transmissible stage,\" he said.\nThe rapid tests are widely used in schools, workplaces and for allowing entry to large events to test those with no symptoms. \nSince they were introduced in secondary schools in England in March, NHS Test and Trace figures show 103,409 LFT tests have come back positive, 79,000 were matched with a confirmatory PCR and 69,500 of those were confirmed positive (and 7,647 came back negative).\nThere was much criticism of the rapid tests when they were first trialled in Liverpool last year because they were directly compared to PCR tests, which were often described as the gold standard.\n\"This is like comparing apples and oranges,\" Prof Petersen said.\nLateral flow tests and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests do different things:\nThe UCL peer-reviewed study concludes that criticism of LFTs for low sensitivity \"have reached the wrong conclusions\", \"confused policy-making\" and \"damaged public trust in LFTs\".\nHealth professionals and the public should be aware of what the tests do, said the researchers, writing in Clinical Epidemiology.\nAnd they acknowledge that errors in the way people take the tests or in the way they are processed in the lab could affect results - and these factors were not taken into account in their study.\nThe current government guidance says that if you receive a negative follow-up PCR test result, and this PCR test was taken within two days of the positive LFT, you will be told by NHS Test and Trace that you can stop self-isolating. \nHowever, it states that you must continue to self-isolate if the PCR result is positive, you choose not to take a follow-up PCR or the test was taken more than two days after the positive LFT.\nDr Sophia Makki, incident director for Covid-19 at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"Around one in three people who have Covid-19 never show any symptoms. \n\"Using LFDs (lateral flow devices) help to find asymptomatic cases who have a high viral load and are most likely to pass on the virus to others.\" "

Vaccination of 16 and 17-year-olds is also continuing at a reasonable rate, so experts are now looking to see if Scotland's youngest teenagers end up better protected from Covid than older age groups.\nCouple Pham Minh Hung and Nguyen Thi Chi Em tested positive for Covid-19 and from their hospital beds in Vietnam \"cried so much that we couldn't sleep\" after learning that their 12 pet dogs had been killed over fears that the animals might spread the virus. Their story, highlighted on social media app TikTok, has prompted a backlash within the country against those responsible.\nNorfolk-based nurse Rebecca Crossley has been praised for creating a Covid-19 vaccine clinic for people with learning disabilities and autism.

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Denmark,Norway",
      "text": "A deadly bow and arrow attack in Norway which left five people dead appears to have been an act of terror, Norway's security service (PST) said. \nThe suspect, a 37-year-old Danish citizen named Espen Andersen Brathen, had converted to Islam and there were fears he had been radicalised.\nHowever a motive has not yet been determined.\nHe is accused of killing four women and a man on Wednesday night in the southern town of Kongsberg.\nIn a press release on Thursday (in Norwegian), police said Brathen was due to appear in court on Friday at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT).\nA police lawyer told public broadcaster NRK he would be assessed by psychiatrists. During a press conference PST head Hans Sverre Sjovold said the suspect had been \"in and out of the health system for some time\".\nResidents have been deeply shaken by the violence.\nFlags were flown at half-mast on Thursday while flowers and other memorials were placed in Kongsberg's main square.\nThe victims were all aged between 50 and 70, regional police chief Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters at a Thursday morning news briefing. \nThe attack was first reported at 18:13 (16:13 GMT) on Wednesday. Police confronted the man six minutes later, but he shot several arrows at them and escaped. He was eventually caught about 30 minutes later.\nIt was during this time, between being first approached and then arrested, that the victims were killed, the police chief said.\nA woman was also stabbed at a nearby intersection, witnesses told local media.\nPolice fired warning shots when he was eventually arrested, but it is not clear if officers were armed when they first came across the suspect. Norwegian police do not usually carry guns on them - weapons are stored at police stations or in their patrol cars. \nThe attack was Norway's deadliest since far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 people, most of them teenagers, on the island of Utoya in July 2011.\nThe attacker allegedly launched the assault inside a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. One of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the shop at the time. \nThe officer and another person who was wounded are recovering in hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\nPolice on Thursday said a third person had also been injured, and was taken to the emergency room. \nPolice prosecutor Ann Ir\u00e9n Svane Mathiassen told NRK that from what they could tell all those attacked were \"completely random victims\".\nShe said the police believed the man went into people's homes to kill them during the attack.\nOne witness told local outlet TV2 she had heard a commotion and saw a woman taking cover, then a \"man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand\".\n\"Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,\" she added.\nPolice have told Norwegian news agency NTB that the attacker also used other weapons during the incident, without giving more details.\nThe suspect moved over a large area, and authorities cordoned off several parts of the town. \nResidents were ordered to stay indoors so authorities could examine the scene and gather evidence. Police searched surrounding gardens and garages with the help of sniffer dogs.\nKongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack in an area where many people lived, and that a crisis team would help anyone affected.\nDescribing the town as \"a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people\", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by \"this very tragic situation\".\nBritish woman Fiona Herland, who has lived in Kongsberg for five years, described the town as \"a very warm, cosy place - nothing happens here.\"\n\"This is absolutely devastating. You can feel the atmosphere here has darkened,\" she told the BBC.\nOfficers took the suspect to a police station in the town of Drammen, where his defence lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, said he was questioned for more than three hours and was co-operating with authorities.\nThe suspect had a Danish mother and Norwegian father, he said. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Danish authorities will work with their Norwegian counterparts on the investigation. \nPolice prosecutor Ann Ir\u00e9n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man lived in Kongsberg and was known to police. \nThe attack came on the final day of then-Prime Minister Erna Solberg's conservative government. On Thursday morning, Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store became Norway's new Prime minister with a centre-left coalition.\nMr Store said it was a \"gruesome and brutal act\".\nNATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, who is from Oslo, said it was \"shocking news\".\nBows and arrows are not classed as illegal weapons in Norway. Buying and owning them is permitted, and owners are not required to register them, although they must be used at designated archery ranges.\nAfter the attack, police officers nationwide were ordered to carry firearms as an extra precaution, but there is \"no indication so far that there is a change in the national threat level,\" the directorate said in a statement (in Norwegian). \nThe PST said the level would remain at moderate.\nAre you in the area?

      "tags": "NI Brexit,European Commission,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU has gone the extra mile by offering a fix to the row about trade in Northern Ireland, a senior EU official has said.\nJo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida - who is the EU's ambassador to the UK - told the BBC the bloc's proposals were \"unprecedented\".\nThe EU has suggested changing part of the Brexit deal that specifically covers Northern Ireland. Both sides agree it has problems.\nThe UK and EU will now hold three weeks of talks to discuss the suggestions.\nWhen the Brexit deal was agreed less than two years ago, the two sides signed up to the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part that aimed to stop checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nInstead, the trade checks take place when goods arrive into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nBut two years on, both sides admit there are problems with the protocol. The UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers, and the EU recognises it has caused problems for businesses in Northern Ireland. \nTheir suggested solutions differ, however, with the UK wanting a completely new protocol, while the EU wants to adapt the current one.\nOn Wednesday, the EU published its plan of how the protocol could be amended - cutting the number of spot checks by 80% and also halving the amount of customs paperwork.\nSpeaking to BBC Two's Newsnight, Mr Vale de Almeida, who became the ambassador to the UK last year, said: \"What we have presented in Brussels today is unprecedented. And I have been working for the EU for almost 40 years now. \n\"What we have done today goes very far. We went the extra mile to address the problems that were created by Brexit in Northern Ireland, which the protocol tries to mitigate.\"\nHe insisted that the EU's suggestions did not represent it giving way to the UK government. \"These are not concessions, these are proposals that we make out of our own initiative,\" he said.\n\"Why should they be concessions? We're not forced to propose this, we proposed this because we realised that there are problems in Northern Ireland and we care about Northern Ireland, we want the protocol to work.\"\n\"We are not renegotiating the protocol, we are adapting the protocol,\" he said.\nAfter the EU set out its plans on Wednesday, the UK said it would study the detail and the next step should involve rapid and intensive talks to see if a solution could be found.\nBut disagreements could still remain, including over the role of the European Court of Justice - the EU's highest court - in Northern Ireland.\nBoth sides previously agreed that the ECJ can police matters of EU law in Northern Ireland, as Northern Ireland will be staying in the EU's single market for goods. So, for example if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ.\nBut the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost previously said he wants the ECJ's role to be removed.\nMr Vale de Almeida said the EU had gone to the limits of what it could offer.\nAsked about the ECJ issue on Newsnight, Mr Vale de Almeida - who is Portuguese - said: \"There is no single market without the European Court of Justice. \n\"It's the referee of the single market. \n\"So if Northern Ireland wants to have access to single market for goods... and at same time have access to the British market, it's a unique position in the world... there has to be a European Court of Justice. One does not go without the other.\"\nTalks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal: It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).\nIt means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules: As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland.\nBut some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all: EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found.\nRead more: The Northern Ireland Protocol explained"

      "tags": "UK Parliament",
      "text": "A consultation has opened on a \"significant\" redrawing of Scotland's electoral map, with widespread changes to Westminster constituencies.\nPopulation changes mean Scotland is due to lose two MPs as part of the review, while England will gain ten.\nMajor alterations are to be made to boundaries across the country to ensure seats are roughly equal.\nA series of consultations and public hearings will be held, and the plans will need to be confirmed by MPs.\nMore sweeping changes which would have seen the House of Commons reduced from 650 seats to 600 were considered in 2017, but were ultimately scrapped. \nBy law, the electoral map needs to be reviewed on a regular basis to keep it up to date with demographic changes - for example, so that fast-growing urban areas have enough representatives, and so that MPs all represent a similar number of voters.\nThe current set of Westminster boundaries have been in place since 2005, when Scotland dropped from 72 constituencies down to 59.\nThe review is carried out by independent boundary commissioners in each part of the country according to a strict set of rules based on how big each seat should be in terms of population and geographical size.\nAside from island constituencies like Orkney and Shetland, which are protected, each seat should comprise between 69,724 and 77,062 voters. \nOnly 18 of Scotland's current constituencies fit this quota, and only nine will be untouched by the review.\nIt was announced in January that the quota for constituency size meant Scotland would have two fewer MPs than under previous boundaries. England would gain ten, while Wales would lose eight.\nThe proposals from the Boundary Commission for Scotland underline how this could work in practice, with one seat taken from the Glasgow area and another from the area covering Aberdeenshire, Moray and the Highlands.\nThese are not the only changes planned, however, with \"significant\" alterations needed to adhere to the strict limits on the number of electors in each area and ensure fairness at the ballot box.\nProf Ailsa Henderson - one of the boundary commissioners - pointed out that Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross currently has almost 47,000 voters - while Linlithgow and East Falkirk has 88,000.\nShe said this meant that \"votes in small constituencies can be worth the equivalent of two votes in the larger constituency\", adding: \"If everyone is selecting representatives to the same legislature, but their votes are worth more based purely on where they live, then that is obviously a problem.\"\nRedrawing the electoral map is a gloriously complicated business.\nThe boundary commissioners have to sketch out new constituency lines across an incredibly nuanced framework of geographical features, population centres, council wards and historical communities.\nAnd, as the eight-week consultation will underline, they also have to think about people.\nPast reviews have elicited a vast range of responses, from fury to incomprehension. People invest part of their personal identity into where they're from and indeed where they're not from, and are often suspicious of change.\nFor example, the ultimately binned 2017 review attracted a deluge of comments from people in Perthshire and Fife who really didn't like the idea of sharing a constituency - one of whom threatened to leave the country altogether if the changes went through.\nThere will also be the usual predictable political posturing from parties seeking to paint the non-partisan exercise as some kind of gerrymandering.\nBut at the end of the day, times change and populations are not static. At times the commissioners might have a difficult and seemingly thankless task on their hands - but they argue it is a necessary one to ensure our elections are fair.\nThe commission is carrying out an eight-week consultation on the proposals, before a series of public hearings are held in early 2022.\nThe plans will be refined ahead of a further consultation later that year, with recommendations to be submitted to parliament by July 2023.\nThe next Westminster election is expected the following year, although that could still change.\nThe Boundary Commissions for England and Wales have already begun initial consultations, while another will get underway in Northern Ireland later this year.\nLord Matthews - a senior judge and deputy chairman of the Boundary Commission for Scotland - said: \"I believe this is a promising start to delivering the requirements of the new rules that mean the number of constituencies in Scotland will reduce from 59 to 57, and that each mainland constituency must have broadly the same number of electors.\n\"Today is the beginning of a process, and we now want to hear the views of the public. We strongly encourage voters to make their views heard.\""

      "tags": "Dominic Raab,Criminal justice system",
      "text": "New Justice Secretary Dominic Raab has told the BBC he can't promise when unprecedented delays in prosecuting and jailing criminals will be solved.\nIn an exclusive interview, Mr Raab said he hoped Crown Court backlogs in England and Wales would fall within 12 months.\nBut he could not say when they would reach pre-pandemic levels. \nMore than 60,000 Crown Court trials waiting to be heard with many serious cases being listed now in late 2023. \nMr Raab, who is also the deputy prime minister, said he acknowledged that some victims faced agonising waits for justice. \nHis comments about the challenges the government faces came during a visit to HM Prison High Down, to inspect body scanners.\nAcross the entire male prison estate, scanners have intercepted 10,000 attempts to smuggle phones, drugs and other contraband in just over a year.\nThe former foreign secretary was made justice secretary last month amid what critics say is an unprecedented crisis in criminal justice. \nThat caseload is approximately 22,000 higher than before the pandemic - when the backlogs had already been rising, following cuts to prosecutions and \"sitting days\", which reduces the number of Crown Courts that can operate at any one time.\nAbout a quarter of victims have been withdrawing from investigations and prosecutions - a figure that rises to 42% for rape. Critics say delays mean they have lost trust in the system. \nFormer justice secretary Robert Buckland said earlier this year that cuts as well as Covid had contributed to the backlog - but his successor told the BBC that he hoped a corner was now being turned. \n\"In the Crown Court ... we are just starting to see the backlog flattening,\" said Mr Raab.\nAsked if the backlog would be below pre-pandemic levels a year from now, he replied: \"I don't think we will be that far forward. \n\"We need to drive down, we have got the plan working with the judiciary to drive this forward as quickly as we conceivably can. \n\"We're going to reduce the backlog within six to 12 months, I can't give you a precise figure... it depends on lots of moving parts but I am confident we will make progress.\"\nThe government has repeatedly promised since 2014 to introduce a \"Victims' Law\" that would set minimum standards of treatment for them in the criminal justice system. \nThat legislation had been expected this Autumn but Mr Raab said he would be reviewing the work before final proposals were put out to consultation. \n\"I totally understand if on top of the injury you have suffered you have to wait agonisingly for a trial. \n\"The only reassurance we can give is to demonstrate that we are on the case.\"\nOn Thursday, the justice secretary was told of another problem in criminal justice - when inspectors gave him 28 days to come up with an urgent plan to improve Oakhill secure training centre, which holds some of the most serious child offenders. \nDavid Lammy, shadow justice secretary, said: \"The Tories allowed this backlog to build up even before the pandemic. It's now clear the Justice Secretary has no idea when these delays will be cleared and no plan to make that happen. [He] needs to get a grip, stop making excuses, and set out a timetable for clearing the backlog.\"\n"

      "tags": "Fast food,Companies,Food industry",
      "text": "The UK's largest poultry seller has warned that the price of chicken is set to rise because of supply chain problems. \nThe chief executive of 2 Sisters Food Group, Ronald Kers, said that \"in reality food is too cheap\". \nMr Kers told the BBC that the price of chicken, the UK's most popular meat, should be higher to reflect the extra costs the business is facing. \nThe firm has 600 farms and 16 factories across the UK.\nMr Kers told the BBC's Today programme that the company has had to cope with additional costs because of Brexit, Covid, labour shortages and logistics issues. \nHe added that the \"significant\" inflated costs of packaging, energy and CO2 were also \"bulking up the price of food\". \nOn Wednesday, the founder of 2 Sisters Food Group, Ranjit Boparan, warned that chicken prices would rise by 10%.  \n\"How can it be right that a whole chicken costs less than a pint of beer?\" he said. \nMr Boparan said the days of low prices were \"coming to an end\" and that \"transparent, honest pricing\" was needed because of  mounting costs.\nThe company has seen its CO2 costs rise by more than 500% in three weeks, while energy costs have increased by more than 450% from a year earlier.\nIt also said feed costs at farms have risen by 15%, with commodity costs in the farming process also up by around 20%.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Kers said: \"If you look at the price of chicken now it is \u00a33.50, while a decade ago it was \u00a35 - it should have gone up.\n\"People on farms are struggling - we don't have enough people on our factories, farms or enough HGV drivers and as a result we're seeing empty shelves and reduced choice,\" he continued.  \n\"There's no margin in the whole supply chain\". \nThe government's visa scheme for short-term workers meant the company was able to bring in an additional 700 people to secure the volume they needed for Christmas, but Mr Kers said the scheme came \"a little too late and a little too short\". \n2 Sisters sells 60% of all turkeys in the country and while Mr Kers said the overall supply chain was \"clearly very fragile\", he advised shoppers to buy \"normally\".\nThe firm produces about a third of all the poultry products consumed in the UK and processes more than 10 million birds each week.\nChicken and turkey farmer Rod Adlington, owner of Adlington Ltd, shares Mr Boparan's concerns and has already had to raise the price of his chickens by 8%.\n\"We've never ever had to put through a price rise before, but if we don't make these changes we just won't be here in six months,\" he told the BBC. \nThe company, based in Coventry, sells premium free range chickens retailing at between \u00a315-\u00a320.  It sells about 2,000 chickens a week and 10,000 turkeys each Christmas. \nThe price of chicken feed has gone up by 20%, and the business has also been hit by higher energy bills and CO2 prices. \nTo help deal with the labour shortage, the firm has put up wages by 10-15%. But Mr Adlington says there is still not enough staff. \n\"The labour issue is catastrophic at the moment, we just have no people for the factories,\" he says. \n\"There's an awful lot of pressure on us and we just can't take it. We need to find a way out of the labour problems.\"\nEdward Cayton owns Peck and Yard chicken shop, which has two branches in Manchester and sells 550 kilo of chicken per week. \nHe said prices rises have \"already had a knock-on effect\". The firm, which was Manchester's first Asian chicken shop, has had to pay \u00a34-\u00a34.5 per kilo of chicken breast that would have usually cost \u00a32. \nMr Cayton said thigh pieces are also up by a third and wings, which usually cost \u00a32.5 from his supplier, have risen to \u00a33.5 per kilo. \n\"We can't raise menu prices because no one would pay much more for chicken and I can't reduce staff so the cost is having to come out of our margins\". \n\"We just have to do more marketing and encourage people to go out to absorb the increases\". \nOne of the key factors affecting the supply chain recently has been the shortage of HGV drivers.\nThe shortage has been blamed on a combination of factors, including the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes.\nAt the end of September, the government announced that it would allow 4,700 visas for HGV drivers to deliver food.\nHowever, the first foreign HGV food drivers might not be in the country for another month, according to a source with close knowledge of the process.\nUnder the scheme - which is separate to that for HGV fuel drivers - drivers can work in the UK until 28 February.\nThe visa scheme opened for applications on Monday. The Home Office has not confirmed the number of visas that have been applied for so far, but several agencies that are recruiting the drivers told the BBC that they were yet to apply for them.\nWhen the visa was announced there was concern from some in the industry that it was too short and would not attract drivers. \n\"The issue is the shortage of HGV drivers across Europe,\" said one source. \"Offers need to be attractive to encourage drivers to come.\""

      "text": "A vote of no confidence has been passed in a police boss whose comments about the Sarah Everard case sparked outrage.\nNorth Yorkshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Philip Allott said women needed to be \"streetwise\" following Ms Everard's murder by a police officer. \nAt a meeting of the panel he reports to, members took turns to urge him to resign and unanimously backed the no-confidence motion.\nMr Allott apologised again but insisted he could \"regain people's trust\".\nThe county's Police, Fire and Crime panel - made up of nine local politicians and two independent members of the public - has no power to remove Mr Allott. \nBut the group urged him to step down following his \"damaging\" remarks.\nSelby District Councillor Tim Grogan, a former police officer, said the commissioner's comments would have been \"lamentable\" regardless of who said them. \nBut, given Mr Allott's position they were \"frankly... unforgivable, at best naive, crass even, at worst wrong-headed, misguided\", he said.\n\"I believe your position is unsustainable. Go - and go now,\" he added.\nPanel chairman Councillor Carl Les added: \"Only you can judge the damage done, only you can resign.\n\"We cannot make you, we can only make recommendations, and there is a frustration in that.\n\"But I think you should consider your position now.\"\nMr Allott told the meeting that nothing would ever get done if everyone resigned and he believed he could regain people's trust.\nThis was one of the more compelling local government meetings I've watched over the years.\nOver the course of a couple of hours, councillors from across North Yorkshire unmuted to have their say on Philip Allott's comments. They roundly condemned them.\nA unanimous vote of no confidence and the panel's request for Philip Allott to resign does not mean he has to. The panel does not have that power. In fact, no-one does.\nThe panel is now writing to the Home Office to ask for powers of recall for police commissioners to be introduced.\nAs it stands, the decision is firmly in Mr Allott's hands.\nAttending the meeting remotely from his office, he accepted that his answer to a BBC Radio York interview question was \"a car crash\".\n\"I would like to apologise for the impact of that answer to Sarah Everard's family and all the victims of violence,\" he said.\nMr Allott said tensions had been high since the furore over his remarks, and accused the media of \"raking over a major mistake\" with continued coverage.\nHe told the panel he was undertaking training to help him better understand issues around women's safety and the reaction to his comments.\n\"As all of North Yorkshire knows, it was wrong, entirely misconceived (and) grossly insensitive,\" he said.\n\"It is not for women or girls to protect themselves, it's for men not to harass, intimidate, assault and murder women.\nMore than 800 complaints were made to his office after he told BBC Radio York women should know \"when they can be arrested and when they can't be arrested\". The panel also received 121 complaints. \nConservative Mr Allott made the comments after it emerged serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens had used his warrant card to falsely arrest Ms Everard for breaching coronavirus guidelines.\nThe vote follows a letter from almost all of the commissioner's staff saying he had brought the office into \"disrepute\" with his \"misogynistic\" remarks.\nIn the letter, staff said they were \"shocked\" a person holding his office \"could hold, let alone voice, such misogynistic views\".\nEmployees said his words had undermined their work and impacted upon their relationships with colleagues working for the county's police force and fire service.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nIn a bid to increase face-to-face GP appointments, the government's unveiling a \u00a3250m winter rescue package. In the first full month since restrictions were lifted only 58% of patients were seen in person - nowhere near the pre-pandemic levels of 80%. To change this, the funding should allow surgeries to recruit extra locum staff as well as physios and podiatrists. And to help more same-day appointments there are plans to relax social distancing rules so more people can be seen at practice sites.\nMore than a year-and-a-half since Covid-19 was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, questions remain over its origins. The World Health Organization is creating a new group - the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago) - to look into it and says it might be the last chance to find out how it emerged. Its previous investigation was hampered by a lack of data and transparency from China and more work was needed to confirm the virus had probably come from bats.\nLateral flow tests were criticised for being less accurate than lab-analysed PCR tests when they were introduced but a study's found they are very good at detecting Covid-19. University College London researchers say positive results should be trusted and people who get one should \"stay at home\", says Prof Irene Petersen, lead author of the study. \nUp to 30 people from any number of households can meet indoors at other homes and audiences in indoor venues can stand during performances as part the latest easing of restrictions in Northern Ireland. It's taken a \"determined and combined effort across society to get us here\", says First Minister Paul Givan.\nHelen Ruddell's a Harry Potter superfan and she's been casting a spell over children in her village with a her model creations.

      "text": "Scotland's rail network will be hit by strikes during the UN climate summit in Glasgow, a union has confirmed. \nThe RMT said members who work for ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper will stage industrial action during COP26 in an ongoing row over pay.\nScotRail staff will strike from 00:01 on Monday 1 November until 23:59 on Friday 12th November.\nThe summit, which is expected to draw thousands of people to Glasgow, runs from 31 October until 12 November.\nSleeper staff will strike on Sunday 31 October from 11:59 until 11:58 hours on Tuesday 2 November and again for 48 hours on Thursday 11 November from 11:59.\nGMB cleansing workers in Glasgow and Unite's Stagecoach staff have also voted to strike during COP26. \nA spokesman for ScotRail said the \"highly damaging\" strike action was \"extremely disappointing\" as it faced a serious financial crisis in the wake of the pandemic. \nTransport Minister Graeme Dey told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the RMT was in receipt of a \"very fair\" pay proposal.\nBut he added many of its members will have voted for strike action \"unaware of the offer that is now on the table\".\nMr Dey also described the two-year deal, which he said has been backed by the three other unions involved, was \"the best offer that can be made in the circumstances\".  \nIt is the latest stage in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions and proposed cuts to services at the rail operator, which wants to reduce the number of services across Scotland by 300 a day from next May.\nReacting to Mr Dey's comments, Michael Hogg from the RMT union said they would not ballot ScotRail workers on the new deal because \"it is not worthy of consideration\".\nHe said the new pay offer was 4.7% over two years, but there have to be efficiency savings. That would mean workers having to give up some current terms and conditions in order to get a pay rise, a caveat Mr Hogg branded \"unacceptable\".\nThere will be no trains running anywhere in Scotland during COP26 if the strikes go ahead, he confirmed.\nScotRail is currently run by Dutch firm Abellio - but will be taken over by a company owned and controlled by the Scottish government in March next year.\nThe move was announced by the government earlier this year after Abellio was stripped of its contract three years early amid concern over its performance. \nScotRail has been in talks for several weeks with trade unions about pay and conditions. A formal written offer was made to four rail trade unions - Aslef, RMT, TSSA, and Unite the union. \nThe company said it had only survived the pandemic due to emergency taxpayer support of more than \u00a3400m in \"the most serious financial crisis in our history\". \nA spokesman said: \"It's extremely disappointing that the RMT have opted to continue with this highly damaging strike action, particularly when a pay offer, negotiated over several weeks, has been made to the trade unions.\n\"We're seeing customers gradually return to Scotland's Railway, but the scale of the financial situation ScotRail is facing is stark. \n\"To build a more sustainable and greener railway for the future and reduce the burden on the taxpayer, we need to change. All of us in the railway - management, staff, trade unions, suppliers, and government - need to work together to modernise the railway so that it is fit for the future.\"\nTransport Scotland said it welcomed constructive talks between all parties and that a \"significant offer\" has been made by employers since the RMT ballot opened.\nA spokeswoman said: \"We understand that the RMT will now ballot its membership again on the substance of this offer.  We hope that RMT members and the other unions will agree and accept this offer, putting to an end existing and proposed industrial disputes and action.\n\"Rail workers have played their part in keeping the country moving through the pandemic and we are sure that they will see the importance of the moment and the role they can play in showing the best Scotland's Railway has to offer as we welcome world leaders from across the globe to COP26.\"\nMeanwhile, Chris Mitchell of the GMB denied cleansing workers in Glasgow were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip.\nMr Mitchell claimed his members have been \"put in a corner\" by Cosla despite their heroic efforts during the pandemic.\nAnd he told Good Morning Scotland the current pay offer of \u00a3850 a year would only amount to an extra \u00a36.50 a week, after tax and National Insurance.\nMr Mitchell said he acknowledged the importance of COP26 but added: \"Cosla need to realise there is an emergency on their own door step.\""

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump,US Congress",
      "text": "A committee investigating the 6 January Capitol riot has said it will pursue criminal charges against former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon next week. \nMr Bannon had been summoned to testify before the congressional panel investigating the riot on Thursday.\nHe did not appear, prompting the head of the committee to schedule a Tuesday vote to hold him in criminal contempt.\nIf convicted, Mr Bannon faces a fine and up to one year in prison. Democrats say he is trying to delay the probe. \nMr Bannon - a former right-wing media executive who became Mr Trump's chief strategist - was fired from the White House in 2017 and was not in government at the time of the January riot.\nBut he has been asked to testify regarding his communication with Mr Trump a week before the incident - as well as his involvement in discussing plans to overturn the election results that saw Joe Biden win the White House.\nMr Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol building in Washington, DC on 6 January in a failed bid to overturn the certification of Mr Biden's victory. Hundreds of Mr Trump's supporters have since been arrested for their actions that day. \nSubpoena documents quoted Mr Bannon as saying \"all hell is going to break loose tomorrow\" on the eve of the riot, which left five dead.\nMr Bannon has repeatedly said he has no plans to appear before the committee.\nHe has argued that executive privilege, which shields some presidential communications, protects his discussions with Mr Trump. Mr Bannon's lawyers say he will continue to resist until a court has ruled on the matter. \nDemocrats argue that Mr Bannon is employing a delaying tactic in an attempt to push back proceedings until after the midterm elections in November 2022, which may change the balance of power in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nOn Tuesday, the Democratic-led investigative committee will decide whether to refer the contempt charge for a full House vote.  \nHouse lawmakers would then have to rule on whether Mr Bannon is in contempt. If the Democratic-majority House votes yes, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.\nWhile this latest development is not surprising, with Democrats controlling both Congress and the presidency, this may be a rare instance where a congressional contempt charge has some teeth.\nIt also comes as the Democratic base demand accountability for the Trump administration's actions, calling on their members in Congress to flex their oversight muscles. \nIn August, the House investigating committee asked for records relating to the day's events, including communications from Mr Trump, members of his family, his top aides, his lawyers and other former members of his administration.\nThe committee has also ordered the testimony of Mr Trump's ex-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows; Dan Scavino, Mr Trump's social media manager; and Kash Patel, a former Pentagon chief of staff.\nMr Meadows and Mr Patel were co-operating with the inquiry, committee leaders Democrat Bennie Thompson and Republican Liz Cheney said last week.\nUS media report Mr Trump has asked all four former officials to refuse to comply with the inquiry.\nOn Friday Mr Trump - who has never conceded losing the election to Mr Biden - accused Democrats in Congress of using the committee to \"persecute their political opponents\"."

They are a highly academic courses that focus on on certain skill levels and they're going to be highly respected not just by business, but by universities.\n\"We will ensure there's a good range of courses overall and ensure there is quality.\""

      "tags": "Doctors,NHS,GP",
      "text": "A&E waits have sunk to their worst levels in England since the four-hour target started, with doctors warning the situation is bleak ahead of winter.\nA quarter of patients waited more than four hours for treatment in September - with even longer waits being recorded elsewhere in the UK.\nIt comes as ministers and GPs clashed over demands that practices see more patients face-to-face.\nThe government has handed GP practices \u00a3250m to take on temporary staff.\nBut the British Medical Association said they were \"hugely dismayed\" with the plan, saying it would not solve the problems.\nThe winter rescue package came on the day NHS England released its latest monthly data for hospital performance.\nLack of access to GPs has been cited as one of the reasons for growing pressures on A&Es.\nThe A&E performance in England was the worst performance since 2004, when the four-hour target was brought in. \nEven greater numbers are waiting over four hours in the other nations with four in 10 patients in Northern Ireland taking over four hours to be seen.\nIn England, A&E patients who then went on to be admitted to a ward also faced record-long waits for a bed, so-called \"trolley waits\" - they tend to be the most seriously-ill and frail patients.\nOf the 386,000 who were admitted, more than a quarter waited over four hours for a bed to become free. And more than 5,000 had to wait over 12 hours.\nDr Katherine Henderson, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: \"This data is bleak and is a stark warning of the crisis that we are heading towards this winter.\"\nShe added that emergency departments were \"dangerously\" over-crowded and there were widespread reports of ambulances queuing outside hospital because of the demands being placed on the system.\nThe \u00a3250m funding plan for GPs is part of the extra \u00a35bn Covid fund announced last month to help the NHS through the winter. It comes on top of the \u00a312bn set aside for GP services this year.\nAlongside locum doctors - doctors who stand in for others temporarily - GP practices will be able to use the money to recruit other temporary staff such as physios and podiatrists. Pharmacists are also being encouraged to see people with minor illness to relieve the pressure on GPs.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the new GP rescue package would help relieve pressure on the whole system.\nOnly 58% of patients were seen face-to-face in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions.\nThat compares with 54% in January and more than 80% before the pandemic.\nPatients have also complained of long waits on phone lines to book an appointment.\nKevin Fogarty said his 84-year-old mother was initially refused face-to-face contact with a GP, despite having an infection in her leg following a biopsy. \n\"She had not been seen for two years. However, an infection developed in the wound but the GP still wouldn't see her. We had to put pressure on them.\"\nMr Fogarty, 60, said the practice in Somerset eventually agreed to see her in person and she is now getting home visits from a nurse to tend to her wound.\n\"GPs seem to be the only group not getting back to normal services, while the likes of shop workers and everyone else are getting on with it. \n\"Telephone and video calls are helpful as an initial consultation, but the GP must see the patient should they insist or there is a requirement.\"\nAlongside the extra money, social distancing rules are also expected to be relaxed in GP surgeries and responsibility for signing fitness-to-work and fitness-to-drive certificates will be able to be passed on to other staff.\nMr Javid said: \"I'm determined to ensure patients can see their GP in the way they want, no matter where they live.\n\"Our new plan provides general practice teams with investment and targeted support. This will tackle underperformance, taking pressure off staff so they can spend more time with patients and increase the number of face-to-face appointments.\"\nGP surgeries will be named in league tables if they are judged to have failed to provide an appropriate level of \"access\". \nBut Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said he was \"hugely dismayed\" with the package. \"It offers very little and shows a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis on the ground.\"\nHe said patients would \"continue to suffer\" and find it harder to book appointments.\n\"It is disappointing to see there is no end in sight to the preoccupation with face-to-face appointments.\"\nHe said in-person appointments were still a key feature of GP care but the pandemic had proven phone or video consultations were \"entirely appropriate and appreciated\" by many.\nThe rescue package comes amid the government's ongoing struggle to increase the number of GPs.\nOver the past five years the total - in terms of full-time posts - has fallen despite successive government drives to increase numbers.\nNHS Providers, which represents health bosses, said its members were particularly worried about A&Es alongside mental health and cancer services. \nDeputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: \"The NHS is fighting fires on multiple fronts as they try to recover care backlogs, increased demand for emergency care, treating patients with Covid and preparing for what is likely to be the most challenging winter yet for the NHS. \n\"In a matter of weeks, we will face our first winter where both flu and Covid are in circulation.\""

      "tags": "UK Parliament",
      "text": "A consultation has opened on a \"significant\" redrawing of Scotland's electoral map, with widespread changes to Westminster constituencies.\nPopulation changes mean Scotland is due to lose two MPs as part of the review, while England will gain ten.\nMajor alterations are to be made to boundaries across the country to ensure seats are roughly equal.\nA series of consultations and public hearings will be held, and the plans will need to be confirmed by MPs.\nMore sweeping changes which would have seen the House of Commons reduced from 650 seats to 600 were considered in 2017, but were ultimately scrapped. \nBy law, the electoral map needs to be reviewed on a regular basis to keep it up to date with demographic changes - for example, so that fast-growing urban areas have enough representatives, and so that MPs all represent a similar number of voters.\nThe current set of Westminster boundaries have been in place since 2005, when Scotland dropped from 72 constituencies down to 59.\nThe review is carried out by independent boundary commissioners in each part of the country according to a strict set of rules based on how big each seat should be in terms of population and geographical size.\nAside from island constituencies like Orkney and Shetland, which are protected, each seat should comprise between 69,724 and 77,062 voters. \nOnly 18 of Scotland's current constituencies fit this quota, and only nine will be untouched by the review.\nIt was announced in January that the quota for constituency size meant Scotland would have two fewer MPs than under previous boundaries. England would gain ten, while Wales would lose eight.\nThe proposals from the Boundary Commission for Scotland underline how this could work in practice, with one seat taken from the Glasgow area and another from the area covering Aberdeenshire, Moray and the Highlands.\nThese are not the only changes planned, however, with \"significant\" alterations needed to adhere to the strict limits on the number of electors in each area and ensure fairness at the ballot box.\nProf Ailsa Henderson - one of the boundary commissioners - pointed out that Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross currently has almost 47,000 voters - while Linlithgow and East Falkirk has 88,000.\nShe said this meant that \"votes in small constituencies can be worth the equivalent of two votes in the larger constituency\", adding: \"If everyone is selecting representatives to the same legislature, but their votes are worth more based purely on where they live, then that is obviously a problem.\"\nRedrawing the electoral map is a gloriously complicated business.\nThe boundary commissioners have to sketch out new constituency lines across an incredibly nuanced framework of geographical features, population centres, council wards and historical communities.\nAnd, as the eight-week consultation will underline, they also have to think about people.\nPast reviews have elicited a vast range of responses, from fury to incomprehension. People invest part of their personal identity into where they're from and indeed where they're not from, and are often suspicious of change.\nFor example, the ultimately binned 2017 review attracted a deluge of comments from people in Perthshire and Fife who really didn't like the idea of sharing a constituency - one of whom threatened to leave the country altogether if the changes went through.\nThere will also be the usual predictable political posturing from parties seeking to paint the non-partisan exercise as some kind of gerrymandering.\nBut at the end of the day, times change and populations are not static. At times the commissioners might have a difficult and seemingly thankless task on their hands - but they argue it is a necessary one to ensure our elections are fair.\nThe commission is carrying out an eight-week consultation on the proposals, before a series of public hearings are held in early 2022.\nThe plans will be refined ahead of a further consultation later that year, with recommendations to be submitted to parliament by July 2023.\nThe next Westminster election is expected the following year, although that could still change.\nThe Boundary Commissions for England and Wales have already begun initial consultations, while another will get underway in Northern Ireland later this year.\nLord Matthews - a senior judge and deputy chairman of the Boundary Commission for Scotland - said: \"I believe this is a promising start to delivering the requirements of the new rules that mean the number of constituencies in Scotland will reduce from 59 to 57, and that each mainland constituency must have broadly the same number of electors.\n\"Today is the beginning of a process, and we now want to hear the views of the public. We strongly encourage voters to make their views heard.\""

      "text": "Vaccine drop-in clinics for 12-15 year olds opened a little over three weeks ago, but more than 40% of the age group have now received at least their first dose.\nWith the vaccination of 16 and 17-year-olds also continuing at a reasonable rate, will Scotland's youngest teenagers end up better protected from Covid than older age groups?\nLooking at first doses, there's 100% coverage of all age groups over 60 in Scotland.\nThere's also 99.1% coverage of the 55-59 group and 96.5% of all 50-54 year olds have received a first dose.\nHowever, a clear trend emerges with the under 60s - the younger the age group, the lower population coverage plateaus.\nAs an example, the 40-49 age group reached 90% coverage on 21 July for first doses and almost three months on are now sitting at 91.7%.\nVaccination drop-in clinics opened on 7 August for 16-17 year olds. \nIt wasn't a standing start, as 12% of that age group had already received a first dose, but coverage is now at 73.2% and closing in on the 18-29 age group which has 77.2% coverage.\nThe drop-in clinics were opened to 12-15 year olds on 20 September and vaccination appointment letters began to be sent out a week after that.\nThis age group has gone from 5.4% coverage to just over 40% in about three weeks.\nIf you work out how long it took each age group to get from 10% to 40% coverage, 12-15 year olds come in at 16 days - faster than any other group under 65.\nHowever, it's important to note that the population size of the age group is a factor here.\nThere are far fewer 12-15 year olds (234,135) than 18-29 year olds (833,947), and only 110,139 people in the 16-17 age group.\nUsing National Records of Scotland population estimates, it's possible to estimate a \"rate per day\" for the early stage of the vaccination programme in each age group.\nTaking into account the population size of each cohort, 12-15 year olds are clearly being vaccinated at a faster rate than any of the other younger age groups were - and there's a big contrast with 16-17 year olds, who are at the bottom of the table.\nAgain, it's worth bearing in mind the vast differences in population size between England and Scotland.\nEngland has vaccinated more than 354,000 12-15 year olds with a first dose, compared with about 95,000 in Scotland, according to the UK government Covid dashboard.\nThe numbers are similar for 16-17 year olds - in England 771,719 have been given a first dose, almost 10 times higher than the number in Scotland.\nHowever, in terms of percentage coverage, Scotland is doing much better in both age groups.\nIn the 16-17 age group, Scotland started from a lower base in August, but the initial pace of vaccination was steeper and has started to level off at a higher figure.\nEngland and Scotland are following different strategies for the vaccination of school-age children.\nEngland is vaccinating pupils in schools, whereas Scotland is mainly using drop-in centres (however, some rural areas are offering them in schools as well).\nColin Angus, a public health modeller at the University of Sheffield, said the Scottish strategy appeared to be \"more effective\" at getting jabs into arms quickly.\n\"We started very gradually vaccinating 12-15 year olds back in August and 20 September was when the government formally announced we were going to crack on and try and vaccinate as many as we possibly could,\" he said.\n\"The difference between what's happened since then in England and Scotland is really striking.\"\nThe Scottish government said it was \"delighted\" at the \"excellent progress\" that had been made in the 12 to 15-year-old age group.\n\"Anyone from this age group who hasn't yet been vaccinated can visit the NHS Inform website to find out more,\" a spokesperson added.\nPupils who have recently received the vaccine spoke to BBC Scotland News about their experiences in both researching and receiving the vaccine.\nCaitlyn, age 15, said she got the vaccine to protect her father.\n\"My father is immuno-suppressed so me and my sister decided to get the vaccine to protect him,\" she said. \"Also my family are in the Netherlands so to be able to go and see them I need to be vaccinated.\n\"I didn't find out much about it - you hear things and people tell you things.\"\nAnd 14-year-old Judyta told the BBC she felt \"a bit dizzy\" after getting the jag, but found the overall experience fine.\nShe said: \"It wasn't very painful. I felt like it was going to be safer so I'd have less chance of catching it [Covid-19].\n\"We have been talking about it, most of my friends do want to get it. I didn't do much research, I just listened to other people and my parents recommended I get it.\"\nThe 16-17 year old age group doesn't appear to have plateaued yet, although the rate of new vaccinations has been slowing.\nHowever, given the small size of the cohort, there's certainly a good chance this group could get very close to full vaccination coverage.\nIt's likely older teenagers will also have an eye on the vaccine passport situation, which will require proof of full vaccination before entry is allowed into certain venues and events.\nThere is some evidence that the announcement of the vaccine certificate scheme helped boost vaccination rates among 18-29 year olds for a period in September.\nThe rate of new vaccinations for 12-15 years has not yet started to tail off, but Mr Angus told BBC Scotland it was too early to tell if coverage would end up better in this group.\n\"If we follow the pattern, 12-15 year olds will level off at a lower level still but we can only hope,\" he said.\n\"Obviously it's a different group with different things going on - so we'll just have to wait and see.\""

But it did not add India to the exempt-from-quarantine-list and the restrictions continued. \nThis led to more backlash from Delhi, which imposed a mandatory quarantine for British nationals arriving in India. Finally on 8 October, UK added India to the exempt-from-quarantine list, ending the mandatory self-isolation. \nCovishield is India's primary vaccine, with more than 720 million doses given out so far. It is the same as the AstraZeneca jab used in the UK vaccine rollout. "

      "tags": "United States",
      "text": "US real estate heir Robert Durst, subject of HBO crime documentary series The Jinx, has been sentenced to life in prison for killing his best friend.\nDurst was found guilty of killing Susan Berman in 2000 to stop her talking to police about his wife's disappearance.\nThen aged 55, she was found shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home. Police believe he killed two others as well. \nIn a victim impact statement in court, Berman's son told Durst \"you murdered the person I was\" when he killed her. \nProsecutors called Durst, 78 - who appeared in the Los Angeles court for his sentencing - a \"narcissistic psychopath\". Durst has denied killing his friend.\nHis sentence for first-degree murder excludes any possibility of parole, meaning he will now very likely die in prison. \nThe crime carries special circumstances, the jury decided, including murder while lying in wait, and murder of a witness.\nDurst's lawyers told the judge on Thursday that he intends to appeal his conviction. Durst himself spoke to the judge only once to say \"yes\" when asked if he was waiving his right to appear at a future hearing.\u00a0\nSusan Berman was a crime writer and daughter of a Las Vegas mobster, and had acted as a spokeswoman for Durst when he became a suspect in his wife's disappearance.\nBerman's cousin, Denny Marcus, told the judge on Thursday: \"I was robbed\u2026 of an absolutely extraordinary, unforgettable brilliant person whose life was savagely taken from her.\"\nSareb Kaufman, who considers Berman his mother as she had been dating his father, said: \"I have not had one day off in 21 years from the absolute destruction, grief and pain this has caused me.\" \n\"I have lost everything many times over because of him... I have lost and sacrificed more than anyone could possibly know,\" he continued. \n\"My mother's murder and the events of the last 40 years will never leave me. Are you satisfied, Bob?\"\nDurst's wife Kathleen McCormack, a medical student, went missing in 1982 and is presumed dead. \n\"The only hope of redemption you have is to help find Kathy,\" Mr Kaufman added, calling on Durst to reveal the location of McCormack's body. \nNew York prosecutors are considering pressing new charges against him in her case, according to US media. \nProsecutors have argued that Durst actually murdered three people - the third being an elderly neighbour, Morris Black, who discovered Durst's identity in 2001 while he was hiding out in Texas and pretending to be a mute woman.\nDurst was acquitted of murdering Mr Black, successfully arguing he had killed him on the grounds of self-defence before cutting up the body.\nDurst is an estranged member of one of New York's wealthiest and most powerful real estate dynasties. His brother Douglas Durst, who testified at the trial, told the court: \"He'd like to murder me.\"\nAt the end of The Jinx series, Durst is heard muttering to himself: \"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\" \nHours before the last episode aired in March 2015, authorities arrested Durst in New Orleans for Ms Berman's murder. Jurors were played the clip during the trial. "

      "text": "The mother of a dyslexic child has told assembly members that seeking support and help for her son left her \"stressed out of my mind\".\nKate McKeown told Stormont's education committee about her son Aidan's experience.\nShe said that it took years to get her son literacy support from the Education Authority (EA).\n\"He is in P7 now and he still can't spell more than three-letter words,\" Ms McKeown said.\nUna Turbitt, from the EA, subsequently told the committee that around a quarter of all school pupils in Northern Ireland will experience \"some dyslexic-type difficulties\".\n\"Around 10% will present difficulties that require additional supports to be provided,\" she continued.\nThe EA also revealed that almost 200 children were currently on a waiting list for \"direct intervention\" support for their dyslexia.\nMs Turbitt said that support services for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) were \"under considerable strain and not delivering as they need to be\".\nHowever, she said that the EA was making progress in helping the increasing number of pupils with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia.\n\"The EA literacy service is currently supporting over 2,300 pupils through direct interventions with pupils in schools,\" she said.\nThere is to be an independent, external review of how the EA supports children with SEN.\nThat follows a number of highly critical internal and external reports into failings in the EA's services for children with SEN.\nAccording to the British Dyslexia Association, dyslexia is a learning difference which primarily affects reading and writing skills.\nIt can mean that children have difficulty reading, writing and spelling.\nMs McKeown told the education committee that it was in primary two when \"we noticed that Aidan had great difficulty with phonetics\".\n\"It made no sense to us that a bright child couldn't read, write or spell in P2 or remember any of the sounds,\" she said.\n\"When we went to the principal to speak to him about it, he said that unfortunately they didn't have the money to provide extra support to Aidan so there was really nothing that they could do.\"\nMs McKeown said they sought private dyslexia screening for Aidan and that found he was \"severely dyslexic\".\n\"He couldn't actually do the work that he was given, he couldn't work independently, he was always in a constant state of anxiety, he was really sick in his tummy every day,\" she said.\n\"I had great problems actually getting him into school.\"\nAccording to Liam Mackle, from the Children's Law Centre (CLC), who helped Aidan's family, it was only after a tribunal hearing in 2020 that Aidan finally received two sessions a week of direct literacy support from the EA.\nMs McKeown said that since Aidan had received one-to-one support from an EA specialist, his experience of school had changed.\nShe read out a statement Aidan had written about that change.\n\"Mum, I could do no work. I used to sit and look out the window, I couldn't do anything or join in the class,\" he wrote.\n\"I felt left out, I felt sad, I felt stupid and lots of times I felt like crying.\n\"I can write, I can read books.\n\"It still takes a bit longer to do work but I'm good at maths.\"\nRachel Hogan, from the CLC, told MLAs that the EA's literacy service which provides specialist support for children with dyslexia had been \"overwhelmed for many years and under-resourced\".\n\"The key issue is failure of early intervention and children having to wait for very lengthy periods for to receive help and support,\" she said.\nMs Hogan said that, as a result, children like Aidan could not function in class when it came to reading, writing and spelling from P2 or P3 onwards.\nShe also said that there was no consistency in the collection of data by the EA to enable proper dyslexia services to be planned.\nEA officials later agreed that the data on the prevalence of dyslexic pupils \"isn't as informative as we'd want it to be at this present time\".\nCynthia Currie, from the EA, said that it was \"difficult to pinpoint exactly\" the number of schoolchildren in Northern Ireland who had dyslexia.\nBut she said that Department of Education census data indicated that \"over 9,300 children have been listed as dyslexia or specific literacy difficulties\" in the 2020/21 school year.\nShe said that 1,621 children had a statement of SEN where dyslexia was named as a primary or additional special need.\nMs Currie also said that 192 children on the waiting list for \"direct intervention\" support for their dyslexia.\nHowever, Ms Turbitt said that while referrals to the EA for literacy support had fallen during the pandemic when children were out of school, need for help was expected to rise.\n\"The service is anticipating a referral spike during this academic year which will create further challenges for the service,\" she said."

      "text": "Protesters who block major roads during the UN climate conference in Glasgow will be moved and may face arrest, police have said. \nPolice Scotland said this would apply even if the COP26 protests are peaceful as they could be unlawful and unsafe.\nDep Ch Con Will Kerr told BBC Scotland officers have a \"whole range of tactics\" to use in such circumstances.\nAlthough disruption is expected, DCC Kerr insisted emergency services would still respond to those who need them.\n\"Some protesters will inevitably try and block some roads. If it's not a main arterial route, we'll take a sensible proportionate approach to it,\" he said. \n\"If it's a main route, if it involves movement plans for the world leaders, if it involves major disruption to the life of the city, then we will move in and if the protesters won't move, we will remove them.\"\nAsked how quickly the police would move people, he said: \"It depends on how many people, what the environment is, but it also depends on how quickly we need to move for the safety of the protesters themselves. \n\"Running on to major roads to try and block it is a very unsafe thing to do. If we need to step in quickly, we will step in quickly.\"\nThe force said that because the UN actively encourages protest, certain groups have been accredited and assigned a time and venue to gather.\nPolice Scotland has met with a number of groups to discuss how the event will be policed, including Extinction Rebellion.\nAssistant Chief Constable Bernie Higgins said there was \"no one size fits all to protest\".\n\"Some groups will do a lie in,\" he said. \"If people want to go to George Square and lie down, crack on, because you're really not going to have much impact on the conference. \n\"If however you decide to try and shut the Kingston Bridge then that's really, really dangerous for yourself, it's really, really dangerous to other road users and potentially it would prevent ambulances responding to calls so we would move very swiftly to clear that area and it would result in arrests.\"\nHe added that police could put diversions in place if protesters block minor routes.\nAbout 10,000 officers will be deployed each day to the conference in Glasgow next month, where around 120 world leaders and heads of state are expected to attend.\nEvery force in the UK will assist Police Scotland with operations, including British Transport Police, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Ministry of Defence police. \nSpecialist resources such as firearms officers, dog handlers, mounted branch, search teams and the marine unit will be used.\nSignificant events during the conference, running from 31 October to 12 November, include the two-day world leaders summit on 1-2 November and the youth event on 5 November.\nPolice Scotland also expect 100,000 people to attend a climate rally on 6 November in the city centre. \nThe style of policing throughout the event will be \"friendly, fair and accommodating\", according to the force.\nIn addition to road closures, DCC Kerr said there was potential for \"further disruption\" if pressure on agencies and services becomes \"more acute\".\nHowever he stressed: \"I can reassure the public that if they need an emergency response from us they will get it.\"\nDCC Kerr added: \"There's no straightforward, simple or single answer to the complex problem of tens of thousands of people and well over 100 world leaders moving about a city over a compressed period of time.\n\"Our principal and simple objective is relatively straight forward, to run a safe and secure environment in which the conference can take place. We are very confident the conference will take place in that secure environment.\"\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,European Commission,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "\"I suppose you've rung me to talk about the Northern Ireland Protocol...\", comes the weary voice down the phone. \nIt's not diplomats or politicians from any particular EU country who greet me like that these days. It's the reaction I get pretty much across the board.\nFour years of Brexit negotiations before the UK's final departure in January last year have left the EU with no appetite for more. \nMember states are far more focused on struggling with post-Covid economic challenges, soaring gas prices and smouldering intra-EU strife with Poland and Hungary. The last thing EU capitals say they need or want right now is a trade war with the UK.\nBut tensions over the Northern Ireland Protocol are real. \nBrussels and London agree - though to differing degrees - that the protocol isn't working well for the people of Northern Ireland.\nOn Tuesday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost called for far-reaching changes to the text. \nBrussels views this as a demand for a rewrite, and the EU is refusing to renegotiate the protocol's framework.\nIt was drawn up as part of the Brexit divorce deal, known as the Withdrawal Agreement. The result of an effort by EU and UK negotiators to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - dividing Northern Ireland, which is part of post-Brexit UK, from EU member state Ireland. \nThe fear was that a customs border between them might endanger the peace process.\nAnd that's how Northern Ireland - which is legally part of the UK customs union - ended up also remaining in the EU customs union and single market for goods after Brexit, as set out in the protocol. \nThis \"exceptional solution\" as the negotiators saw it, was an attempt to recognise the exceptional case of Northern Ireland, to avoid that hard border with the Republic of Ireland and to safeguard the peace process after Brexit.\nBut, to protect the EU's single market from goods potentially flooding in unchecked from the UK, Brussels insisted customs checks needed to be carried out between Great Britain and Northern Ireland - if they weren't going to take place on the island of Ireland.\nThis has angered unionists in the North, who feel they are being severed from the United Kingdom. \nLord Frost and others in the UK government warn the Protocol is upsetting the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland, thereby endangering the peace process the agreement was supposed to protect.\nBut Brussels insists this is an international treaty signed knowingly at the time by the UK government. \nIt says it is happy to work on ironing out any day-to-day practical difficulties of the protocol, raised by businesses and civil society in Northern Ireland. But the EU wants to make clear this week that it is not bowing to \"attempts at bullying\" by London, in the words of one European diplomat I spoke to. \nThe EU describes its new proposals as \"practical steps to solve concrete problems\".\nIt says it wants to ensure the smooth arrival of medicines from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. \nBecause it has heard complaints in Northern Ireland that regulations are being made concerning life there, without local involvement, Brussels will undertake this week to consult more with the authorities and businesses there.\nAnd while the EU insists that waiving customs checks altogether would endanger its single market, EU insiders say new measures being suggested this week to reduce the number of checks on goods and animal products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland (and therefore potentially onwards into the EU single market) already go too far for some EU member states.\nHowever, for now, Brussels is refusing to engage with Lord Frost's demand to remove the role of the European Court of Justice in the protocol. \nThe ECJ is a red rag to many Brexit supporters including in the governing Conservative party.  \nDavid Frost said on Tuesday he wanted to see the Protocol changed to become \"like a normal treaty in the way it is governed, with international arbitration instead of a system of EU law ultimately policed in the court of one of the parties, the European Court of Justice\".\nBut again the EU insists the protocol is no normal treaty.\nIt says that Northern Ireland's ongoing participation in the EU customs union and single market means in those areas it is subject to EU regulations and those, in turn, are always policed by the European Court of Justice.\nYet there is some wiggle room here. \nIn its agreements with sovereignty-minded Switzerland, the EU has an additional layer of oversight - placing the ECJ very much at arm's length.\nBut even if Brussels eventually suggested this, would the UK government go for it?\nOn Tuesday, Baroness Chapman, shadow Brexit Minister in the Labour Party, accused senior Conservatives of being \"desperate to use a tussle with Brussels\" to distract from what she described as the government's domestic failures - whether on Covid or the current energy crisis.\nA number of EU diplomats I've spoken to have echoed this sentiment. They're not convinced the government wants to resolve the protocol situation with Brussels, they say. At least not right away.\nThat is an accusation denied by the UK government. \nIn fact, Lord Frost says he's put together the legal text of a \"forward-looking\" new protocol which he has passed to the European Commission for consideration. \nFor now, despite some barbed exchanges by individual politicians (take a look at this weekend's Twitter spat between Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and Lord Frost) both the EU and the UK insist theirs are not take-it-or-leave-it positions. \nBoth sides say they're open to discussion over the coming weeks. Lord Frost called on Brussels to be \"ambitious\" and to work together with the UK to agree \"a better way forward\". The EU is calling for \"constructive dialogue\". \nLet's see.\nThe UK government has threatened to suspend parts of the protocol if it deems that to be necessary.\nThe EU assumption is that, even if talks go badly, the UK would be unlikely to take such action before mid-November when the international COP26 climate summit in Glasgow comes to an end.\nThis would avoid a big UK moment on the global stage being dominated by headlines about a row with Brussels and the possible endangering of the Northern Ireland peace process.\nBut Brussels is readying itself for every eventuality. Key EU member states say they've asked the European Commission to prepare \"targeted retaliation\" if, for example, the UK suddenly stops customs checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nOne possibility you hear mentioned is that the EU could start new legal proceedings against the UK and/or suspend parts of its post-Brexit \"zero tariff zero quota\" trade agreement with the UK. The idea would be to target strategic UK markets like whisky or cars \"to send a clear message to London\", according to EU diplomats I've spoken to. \nAs bilateral discussions start again in earnest over the Northern Ireland Protocol, there's definite potential for things to get a lot messier."

      "tags": "Social care,Home care,Employment,Care homes,NHS England,NHS",
      "text": "Shortages of care staff, who support older or disabled people in the community, are causing major problems for hospitals, the BBC has learned. \nNHS chief executives say rising numbers of patients are stuck in hospitals in England due to a lack of care staff. \nThe situation is \"dire\", according to NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts.\nThe government says extra funding and a regular recruitment drive will help boost the care workforce. \nCare companies are facing acute problems in recruiting and retaining staff, according to a report which suggests there are now more unfilled care jobs than before the pandemic. \nThe annual Skills for Care workforce report is based on data provided by a representative sample of employers of England's 1.54 million care workers.\nThe researchers calculate that employers were failing to fill 8% of posts before the pandemic.\nFigures obtained since suggest this had fallen to below 6% by June 2020 - but by August this year the trend had reversed with 8.2% of care sector roles unfilled. \nThis amounts to more than 100,000 posts with no-one to fill them, says Skills for Care. \nIncreasingly, care companies are forced to turn down work supporting patients as they move from hospital back to their own homes or care homes. \nThose patients have to stay in hospital longer, putting more pressure on an NHS already struggling with Covid-19 and the waiting list backlog. \n\"We've just tipped over the point where delayed discharges are a bigger problem than Covid,\" said one hospital boss who asked not to be named. \n\"Roughly 100 beds blocked and domiciliary care providers are handing dozens of [patient care] packages back to the council as they don't have staff to deliver them,\" said another. \nA third manager had 140 patients ready to leave hospital, but the carer shortage meant \"patients are dying in hospital when their choice was home, a hospice or nursing home\".\nThe anonymous comments from more than 20 hospital bosses were gathered by NHS Providers, in response to a BBC request for information. \nThe organisation's deputy chief executive, Saffron Cordery, said the delays are particularly worrying as winter is about to put extra pressure on services. \nNot being able to leave hospital when they are ready can delay a patient's recovery and rehabilitation, said Ms Cordery, while those waiting for treatment face backlogs.\n\"It's vital that government delivers its commitment to place vital social care services onto a sustainable footing.\"\nShe also highlighted the need for \"crucially - a sustainable workforce, properly valued and respected for this vitally important work\". \nCare companies say the main factors making it hard to find and keep staff are: \nIn Sheffield, Tracey Hobson, a clinical manager at Northfield Nursing Home, says: \"Recruitment is an absolute nightmare\". \n\"You wake up in the morning and you're thinking, you know, I'm not going to be able to ensure that these people get the care that they deserve, and have enough staff to do it.\"\nTracey says the sector faces a national staff shortage. She personally receives about 20 messages each day from recruitment agencies, desperate to hire her. \n\"You know, I've got a job. I'm looking after people to the best of my ability.\"\nIn Buckinghamshire, Dr Kris Owden runs Caremark Aylesbury and is also a doctor who worked on hospital wards during the pandemic. \nThe firm pays relatively well and has managed to recruit enough new staff to replace most of those leaving but Dr Owden says they are still overstretched and have to refuse up to eight new people needing care each day.\n\"For us to be in this position before the winter, before the Christmas period is terrifying,\" he said. \nHe says a properly resourced care system would take pressure off the NHS and wants to see carers paid better, with a proper career structure and recognition of their skills. \nAmong his senior staff, supervisor Charlotte Backhouse and manager Vicky Hartgill - who are both normally office-based - are having to step in and do front-line work.\nOn top of her regular job, Vicky worked through the weekend and on Monday had an 05:00 start. Although she loves seeing clients, she says she is \"shattered\". \nShe added: \"We need to be able to recruit, we need to be able to recruit in a safe way and just have a bigger workforce.\n\"We do have to pick up the phone and change times. We do have to be creative with the care that we provide - and until we can get some more people through the door to support us, that's the way things will have to stay.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"We appreciate the dedication and tireless efforts of care workers throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. \n\"We are providing at least \u00a3500m to support the care workforce as part of the \u00a35.4bn to reform social care.\n\"We are also working to ensure we have the right number of staff with the skills to deliver high quality care to meet increasing demands. \n\"This includes running regular national recruitment campaigns and providing councils with over \u00a31bn of additional funding for social care this year.\""

      "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic has made celebrities out of scientists, who have graced the daily news headlines and gained large social-media followings. \nBut this rise in prominence has come with online abuse and even physical harassment.\nThe journal Nature surveyed scientists, who described receiving threats of violence after media appearances.\nDiscussions about vaccines or the drug ivermectin were common triggers for harassment.  \nIn the past, scientists have faced abuse when discussing climate change or previous vaccination campaigns. \nThe self-selecting survey of 321 people working in fields relevant to Covid found more than a fifth had received threats of physical or sexual violence. \nWhile this is not representative of all scientists and cannot accurately reveal the scale of abuse, it provides a glimpse into some of the personal experiences of those who came into the public eye to give information during the global disease outbreak. \nSix people who responded to the questionnaire said they had been physically attacked following media appearances.\nSome of the more extreme cases have been widely reported. Leading Belgian virologist Prof Marc Van Ranst ended up in a safehouse after being targeted by a far-right trained sniper (since found dead) who despised lockdowns and threatened to kill health professionals. \nThe UK\u2019s chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, was assaulted in a park by a 24-year-old estate agent, while two prominent German scientists were posted bottles of clear liquid labelled \"positive\" and a note telling them to drink it.\nUS infectious-diseases doctor Krutika Kuppalli, who gave national media interviews and testified to a congressional committee, told Nature she had received a death threat via a phone call to her home. \nAustralian virologist Danielle Anderson, who worked at the Wuhan Institute for Virology and was critical of the theory it might be where the virus had escaped from, received an email telling her to \"eat a bat and die\". \nProf Andrew Hill wrote a positive review of anti-parasite drug ivermectin for treating Covid but reversed his stance once he discovered data he had been basing his conclusions on was untrustworthy. \nCurrent available evidence suggests ivermectin is unlikely to be very effective for Covid - but Prof Hill has received a barrage of abuse, including accusing him of genocide, which has driven him off social media. \n\"I was sent images of Nazi war criminals hanging from lampposts, voodoo images of swinging coffins, threats that my family were not safe, that we would all burn in hell,\" he told BBC News.\n\"This was happening most days - I opened my laptop in the morning to be confronted with a sea of hate and disturbing threats.\n\"There were also threats to my scientific reputation on email.\n\"I know many other scientists who have been threatened and abused in similar ways after promoting vaccination or questioning the benefits of unproven treatments like ivermectin.\" \nUniversity of Southampton senior research fellow in global health Dr Michael Head said there had been \"a huge amount of abuse aimed at everyone contributing to the pandemic response... includ[ing] NHS front-line staff\". \nUniversity College London behavioural scientist Prof Susan Michie said \"disturbing\" online abuse would happen \"most intensively after media engagements and especially after those that address restrictions to social mixing ,the wearing of face masks or vaccination\".\nOther scientists surveyed mentioned emails being sent to their employers or their professional reputations being challenged. \nBut of those being harassed on their own social media, almost half said they did not tell their employer. \nThe Nature survey also found those targeted with the most frequent harassment were most likely to say it had affected their willingness to give media interviews in the future. \nFiona Fox, chief executive of the UK Science Media Centre, which provides scientific comment and briefings to journalists, said it was a \"great loss if a scientist who was engaging with the media, sharing their expertise, is taken out of a public debate at a time when we've never needed them so badly\".

      "text": "A Banksy artwork which shredded itself at a previous auction has sold for a record \u00a316m.\nLove is in the Bin was what remained of the artist's live destruction of his piece Girl with Balloon, which sold for \u00a31m in 2018.\nIt went under the hammer at Sotheby's in London on Thursday, selling for \u00a316m - vastly over its \u00a34-6m guide price.\nIncluding a buyer's premium, the purchaser paid \u00a318.5m in total.\nThe sale, which saw nine bidders battle for around 10 minutes, beats the previous record of \u00a316.8m set for Banksy in March. \nAfter closing bidding, auctioneer Oliver Barker joked he was relieved that the artwork was \"still there\".\nBefore opening the bidding, Mr Barker said that the painting became an \"unexpected piece of performance art\" when it shredded in the same auction room after being sold to a \"private European investor\" three years ago.\nOpening bids at \u00a32.5m, its price tag hit \u00a310m within minutes as numerous offers were placed.\nBidding then gradually climbed to a record \u00a315m as the race progressively narrowed down between fewer bidders.\nThere were a few tentative moments after bidder Nick Buckley Wood, representing a private investor, waited to see if anyone would outdo his client's \u00a316m offer.\nA shake of the head from his rival finally indicated they were out of the running.\nMr Barker said: \"At \u00a316m ladies and gentlemen we are selling the Banksy at Sotheby's.\n\"You were here for this fantastic moment.\"\nHe then drew laughter from the audience after saying: \"I can't tell you how terrified I am to bring down this hammer.\"\nIn keeping with his irreverent guerrilla style, Love is in the Bin saw Banksy poke fun at the art world.\nSotheby's contemporary art chairman Alex Branczik said the stunt \"did not so much destroy an artwork by shredding it, but instead created one\".\n\"Today, this piece is considered heir to a venerated legacy of anti-establishment art,\" he added, labelling it as \"the ultimate Banksy artwork and a true icon of recent art history\".\nBack in 2018, moments after the hammer fell at the auction, alarms sounded and the canvas dropped through a hidden shredder built into the bottom.\nThe unnamed European woman who bought the piece said: \"At first I was shocked, but I realised I would end up with my own piece of art history.\"\nFormer BBC arts editor Will Gompertz wrote at the time that he believed Love is in the Bin would go on to be seen as \"one of the most significant artworks of the early 21st Century\".\n\"It is not a great painting that can be compared to a late Rembrandt, or a sculpture to sit alongside Michelangelo's David, but in terms of conceptual art emanating from [Marcel] Duchamp's Dadaist sensibility, it is exceptional,\" he added.\n\"It was brilliant in both conception and execution.\"\n\"What is Love is in the Bin?\" he asked. \"Is it a painting? Or, is it now a piece of conceptual art? Or should it be classified as a sculpture? Or is it rubbish?  \n\"Who decides? Who knows? Duchamp would say it is up to you to decide.\"\nThe piece had been on permanent loan to the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart museum in Germany since March 2019.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "tags": "Islington,Leicester",
      "text": "An MP who made threatening phone calls to a woman because she was jealous of her relationship with her partner has been found guilty of harassing her.\nClaudia Webbe, 56, a former Labour MP for Leicester East, who is now independent, was found guilty of one charge of harassment. \nWestminster Magistrates' Court heard she made several calls over two years and threatened the woman with acid. \nAfter the verdict, Webbe said she was \"deeply shocked\" and would appeal.\nThe prosecution said Webbe, of Islington, north London, made 16 calls to 59-year-old Michelle Merritt, a friend of her partner Lester Thomas, between September 2018 and April last year. \nThe court heard on one occasion she made an \"angry\" call, used a derogatory term and added: \"You should be acid.\"\nIn another she threatened to send naked photos and videos of Ms Merritt to her family and made silent calls from a withheld number, the hearing was told. \nDuring cross-examination on Wednesday, Webbe, who was suspended by the Labour party, said she had never met Ms Merritt and \"there was no reason for any falling out\".\nShe claimed a recorded phone call on 25 April in which Webbe was heard saying \"get out of my relationship\" 11 times was taken out of context. \nWebbe said it had been during a heated argument with Mr Thomas over breaching the Covid-19 lockdown with Ms Merritt.\n\"I simply called her and asked her not to break lockdown with Lester,\" she said.\n\"She was breaking the rules and I was just pointing it out. I'm the victim.\"\nWebbe claimed she was a victim of \"domestic abuse and coercive control\" and was being \"goaded and gaslighted\" during the row, which resulted in police being called after a neighbour reported her screams.\nShe confirmed she was still in a relationship with Mr Thomas and they were engaged. \nWebbe previously said: \"I have spent my lifetime campaigning for the rights of women, for challenging this type of behaviour and this is not something that is in my character and not something I would ever do.\"\nPaul Hynes QC representing Webbe read out character references from former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott.\nMs Abbott said the defendant was \"very committed to working to support women\", describing her \"warm, empathetic manner\" and added: \"I regard her as a very honest woman.\"\nWhile Mr Corbyn said she was \"very committed to ensuring the administration of justice is done\" and prepared to \"state uncomfortable truths when it matters\".\nHowever, District Judge Paul Goldspring said he had found Webbe \"untruthful\" in her evidence.\n\"Some of the things she said I believe were made up on the spur of the moment,\" he said.\n\"Some things she said in the witness box just don't bear scrutiny.\n\"In short, I find Ms Webbe to be vague, incoherent and at times illogical.\"\nHe released Webbe on unconditional bail but warned her that she could face prison when she is sentenced on 4 November. \n\"Threatening to throw acid at somebody and to send intimate photographs to family members crosses the custody threshold,\" he added.\nAfter the verdict, Webbe said: \"I am innocent and will appeal this verdict. As I said in court and repeat now, I have never threatened violence nor have I ever harassed anyone.\"\nHer lawyer, Raj Chada, added: \"The recording of the call Ms Webbe made has been taken out of context. We are sure that Ms Webbe will be vindicated at an appeal.\"\nLisa Rose from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Webbe's \"persistent nuisance behaviour caused considerable distress and alarm to her victim who became genuinely concerned for her safety\".\n\"No-one should have to endure this sort of harassment,\" she added.\nThe Labour Party called on Webbe to step down after the verdict.\nA spokesperson added: \"The Labour Party strongly condemns Claudia Webbe's actions and she should now resign.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "title": "Brexit: EU proposes fewer checks on GB-NI goods",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,European Commission,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU has released its plan for a reduction of post-Brexit checks on goods and medicines arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. \nNorthern Ireland has a special Brexit deal which keeps it in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.\nBut it means goods arriving from Britain face checks and controls.\nThe UK government said it is studying the detail of the EU's proposals.\nThe new plan, which seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit agreement, would remove about 80% of spot checks, the EU said.\nThe EU said customs paperwork would also be cut by 50%.\nThe UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers.\nAt the start of the year, the new post-Brexit arrangement - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIt involves keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods - but this, in turn, creates a new trade border with Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK.\nBrexit Minister Lord Frost said the protocol - which the UK originally agreed to - was harming the peace process in Northern Ireland and that it undermined the Good Friday Agreement. \nThe EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and is now attempting to ease that burden with what it calls \"a different model\".\nIt has produced \"bespoke arrangements\" covering food, customs and medicines. \nEuropean Commission Vice-President Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he had listened to, and engaged with, those in Northern Ireland. \n\"Today's proposals are a direct, genuine response to their concerns,\" he said. \n\"We have put a lot of hard work into them to make a tangible change on the ground.\"\nHe said he looked forward to \"engaging earnestly and intensively\" with the UK government.\nSome firms in Northern Ireland affected by the protocol say supply chains are being disrupted, and while there may be opportunities, there are also some problems. \nOn Wednesday, a UK government spokesman said the next step should be a \"rapidly conducted\" round of intensive talks on both the UK and EU proposals.\n\"Significant changes which tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol, including governance, must be made if we are to agree a durable settlement which commands support in Northern Ireland,\" he said.\nA solution is needed that both safeguards the Good Friday Agreement and \"puts the UK-EU relationship on a stronger footing\", he added. \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme that Prime Minister Boris Johnson told him \"personally that after agreeing to the protocol he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics\".\n\"I do believe that the government didn't really want this to happen to Northern Ireland and they took a short term bet.\n\"The trouble is this has cost the business people of Northern Ireland \u00a3850m which we can't afford, so it's got to be fixed and it's got to be fixed fast.\"\nTalks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the proposals were a \"major effort\" to address the post-Brexit trade rules between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\"Meats, whether they're chilled meats or other food stuffs, can come into Northern Ireland and if they're staying in Northern Ireland then the checks that are currently required will not be required,\" he said. \nThis would be dependent on proper sharing of data and proper labelling, he added. \nThere are also plans to give Northern Ireland politicians and other interested parties greater influence over the implementation of the protocol.\nHowever, the measures will fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role.\nOn Tuesday, the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost proposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one.\nAs part of these plans, the UK government wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ, which is the EU's highest court.\nThe agreement states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland - so for example, if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ.\nThe movement of food products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have faced the biggest difficulties due to the EU's strict rules.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal: It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).\nIt means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules: As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland.\nBut some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all: EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found.\nRead more: The Northern Ireland Protocol explained\nThe EU says its new plan for food means that most products destined for consumers will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nA grace period, which means the protocol is not being fully implemented, currently means that supermarkets do not face a full range of controls.\nThe EU says its new proposals will go beyond this and cover more businesses.\nIt says the level of identity and physical checks will be up to 80% lower compared to other single market borders. \nHowever, it says for this to work it will need the UK to build properly equipped border posts at Northern Ireland's ports, allow access to real time trade data and implement \"only for sale in UK\" labelling.\nThe possibility also remains that some GB food products could be banned in Northern Ireland.\nThe EU maintains a \"prohibited and restricted\" list of food imports, which includes chilled meat products like fresh sausages.\nThe EU is proposing that \"national identity goods\", or those which do not have a non-GB supply chain, would be exempt, but that leaves open the possibility that some goods could be banned.\nOn customs, the EU is proposing what it calls a \"unique facilitation\" for paperwork, which it says will mean Northern Ireland importers can submit a greatly reduced amount of information.\nIt estimates this will halve the administrative burden.\nIt will also expand the concept of \"goods not at risk\" - this is an existing arrangement which Northern Ireland traders use so they do not have to pay EU tariffs on GB goods.\nThe EU says the combination of the agri-food and customs proposals will effectively create an \"express lane\" to help facilitate the movements of GB goods whose end destination is Northern Ireland.\nThe supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has emerged as one of the most difficult issues. \nPharmaceutical distributors have warned that if the current protocol was fully implemented they would have to withdraw hundreds of products from sale in Northern Ireland.\nThe EU is now proposing to change its laws around the regulation of medicines to keep products flowing.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d has previously said he will do \"whatever it takes\" to guarantee the supply of medicines.\nThis is a complicated area and the pharmaceutical industry will need time to assess if the plan will work.\nThe EU originally floated a version of this idea in July but the industry was unconvinced at that time.\nThe proposals for giving Northern Ireland politicians and other stakeholders a greater voice include the establishment of structured groups to provide a forum for discussion on key issues.\nIt would also see interested parties invited to some meetings of the Specialised Committee, one of the joint UK/EU bodies that oversee the protocol.\nThe EU says it also wants to create a stronger link between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the EU/UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly.\nIt also intends to create a website to track which EU legislation is applicable in Northern Ireland.

      "title": "Millions miss out on seven-day GP access",
      "tags": "NHS,GP",
      "text": "More than five million people across England are unable to book an appointment with a GP outside of working hours.\nBBC analysis of official data shows 10% of registered patients live in areas where there is no access to GPs on evenings and at weekends.\nLabour has accused the government of \"breaking its promises\".\nNHS England said it was still on target to provide access to extended care for all patients by 1 October.\nOur analysis shows:\nFormer Prime Minister David Cameron made a promise everyone in England would have access to GP services seven-days a week by 2020, at the Conservative party conference in 2014..\nThe plans have since been brought forward.  From October, it will be mandatory for all Clinical Commissioning Groups to put in place arrangements for extended access to general practice. \nThe latest data - from March and collated bi-annually from surveys filled out by GPs - shows widespread regional variation.\nIn Sefton in Merseyside, for example, two thirds of patients had no access to GPs outside of working hours, the highest percentage in England.\nThat compares to Herefordshire and Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, where every patient had access to full provision.\nA spokesman for NHS South Sefton CCG said extended access to general practice was \"not compulsory\", but it was \"undertaking a procurement exercise\" to roll services out from October.\nSelf-employed, mother of three, Pragya Agarwal is registered at a GP practice commissioned by NHS Southport and Formby CCG. \nNo practices provide a full 8am-8pm service, but 94% of patients have access to some form of partial provision.\nPragya said it was often impossible to access a doctor's appointment.\nShe said \"You call in the morning to make an appointment at literally one minute to 8am and it's impossible to get through, the lines are jammed straight away, everyone is trying to call at the same time and there just aren't enough appointments in the day.\n\"Then usually you're offered an appointment a week, eight to ten days ahead\u2026 the access to appointments is very limited. It's really difficult unless you sound really, really urgent.\"\nPragya said \"I hate to malign the NHS in any way, everyone works incredibly hard. Our local GP seems under a lot of pressure to meet deadlines, so when you do see someone for five to 10 minutes it's very rushed.\"\nOlivia Djouadi, 46, from Bromley in south London, where 94% of patients have full access to extended hours appointments.  She is self-employed and cares for a disabled teenage son.\n\"I call for an appointment at 8 o'clock on a Monday morning and can be given an appointment for a couple of weeks time. \n\"At 8 o'clock, it seems they've booked all the slots for the day. If you are even slightly late, like 8.15, there is no chance of seeing someone that day.\n\"I've often been given an appointment for a couple of weeks time. I have diabetes and lots of medical needs so I can't really wait a couple of weeks. If I'm concerned, I will often go to the in-house GP at A&E ... and I sit and wait.\n\"I have a teenager in a wheelchair and work full-time, so I'd have to cancel his school day if I have to wait at A&E to see someone because I might not be back when his transport brings him home from school.\"\nA spokesperson for NHS Rushcliffe CCG said it was proud of the extended hours service it provides, through '\"vanguard funding\".\nIn 2015, it became one of fifty 'vanguard' sites created and funded by the NHS. The purpose was to bring together hospitals, community services, GPs and care homes to provide extended care. \nNHS Herefordshire CCG has been able to offer full extended access, through the GP Access Fund. \nOriginally called the Prime Minister's Challenge Fund, it became one of twenty-one pilot areas funded in 2015 to provide extended GP hours. \nThat has enabled Herefordshire to commission a GP Federation to provide three hub sites across the county, to provide seven-day a week service. \nChristine Price from Healthwatch Herefordshire, the independent champion for people who use health services in the county, said though people want convenience of care, how to get to services for those living in rural communities is an issue.\nChristine said \"People thought their own local GP would be open as part of extended access, but it's not realistic with twenty-four practices across the whole county.\n\"With limited transport between market towns and rural areas, the reality is not everyone can access services. \n\"If all patients wanted to use it, it wouldn't have the capacity for them to use it.\n\"People without money, friends and family nearby struggle to access services outside of their immediate area. It's not there for everyone in reality.\"\nDoctors' groups have questioned the government's priority of extended access at a time when there is a critical shortage of GPs.\nIn the recent British Medical Association's paper, Dr Richard Vautrey, its GP Committee chair, said the government should address \"increased demand and unmanageable GP workloads\".\nThe Royal College of GPs said it wants to give patients access to services they need but states there are not enough GPs to provide this. \nIts chair, Helen Stokes-Lampard, has called for funding for an extra GP in every practice in England. \nLabour's Shadow Secretary of Health and Social Care, Jonathan Ashworth MP has been critical of the handling of the extended access scheme. \nHe said \"This is yet more evidence that the Tories have broken their promises on access to GPs seven days a week.\n\"The truth is that years of austerity has taken its toll on general practice. We need a serious long term investment plan for primary care.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it had invested an extra \u00a32.4bn a year into general practice by 2021.\nIt said alternative data, recorded in May 2018, sourced monthly from Clinical Commissioning Groups, suggests 55% of the population now had access to 8am-8pm GP services.  NHS England has declined to release this data. \nA spokesman for NHS England said: \"The NHS is investing at least \u00a3258m this year to offer improved access to general practice, including evening and weekend appointments. This is ahead of schedule with appointments available to more than half the country now, and they will be available across the whole country by October this year.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it wants everyone to have access to evening and weekend GP appointments and \"already millions have benefitted\" from the plans.\nThe BBC also analysed similar data from Wales and Scotland.  In Northern Ireland, there was no comparable data available.\nIn Wales, five out of seven Health Boards provided no out-of-hours appointments after 18:30, in data provided by the Welsh government. GPs chose whether to provide 24-hour care for their patients or to transfer responsibility to local Health Boards. \nThe Welsh government said its figures \"show more appointments are available for people at more convenient times\".\nIn Scotland, 3% of patients are registered at a GP practice that has opted in to provide out-of-hours services, in data provided by the Information Services Division (ISD) on behalf of the Scottish Government. \nA Scottish Government spokesman said GPs were not contractually required to provide care, and it was the responsibility of local Health Boards. \n\"Everyone in Scotland has access to out-of-hours services - regardless of where they live,\" he added."

      "title": "Norway attack: What we know about bow and arrow killings",
      "tags": "Norway",
      "text": "A bow and arrow attack that left five people dead and three others wounded has shocked Norway.\nA 37-year-old Danish man has been arrested and is being questioned by police, who have not ruled out terrorism.\nThe attack was the country's deadliest since the far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in 2011.\nHere's what we know.\nThe attack took place on Wednesday evening in Kongsberg, which is about 80km (49 miles) south-west of Norway's capital, Oslo. \nThe attacker launched the assault near a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. \nPolice first received a report of a man shooting at people with a bow and arrow at 18:12 local time (16:12 GMT). Shortly afterwards, officers arrived on the scene. \nIt is not clear if they were armed when they first came across the suspect. They made contact with the attacker at 18:18. \nThe officers were then shot at with arrows before the attacker escaped. Attacks were subsequently reported in different locations.\nOne witness told local media they saw a woman lying injured at an intersection and calling for help.\nAnother witness told the TV2 channel that she saw a \"man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand\".\n\"Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,\" she said.\nImages from Kongsberg showed arrows lying on the ground and one sticking out of a wall.\nAt a news conference on Thursday, Norwegian police official Ole Bredrup Saeverud said the victims were most likely killed after officers first confronted the attacker.\nThe suspect was arrested at 18:45 - 35 minutes after the attack began. Warning shots were fired during the arrest, police said.\nNorwegian media questioned why it took police more than half an hour to arrest the suspect after the first reports of an attack. Mr Saeverud said it had been a \"confusing\" situation.\nNorway's intelligence service, PST, said the attack appeared to be an \"act of terror\" but further investigation was needed to establish the motivation.\nOfficers named him as Espen Andersen Brathen, a 37-year-old Danish citizen with a Danish mother and Norwegian father.\nPolice prosecutor Ann Ir\u00e9n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man lived in Kongsberg and was known to police. He will be assessed by psychiatric experts, she told NRK.\nThe suspect converted to Islam and \"there were fears linked to radicalisation previously\", Chief Saeverud told reporters.\nHe said the latest report of concern about radicalisation was in 2020. \"We haven't had any reports about him in 2021,\" Mr Saeverud said.\nPublic broadcaster NRK reported that Brathen received a six-month restraining order against two family members last year.\nAccording to the verdict in that case, he reportedly left a revolver on the sofa which one family member perceived as a threat.\nThe suspect was taken to a police station in the town of Drammen, where he was questioned by police. \"He is explaining in detail and he is speaking and co-operating with the police,\" the suspect's lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, told reporters.\nMr Saeverud said the suspect confessed during questioning, adding that he was \"relatively sure that he acted alone\".\nThe suspect was charged and is expected to appear before a court in Kongsberg on Friday at 09:00 local time.\nNone of the victims have been formally identified. Four women and a man, all aged between 50 and 70, were killed, police said.\nRelatives have been notified. Police say they do not believe the suspect knew any of the victims.\nOne of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the supermarket, where the attack is said to have started. He and one other wounded person were stable.\nIn a press release on Thursday, police said a third person was wounded and had been taken to an emergency room.\nIncoming Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said the attack was a \"gruesome and brutal act\". It happened a day before his centre-left coalition government was due to take office.\nThe outgoing conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg said reports of the attack were \"horrifying\".\nAnd Kongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack that had taken place in an area where many people lived.\nDescribing the town as \"a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people\", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by \"this very tragic situation\".\nInternationally, political leaders expressed shock and offered their condolences.\nDenmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen condemned the \"terrible attack\", while UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \"saddened by the tragic news\"."

      "tags": "COP26,UK climate change protests,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Carbon emissions are rebounding strongly and are rising across the world's 20 richest nations, according to a new study. \nThe Climate Transparency Report says that CO2 will go up by 4% across the G20 group this year, having dropped 6% in 2020 due to the pandemic.\nChina, India and Argentina are set to exceed their 2019 emissions levels. \nThe authors say that the continued use of fossil fuels is undermining efforts to rein in temperatures. \nWith just two weeks left until the critical COP26 climate conference opens in Glasgow, the task facing negotiators is stark. \nOne of the key goals of the gathering is to take steps to keep the important 1.5C temperature threshold alive and within reach. \nWith the world currently around 1.1C warmer than pre-industrial times, limiting future incremental increases is extremely challenging. \nIf Glasgow is going to succeed on this question, then the countries that create the most carbon will have to put ambitious policies into place. \nThe evidence from this new report is that it isn't happening fast enough.\nThe G20 group is responsible for around 75% of global emissions, which fell significantly last year as economies were closed down in response to Covid-19.\nBut this year's rebound is being powered by fossil fuel, especially coal.\nAccording to the report, compiled by 16 research organisations and environmental campaign groups, coal use across the G20 is projected to rise by 5% this year. \nThis is mainly due to China who are responsible for around 60% of the rise, but increases in coal are also taking place in the US and India. \nCoal use in China has surged with the country experiencing increased demand for energy as the global economy has recovered. \nCoal prices are up nearly 200% from a year ago. \nThis in turn has seen power cuts as it became uneconomical for coal-fired electricity plants generate electricity in recent months. \nWith the Chinese government announcing a change in policy this week to allow these power plants to charge market rates for their energy, the expectation is that this will spur even more coal use this year.\nWhen it comes to gas, the Climate Transparency Report finds that use is up by 12% across the G20 in the 2015-2020 period. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nWhile political leaders have promised that the global recovery from Covid should have a green focus, the financial commitments made by rich nations don't bear this out. \nOf the $1.8tn that has been earmarked for recovery spending, just $300bn will go on green projects. \nTo put that figure into context, it almost matches the $298bn spent by G20 countries in subsidising fossil fuel industries in the eighteen months up to August 2021. \nThe report also points to some positive developments including the growth of solar and wind energy in richer countries, with record amounts of new capacity installed across the G20 last year. \nRenewables now supply around 12% of power compared to 10% in 2020.\nPolitically, there has been significant progress as well with the G20 group as the majority recognise that net zero targets are needed for around the middle of this century.\nAll members of the group have agreed to put new 2030 carbon plans on the table before the Glasgow conference. \nHowever, China, India, Australia and Saudi Arabia have not yet done so.\n\"G20 governments need to come to the table with more ambitious national emission reductions targets. The numbers in this report confirm we can't move the dial without them - they know it, we know it - the ball is firmly in their court ahead of COP26,\" said Kim Coetzee from Climate Analytics, who coordinated the overall analysis.\nThere are expectations that both India and China will submit new national plans before the meeting in Glasgow, which could give a significant boost to attempts to keep the 1.5C target in view. \nThe G20 group will meet in Rome in the days leading up to COP26 and the UK minister who will lead the talks has in recent days urged the leaders of these countries to now step up.\n\"It is leaders who made a promise to the world in Paris six years ago, and it is leaders that must honour it,\" said Alok Sharma.\n\"Responsibility rests with each and every country, and we must all play our part. Because on climate, the world will succeed, or fail, as one.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "Comedian Robert Webb and his dance partner, Dianne Buswell, are withdrawing from Strictly Come Dancing. \nPeep Show star Webb, who had open heart surgery two years ago, made the decision due to ill health. \nHe said he had an urgent consultation with his heart specialist after experiencing symptoms and she recommended he pull out of the series.\nA Strictly spokeswoman said the BBC One show would continue as normal this weekend, despite Webb's departure.\nWebb, 49, said he was \"extremely sorry\" to have to leave the competition, adding: \"It became clear that I had bitten off way more than I could chew for this stage in my recovery.\" \n\"I'm proud of the three dances that Dianne Buswell and I managed to perform and deeply regret having to let her down like this,\" he said. \n\"I couldn't have wished for a more talented partner or more patient teacher, and it's a measure of Dianne's professionalism and kindness that I was able to get as far as I did.\"\nHe thanked everyone who had voted for him and his dance partner, saying he was \"especially touched\" by the support from fellow heart patients - and that he had perhaps been \"too eager to impress them\". \nHe said they would know \"that recovery doesn't always go in a straight line\", adding that \"it was always going to be a difficult mountain to climb\". \n\"I leave knowing that Strictly viewers are in very safe hands and I'll be cheering for my brother and sister contestants all the way to Christmas,\" he said. \"Despite this sad ending, it has been a genuine honour to be part of this huge, joyful and barking mad TV show.\"\nIn a video played on BBC Two's It Takes Two, which announced the news, he said he would \"miss learning new dances and being able to do new dances... it's been a ride\". \nBuswell said she was a \"massive fan\" of Webb's, had been delighted to learn he was joining the show and being partnered with him was the \"icing on the cake\". She said they had worked hard \"and had a good laugh along the way\". \nShe added: \"I know Robert had a lot more to give to the competition but his health of course comes first and I wish him a speedy recovery. I feel lucky to have danced with him and to call him a friend.\"\nFellow contestants also sent their best wishes, with BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker saying it had \"been wonderful to watch them enjoying every dance each week\". \nStrictly's executive producer Sarah James thanked the pair for the \"commitment, creativity and joy they brought to the show\".\nShe said they were \"so sad\" but completely understood and supported his decision, adding that everyone on Strictly sent \"love and best wishes for his continued recovery\".  \nWebb and Buswell had performed three dances together, most recently as Kermit and Miss Piggy in last weekend's Movie Week show. \nThey danced a quickstep to The Muppet Show theme, from The Muppets Movie, on Saturday night and scored 25 points from the judges. Viewers gave them enough votes to avoid the dance off, broadcast on Sunday. \nWebb, who previously became a fan favourite with a Flashdance routine on Let's Dance for Comic Relief, had said it was his health condition that made him want to sign up for Strictly. \n\"It's partly my age, and it's partly that nearly two years ago I had quite a big-deal health thing,\" he told the BBC before the live shows began. \"I had to have open heart surgery, so since then I think my attitude is basically, this is no time to be cool, sitting at the edges watching the other people do the dancing.\""
