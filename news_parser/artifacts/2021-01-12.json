      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The past 48 hours have been the busiest for health trusts since the start of the pandemic, with appeals to off-duty staff to help ease the pressure. \nSome trusts were close to declaring a major incident, which was averted after staff responded to Sunday's call. \nNI's six trusts warned that by the third week of January, hospitals could be dealing with double the number of Covid patients.\nHealth trusts have also said more cancer operations could be cancelled. \nThe Belfast Health Trust has already cancelled urgent cancer surgeries. \nOn Monday, a further 16 Covid-related deaths were announced by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, 15 of them occurring in the last 24 hours.\nSeven hundred and fifty-nine new cases of the virus were also reported.\nThe Western Health Trust is appealing to families to bring their loved ones home as soon as they are ready for discharge, and care for them there - even if a package is not yet in place.\nMeanwhile, a divert of patients from the Southern Health Trust to the Western Health Trust has been lifted.\nThree patients were diverted from the Southern Health Trust to the Western Health Trust overnight on Sunday.\nThe number of Covid-19 patients being treated by the Southern Health Trust is now 230, up from 215 on Sunday night.\nEmergency Department (ED) patients in the trust are experiencing very long waits, with departments expected to be busy again on Monday evening.\nIn total 91,954 people in Northern Ireland had received at least one coronavirus jab as of Monday night.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said on Monday afternoon that the latest modelling showed NI's R-number is sitting at about 1.1-1.2.\nThis is a drop from an estimated 1.8 earlier in January.\nMrs Foster said things were \"moving in the right direction\" with a reduction in the number of positive cases, but warned everyone needed to \"ready themselves\" for strain on the health service in the next few weeks.\nShe added that the executive had \"few options left\", if further restrictions were deemed necessary to tackle the transmission of the virus.\nThe first minister suggested the executive could look at whether curfews should be imposed again.\nThe executive will meet on Tuesday and Thursday this week for updates from health officials on the coronavirus situation.\nNew lockdown restrictions came into force in NI on Friday, forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasons.\nSpeaking to Good Morning Ulster, Western Health Trust chief executive Dr Anne Kilgallen predicted two out of every four patients being treated in hospitals in the west will have coronavirus by the third week of January. \nShe said currently one in four people in Northern Ireland hospitals has Covid-19. \nDr Kilgallen said the surge over the weekend was \"an indication of why\" they had to suspend red-flag cancer surgeries. \nShe added: \"We will work our hardest to ensure that we do respond to need. This is one of the reasons why, some trusts and I think this week more of us will do so, we made the extremely difficult decision to postpone cancer surgery.\"\nShe asked families to bring their relatives home as soon as they are \"medically fit\" for discharge. \n\"We realise that this is a big ask of families, but we do need people's help. We cannot keep people in hospital awaiting care packages, or indeed awaiting their preference in terms of a care home.\"\nIt is understood at the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen, five senior doctors, several radiographers, pharmacists and nurses came into work on Sunday.\nThis freed up 20 to 30 beds, allowing the Western Health Trust to take on patients from the Southern Health Trust. \nAll weekend, parts of Northern Ireland's health system were under severe pressure but, at times, it seemed the Southern Trust's hospitals were on the brink of falling over.\u00a0 \nAppeals were made for additional staff in the Western and Southern Health Trusts while a joint statement by the chief executives of the six health trusts says staff were doing all they could to deal with the situation.\nDaisy Hill and Craigavon were especially busy, with appeals made for available staff to come to work.\nSouth West Acute Hospital put out a similar appeal as it prepared to accept ambulance diverts and patients from other areas.\u00a0 \nOften an appeal for staff is the first indication that a hospital is about to declare a major incident, but when asked by the BBC if that was the case the Southern Health Trust\u00a0said calls for additional staff to come to work had helped avoid a crisis. \nThere have been numerous warnings that January would see an alarming increase in Covid cases, deaths and pressure - sadly, officials aren't being proved wrong. \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was experiencing the \"worst case scenario\" predicted at the start of the pandemic. \n\"We are at the extreme of the pandemic right now, this is the worst situation that we have been in from the very onset.\"\nShe added that the peak for Covid-19 cases had \"probably been reached\" but the peak pressure on the health service was yet to come.\nAt the weekend, Belfast Trust chief executive Dr Cathy Jack appealed to staff to \"voluntarily postpone any planned booked annual leave in the coming weeks\".\nHowever, Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursing NI, said it is an \"understatement\" to say that staff are feeling tired and overworked and any attempt to force them to cancel annual leave would be \"inhumane\".\nPatricia McKeown of trade union Unison, which represents many nurses, said staff were \"tired, they're stressed they're getting infected, they're getting sick, some of them, tragically, haven't made it.\n\"And yet, incredibly, they responded in the way they did over the weekend.\n\"But right now they're being asked to give even more, respond again in an even bigger and more intense way, because this coming week is going to be very, very serious.\"\nChief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said it is estimated that on average about \"one in 60\" people currently have Covid-19 in Northern Ireland.\nHe said the rising number of cases is a \"payback\" for the relaxation of restrictions in December.\n\"We've been running at about 500 people at any one time in our hospitals with Covid,\" he told The Nolan Show.\n\"I think it's very likely the numbers will be in excess of a thousand and that will put extreme pressure on an already hard pressed staff."

      "text": "A fall in Northern Ireland's rate of Covid-19 infection has been achieved by many people \"doing the right thing\", Arlene Foster has said.\nBut she said she was concerned by reports of some employers not adhering to the \"stay-at-home\" order for staff.\nEarlier, ministers also discussed a potential crackdown on larger retailers selling non-essential items.\nThe first minister said that was a \"selfish spirit\" which would not help beat the virus.\nStormont's first and deputy first ministers were appearing in Dungannon, County Tyrone, at their first joint press conference in more than a month.\nTheir comments came as a further 1,205 cases of the virus were reported by Northern Ireland's Department of Health on Tuesday. \nTwenty-two more people have died with the virus, taking the department's total number of deaths to 1,498.\nThere are 785 people in hospital with Covid-19, 55 are in intensive care.\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations.\nBut it has now fallen \"significantly\", according to the Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young.\nThe first and deputy first ministers will meet the PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne on Tuesday evening to discuss enforcement of the coronavirus laws.\nMichelle O'Neill, NI's Deputy First Minister, said there would also be an \"urgent roundtable\" with the retail sector to reinforce the need to \"comply with the spirit and letter\" of the restrictions.\n\"Adherence will get us through this difficult period,\" said Ms O'Neill.\nNorthern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with many sectors forced to close. \nPeople have also been told they should only leave home for exercise, food and medical needs or if they cannot work from home.\nMrs Foster said the evidence provided to ministers showed that the restrictions were working, and she paid tribute to the public for complying.\n\"It's people choosing to Facetime and phone friends rather than visiting, it's doing one big shop and not nipping out every day, doing the best job you can at home and not going into the work place when you don't have to,\" she added.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer warned that there are \"some hard yards to go\" and lockdown would not be ending soon.\n\"I'm not certain we will be emerging from lockdown in February. I think that would be optimistic in the extreme,\" said Dr Michael McBride.\n\"We have a long, long way to go with this virus. I don't think any of us can anticipate a return to normality come the 6th of February.\"\nMr McBride said restrictions would be in place for a considerable number of months, until a time when more of the population who are extremely clinically vulnerable are vaccinated.\nEarlier, Prof Young said Northern Ireland had passed the peak in terms of new cases of Covid-19 for this wave of the pandemic.\nBut he warned: \"We still have a long way to go and the number of cases we are seeing each day is still averaging well over 1,000 cases a day - which by any measure in the course of the epidemic represents a very high level.\" \nHe said he expects the number of hospital inpatients to continue to rise \"until some time in last two weeks in January\".\nProf Young said he believed that the current restrictions are \"sufficient\" for the moment, if people stick to them.\nNorthern Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said it was estimated that on average about one in 60 people have Covid-19 in Northern Ireland.\nHe said the rising number of cases was a \"payback\" for the relaxation of restrictions in December.\nNew lockdown restrictions came into force in Northern Ireland on Friday 8 January, meaning people can only leave their home for essential reasons.\nProf Young said while compliance with the stay-at-home order was better than it was at the start of December, it was still not as good as it was in the first lockdown in March.\nAmid the pressure on the health service, health trusts have said more cancer operations could be cancelled.\nThe Belfast Health Trust has already cancelled urgent cancer surgeries.\nFather James O'Reilly, a chaplain at Antrim Area Hospital, said he has been called to the hospital almost every day in the past year to give Covid-19 patients their last rites and to provide comfort to families and staff.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme he said: \"You can see the toll it's taking on the nurses and doctors now.\n\"They are giving everything and quite honestly they don't have much more to give it seems.\n\"That's a scary thought because they're our last line of defence against this disease.\"\nAs of Monday evening, almost 92,000 people in Northern Ireland had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.\nDr Frances O'Hagan, whose clinic in Armagh city began vaccinating people aged over 80 last week, expects to have administered the jab to more than 300 patients by the end of the week.\nShe said she hoped to get more stock of the vaccines \"very shortly\" for the next groups on the priority list.\n\"We are ready to go... we will get those [vaccines] into patients' arms as soon as they are given us,\" she added."

We cannot do this indefinitely. \n\"There comes a point where if the infection gets further out of control, more and more patients from London will need to be transferred elsewhere.\"\nAt the start of November, he said, London had 1,000 Covid-19 patients. \nThis increased four-fold to 4,000 on Christmas Day and has doubled to just under 8,000 today, with more than 1,000 of those on critical care, he told the press conference.\nBut Dr Diwakar said there was \"hope\", with one hall of the ExCel Centre having opened as London's first mass vaccination centre.\n\"I can tell you Covid-19 is a horrible, horrible disease that leaves so many, including young people, breathless and gasping for life,\" he said. \nOn Friday, the Mayor of London declared a \"major incident\" as he described the coronavirus spread in the capital as \"out of control\".\nMore than 120 firefighters and 75 Met Police officers have been drafted in to help the London Ambulance Service cope with demand."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,World War Two",
      "text": "The Covid pandemic has caused excess deaths to rise to their highest level in the UK since World War Two.\nThere were close to 697,000 deaths in 2020 - nearly 85,000 more than would be expected based on the average in the previous five years.\nThis represents an increase of 14% - making it the largest rise in excess deaths for more than 75 years.\nWhen the age and size of the population is taken into account, 2020 saw the worst death rates since the 2000s.\nThis measure - known as age-standardised mortality - takes into account population growth and age.\nThe data is only available until November - so the impact of deaths in December have not yet been taken into account - but it shows the death rate at that stage was at its highest in England since 2008.\nThe data on deaths can be confusing. \nOn one hand, excess deaths are at their highest since World War Two, while on the other, death rates, once age and size of population are taken into account, are at their worst level for a little over a decade 'only'.\nHow should that be interpreted? \nExcess deaths are basically a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years.\nClearly, 2020 saw a huge and unexpected rise in deaths because of the pandemic, just as World War Two led to a sudden jump.\nBut in determining how much those jumps affected the chances of dying, a measure known as age-standardised mortality, which takes into account the age and size of the population, is important.\nIt shows the pandemic has undone the progress made in the last decade or so. That is significant - especially given this has happened despite lockdowns and social-distancing measures to stop the spread of the virus.\nBut it also helps put the death toll over the past 12 months in a wider context.\nKing's Fund chief executive Richard Murray said the picture was likely to worsen, given Covid deaths were rising following the surge in infections over recent weeks.\n\"The UK has one of the highest rates of excess deaths in the world, with more excess deaths per million people than most other European countries or the US,\" he said.\n'It will take a public inquiry to determine exactly what went wrong, but mistakes have been made. \n\"In a pandemic, mistakes cost lives. Decisions to enter lockdown have consistently come late, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes or the experiences of other countries. \n\"The promised 'protective ring' around social care in the first wave was slow to materialise and often inadequate, a contributing factor to the excess deaths among care home residents last year.\n'Like many countries, the UK was poorly prepared for this type of pandemic.\"\nMatthew Reed, of the end-of-life care charity Marie Curie said the focus on Covid should not hide the fact there has been a \"silent crisis\" of deaths at home.\nHe said people have died prematurely in 2020 from other causes - with a big jump in deaths at home.\n\"We are concerned many have not had the care they needed,\" he added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Social distancing,Crime,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The police's role in the coronavirus pandemic is simple: to ensure we follow national lockdown restrictions.\nBut in practice, that is a huge challenge for officers who are being asked to monitor behaviour that, until March last year, was perfectly legal.\nPolice chiefs have followed a system called \"The Four Es\". Before fines are issued to rule-breakers, police will first:\nThe fourth \"E\" is \"Enforce\" by issuing penalty notices, as a last resort. \nCovid rule-breakers are now \"increasingly likely\" to be fined by officers, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said.\nThe police have a legal duty to make sure the rules are enforced, alongside council, environmental health and trading standards officers.\nIf you break coronavirus regulations, you could get a fixed penalty notice , the Covid equivalent of a traffic offence like speeding. \nSince March, 32,000 have been issued in England and Wales. Penalties rose sharply during England's November lockdown. Almost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out as police moved more quickly to enforcement. \nIn England and Northern Ireland fines start at \u00a3200. Fines start at \u00a360 in Wales, and in Scotland, although this is reduced to \u00a330 if paid within 28 days. \nLarge parties can also be shut down by the police - with fines of up to \u00a310,000.\nIn extreme circumstances, you could be prosecuted and face an even greater fine imposed by a court. \nYes. All of England is now in a \"tier four\" national lockdown, with similar measures in place across the rest of the UK. \nUnder the new lockdown law, you must stay at home unless you have a \"reasonable excuse\" to be outside. Your home includes property such as a garden, shed or garage - and also access to it. \nThe government's lockdown guidance sets out examples of reasonable excuses. Police won't fine you for leaving home to go shopping for essential goods, or to use a business that can remain open, or for going to work or education, training or childcare. \nThere are other reasonable excuses - such as helping other people in their moment of need. Police chiefs are telling frontline officers to use their judgement if they come across a situation not defined in the regulations. \nIf you want to take part in a protest, the law does not define that as a reasonable excuse to leave home. There is, however, an exception for joining a picket as part of lawful industrial action.\nExercise is one of the reasonable excuses for being outside in a public space. You cannot be fined for exercising.\nBut there has been enormous confusion since last March over how long people could exercise for. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove pronounced that spring that he thought half an hour was enough.\nThere are also questions over how far you can go to exercise. Boris Johnson has been criticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Street to go cycling during lockdown.\nThere are no restrictions in law in England on how you exercise and for how long. You cannot exercise in groups, but you can run or go on a wander with someone else from your household, support bubble or one person you don't live with.\nThe government's Covid guidance for exercise explains that law - and mixes it with a non-legal recommendation to only go out once a day - and to stay local.\nIt says local \"means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live\", but that has no legal force.  \nDerbyshire Police have been taking the \"stay local\" principle seriously. Officers have issued tickets to people who drive five miles to their local beauty spot - including two women accused of an illegal picnic because they were carrying takeaway cups of tea. \nThey might. This refers to the ban on \"gatherings\". \nThe last-but-one version of the restrictions made it a potential crime to \"mingle\". That language has now gone from the law - but the rules are far stricter. \nWhile the law in England doesn't criminalise bumping into someone in the street, you can no longer meet anyone socially - other than those in your household, support bubble or people you care for. \nThe Home Office has given the police an extra \u00a330m to pay for Covid patrols in England and Wales.\nOver Christmas there were more than 800 fines for what Home Secretary Priti Patel says were \"egregious\" breaches of the rules. \nThe National Police Chiefs' Council hasn't abandoned the Four Es - but expect more fines and more officers asking people what they are doing.\nFor instance, the Metropolitan Police has told officers to issue fines \"more quickly\" to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches. \nDerbyshire Police, who famously put a drone up over hikers in the first lockdown, has issued a similar warning. \nYes - while in shops and on public transport. You could face a fixed penalty notice if you don't.\nIf you have returned from an overseas Covid hotspot, or have been told by the NHS Test and Trace system to stay at home, you must quarantine for 10 days. \nThe police can now check the NHS Test and Trace database to investigate a tip-off about a quarantine-breaker. Police won't get to see your personal health records. "

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's first minister has said the country's current lockdown is \"very unlikely\" to be lifted at the end of the month.\nNicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed that more than 5,000 people have now died after testing positive for the virus.\nA review of the current restrictions is due to be carried out at the end of January.\nMs Sturgeon said it was possible that there would be no easing at that point. \nA further 54 deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours - bringing the total by that measure to 5,023.\nBut the most recent figures from the National Records of Scotland - which record all deaths registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate - put the total at 6,686.\nMs Sturgeon told her daily briefing that the figures were a reminder of the toll the virus had taken.\nAnd she said every death had caused heartbreak to friends, families and loved ones across the country. \nThe first minister also said Scotland's NHS would be under far greater pressure if the current restrictions had not been put in place on Boxing Day. \nAnd she urged people not to raise their expectations about what will be announced when the lockdown review is completed in a fortnight as wholesale lifting of the restrictions was \"very unlikely\".\nShe added: \"There may not even be any lifting of these restrictions as soon as the end of January - we will have to consider all of that carefully and set it out in due course.\"\nAll of mainland Scotland and some islands were placed into level four restrictions on 26 December, with schools remaining closed to most pupils until at least the end of the month. \nA further 1,875 positive cases of the virus were recorded on Monday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 153,423.\nThe number of people in hospital with the virus stands at 1,717 - an increase of 53 since yesterday and higher than the peak of about 1,500 in the first wave in April.\nOf these, 133 patients are intensive care units, with Ms Sturgeon saying that the virus was putting \"very acute pressure\" on hospitals. \nThe first minister also said that 175,942 people in Scotland had received their first vaccine dose by Monday.\nOpposition parties have claimed that the rollout of the vaccine has been \"sluggish\" in Scotland compared to south of the border - a charge that the government denies. \nAnd they have called for greater transparency over how many people are being given the jab every day.\nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman said on Monday that the government was aiming to vaccinate about 560,000 people in Scotland by 31 January.\nThe Scottish government has previously said it is concerned that too many people have not been following the \"stay at home\" rules that are in place across the whole of the mainland and some islands. \nMinisters have been discussing the possibility of imposing tougher rules on click and collect shopping and takeaway food, with an announcement expected to be made on Wednesday.\nRetail industry representatives have described click and collect services as a \"lifeline\" for struggling businesses amid the forced closure of all non-essential shops.\nAnd they said they had not been shown any evidence that click and collect was driving transmission of the virus. \nMs Sturgeon told her daily coronavirus briefing that the government may not stop click and collect services altogether. \nBut she added: \"If we are saying to people right now that you should not be out of your home for shopping unless it is essential, then do we need to have click and collect for non-essential services instead of having that for delivery?\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Scotland that he did not want to see further restrictions put in place unless there was evidence that they would have the desired effect. \nHe also suggested that restricting click and collect would simply result in more people going back into supermarkets to do their shopping. \nThe Scottish government is also under pressure to lift the the current ban on public Sunday worship, with a group of 500 church leaders from across the UK - including 200 in Scotland - insisting that there is \"no evidence of any tangible contribution to community transmission through churches in Scotland\".\nIn a letter to the first minister, they claim that the ban may be unlawful and accuse the government of failing to understand that \"Christian worship is an essential public service, and especially vital to our nation in a time of crisis\".\nA Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"Test and Protect tells us where people were in their 48-hour infectious period.\n\"So we know that on one day last week the seven-day number for places of worship was 120, and data from yesterday shows the seven-day number for places of worship is 38, underlining the essential decision to require places of worship to close for public health reasons.\"\nMeanwhile, it has been confirmed that everyone arriving in Scotland from overseas will need to show proof of a negative test from Friday. \nThe test will need to be \"highly reliable\", the first minister said, and will need to have been from the previous three days - although young children may be exempt from the restriction. \nThose travelling from countries not on the quarantine exemption list will still need to self-isolate on arrival. \nThe new rules, which will also come into force in England, were first outlined last week.

      "tags": "Scottish government,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A shortage of NHS staff could prevent the opening of the NHS Louisa Jordan to Covid patients if capacity is exceeded elsewhere, a leading doctor has said.\nPresident of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, Prof Mike Griffin, said the increasing numbers off work was a \"major problem\".\nThe Scottish government says the NHS is not being \"overwhelmed\" and staffing plans are in place to deal with demand.\nThe NHS Louisa Jordan is currently being used for outpatient services.\nThe temporary hospital at the SEC in Glasgow was set up in April in response to concerns over hospital capacity.\nIt was not used for Covid care during the first surge of the pandemic and has since been made available for outpatient services, such as orthopaedics, plastic surgery and dermatology.\nIt is also being used for Covid vaccinations.\nProf Mike Griffin told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the pressure on the NHS workforce was particularly acute in the west of Scotland, where the number of cases was high.\n\"Particularly in Glasgow and Lanarkshire, there's been significant increases recently because of the new variant. Without any doubt, that new variant is increasing transmissibility, and therefore increasing infection rates and increasing hospital admissions,\" he said.\n\"But it's not just the admissions that's the problem. Our doctors, surgeons, nurses and everyone are really working extremely hard - but there is an increase in absenteeism because of illness and because of self-isolation amongst nursing staff.\"\nTwo of Scotland's health boards - NHS Ayrshire and Arran and NHS Lanarkshire - are currently over their capacity for Covid patients.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has reached 85% capacity and NHS Tayside is at 81% capacity, according to the latest Scottish government figures.\nThe NHS Louisa Jordan has capacity for 1,000 Covid patients if it is needed, but Prof Griffin said that using it as a Covid facility could be dependent on retired or former staff returning to work for NHS Scotland.\n\"Opening the Louisa Jordan as a Covid institution without staff is impossible,\" he said. \n\"It is equipped to be able to do it. And if the staffing is there, if we get returners and so on, then perhaps that might happen.\"\nThe number of Covid patients in hospital across Scotland is now higher than it was in April, although the numbers in intensive care are lower.\nNumbers initially appeared to be declining in November, but never reached low levels and began to climb sharply again at the end of the year.\nProf Griffin added that it was likely that better treatments for Covid patients were also reducing mortality and so keeping those patients in hospital for longer.\nNHS Scotland has an overall capacity for 13,000 beds, with 2,400 assigned to Covid patients.\nThis is down from a capacity of about 3,600 in the autumn because of additional seasonal pressures on the NHS, including weather-related issues and increased staff absence.\nScotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, accepted that having around 1,500 patients in hospital with Covid had forced the cancellation of procedures such as cataract operations and hip replacements.\nBut he said that ability to \"flex\" within the system meant that the NHS remained within capacity.\nProf Leitch also pointed to the situation in England where there have been reports of limits being put on the amount of oxygen that patients can receive and some intensive care patients having to be treated in non-ICU beds.\nSpeaking at the first minister's coronavirus briefing, he said: \"People shouldn't be scared that the health service is full or overwhelmed - it isn't.\n\"It is fragile, and you just have to look a few hundred miles south to see what happens when it is even more fragile.\n\"So we need to avoid that as much as we can in Scotland.\""

Regular eye tests can often detect symptomless sight-threatening conditions.\" \nBut even simple screen breaks can help to prevent eye strain, the charity suggested.\nGovernment guidance states that under lockdown people can leave home for medical appointments and to \"avoid injury, illness or risk of harm\". \nThe College of Optometrists said its members should continue to provide eye care under lockdown for people who experience any eyesight changes or problems. \nOptometrists are the professionals who will carry out your eye test when you visit an optician's practice. \nRoutine appointments can also be provided \"if capacity permits, and if it is in the patients' best interests\", the guidance states. \nClinical adviser Paramdeep Bilkhu said the college's own research suggested just under a quarter of people noticed their vision deteriorate during the first lockdown. \n\"Our research showed us that many people believe that spending more time in front of screens worsened their vision,\" he said. \n\"The good news is that this is unlikely to cause any permanent harm to your vision. However, it is very important that if you feel your vision has deteriorated or if you are experiencing any problems with your eyes, such as them becoming red or painful, you contact your local optometrist by telephone or online.\"\nUK health and safety legislation states employers must pay for eye tests for their employees if they have to use a screen for work for more than one hour a day. \nIn the summer, the UK Ophthalmology Alliance and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists calculated that at least 10,000 people had missed out on essential eye care in Britain. \nIn the most extreme cases, the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it feared some people were at risk of losing their sight because of a fear of attending hospital during the coronavirus pandemic.\nA Royal College of Ophthalmologists spokesperson said: \"It is important that people who have found significant changes in their vision seek the advice of an optometrist who will examine, and determine if the changes require further investigation by an ophthalmologist - a medically-trained eye doctor.\""

      "text": "Retailers suffered their worst annual sales performance on record in 2020, driven by slump in demand for fashion and homeware products, figures show.\nWhile food sales growth rose 5.4% on 2019, non-food fell about 5%, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.\nIt meant an overall fall of 0.3% in a year dominated by the Covid-19 impact, the worst annual change since the BRC began collating the figures in 1995.\nChristmas offered little cheer, with much of the High Street still closed.\n\"Physical non-food stores, including all of non-essential retail, saw sales drop by a quarter compared with 2019,\" said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive.\n\"Christmas offered little respite for these retailers, as many shops were forced to shut during the peak trading period,\" she said.\nThe 5.4% rise in food sales was fuelled by shoppers flocking to supermarkets and online grocers to ensure they were stocked up during the pandemic.\nIn December, total retail sales increased by 1.8% as shoppers spent more in the run-up to Christmas. Like-for-like sales for the month were up 4.8% as overall shop takings were still affected by restrictions and temporary closures.\nOnline non-food sales jumped by 44.8% in December, according to the new figures, as a higher proportion of shopping took place online.\nThe BRC's sales monitor is collated with the consultancy KPMG, whose UK head of retail, Paul Martin, said: \"In the most important month for the retail industry, there was some positive growth due to the ongoing shift of expenditure from other categories such as travel and leisure.\n\"Once again we saw big swings in the types of products being purchased and the channels used for shopping, with much of the growth taking place online, where nearly half of all non-food purchases were made.\"\nBut he warned that the new lockdown would worsen conditions for many non-essential shops and the High Street generally.\nLast week, a report from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping.\nNearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, the CRR said."

This mentality is what causes nepotism and tribalism in Kenyan institutions, it should be about the most suitable candidate not 'one of our own' thing.\"\nMs Campbell's defenders praised her for visiting Kenya several times and said it was not only the model's social media following that made her the perfect appointment.\nHer circle of friends were equally important as she would attract wealthy tourists willing to spend money.\nThe tourism industry usually contributes about 8.8% to Kenya's annual Gross domestic product (GDP), according to Kenya's East African newspaper."

To support our colleagues, we will have additional security in stores to help manage this.\"\nAn Asda spokesman said if customers had forgotten their face coverings, it would continue to offer them one free of charge. \nBut he added: \"Should a customer refuse to wear a covering without a valid medical reason and be in any way challenging to our colleagues about doing so, our security colleagues will refuse their entry.\"\nAndrew Murphy, executive director of operations at Waitrose, said: \"We've listened carefully to the clear change in tone and emphasis of the views and information shared by the UK's governments in recent days. \n\"By insisting on the wearing of face coverings, over and above the social distancing measures we already have in place, we aim to make our shops even safer for customers.\"\nOn Tuesday, Sainsbury's told the BBC it did not have the power to deny entry to shoppers without masks. However, trials showed customers complied more when asked to wear masks by security guards at the door, it said.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Sainsbury's boss, Simon Roberts, said \"we are not going to ban customers\".\nBut he urged shoppers to wear a mask and shop alone. \n\"By doing that we will help keep everybody safe,\" he said.\nThe Co-op also said it would not ban shoppers without masks from entering, and instead urged customers to take responsibility for wearing a face covering when visiting its stores, as it was mandatory by law. \nBoss of Co-op Food Jo Whitfield said: \"We've increased our in-store messaging to remind customers and government guidance does state that the police can take measures if members of the public don't comply with this law.\"\nIceland said it would take a similar approach, adding the vast majority of its customers continued to shop in compliance with the law. \n\"In view of the rising tide of abuse and violence being directed at our store colleagues, we do not expect them to confront the small minority of customers who aggressively refuse to comply with the law,\" a spokesman added. \nIn England, the police can issue a \u00a3200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a \u00a360 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People have been urged to \"play your part\" and follow Covid rules by Home Secretary Priti Patel, who says she will back police to enforce laws.\nAt a No 10 briefing, Ms Patel said a minority were \"putting the health of the nation at risk\" by flouting rules.\nPolice are \"moving more quickly to issuing fines\", she added, with nearly 45,000 fixed penalty notices issued across the UK.\nAnother 1,243 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid. \nAnd there have been a further 45,533 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK.\nMeanwhile, another 145,076 people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 20,768 a second dose, bringing the totals respectively to 2,431,648 and 412,167.\nAt the briefing, Ms Patel said: \"My message today to anyone refusing to do the right thing is simple: if you do not play your part, our selfless police officers - who are out there risking their own lives every day to keep us safe - they will enforce the regulations.\n\"And I will back them to do so, to protect our NHS and to save lives.\"\nIt comes after the UK's most senior police officer said lockdown rule-breakers were more likely to be fined as Covid laws would be enforced \"more quickly\".\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said her officers had been forced to break up parties, despite hospitals in London struggling to cope with rising patient numbers.\nChairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Martin Hewitt, who also spoke at the Downing Street briefing, said people should be asking themselves whether their reason for leaving home was \"truly essential\". \nHe stressed that police officers had been \"putting themselves at risk in order to keep people safe\", and said it had been \"disappointing\" to see some of the behaviour by rule-breakers.\nHe said examples of recent breaches included: \nMr Hewitt said he made \"no apology\" for police issuing fines, and warned people breaking rules - such as by organising parties or not wearing face coverings on public transport - to \"expect\" a fine. \nAsked if there needed to be more clarity on the guidance around exercise and staying local, Mr Hewitt said it would be wrong to put a \"particular distance\" on how far people could exercise from their home - as it would be too difficult for police to enforce. \nHe said it was right there was an exception to allow people to exercise, but insisted it was the public's responsibility to make sure they were doing so safely.\nThere is a big focus on adherence to lockdown rules. But what has almost gone unnoticed is the fact that cases may have actually started falling. \nThere has now been two consecutive days where newly diagnosed cases have hovered around the 46,000 mark. Up to the weekend, the average was close to 60,000.\nThe drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in London, the south east and east of England. \nIn some regions, cases are still going up. The north west of England is causing particular concern.\nIt is too early for the vaccination programme to be having any significant impact, so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look like they may be beginning to have an impact.\nCare must be taken in reading too much into a couple of days' data.\nHospital cases are still rising - patients being admitted at the moment are the ones who were infected a week or so ago - but it does at least offer a glimmer of hope. \nLater in the news conference, NHS medical director for London Dr Vin Diwakar said the capital's Nightingale hospital has reopened and was admitting patients to help with the coronavirus spread. \nHe told reporters it was taking non-Covid patients to help free up beds in London's hospitals.\nDr Diwakar warned that if levels of hospitalisation in the capital continued to rise then more patients would need to be transferred out of London, adding that the NHS across the country was under pressure.\nIn Birmingham, 200 doctors are being redeployed to one of the country's largest intensive care units as it nears capacity.\nThe University Hospitals Birmingham Trust said there were 873 patients with Covid-19 in their hospitals, with 125 in intensive care.\nEarlier, crime and policing minister Kit Malthouse said people have a \"duty\" to make this lockdown \"the last one\".\n\"We are urging the small minority of people who aren't taking this seriously to do so now, and [we say] to them that, if they don't, they are much more likely to get fined by the police,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\nDame Cressida told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move towards greater enforcement was \"common sense\" rather than a show of \"dictatorial policing\".\nFines start at \u00a3200 in England and Northern Ireland, and \u00a360 in Wales and Scotland. Large parties can be shut down by the police, with fines of up to \u00a310,000.\nEngland is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home.\nSimilar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - all of which are in charge of deciding and enforcing their own coronavirus restrictions.\nIn other developments: "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic,Nurseries",
      "text": "England is currently under a third national lockdown, in an attempt to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed by coronavirus cases.\nBut there has been speculation that ministers could be considering tightening restrictions, amid concerns the \"stay-at-home\" message isn't being followed by enough people. \nAt Monday evening's Downing Street briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged people to follow the existing rules but added, \"we won't rule out taking further action if it's needed\". Other ministers have struck a similar tone.\nBut what is the case for more changes? \nIn March, nurseries closed to all but vulnerable children and those whose parents were key workers.\nBut so far this lockdown, early-years provision has remained open in England.\nScotland and Northern Ireland have chosen to keep nurseries closed to most children for now.\nBut England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said keeping them open \"would allow people who need to go to work, or need to do particular activities, to do so\". \nYounger children carry a lower risk of transmission than adolescents, scientists say.\nBut according to Public Health England, 10% of coronavirus outbreaks or clusters in educational settings since September have been in early-years provision.\nEngland's three main nursery organisations have called on the government to provide clear scientific evidence on the risks to early-years staff now there is a more transmissible variant of Covid-19.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he too would like to hear more from scientists about the risks - and nurseries should \"probably\" close. \nGoing out to exercise once a day is one of the \"reasonable excuses\" for leaving home during lockdown.\nPeople can walk, run, cycle or swim with those they live - or are in a support bubble - with. \nIn addition, they can exercise, on their own, with one person, each time, from another household - as long as they stay 2m (6ft) apart. \nHowever, Mr Hancock said, \"we've been seeing large groups and that is not acceptable\" and warned that, \"if too many people keep breaking this rule, then we are going to have to look at it\".\nThe rules say exercise should be \"local\" - in the village, town, or part of the city where you live - but do not currently specify how far people can travel.\nDerbyshire Police recently fined two women \u00a3200 each for driving five miles to meet for a walk, saying driving for exercise was \"not in the spirit\" of lockdown. They were told the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed, either, as they were \"classed as a picnic\".\nThe penalties have now been withdrawn. \nProf Whitty, meanwhile, has urged people to \"double down\", avoid unnecessary contact and stick to the rules. \nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live about coffee shops remaining open for takeaways, he advised against meeting up there. \n\"Really, please don't,\" he said.\nFace coverings must be worn in almost all public indoor settings - including shops -  unless people are exempt.\nPremises \"should take reasonable steps to promote compliance with the law\", government guidance says.\nLast summer, when customer face coverings became law, many supermarkets said they would not make their staff responsible for enforcing the rules. \nHowever, Morrisons has now updated its policy to bar shoppers who refuse to cover their faces, unless they are medically exempt. Sainsbury's says security guards at its stores will challenge customers who do not comply.\nTesco, Asda and Waitrose have followed suit and say they too will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks unless they have an exemption.\nThere have been suggestions face coverings should be required in outdoor public places. \nHowever, Sage has previously suggested it would have a \"very low impact\" on community transmission\nProf Whitty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the risk posed by joggers, for example, was \"very low\" - but there \"might be some logic\" to people wearing masks in a busy outdoor queue or crowded around a market stall.\nOne change the government has ruled out is to support bubbles - which allow people living alone and single, or new parents to mix with another household of any size, without having to socially distance. \nAt the government briefing, Mr Hancock said: \"I can rule out removing the bubbles.\"\nThe official guidance says it's best if a support bubble is formed with a household who live locally. \nBut there is currently no limit to how far people can travel to visit their bubble, meaning they could go from areas with high infection rates to those with lower ones, potentially spreading the virus.\nWhen \"bubbling\" was first suggested, in May, Sage rejected it as too dangerous, because the reproduction (R) number  - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - was close to one. \nCurrently, the R number in England is between 1.1 and 1.4. Sage says stopping all indoor contact between different households could lower this by as much as 0.2.\n\"Active contract tracing should be a precondition of introducing bubbling\", Sage added. \nUnlike in March, places of worship are allowed to open in England, although they are closed in Scotland.\nThey provide spiritual leadership for many and bring communities together - but their \"communal nature\" also makes them \"vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus\", the government guidance for England says.\nWhen the latest lockdown was announced, the Archbishop of Canterbury tweeted: \"The government hasn't suspended public worship - but some may feel it better not to attend in person and some parishes are expected to offer online services only for now.\" \nSage has previously suggested places of worship pose a high risk to vulnerable groups but closing them would have a low to moderate impact on overall coronavirus transmission."

      "text": "The FBI has warned of possible armed protests across the US as Trump supporters and far-right groups call for demonstrations before Joe Biden is sworn in as president.\nThere are reports of armed groups planning to gather at all 50 state capitols and in Washington DC in the run-up to his 20 January inauguration.\nSecurity will be tight for the event after a pro-Trump mob stormed Congress.\nHouse Democrats say a vote to impeach the president will happen on Wednesday.\nThey accuse President Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" and say the vote will be held unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office. There is no sign Mr Pence is prepared to do so. \nMr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris are expected to be sworn in at a ceremony at the Capitol. The Biden team had already urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital because of the Covid-19 pandemic, a call that is now being repeated by local authorities.\nSecurity officials have said there will be no repeat of the breach seen on 6 January, when thousands of pro-Trump supporters were able to break into the building where members of Congress were voting to certify the election result.\nFive people died in the riot, which happened after Mr Trump repeated unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the November vote and encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol. \nSince then, calls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans. Mr Trump has made no public statements since he was banned from several social media platforms - including Twitter - on Friday.\nHe became the third US president to be impeached in December 2019 over charges of breaking the law by asking Ukraine to investigate his rival in the presidential election. The Senate cleared him.\nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protests on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.   \nAn internal FBI bulletin, reported by ABC News and other outlets, carries a warning that one group is calling for the \"storming\" of state, local and federal courthouses around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not. \nAlthough the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were also reported elsewhere in the country. Local police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses, according to US media. \nFBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration.\nCompanies and social media networks are cracking down against users and websites seen to be encouraging violence, including social network Parler, which said it was suing Amazon for removing it from its web hosting service. \nTwitter said it had suspended more than 70,000 accounts that promoted the Q-Anon conspiracy theory while Facebook said it was banning any content that refers to Stop the Steal, a slogan associated with Mr Trump's claim the election was rigged.\nIn other developments:\nOn Monday President Trump declared a state of emergency for Washington DC until 24 January, which enables the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to act to \"avert the threat of a catastrophe\".\nChad Wolf, acting head of the DHS, said he had instructed the US Secret Service to begin operations for the inauguration on Wednesday - six days early - \"in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape\". \nLater on Monday, Mr Wolf became the third Trump cabinet secretary to step down since the riots, after Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao. He said his departure had been prompted by \"recent events\", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment.\nMore than 10,000 National Guard troops will be in the capital by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested, Chief of the National Guard Bureau General Daniel Hokanson said. For Mr Trump's inauguration in 2017, about 8,000 National Guard troops were deployed.\nMeanwhile, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called for more security after what she described as an \"unprecedented terrorist attack\" at the US Capitol last week.\nThe National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid \"credible threats\" of violence, adding it could also temporarily close areas of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \nSpeaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was \"not afraid\" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears.\nAfter being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity. \nDonald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years to refuse to do so.

He was later arrested by local police and the FBI for his role in the riots. \nFootage shows Mr Jensen leading the mob that chased Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts \"second floor!\" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber. \nAfter Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves Mr Jensen - a move seemingly designed to draw attention on to himself, luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside. \nThe image of Mr Goodman trailed by a mob - some armed with Confederate flags, others with allusions to the Nazi flag - was  extremely disturbing, Mr Burkhalter said. \n\"Police officer, not a police officer, to see a black man being chased by someone carrying a Confederate flag - there is something wrong with that picture. That should never happen again,\" he said. \n\"It just reeks of everything we need to correct.\"  \nMr Goodman's standoff with the mob came just minutes before authorities were able to seal the chamber, according to reporting from the Washington Post.\nHis heroics were noted at the highest level - he was invited to the inauguration as a guest of Vice-President Kamala Harris.\nReporting by Holly Honderich"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Mold,Retailing,Supermarkets,Coronavirus pandemic,Vaughan Gething",
      "text": "Supermarket workers are facing abuse for challenging shoppers not wearing masks during the pandemic, staff say.\nOne Mold supermarket worker said she was challenging people every day and seeing \"loads of people walking around\" the store without masks and in groups.\nThe Welsh Government has hinted rules will be tightened amid concerns Covid-19 rules are not being followed.\n\"This is not a social event, come in on your own, not as a family of five,\" the supermarket worker said.\nSupermarket workers spoke to BBC Radio Wales as Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the \"onus\" was on supermarkets to make sure shoppers abided by the rules.\nThere has been an \"escalation of abuse\" towards supermarket staff in the last nine months, and the role of policing such rules must not fall on those on the shop floor, Nick Ireland Divisional Officer of the Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) said.\nHe said measures in stores had \"rolled back\", with many no longer enforcing systems, and people walking the wrong way down one-way systems, and \"whole families\" shopping with just one basket.\nMeanwhile Bally Auluk, an area organiser in Cardiff and Barry for Usdaw, said abuse towards shopworkers was happening on \"a daily and weekly basis\".\nHe said retailers and the Welsh Government should \"start protecting shop workers\" after dealing with members himself who were \"threatened with physical violence and spat on\".\n\"Customers now are treating it almost like it was last year, that it's not a problem, that is where the big issues arises,\" he said.\nMorrisons and Sainsbury's had pledged to challenge shoppers not wearing face coverings in store, unless they have a medical exemption.\nTesco, Asda and Waitrose are the latest supermarkets to follow the move and challenge those who flout the rules.\nUnder coronavirus rules, people must wear face coverings in order to enter shops across the UK, while supermarkets should have social distancing and strict hygiene measures in place.\nThe Welsh Government has been in talks with retailers on how to improve safety and return to the strict observance of social distancing from the first lockdown, although no new guidance has been issued. \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said he had heard concerns from people \"expressing anxiety\" about a lack of \"visible protections\" in supermarkets, such as limited numbers allowed in store, hand sanitiser and security on doors.\nThe Mold supermarket worker said staff had been told not to challenge people not wearing masks, and had seen people being yelled at.\nJane, who did not give her last name, told BBC Wales customers were offered a mask on the way in, but many did not want them.\n\"You do see a lot of customers walking around without a mask on,\" she said.\n\"Of course there are people with hidden disabilities who can't wear a mask but there can't be that many of them.\"\nJane said enforcement needed to be greater, but it should not be led by the shopfloor staff.\"We're told not to challenge people as we don't know someone's personal situation and we don't want to face any abuse if they don't want to wear it or don't agree with it,\" she said.\n\"At the moment people will ask politely, but I have witnessed quite a few occasions where customers have been verbally abusive to the person greeting them on their way in. \n\"There needs to be someone enforcing this, it can't be left to retail staff: whether its a police officer or a security guard.\"\nOne security guard at a supermarket in Aberdare said he had had more \"hassle\" working in the past 10 months at the store, than from drinkers while working as a nightclub doorman for more than 20 years.\n\"The attitude towards yourself... they don't appreciate that you're standing there for 12 hours a day, they don't understand how hard it is to try and keep people distancing,\" he told Dot Davies on BBC Radio Wales.\n\"When they go inside the shop it all goes out the window... we keep the two metres outside, but we've got people coming outside to tell us we should be in there sorting it out.\"\nOne supermarket manager said the lengths people were going to in order to shop together were \"ridiculous\", with families coming in with a number of trolleys or baskets in order not to be challenged.\n\"We've seen families turning up to go shopping for a basket shop, it's just not on,\" said Mr Ireland, who called on supermarket staff to be prioritised for vaccines.\nHe suggested those who do not observe the rules should be banned and fined.\nBut one mother said that she had no choice but to shop with her children, and she had been unable to get a click and collect or delivery slot.\n\"It's easy to get caught up in the fear of it, but some people are at the shops as they have no choice,\" she said. \nOthers have spoken of shop staff themselves not wearing masks.\nJames Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said it was \"everyone's responsibility\" to abide by the rules, rather than for shop workers to enforce.\n\"Doing that [enforcement of rules] in a small store, where you don't have lots of colleagues around, has been a trigger for more abuse and even violence,\" he said.\nMr Lowman said making businesses Covid secure was down to the local authority, while individuals' behaviour was a matter for police, but \"in practicality\" it is everyone's responsibility.\nBut Mr Gething said the \"onus\" for getting shoppers to follow Covid-19 rules, such as wearing masks, social-distancing and cordoning off non-essential items, was on the supermarket managers.\n\"[It needs to be made] clear that you do need to wear a mask unless you can demonstrate that you have a particular exemption,\" he said.\n\"I don't think there's any lack of understanding. We've been through this before and I do think a number of supermarkets are going to go and make clear there are a range of items that are off-limits for shoppers coming in.\n\"Supermarkets understand what they need to do.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment. So, a second penalty would be \u00a3400, a third \u00a3800, up to a maximum of \u00a36,400. \nIn Wales, the penalty for a first offence is \u00a360, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of \u00a31,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work."

      "text": "Long-lived banned industrial chemicals may be threatening the fertility of male porpoises living off the UK.\nPolychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs) were phased out decades ago, but can build up in whales, dolphins and porpoises.\nScientists say harbour porpoises exposed to PCBs had shrunken testicles, suggesting an effect on sperm count and fertility.\nThey say that while these are preliminary findings, more must be done to clean up the oceans.\nPCBs have been linked with a number of threats to whales and dolphins, but research has focused on mothers and their young.\nA study led by scientists at the Institute of Zoology at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) found high levels of PCBs were linked to smaller testicles in otherwise healthy animals.\nThey think this could have an impact on sperm count, with obvious implications for reproductive success.\n\"In porpoises, reduced testes weights have been associated with lower sperm counts so we think that if PCBs are reducing testes weights they may also be reducing sperm counts but we hope to do further research to confirm this,\" said lead researcher Rosie Williams of ZSL. \nPopulations of harbour porpoises around the UK are believed to be stable, though the animals face threats from pollution, accidental fishing and infection. The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals.\nPCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment.\nA series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity.\nThe chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea.\nPCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises.\nOne killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded.\nAlthough levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely.\nPCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life. \nA recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a \"cocktail of pollutants\", which are passed down from mother to calf.\nScientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain.\nIn humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality.\nStrandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast.\nThe deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections.\nIn the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades.\nThe study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility.\n\"Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,\" said Rosie Williams.\nPopulations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility.\n\"This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,\" she said.\n\"That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals.\"\nThere are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber.\nThe study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

      "text": "There have now been more than 5,100 deaths in Wales involving Covid-19 since the pandemic began. \nThe latest weekly figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show 310 deaths in the week ending 1 January, which is 32 more than the week before.  \nThis is nearly 42.6% of all deaths.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg saw the highest numbers of weekly deaths in Wales, the most since the end of April at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic.\nThere were 76 deaths in the area - including 66 in hospitals and six in care homes.  \nLooking at council areas, Rhondda Cynon Taf had the second highest number of hospital deaths across England and Wales, with 34. The London borough of Newham had 35.\nThe ONS again urged caution when interpreting this week's figures, due to the Christmas and new year holidays, which will affect the number of registrations.\nThe total number of Covid deaths in Wales, up to and registered by 1 January, was 4,963.\nBut when deaths registered over the following few days are included, there was a total of 5,169.\nThe Aneurin Bevan health board, with 68 deaths registered involving Covid, also had its highest number in a single week since the end of April. \nHywel Dda health board reported 37 deaths - its highest weekly figure since the pandemic began. Of these, 18 were patients in hospital from Carmarthenshire and 10 were hospital patients from Pembrokeshire.\nSwansea Bay health board had 61 deaths in this week. The Swansea council area itself had the seventh highest number of hospital deaths across England and Wales.\nThere were 36 deaths in Cardiff and Vale, 25 deaths in Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales - 10 of which were hospital deaths in Wrexham - and seven in Powys.\nAll counties recorded at least one death involving Covid-19.\nRhondda Cynon Taf, with 685 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales up to the latest week, followed by Cardiff with 578. \nWhen looking at crude death rates - based on the number of deaths compared to local populations - Wales has three of the five worst across England and Wales.\nRhondda Cynon Taf has 283 deaths per 100,000 in total so far in the pandemic. \nMerthyr Tydfil is second with 253.6 and Blaenau Gwent is ranked fourth.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing.\nIn Wales, the number of deaths fell from 825 to 727 in the latest week, but this was still 209 deaths (40.3%) higher than the five-year average for that week. This is the second highest proportion after London.\nThe ONS figures report where doctors mention Covid-19 on death certificates, including confirmed and suspected cases.\nThey include deaths occurring in all places, not only hospitals and care homes but also people's own homes.\nIt has been estimated that Covid is the underlying cause in around 90% of these deaths and not just a contributory factor."

      "text": "Royal Mail has published a list of areas where there have been delivery delays due to its workforce being affected by the Covid pandemic.\nThe postal service said some areas will see a reduced service due to workers being off sick or self-isolating.\nRoyal Mail listed 28 areas where post might be late, with 27 in England and one in Northern Ireland.\nProblems with deliveries over Christmas had prompted shoppers to complain about parcels not arriving on time.\nRoyal Mail said: \"Despite our best efforts and significant investment in extra resource, some customers may experience slightly longer delivery timescales than our usual service standards. \n\"This is due to the exceptionally high volumes we are seeing, exacerbated by the coronavirus-related measures we have put in place in local mail centres and delivery offices to keep our people and customers safe.\"\nMany of the affected areas are in or near London, while others include Chelmsford in Essex, Leeds in West Yorkshire, Margate in Kent, and Widnes in Cheshire. \nLabour MP Wes Streeting, whose Ilford constituency is one of the areas affected, tweeted on Sunday that he was concerned about vaccination invitations getting caught up in Royal Mail delays.\nBut Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi replied that the government would work with Royal Mail to ensure that vaccine invitations were prioritised.\nCustomers have taken to Twitter to complain about delays to their postal service.\n\"Unfortunately I live in one of these areas.,\" wrote Matt S. \"N8 has been receiving an absolutely dreadful service since April 2020 - @RoyalMail what are you going to do to improve the situation?\"\nMark Harrison wrote: \"We could manage and expect a bit of disruption - but we've had only 2 deliveries in a month.

      "tags": "Marcus Rashford,Free school meals,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A mother who posted a photo on social media of a food parcel she received has told of the \"sense of sadness\" she felt on seeing what it contained.\nThe mother, who wants to be anonymous, told the BBC: \"As I unpacked that food parcel... and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and depressing.\"\nChartwells, the firm which supplied the parcel, has apologised.\nThe education secretary said schools will be able to offer vouchers rather than food parcels from next week.\nGavin Williamson told the education select committee on Wednesday that he was \"absolutely disgusted\" by the photo of the food parcel's contents, and that his department had made it clear \"this sort of behaviour is just not right [and] will not be tolerated\".\nHe said the government would \"support any school that needs to take action\" and \"name and shame those that are not delivering against the standards\" set by the Department for Education.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Boris Johnson on online images of the \"disgraceful\" food parcels during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs).\nThe PM insisted the government had \"massively increased the value of what we're providing\" in the form of another  \u00a3170m in the winter grant scheme, \u00a3220m for holiday activities and food programme, as well as the rollout of the national voucher scheme. \nHe expressed his gratitude to the footballer Marcus Rashford - a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals who shared images of some parcels online - for highlighting the issue.\nSpeaking to MPs on the Commons Liaison committee on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Johnson said the free school meals pictured online do not reflect government guidance, adding it was a \"scandal and a disgrace that some companies are trying to get away with the provision that they're offering\".\nThe PM added that it was the decision of the schools on whether or not to have vouchers or food parcels, saying that about 75% opt for vouchers but that some schools wish to continue to support caterers.\nMr Rashford, who has met with Chartwells and spoke to Mr Johnson earlier, called for a \"full major review\" of the free school meal system.\nIn a Twitter thread on Wednesday, Mr Rashford said many vulnerable children had been helped during the pandemic \"thanks to the efforts of individuals, businesses, charities, educators, and government\".\nBut he added: \"It's 2021. Our eyes are open. Now is the time for a full major review of the Free School Meal system.\" \nFood parcels have been sent to pupils in England who would normally be eligible for free school meals while schools are closed during the coronavirus lockdown. \nThe national voucher scheme provides supermarket vouchers through an online portal. The government had previously used this scheme during the first lockdown.\nA row broke out after the mother, using the online name Roadside Mum, posted a photo on Twitter of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items, which she calculated to have cost about \u00a35. The post prompted others to complain about the quality and quantity of the food they had received in similar parcels.\nThe mother, who is disabled, had thought it was supposed to last 10 school days and should have been worth \u00a330.\nShe told BBC Breakfast: \"As I unpacked that food parcel in my living room and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and very depressing. \n\"One of my children came in and saw me laying this out on the floor, and I said I was going to picture it because it didn't look like a lot.\n\"I could see the child's realisation that this is what I've been given to eat for a week and the sense of sadness.\n\"Where has the rest of the food gone? This is meant to be a week's food. Why is it so mean?\"\nChartwells, the company that provided the parcel, said it was actually only intended to last one school week and had cost \u00a310.50 for food, packing and distribution.\nIn a further statement posted on Wednesday, the firm, which is owned by Compass group, said it had \"fully investigated\" its food parcels provision in the last few hours. It apologised for those parcels that did not meet the firm's high standards, and committed to refunding the costs.\nIt added that from Monday, the lunches would be enhanced to reflect the Department for Education's additional allowance of \u00a33.50 per week per child.\nThe company has since said that it will add breakfast free of charge into the food parcels from 25 January, and will continue to do so while schools are closed. It will include bread, butter, yoghurts, juice, milk, oats and fruit, it said. \nMeanwhile, some parents in London said they received a pot of flour and instructions on how to bake eight bread rolls in a food parcel from Pimlico Academy.\n\"It's very humiliating,\" one parent told Politics Home. \"Why would you decide for us? Why not give us the money?\"\nFuture Academies, which runs the school, told the BBC it had asked its caterers to improve the quality of its food parcels.\nImpact Food Group, the suppliers, said the pot contained \"bread mix\" and the only extra ingredient needed was water.\nThe intention was to help parents create \"an interactive cooking experience\" with their children and to help with some food education at home, he said.\nThe academy chain has said its own voucher scheme would start on 18 January.\nRachel Rodgers, a mother of three children aged 14, eight, and five, said she was not \"impressed\" with the amount of food provided in a parcel for her youngest child.\nRachel, from Essex, says: \"I got so much more with the vouchers. I always looked for meat and vegetables on offer at the supermarket, so I made the vouchers stretch even more.\n\"What am I supposed to do with one potato?\"\nRachel, who receives food parcels for her two youngest children and a voucher for her eldest, says it would have been \"nice to get a little more\" food, adding that \"even sandwich meat would have been good\".\nOne mother of three says she was \"disappointed\" by the contents of food parcels.\nThe mum, who does not want to be identified, says the food box she received for two of her children at secondary school contained sliced frozen bread \"[which] did not stay fresh\"; two slices of cheese that [were] \"hard and taste disgusting\", as well as beans, tinned tomatoes, apples, pasta and potatoes.\nShe says her youngest child, who is in primary school, received a parcel of five rolls \"that were going stale\", grated cheese, three packs of crackers, five yoghurts and packs of biscuits.\nThe mother adds: \"It is a good job I already had some cheese and bacon in the fridge, because this is disheartening.\n\"We have never had support feeding our children through the holidays even when I was young. We need help now.\"\nThe initial social media images of food parcels drew widespread criticism. \nBecca Lyon, head of child poverty campaigns at Save the Children, said the charity welcomed the return of the voucher scheme - adding that the problems some families had with the vouchers last year should not be repeated.\nAnne Longfield, the children's commissioner, called on companies to provide \"real food and real amounts that will really help families\".\nMeanwhile, Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the contents of the food parcels were \"not nutritionally sufficient for children and young people\".\nSource: Department for Education\nIn Wales, the provision of free school meals during the holidays has been extended by a year, and the Northern Ireland Executive made a pledge in November to provide free school meals in holidays until Easter 2022.\nIn Scotland - where holiday provision is currently promised up to Easter 2021 - both the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives have pledged to fund free school meals for all primary school pupils during term-time and holidays if they win the 2021 Scottish election."

      "text": "Top NFL coach Bill Belichick says he will not accept President Donald Trump's offer of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, citing the US Capitol riot.\nBelichick, of the New England Patriots, said he was flattered when he was first offered the medal - the top award given to civilians in the US.\nBut he said he changed his mind after a mob of Trump supporters stormed Congress last week. Five people died.\nThe celebrated coach had previously spoken of his friendship with Mr Trump.\n\"Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honour represents and admiration for prior recipients,\" Belichick said in a statement. \n\"Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award.\" \nBelichick, who has won a record six Super Bowl titles, is considered one of the most successful coaches in NFL history.\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom recognises individuals who have made outstanding contributions to \"the security or national interests of America\".\nIn 2019 Mr Trump gave the award to golfer Tiger Woods, as well as radio personality Rush Limbaugh and posthumously Elvis Presley.\nDonald Trump may only have recently made a career of politics, but he's always loved sport.\nHe owns 17 golf courses and once bought and ran the New Jersey Generals of the US Football League.\nJust last week, he awarded three presidential medals of freedom to professional golfers. This week he was planning to honour the most successful professional football coach in modern times, Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots.\nThe president seems to particularly enjoy the company of sport figures and revel in their achievements and prowess.\nSo for Belichick, a personal friend of the president's, to decline the award is a stinging rebuke.\nThe coach's decision reflects the depth of the political crisis president has created in the past week. It also highlights the troubled relationship Trump has had with the National Football League and its players, who he has disparaged for Black Lives Matter protests during the US national anthem.\nBelichick, a sometimes bristling, controversial figure with more than a few detractors, is used to public animosity. A coach can't win without the commitment of his players, however, and Belichick clearly believed his relationship with his team would be jeopardised by associating himself with Trump at this point."

      "tags": "NHS Wales,Intensive care,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Around half of patients admitted to Welsh intensive care units during the second wave of the pandemic have died, a study has found.\nThe Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) found men aged in their 60s were more likely to need intensive care.\nIt also found those from Asian backgrounds and deprived areas were disproportionately affected.\nBut a leading doctor said, overall, people were more likely to survive now.\nIntensive care consultant Matt Morgan said new treatments meant only the sickest patients were reaching intensive care, where outcomes were poorer.\nICNARC collected information on 431 Welsh patients who were critically ill with coronavirus from 1 September to 31 December 2020 as part of a UK-wide audit of intensive care patients.\nOf the patients who were admitted, 68% were men and 32% women. The average age of a patient was 59.5 years.\nWhile the vast majority of patients were white (91.6%), the number of patients of Asian ethnicity was more than double the proportion of the Asian population, with 6.3% of patients recorded as being Asian, compared to an average of 2.4% in their local population.\nThe audit of patients found that, excluding those still being treated at the unit, half had died while half had been discharged.\nAlthough the numbers of patients surveyed is relatively low for statistical purposes, Dr Morgan said the survival rate reflected the situation in hospitals.\n\"We are putting fewer people, who are in the first stage of their illness, on to life support machines. And that is because we have treatments now that we know can help,\" he said.\n\"Overall, you are more likely now to survive Covid than ever before, and that is in every age group - sometimes by as much as 10% more.\n\"What we do know is that overall, out of every ten people who come to intensive care with Covid about six of them will survive and will leave the intensive care unit. Which means sadly four of them won't, four of them will die.\n\"That's similar overall to the first wave but that data is based on some patients who are still in the intensive care unit. So that may change and it's more likely to get worse rather than better.\"\n\"We also know patients who are on life support machines in the intensive care unit will do worse than those who come to the intensive care unit and are not on life support machines. \n\"For those people, it's probably five out of 10 people who will survive and five who will sadly die and that may be worse when we have the data on those who are still there.\n\"And there's a big effect of age. So for those over the age of 70 it may be as little as four people out of 10 who survive, maybe less. And for those over the age of 80 it may be as low as one or two people out of ten who survive. \nThe figures from ICNARC also highlight how people from poorer backgrounds were more likely to need treatment in intensive care.\nUsing a deprivation score from 1 to 5, more than half of patients scored 4 or 5, representing the most deprived postcodes in Wales.\nDr Morgan said: \"Sadly, disease is an illness of deprivation.\n\"And so that's why we feel it, particularly in Wales where the industrial scars of our past are still very much there - and our health is there.\""

      "title": "Covid: What next for restrictions as hospital cases rise?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What is the next move? \nThe disease is still spreading. There are more people in hospital with Covid-19 in the UK than at any other point in the pandemic. \nProf Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, hit the airwaves on Monday morning to tell us it's \"everyone's problem\".\nAnd a possible further increase in the numbers from those get-togethers that did take place over Christmas is yet to filter through. \nIt is cheering, and crucial, to see the elderly and vulnerable attending vaccine super-centres in huge numbers for their injections. \nBut there is no getting away from it: at this moment, the coronavirus situation seems pretty dire. And there is real concern in government that the public, this time round, is just not paying attention to the rules as closely as they did back in the spring. \nWhat is the government's answer? It is not, at least not yet, despite calls from the opposition, another big clampdown. \nIt might not feel like it, but it is only seven days since Boris Johnson took what used to be the rare step of making a national address, live on primetime TV, telling us, across the UK, once more to \"stay at home\".\nThere is hardly any political appetite to go even further. \nAs one senior minister said today: \"We have gone as far as we possibly can in terms of shutting things down\".  \nThe prime minister was reluctant to go this far, only moving back to a lockdown in England when the evidence put forward by the government's top medics got worse, and worse and worse. \nThere are in fact even more limits that ministers, not just in Westminster but in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast too, could introduce. \nSchools could be forcibly closed to all pupils. Nurseries could shut. \nGovernment sources say the nurseries policy isn't going to change. Number 10 firmly denies they would ever take such a drastic step on schools which have always been open to key workers' children and it is hard to imagine that ever happening. \nIn extremis though there are measures that could be taken - in theory the government does not want to do any of this, but in practice there are other potential steps. \nBuilding sites could be made to lock their gates. Factories where machines are still whirring because they are operating under Covid guidelines could be made to pause. \nEngland, Scotland and Northern Ireland could follow Wales and ban people from seeing anyone they don't live with even outdoors. \nPlaygrounds, launderettes and chiropractors, could, along with many others on the list of premises allowed to stay open, have to shut up shop after all. \nBut while ministers have talked about squeezing the advice for takeaways to try to prevent big queues gathering at popular places, encouraged the supermarkets to make sure they are doing as much as they can to be safe, and even discussed the prospect of asking for masks to be worn outdoors, there is no expectation, at least at the start of this week, that a more extensive clampdown is coming from Westminster. \nAlthough, it's worth noting that the Scottish cabinet will discuss restrictions again on Tuesday. \nOne reason for the reluctance to go much further is that every step that affects a business affects jobs and livelihoods too. \nThe chancellor told MPs on Monday that 800,000 people have lost their jobs since February, admitting the economy will get worse before it gets better. \nSo trying to preserve activity that can be done safely matters to the government too. \nThere's also a question in government circles about whether cranking up different rules bit by bit is really what would help. \nChris Whitty this morning bluntly suggested there was limited value in \"tinkering\" with the rules, and what is required instead is for all of us to realise how grave the situation really is. \nInstead of worrying about whether we are allowed to sit on a park bench at all, (and yes, this has been a lively conversation in Westminster today) , perhaps we should be asking ourselves whether we really need to be out at all. \nBut when what happens next will be in large part shaped by our behaviour as individuals, working out the dos and don'ts can get sticky fast. \nTwo women who hit the headlines for driving five miles to go for a snowy walk with a takeaway cuppa had their fines withdrawn today, just as the prime minister caused a stir when a newspaper revealed he'd gone seven miles to the other side of London for a cycle in the Olympic Park. \nYou might be a reader who feels, 'so what?'. In both cases they were exercising outside, within the law, so who cares? \nBut you might feel when the firm instruction is to stay at home, and stay local, that is pushing the rules. \n(For what it's worth, the government's guidance is to \"stay local\" for exercise. There is no mileage limit, but the definition in the official advice says people should \"stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live\". And there aren't many inhabitants of SW1 who would see Stratford in East London as local to them, or East Enders who would see Downing Street as round the corner.) \nFor now though, with grimmer and grimmer medics' warnings ringing in our ears, and reminders about enforcement from the police coming too, ministers seem resolved to encourage the public to comply rather than crack down further. \nBut it is however, only a week since the lockdown the prime minister had so hoped to avoid returned. By now, it's not surprising, Boris Johnson would never quite rule anything out. \nP.S. In all the gloom, the cheerier news is that the vaccination programme across the UK is certainly getting going, with 2.3 million people having had their first jab. \nThe number of people getting vaccinated has been added to the list of statistics that the government publishes every day. The targets the government has set are tough, but the numbers so far, are growing fast. "

Everyone needs to exercise their own judgement\", she added.\nThe Evening Standard reported that the prime minister had been seen in the Olympic Park, with his security detail, on Sunday.\nThere's nothing in English lockdown law that says Boris Johnson shouldn't have pedalled around London's Olympic park on Sunday, seven miles from Downing Street.\nBut this comes at a time when the government is desperately pleading with people to take Covid-19 seriously and follow the rules.\nIn England that means leaving home only for essential work, shopping and exercise. The guidance also says \"stay local\" without defining how far people can roam.\nTravel for exercise is allowed \"a short distance within your area\" to access an open space.\nNumber 10 will insist that's precisely what Mr Johnson did.\nBut his ride highlights the problem everyone faces trying to interpret rules, and relying on people using common sense.\nThe outing certainly doesn't help ministers straining to tell the public - in clear, consistent, easy-to-understand terms - to stay at home.\nAndy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, west London, criticised the prime minister for having a \"do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do\" attitude.\nSpeaking to Today, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said: \"What we are asking people to do is when they exercise to stay local.\n\"Now local is, obviously, open to interpretation, but people broadly know what local means.\n\"If you can get there under your own steam and you are not interacting with somebody... then that seems perfectly reasonable to me.\"\nThe PM's official spokesman added: \"We have always trusted the public to exercise good judgement. We did throughout the first lockdown and continue to do so.\"\nThe issue of travelling for exercise was highlighted at the weekend after police in Derbyshire fined two women \u00a3200 after they drove five miles from home to take a walk - a penalty that was later dropped.\nGovernment advice for England says people can leave home to exercise, but adds: \"This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area.\"\nThe guidance adds: \"Stay local means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live.\"\nThe government also states: \"The law is what you must do; the guidance might be a mixture of what you must do and what you should do.\"\nIn Scotland, the advice is that exercise can be taken if it \"starts and finishes at the same place, which can be up to five miles from the boundary of your local authority area\".\nIn Wales, exercise also has to start from and finish at home. There no limits on distance travelled, although the advice is that \"the nearer you stay to your home, the better\".\nPeople in Northern Ireland are advised not to go more than 10 miles from home when exercising."

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,Roman Catholic Church",
      "text": "The Irish government is to apologise after an investigation found an \"appalling level of infant mortality\" in the country's mother-and-baby homes.\nEstablished in the 19th and 20th Centuries, the institutions housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage.\nAbout 9,000 children died in the 18 institutions under investigation.\nThe government said the report revealed the country had a \"stifling, oppressive and brutally misogynistic culture\".\nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) M\u00edche\u00e1l Martin said the report, which can be read in full here, described a \"dark, difficult and shameful chapter\" of Irish history.\n\"As a nation we must face up to the full truth of our past,\" he said.\nThe commission that investigated the homes found that the number of children who died was about 15% of all those who were born in the institutions.\nThere were about 56,000 unmarried mothers and 57,000 children in the homes investigated by the commission.\nThe greatest number of admissions was in the 1960s and early 1970s.\nMany children born in the homes were adopted or taken to orphanages run by Catholic nuns.\nThe report said \"the women and children should not have been in the institutions\" and that many women suffered emotional abuse.\nThe investigators said it appeared there was \"little kindness\" shown to the mothers and \"this was particularly the case\" during childbirth, which many of the women found to be \"a traumatic experience\".\nMr Martin is to issue a full apology on behalf of the state in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) on Wednesday.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, he said \"one hard truth\" was that \"all of society was complicit\" in the scandal.\n\"We did this to ourselves as a society - we treated women exceptionally badly; we treated children extremely badly,\" said the taoiseach.\n\"We had a completely warped attitude to sexuality and intimacy and young mothers and their sons and daughters were forced to pay a terrible price for that dysfunction.\n\"As a society we embraced judgementalism, moral certainty, a perverse religious morality and control which was so damaging.\n\"But what was very striking was the absence of basic kindness.\"\nThe leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, said he accepted that the Church was part of a culture in which \"people were frequently stigmatised, judged and rejected\".\n\"For that, and for the long-lasting hurt and emotional distress that has resulted, I unreservedly apologise to the survivors and to all those who are personally impacted by the realities it uncovers,\" he said.\n\"I believe the Church must continue to acknowledge before the Lord and before others, its part in sustaining what the report describes as a 'harsh\u2026 cold and uncaring atmosphere'.\" \nThe Church needed to find ways of reaching out to those who have spoken of their experiences in the report, he said.\nArchbishop Martin urged anyone who could help locate the burial places of those who died in the mother and baby homes to come forward.\nChildren's Minister Roderic O'Gorman said the report showed that for decades a \"pervasive stigmatisation of unmarried mothers and their children robbed those individuals of their agency and sometimes their future\".\nThe commission has made 53 recommendations, including compensation and memorialisation.\nIts report stated that while mother-and-baby homes existed in other countries the proportion of unmarried mothers who were in the institutions in Ireland was probably the highest in the world.\n\"In the years before 1960 mother-and-baby homes did not save the lives of 'illegitimate' children; in fact they appear to have significantly reduced their prospects of survival,\" stated the report.\n\"The very high mortality rates were known to local and national authorities at the time and were recorded in official publications.\"\nThe Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, which ran some of the homes, said it was a \"matter of great sorrow to us that babies died while under our care\".\n\"We especially want to recognise and accept today that so many women who were shunned and shamed by society did not find the support and level of care they needed and deserved at such a dreadful and painful time in their lives,\" said the group.\n\"We want to sincerely apologise to those who did not get the care and support they needed and deserved.\"\nThe homes became an international news story in 2014 after a substantial amount of human remains was found in the grounds of a former home in Tuam, County Galway.\nLocal historian Catherine Corless found that 796 children had been buried there.\nIn response, the Irish government established an independent Mother-and-Baby Homes Commission.\nIn an interim report, the commission found that some babies were buried in 20 chambers inside what was a larger decommissioned sewage tank.\nSpeaking after the publication of the final report, Ms Corless was critical of how the government had presented it to the survivors of the homes.\nThe taoiseach had spoken to them in an online briefing on Tuesday before the report was made public.\n\"It was highfalutin talk... a lot of waffle, you could say,\" she said.\n\"A lot of the survivors are very, very upset, they feel they're just being thrown redress - pay them off and just forget about everything.\"\nAnnette McKay's mother was sent to the home in Tuam when she was 17 and believes her older sister could be one those buried there.\nShe has always hoped her sister's remains could be exhumed and identified, however while the report talks about a process of \"respectful reburial\", it will not begin until 2022.\nShe told PA: \"I'm very sad. I was never optimistic. I was always full energy, that a fight could be won, and now I don't feel that. I feel defeated.\"\n\"It's very, very hard today to look at a picture of my mother and think 'another year mum, and we're no further on'. It's been a tough day.\"\nThe commission said it found \"very little evidence that children were forcibly taken from their mothers\".\nIt continued: \"It accepts that the mothers did not have much choice but that is not the same as 'forced' adoption'.\"\nThe report contains witness testimony from women who said they had not consented to their child being adopted.\nNiall Boylan, who was born in the St Patrick's home on the Navan road in Dublin, has criticised the report's failure to deal with forced adoption. \n\"The report doesn't acknowledge that there was abuse, and they don't acknowledge that there was forced adoption. It's ridiculous.\""

      "text": "The US has placed Cuba back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism, citing the communist country's backing of Venezuela.\nPresident Donald Trump's administration made the announcement just days before he leaves the White House.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on 20 January, has previously said he wants to improve US-Cuban relations.\nCuba called the move \"political opportunism\".\nMr Biden has said he is seeking closer ties between the long-term adversaries but Mr Trump's decision is likely to hinder a quick repair of relations. \nCuba's place on the list will require a formal review that could take months, analysts say.\nThe Caribbean island was removed from the list by President Barack Obama in 2015, but Mr Trump has taken a harder line towards the country.\nWhen explaining the decision, officials cited Cuba's support of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro who the US refuses to recognise.\n\"With this action, we will once again hold Cuba's government accountable and send a clear message: the Castro regime must end its support for international terrorism and subversion of US justice,\" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Monday.\nIn response, Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Bruno Rodriguez tweeted: \"We condemn the cynical and hypocritical qualification of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, announced by the United States.\"\nIn advance of the announcement, House Democrat Gregory Meeks called it \"another stunt by President Trump and Pompeo, trying to tie the hands of the incoming Biden administration on their way out the door.\"\nMr Biden's plans included allowing Cuban-Americans to visit family and send money. \nPresident Obama began to normalise relations with Cuba in 2015. He called the decades-long US efforts to isolate the country \"a failure\".\nSince the Cold War era, the US had pursued various policies to undermine Cuba which it saw as a great threat.\nCuba now rejoins countries including Iran and North Korea on the list of sponsors of terrorism. The impact on the island country include severe limits on foreign investment."

      "tags": "Retailing,Social distancing,Supermarkets,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Morrisons will bar customers who refuse to wear face coverings from its shops amid rising coronavirus infections.\nFrom Monday, shoppers who refuse to wear face masks offered by staff will not be allowed inside, unless they are medically exempt.\nSainsbury's also said it would challenge those not wearing a mask or who were shopping in groups.\nThe announcements come amid concerns that social distancing measures are not being adhered to in supermarkets.\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government is \"concerned\" shops are not enforcing rules strictly enough.\n\"Ultimately, the most important thing to do now is to make sure that actually enforcement - and of course the compliance with the rules - when people are going into supermarkets are being adhered to,\" Mr Zahawi told Sky News.\n\"We need to make sure people actually wear masks and follow the one-way system,\" he said.\nMorrisons said it had \"introduced and consistently maintained thorough and robust safety measures in all our stores\" since the start of the pandemic.\nBut it said: \"From today we are further strengthening our policy on masks.\" \nSecurity guards at the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain will be enforcing the new rules.\nMorrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: \"Those who are offered a face covering and decline to wear one won't be allowed to shop at Morrisons unless they are medically exempt.\n\"Our store colleagues are working hard to feed you and your family, please be kind.\"\nFollowing Morrisons' announcement, Sainsbury's said that it was also putting trained security guards at the front of its stores to challenge shoppers who did not comply.\nChief executive Simon Roberts said: \"I've spent a lot of time in our stores reviewing the latest situation over the last few days and on behalf of all my colleagues, I am asking our customers to help us keep everyone safe. \n\"The vast majority of customers are shopping safely, but I have also seen some customers trying to shop without a mask and shopping in larger family groups. \n\"Please help us to keep all our colleagues and customers safe by always wearing a mask and by shopping alone. Everyone's care and consideration matters now more than ever.\"\nEarlier on Monday, Mr Zahawi stopped short of saying that supermarket staff should be responsible for enforcing rules on face masks.\nEnforcement of face coverings is the responsibility of the police, not retailers. Wearing face masks in supermarkets and shops is compulsory across the UK. \nIn England, the police can issue a \u00a3200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a \u00a360 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines.\nHowever, retail industry body the British Retail Consortium said that, workers have faced an increase in incidents of violence and abuse when trying to encourage shoppers to put them on.\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, added: \"Supermarkets continue to follow all safety guidance and customers should be reassured that supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit during lockdown and beyond. \n\"Customers should play their part too by following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers.\"\nUnder current lockdown restrictions across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people must only leave home for essential reasons, such as buying food or medicine.\nIn a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus, supermarkets introduced social distancing measures during the UK's first nationwide lockdown last March. They included limits on the numbers of customers in the shops at any one time, protective plastic screens at tills and \"marshals\" to ensure shoppers were maintaining a two-metre distance.\nBut amid rising numbers of infections, some have expressed concerns about a \"lack of visible protections\" implemented by supermarkets in recent weeks.\nThe First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturday that he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown as people were worried the strict enforcement of rules did not \"appear to be there this time\".\n\"Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,\" he said.\nSupermarket Waitrose said that it was taking a \"cautious approach\" to the virus, with marshals checking that customers are wearing face coverings on the door, hand sanitiser stations at its entrances and written communications to shoppers reminding them to maintain their distance.\nTesco said it was limiting the number of customers in store and was also reminding customers to wear masks.\n\"We have clear signage explaining this, and we have packs of face coverings available for purchase near the front of our stores for any customers who have forgotten them.\"\nMeanwhile, Asda announced last week that it would extend its marshals' hours to 08:00 to 20:00 and increase how often baskets and trollies are cleaned.\nShop workers' union Usdaw has also called for firms to apply more stringent measures again.\nThe union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said that it had received reports that \"too many customers are not following necessary safety measures like social distancing, wearing a face covering and only shopping for essential items\".\n\"It is going to take some time to roll out the vaccine and we cannot afford to be complacent in the meantime, particularly with a new strain sweeping the nation,\" Mr Lillis said.\nThe trade union also suggested that \"'one-in one-out\" policies and proper queuing systems should be reintroduced in supermarkets. \nIt added that these systems should be managed by trained security staff where necessary.

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,World War Two",
      "text": "The Covid pandemic has caused excess deaths to rise to their highest level in the UK since World War Two.\nThere were close to 697,000 deaths in 2020 - nearly 85,000 more than would be expected based on the average in the previous five years.\nThis represents an increase of 14% - making it the largest rise in excess deaths for more than 75 years.\nWhen the age and size of the population is taken into account, 2020 saw the worst death rates since the 2000s.\nThis measure - known as age-standardised mortality - takes into account population growth and age.\nThe data is only available until November - so the impact of deaths in December have not yet been taken into account - but it shows the death rate at that stage was at its highest in England since 2008.\nThe data on deaths can be confusing. \nOn one hand, excess deaths are at their highest since World War Two, while on the other, death rates, once age and size of population are taken into account, are at their worst level for a little over a decade 'only'.\nHow should that be interpreted? \nExcess deaths are basically a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years.\nClearly, 2020 saw a huge and unexpected rise in deaths because of the pandemic, just as World War Two led to a sudden jump.\nBut in determining how much those jumps affected the chances of dying, a measure known as age-standardised mortality, which takes into account the age and size of the population, is important.\nIt shows the pandemic has undone the progress made in the last decade or so. That is significant - especially given this has happened despite lockdowns and social-distancing measures to stop the spread of the virus.\nBut it also helps put the death toll over the past 12 months in a wider context.\nKing's Fund chief executive Richard Murray said the picture was likely to worsen, given Covid deaths were rising following the surge in infections over recent weeks.\n\"The UK has one of the highest rates of excess deaths in the world, with more excess deaths per million people than most other European countries or the US,\" he said.\n'It will take a public inquiry to determine exactly what went wrong, but mistakes have been made. \n\"In a pandemic, mistakes cost lives. Decisions to enter lockdown have consistently come late, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes or the experiences of other countries. \n\"The promised 'protective ring' around social care in the first wave was slow to materialise and often inadequate, a contributing factor to the excess deaths among care home residents last year.\n'Like many countries, the UK was poorly prepared for this type of pandemic.\"\nMatthew Reed, of the end-of-life care charity Marie Curie said the focus on Covid should not hide the fact there has been a \"silent crisis\" of deaths at home.\nHe said people have died prematurely in 2020 from other causes - with a big jump in deaths at home.\n\"We are concerned many have not had the care they needed,\" he added."

      "text": "The UK economy will \"get worse before it gets better\" as the country battles the pandemic, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned.\nThe chancellor told MPs the new national restrictions were necessary to control the spread of coronavirus. \nHowever, he said they would have a further significant economic impact,\n\"Even with the significant economic support we've provided, over 800,000 people have lost their job since February,\" he said.\n\"Sadly, we have not and will not be able to save every job and every business.\n\"But I am confident that our economic plan is supporting the finances of millions of people and businesses.\"\nThe chancellor said \"the road ahead will be tough\", but maintained that the government was \"taking the difficult but right long-term decisions for our country\".\nHe said that fiscal stimulus provided so far amounted to more than \u00a3280bn, while 1.2 million employers had furloughed almost 10 million employees.\nAt the same time, three million people had benefited from self-employment grants.\nMr Sunak said he would \"bear in mind\" calls to extend business rate relief and provide further support for the hospitality sector at the Budget in March.\nShadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of being \"out of ideas\" and providing \"nothing new\".\nShe said: \"The purpose of an update is to provide us with new information, not to repeat what we already know.\"\nThe chancellor's words reflect the fact that with a widespread lockdown, the first months of 2021 are likely to see a further contraction in the UK economy and probably an official double-dip recession. This reflects the physical shutdown nationwide of hospitality and retail, as well as the effect in the data of school shutdowns too.\nIn addition, consumers and workers are likely to be more cautious as the vaccine starts to be rolled out. So this is a very odd sort of economic tripwire. The challenge in the next weeks and months gets bigger, although not as big as it was last April. But beyond that, there is the hope of something normal.\nThe implication for the chancellor as he prepares a vital early March Budget, however, is further delay to the measures, such as tax rises, to deal with historic levels of pandemic government borrowing.

Some callers reported the incident had shaken properties but no major damage is thought to have occurred.\"\nCommunications with the aircraft were re-established after the Typhoons were launched and it was intercepted before being escorted to Stansted.\nA spokesman for the airport said the \"private jet\" was believed to have been flying from Germany to Birmingham.\nHe confirmed the plane had been brought into land at about 13:40.\nWhen an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, the air in front of the nose of the plane builds up a pressure front because it has \"nowhere to escape\", said Dr Jim Wild of Lancaster University.\nA sonic boom happens when that air \"escapes\", creating a ripple effect which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap. \nThe speed of sound varies. It is about 770mph (1,200km/h) at sea level, but slower at higher altitudes. A plane flying at 30,000ft would reach the speed of sound at about 675mph (1,085km/h), according to NASA's educational website.\nIt can be heard over such a large area because it moves with the plane, rather like the wake of a boat spreading out behind the vessel.\nRAF jets are only given permission to go supersonic over populated areas in emergencies, usually when they are required to intercept another aircraft.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. \nA range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. \nIt is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. \nThe restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. \nVaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are \"the\" exit strategy from the pandemic.\nThe three vaccine frontrunners are those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nPfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design.\nThey inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. \nThese have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. \nThe Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe.\nIt is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.\nAll three are supposed to be given as two doses.\nA single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now been approved for use in the UK.\nTwenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year.\nBecause only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year.\nAnother jab, Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators.\nIt uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. \nThere are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. \nThe Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.\nThe Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised.\nThe vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death.\nIt is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. \nHowever, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid.\nNonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. \nUnderstanding which method produces the best results will be explored in challenge trials where people are deliberately infected with the virus.\nNew versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. \nHowever, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first \"real-world\" data on the new variants.\nBoth showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.\nThe results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target.\nWe may need to change the vaccines we use in the future."

      "text": "Two hundred doctors will be redeployed to one of England's largest intensive care units amid fears it could be \"overwhelmed\".\nA leaked memo warned hospitals in Birmingham were \"in a position of extremis\" as Covid-19 cases rise.\nElective surgeries at the city's main Queen Elizabeth Hospital will stop as staff move to critical care duties.\nA spokesperson said the approach ensured \"the greatest good for the greatest numbers of people\".\nThe trust's decision to redeploy doctors was revealed in a leaked email to the Health Service Journal, which has been verified by the BBC. \nSent by consultant Peter Hewins, it said hospitals in Birmingham risked being \"overwhelmed\" amid a \"period of absolute emergency\".\nThe University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) said there were 873 patients with Covid-19 across its sites, with 125 in intensive care.\nThis was significantly more than in April 2020, it said, as it announced plans to double its intensive care capacity to more than 250 beds.\nTime-critical surgery, including cancer operations, will continue, the trust said, but elective procedures at the Queen Elizabeth will be paused, and reduced elsewhere.\nThere will also be a \"further reduction of outpatient activity\", a spokesperson said, adding: \"Every member of staff will be supported by the Trust in delivering the best care wherever they are working.\"\nNeighbouring University Coventry and Warwickshire Hospitals Trust confirmed it had started taking Covid patients from Birmingham. \nUniversity Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) is one of the largest teaching hospital trusts in England.\nIt runs several hospitals, including Birmingham Heartlands, the Queen Elizabeth, Solihull Hospital and Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield. It also runs Birmingham Chest Clinic.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk "

      "text": "Indonesian search teams have retrieved one of the two \"black boxes\" from the Boeing 737 plane that crashed into the Java Sea on Saturday, killing all 62 people on board.\nThe flight data recorder was brought ashore, but the teams are still trying to locate the cockpit voice recorder.\nThe authorities hope that data from the black boxes can give vital clues on the possible cause of the crash.\nThe 26-year-old aircraft passed an airworthiness inspection last month.\nIt was still functioning and intact before it crashed, preliminary results showed. \nFlight SJ182 was en route from the capital Jakarta to the city of Pontianak on Borneo island.\nSeparately, Indonesian police have identified the first victim - Okky Bisma, a 29-year-old flight attendant.\nIndonesia's transport ministry on Tuesday said the aircraft had been grounded during the pandemic, and passed an inspection on 14 December.\nIt made its first flight five days later with no passengers before resuming commercial flights on 22 December.\nThe National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said that preliminary findings showed that the plane had reached the height of 10,900ft (3.3km) at 14:36 local time on Saturday (07:36 GMT), then made a steep drop to 250ft at 14:40, before it stopped transmitting data.\nKNKT head Soerjanto Tjahjono added that the plane's turbine disc had been found with a damaged fan blade - ruling out the theory that the plane had exploded mid-air. \n\"The damaged fan blade indicates that the machine was still functioning when it crashed. This [is] also in line with the belief that the plane's system was still functioning when it reached 250ft,\" said Mr Soerjanto in a written statement to reporters. \nSearch teams are continuing to comb the waters at the crash site, trying to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder. \nEarlier on Tuesday, the KNKT said a device used to locate the black boxes had experienced \"technical problems or equipment damage\".\nSeveral pieces of debris, body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing have already been recovered.\nAccording to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel were involved in the search operation on Monday, along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. \nInvestigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. An engine turbine has also been recovered. \nSafety officials say this stage of the investigation could take up to a year. \nThe Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday.\nMinutes later, at 14:40, the last contact was recorded.\nThere were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say.\nWitnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion.\nSriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations.\nThe missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK is at the \"worst point\" of the pandemic, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned, but said the actions of the public \"could make a difference\".\nAt a No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock pleaded with people to follow the government's Covid rules until the vaccine could provide a \"way out\" of the pandemic.\nThe government earlier published its plan to immunise tens of millions of people by spring.\nSo far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first Covid vaccine shot.\nAnd a total of 2.6 million doses have been given out across the country, with some people having received both doses.\nMr Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus was putting the NHS under \"significant pressure\", adding it was \"imperative\" that people limit their social contacts. \n\"The NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now - and that something is to follow the rules,\" he said.\n\"I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don't rule out taking further action if it is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a difference.\"\nThe health secretary said he could \"rule out\" tightening restrictions by removing support and childcare bubbles, however.\nHis comments follow similar warnings from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said that the next few weeks will be \"the worst\" of the pandemic for the NHS.\nAccording to the latest figures, there have been another 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, and another 46,169 cases reported. There are also more than 32,000 people in hospital with coronavirus, data shows.\nMatt Hancock has previously said he's learned to rule nothing out when it comes to dealing with the pandemic. \nBut today he took the unusual step of doing just that. \nSupport bubbles and childcare bubbles, hugely valued by so many, will stay. \nSenior Whitehall sources have previously told me bubbles were \"untouchable\" but for a minister to say as much, so explicitly and on the record, means there's now very little wriggle room for the government to change its mind.\nMinisters will know that scrapping bubbles, for those that rely on them, could have proved deeply unpopular. But this certainty is a rarity. \nWhilst the current emphasis is on compliance, the idea of toughening up controls in other areas is not being ruled out. \nThe vaccine delivery plan says it is expected to take until spring to give a first dose to all 32 million people in the UK's priority groups, including everyone over 55 and those who are clinically vulnerable.\nUnder the plan, the government has pledged to carry out at least two million vaccinations in England per week by the end of January, which it says will be made possible by rolling out jabs at 206 hospital sites, 50 vaccination centres and around 1,200 local vaccination sites. \nIt also reiterates the government's aim of offering vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February.\nAccording to Mr Hancock, two fifths of over-80s have now received their first dose, and almost a quarter of care home residents have received theirs.\nAlso at the briefing, NHS England's national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said the NHS was aiming to vaccinate the rest of the top nine priority groups by April, with a final push to offer all adults over 18 a jab by the autumn.\nHe stressed it would take until February before there were \"early signs\" that vaccination was leading to a drop in hospitalisations.\nThe country has still not seen the full impact of the Christmas loosening of lockdown restrictions, Prof Powis added, although he noted there are now 13,000 more Covid patients in hospital than there were on Christmas Day.\nSpeaking in Bristol earlier, Mr Johnson warned the vaccination programme was in a \"race against time\" because of pressure on the NHS.\nHe said it was \"a very perilous moment because everyone can sense the vaccine is coming in - my worry is that will breed false complacency\".\nThe newly-published vaccination plan also says ministers are aiming to offer jabs at more than 2,700 sites across the UK.\nAnd it says that daily vaccination figures for England will be published from now on - showing the total number vaccinated to date, including first and second doses. \nEarlier, NHS England's chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, told MPs that there was a \"strong case\" for asking the the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider prioritising \"teachers and other key workers\" for vaccination after the \"first nine [priority] groups have been vaccinated\".\nA quarter of coronavirus admissions to hospital are for people under the age of 55, he added.\nIn the first four weeks of the vaccination campaign, the NHS did 1.3 million vaccinations.\nNews that in the past week almost the same again has been done shows progress is being made - even though there has been some concern rollout to care home residents has been slower than hoped.\nHitting two million doses a week is the next target - and is something the NHS is aiming to get close to this week.\nWith more vaccination sites opening by the day, it should be achievable as long as there is good supply.\nThere is already enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all 15 million people in the highest at-risk groups that have been promised an offer of a vaccine by mid-February.\nHowever, not all of it has been through the final safety checks or been packaged up ready for distribution.\nChallenges remain, but even at this early stage it is clear there is growing optimism that the programme is on track. \nAs seven mass vaccination centres opened across England on Monday, NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week.\nBut with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation.\nTwo vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK.\nOn Friday, a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna - was approved for use, although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring.\nVaccine programmes are also progressing in the UK's devolved nations. \nAll over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid in Wales will be offered a vaccine by spring, under new plans.\nAnd Scotland's health secretary has said every aged over 80 or over in the nation will be offered a jab by February, while care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at home can now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine.\nEngland is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. \nSimilar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why there are \"less restrictions in place\" now than there were last March.\nIn his first speech of the year, he said: \"I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours\".\nMeanwhile, the United Arab Emirates is being removed from the UK list of travel corridors amid a spike in Covid cases.\nAnd England's Test and Trace scheme has revised one of its definitions of a \"close contact\" - the people who need to be reached if they have been near to someone who has tested positive for Covid.\nThis now refers to anyone who has been within two metres of someone for more than 15 minutes, whether in a single period or cumulatively over the course of one day.\nPreviously the definition was just a single period of at least 15 minutes.

      "text": "A deal has been agreed for the sale of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home and Bonmarch\u00e9 chains, which were on the brink of closure.\nThe businesses went into administration last year after a collapse in sales due to the pandemic.\nAlmost 2,000 staff will be kept on but as many as 260 stores could close.\nThe buyers are a consortium of international investors who will inject fresh funds into the business, led by the existing management team.\nEdinburgh Woollen Mill, which sells mid-price knitwear and other clothing to older shoppers, is part of a stable of retail brands owned by billionaire businessman, Philip Day. \nIt is understood that Mr Day will effectively lend the group the money to buy the businesses which will be paid back over a number of years.\nThe deal also covers two other brands in the group, value retailer Bonmarch\u00e9, and Ponden Home, an interiors chain based in the south east of England. \nThe new owners plan to operate 246 stores across both the Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home brands, retaining 1,453 staff in those stores, the head office and distribution centres in Carlisle.\nHowever, 85 Edinburgh Woollen Mill stores and 34 Ponden Home stores have been closed permanently, with the loss of  485 jobs.\nWakefield-based Bonmarch\u00e9 will retain 72 of its stores and 531 staff including head office and distribution centre staff.\nThe majority of its stores, 148 outlets, remain under review with staff on furlough.\nAdministrators representing Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home said the deal represented the best chance to save stores and jobs, given the difficult outlook for UK retail.\n\"We regret that not all of Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home could be rescued,\" said Tony Wright, partner at FRP. \"This has resulted in a significant number of redundancies at a particularly challenging time of year and period of economic uncertainty.\"\nRetail has been particularly hard hit by measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. Even when shops have been open many shoppers stayed away, wary of the health risks.\nThe British Retail Consortium said consumers bought 5% less last year than the year before (not including food). Much of that custom switched from the High Street to online, making it harder for chains whose customers usually shop in person. Physical stores saw sales drop by a quarter, the BRC said.\nOther major brands including Topshop-owner Arcadia and Debenhams have also gone into administration, costing hundreds of jobs. \n\"Lockdowns have proved hugely damaging for mid-range fashion chains like Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Bonmarch\u00e9 whose traditional customer base has not adapted so quickly to online shopping as younger shoppers,\" said Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"The backers of this rescue deal clearly believe there is pent-up demand amongst core customers which will be released once the doors are flung open once more,\" she added.\nOn Monday, Marks & Spencer announced it was buying Jaeger, another brand that had belonged to Philip Day's portfolio. \nPeacocks, another High Street fashion brand in the EWM group remains in administration."

She hosts the show from Monday to Thursday.\nWriting on Twitter, Rani said it was \"an honour\" to be joining Radio 4's \"mothership\".\nRani joined the BBC's Asian Network in 2005 and is a regular presenter on BBC Radio 2. She is also known for her appearances on The One Show and Watchdog, and for competing on the 2015 series of Strictly Come Dancing.\n\"Woman's Hour has always given a voice to people who may not be heard elsewhere and I want to continue that important tradition,\" she said.\nRadio 4 controller Mohit Bakaya said he wanted the station to \"better reflect and be relevant to the audience across the UK\". Rani will bring \"a wealth of broadcasting experience\" as well as a \"valuable\" perspective and insight, he added.\nComedian Shappi Khorsandi was among those to welcome her new role, saying she would be \"listening even more\".\nRani's appointment means the new Woman's Hour presenters are considerably younger than their predecessors. Dame Jenni was 70 when she left on 1 October, while Garvey was 56 when she signed off last month.\nBefore leaving, Garvey expressed a hope that whoever joined Barnett would be closer to her own age.\n\"Emma is in her 30s and that's great,\" she told the Daily Telegraph. \"It will give the programme a real energy, which I think is brilliant.\n\"So I think the person working alongside her should be somebody nearer my age to make sure we give the audience as broad a range of life experience and interests as possible. I would prefer it if the other presenter were in her 50s.\"\nBarnett had an eventful first week on the Radio 4 institution, opening her stint by reading out a message from The Queen.\nTwo days later, one of her guests dropped out of a discussion after objecting to remarks the presenter made about her off air.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 BST.\nThe UK's most senior police officer, Dame Cressida Dick, says her officers are still breaking up house parties, secret gambling gatherings and raves. She warned rule-breakers they were increasingly likely to be fined, with 8,000 penalties issued in England and Wales since November. See the powers the police have. The government has also said it could impose even tougher restrictions if people fail to follow those already in place. Here are some of the steps they could take, but why, according to our political editor, there's little political appetite to do it. Meanwhile, travel rules are getting stricter. Pre-departure Covid-19 testing will be required for UK arrivals from Friday, and the UAE has been removed from the safe travel list.\nMorrisons has said it will now refuse entry to shoppers without face coverings - and who refuse to wear masks offered by staff - unless they are medically exempt. Sainsbury's says staff will challenge those not wearing a mask or who are shopping in groups. We explain more here about how to wear a mask and who might be permitted not to - for example, those with certain medical conditions. The government says those who are exempt shouldn't have to show written evidence, but you can download or print exemption cards if you'd feel more comfortable with one.\nSo many of us are spending more time staring at a screen right now and an eye health charity is recommending we learn the \"20-20-20\" rule to protect our sight. Fight for Sight advises looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds, every 20 minutes you're working at a screen, in order to reduce eye strain. The charity also commissioned a survey of 2,000 people which found more than a third believed their eyesight had worsened in the past year. It says the number of us getting regular eye tests is also down and is urging people not to miss their appointments.\nIt sadly comes as no surprise to learn that 2020 was the worst year on record for UK retailers, especially those focused on clothing and homeware. Food bucked the trend, particularly over Christmas, with the highest ever festive spending on groceries. But overall, retail sales declined by 0.3% across the year, and non-food by nearly a quarter, the biggest annual dip since the British Retail Consortium began collating the figures in 1995. The BRC says many retailers are struggling to survive and the government should extend the business rates holiday to save jobs. \nA father who'd campaigned for a change in the coronavirus rules to make life easier for non-resident parents to see their children has welcomed a government rethink. Previously, parents could visit children they don't live with during lockdown, but restrictions prevented them from staying overnight in a hotel. Ex-BBC journalist Tom De Castella said the ban \"had a massive bearing on seeing my daughter\", who lives a three-and-a-half hour drive away from his home. Now the rules have been rewritten, he's relieved. \"This is about building a bond with your child, it's crucial to their development,\" he added.\nGet a longer news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.     \nPlus, three vaccines are now approved for use in the UK, but there are many differences between them.

showing the total number vaccinated to date, including first and second doses. \nEarlier, NHS England's chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, told MPs that there was a \"strong case\" for asking the the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider prioritising \"teachers and other key workers\" for vaccination after the \"first nine [priority] groups have been vaccinated\".\nA quarter of coronavirus admissions to hospital are for people under the age of 55, he added.\nIn the first four weeks of the vaccination campaign, the NHS did 1.3 million vaccinations.\nNews that in the past week almost the same again has been done shows progress is being made - even though there has been some concern rollout to care home residents has been slower than hoped.\nHitting two million doses a week is the next target - and is something the NHS is aiming to get close to this week.\nWith more vaccination sites opening by the day, it should be achievable as long as there is good supply.\nThere is already enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all 15 million people in the highest at-risk groups that have been promised an offer of a vaccine by mid-February.\nHowever, not all of it has been through the final safety checks or been packaged up ready for distribution.\nChallenges remain, but even at this early stage it is clear there is growing optimism that the programme is on track. \nAs seven mass vaccination centres opened across England on Monday, NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week.\nBut with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation.\nTwo vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK.\nOn Friday, a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna - was approved for use, although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring.\nVaccine programmes are also progressing in the UK's devolved nations. \nAll over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid in Wales will be offered a vaccine by spring, under new plans.\nAnd Scotland's health secretary has said every aged over 80 or over in the nation will be offered a jab by February, while care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at home can now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine.\nEngland is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. \nSimilar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why there are \"less restrictions in place\" now than there were last March.\nIn his first speech of the year, he said: \"I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours\".\nMeanwhile, the United Arab Emirates is being removed from the UK list of travel corridors amid a spike in Covid cases.\nAnd England's Test and Trace scheme has revised one of its definitions of a \"close contact\" - the people who need to be reached if they have been near to someone who has tested positive for Covid.\nThis now refers to anyone who has been within two metres of someone for more than 15 minutes, whether in a single period or cumulatively over the course of one day.\nPreviously the definition was just a single period of at least 15 minutes.

      "tags": "Schools,Gavin Williamson",
      "text": "An extra 300,000 laptops and tablets have been bought to help disadvantaged children in England learn at home, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.\nMr Williamson said the devices would be delivered to schools.\nHe also pledged to publish a remote education framework to support schools and colleges with delivering lessons during the latest national lockdown.\nIt comes as research says children from poorer families are likely to struggle more with remote learning.\nThe Department for Education said its data showed that over 700,000 devices had been delivered to schools in England so far during the pandemic - 100,000 of which were delivered last week.\nThe department says the additional 300,000 laptops and tablets lifts government investment by another \u00a3100m, meaning over \u00a3400m will have been invested in supporting disadvantaged children who need help with access to technology during the pandemic.\nBut the department has faced mounting criticism over huge percentages of pupils not having access to digital devices, nine months into the pandemic.\nMr Williamson said the DfE was \"doing everything in our power to support schools with high-quality remote education\".\nHe said: \"These additional devices, on top of the 100,000 delivered last week, add to the significant support we are making available to help schools deliver high-quality online learning, as we know they have been doing.\"\nOn top of this, the remote education framework would support schools and colleges with delivering education for pupils who are learning from home, he said.\nThe frameworks, which are voluntary and should be adapted for schools' individual circumstances, will \"help them to identify the strengths and areas for improvement in the lessons and teaching they provide remotely\".\nBut Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said:  \"While we welcome the extra laptops and tablets announced, it is pretty poor that nearly a year after this crisis began we are only now inching up to the number of devices that are needed.\n\"The reality is that this extra provision is coming when we are already well into the new lockdown and after a heavily disrupted autumn term in which many children had to self-isolate in line with coronavirus protocols,\" he said.\n \"The government was slow off the mark to address the digital divide early in the crisis and is now trying to make up for lost time.\"\nMr Williamson's laptop announcement comes as research by the University of Sussex found that nearly one in five less advantaged parents said they struggled with home-learning during the first lockdown.\nThe research surveyed 3,409 parents in the UK between 5 May until 31 July last year and found  families of lower socioeconomic status were more likely to report their home environment made it harder for pupils to complete schoolwork from home.\nThe study says secondary school pupils eligible for free school meals (39%) were more likely to report that a lack of technology - such as laptops and computers - made learning from home more difficult, compared to 19% of pupils who are not eligible for free school meals.\nPrimary school pupils from struggling households were found to be more likely to find home learning learning harder than their more comfortable off peers due to the environment - such as noise levels (59% to 50%), lack of space (45% to 22%), lack of technology (45% to 26%) and lack of internet (35% to 16%).\nThe researchers warned that educational inequalities were likely to increase due to further school closures this year.\nLead researcher Dr Matthew Easterbrook said: \"These results show that school closures disproportionately disrupt the education of those who are most economically disadvantaged, suggesting that educational inequalities are likely to rise because of the pandemic.\n\"The results show that parents of pupils from disadvantaged families - those who are eligible for free school meals, who have lower levels of education, or who are financially struggling - are much more likely to report that learning from home is challenging.\"\nReport co-author Lewis Doyle, doctoral researcher at the University of Sussex, added: \"School closures, while clearly necessary during this public health crisis, risk entrenching inequality.\"\nOn Tuesday the government also published figures on how many pupils were physically in schools across England before the Christmas holidays.\nThe data shows 79% of pupils in state schools were in class on Wednesday16 December - down from 85% on Thursday 10 December.\nIn secondary schools, attendance fell from 80% to 72% on 16 December, while  pupil attendance in primary schools fell from 89% to 86%, the figures show.\nBetween 9% and 11% of pupils - up to 872,000 children - did not attend school for Covid-19 related reasons on  16  December.

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The past 48 hours have been the busiest for health trusts since the start of the pandemic, with appeals to off-duty staff to help ease the pressure. \nSome trusts were close to declaring a major incident, which was averted after staff responded to Sunday's call. \nNI's six trusts warned that by the third week of January, hospitals could be dealing with double the number of Covid patients.\nHealth trusts have also said more cancer operations could be cancelled. \nThe Belfast Health Trust has already cancelled urgent cancer surgeries. \nOn Monday, a further 16 Covid-related deaths were announced by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, 15 of them occurring in the last 24 hours.\nSeven hundred and fifty-nine new cases of the virus were also reported.\nThe Western Health Trust is appealing to families to bring their loved ones home as soon as they are ready for discharge, and care for them there - even if a package is not yet in place.\nMeanwhile, a divert of patients from the Southern Health Trust to the Western Health Trust has been lifted.\nThree patients were diverted from the Southern Health Trust to the Western Health Trust overnight on Sunday.\nThe number of Covid-19 patients being treated by the Southern Health Trust is now 230, up from 215 on Sunday night.\nEmergency Department (ED) patients in the trust are experiencing very long waits, with departments expected to be busy again on Monday evening.\nIn total 91,954 people in Northern Ireland had received at least one coronavirus jab as of Monday night.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said on Monday afternoon that the latest modelling showed NI's R-number is sitting at about 1.1-1.2.\nThis is a drop from an estimated 1.8 earlier in January.\nMrs Foster said things were \"moving in the right direction\" with a reduction in the number of positive cases, but warned everyone needed to \"ready themselves\" for strain on the health service in the next few weeks.\nShe added that the executive had \"few options left\", if further restrictions were deemed necessary to tackle the transmission of the virus.\nThe first minister suggested the executive could look at whether curfews should be imposed again.\nThe executive will meet on Tuesday and Thursday this week for updates from health officials on the coronavirus situation.\nNew lockdown restrictions came into force in NI on Friday, forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasons.\nSpeaking to Good Morning Ulster, Western Health Trust chief executive Dr Anne Kilgallen predicted two out of every four patients being treated in hospitals in the west will have coronavirus by the third week of January. \nShe said currently one in four people in Northern Ireland hospitals has Covid-19. \nDr Kilgallen said the surge over the weekend was \"an indication of why\" they had to suspend red-flag cancer surgeries. \nShe added: \"We will work our hardest to ensure that we do respond to need. This is one of the reasons why, some trusts and I think this week more of us will do so, we made the extremely difficult decision to postpone cancer surgery.\"\nShe asked families to bring their relatives home as soon as they are \"medically fit\" for discharge. \n\"We realise that this is a big ask of families, but we do need people's help. We cannot keep people in hospital awaiting care packages, or indeed awaiting their preference in terms of a care home.\"\nIt is understood at the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen, five senior doctors, several radiographers, pharmacists and nurses came into work on Sunday.\nThis freed up 20 to 30 beds, allowing the Western Health Trust to take on patients from the Southern Health Trust. \nAll weekend, parts of Northern Ireland's health system were under severe pressure but, at times, it seemed the Southern Trust's hospitals were on the brink of falling over.\u00a0 \nAppeals were made for additional staff in the Western and Southern Health Trusts while a joint statement by the chief executives of the six health trusts says staff were doing all they could to deal with the situation.\nDaisy Hill and Craigavon were especially busy, with appeals made for available staff to come to work.\nSouth West Acute Hospital put out a similar appeal as it prepared to accept ambulance diverts and patients from other areas.\u00a0 \nOften an appeal for staff is the first indication that a hospital is about to declare a major incident, but when asked by the BBC if that was the case the Southern Health Trust\u00a0said calls for additional staff to come to work had helped avoid a crisis. \nThere have been numerous warnings that January would see an alarming increase in Covid cases, deaths and pressure - sadly, officials aren't being proved wrong. \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was experiencing the \"worst case scenario\" predicted at the start of the pandemic. \n\"We are at the extreme of the pandemic right now, this is the worst situation that we have been in from the very onset.\"\nShe added that the peak for Covid-19 cases had \"probably been reached\" but the peak pressure on the health service was yet to come.\nAt the weekend, Belfast Trust chief executive Dr Cathy Jack appealed to staff to \"voluntarily postpone any planned booked annual leave in the coming weeks\".\nHowever, Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursing NI, said it is an \"understatement\" to say that staff are feeling tired and overworked and any attempt to force them to cancel annual leave would be \"inhumane\".\nPatricia McKeown of trade union Unison, which represents many nurses, said staff were \"tired, they're stressed they're getting infected, they're getting sick, some of them, tragically, haven't made it.\n\"And yet, incredibly, they responded in the way they did over the weekend.\n\"But right now they're being asked to give even more, respond again in an even bigger and more intense way, because this coming week is going to be very, very serious.\"\nChief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said it is estimated that on average about \"one in 60\" people currently have Covid-19 in Northern Ireland.\nHe said the rising number of cases is a \"payback\" for the relaxation of restrictions in December.\n\"We've been running at about 500 people at any one time in our hospitals with Covid,\" he told The Nolan Show.\n\"I think it's very likely the numbers will be in excess of a thousand and that will put extreme pressure on an already hard pressed staff."

      "tags": "Policing,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Metropolitan Police Service,Cressida Dick,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lockdown rule-breakers are more likely to be fined as Covid laws will be enforced \"more quickly\", the UK's most senior police officer has said.\nLondon's Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said her officers have had to break up parties, despite hospitals struggling to cope with rising patient numbers.\nA minister confirmed her pledge that fines were \"increasingly likely\".\nKit Malthouse said people have a \"duty\" to make this lockdown \"the last one\".\n\"We are urging the small minority of people who aren't taking this seriously to do so now, and [are illustrating] to them that if they don't they are much more likely to get fined by the police,\" Mr Malthouse, the policing minister, told BBC Breakfast.\n\"These current measures should in theory, if we all stick by them, be enough to drive the numbers down so that we can start to move through the gears of tiers from mid-February,\" he added.\nAsked if tighter restrictions for England were on the way - something the health secretary has refused to rule out - Mr Malthouse said ministers were \"on tenterhooks\" watching the daily figures for Covid deaths, new cases and hospital admissions, as rules continue to be kept under review.\nHe said the government's ramped-up efforts to give vulnerable people the coronavirus vaccine should help the UK to \"get back to some sort of normality later this year\".\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was currently no expectation that Westminster will impose more extensive restrictions.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she discussed possible tighter restrictions with members of her cabinet on Tuesday morning.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel and chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, will hold a coronavirus press conference at Downing Street later.\nThe latest figures on Monday showed a further 529 people had died within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, while another 46,169 cases were reported. \nThere are also more than 32,200 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, data shows.\nDame Cressida told BBC Radio 4's Today programme some 75 police officers are joining 185 firefighters in being trained to drive ambulances in the capital, to help London Ambulance Service as the number of cases of the virus continues to rise.\nAnd writing in the Times, she said her officers had found people hosting raves, house parties and basement gambling events, despite clear laws that ban social gatherings.\n\"It is preposterous to me that anyone could be unaware of our duty to do all we can to stop the spread of the virus,\" she said, adding that people breaking Covid laws were \"increasingly likely to face fines\".\nPolice chiefs in other parts of England have also warned \"patience is running out\" with rule-breakers, with the public increasingly willing to report alleged rule breaches.\nSince March, some 32,000 penalties for breaching Covid laws have been issued in England and Wales - with a sharp rise in penalties during England's November lockdown.  \nAlmost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out in the weeks up to Christmas as police began moving more quickly from \"engage\", \"explain\" and \"encourage\" to the fourth \"e\" - \"enforcement\".\nExpect the rate of fines to continue upwards during January, given the scale of the emergency and the pressure from government on constabularies to enforce the law. \nBut there is also a tension here. Police chiefs have told their officers they will often have to use their own judgement because the list of \"reasonable excuses\" in the law for why someone can be outside is not fixed in stone. \nThere is a lot of wriggle room in the law to allow daily lives to continue. \nWhile ministers, scientists and health experts are all hammering home the message that people should stay at home as much as possible, the law is more liberal - for instance, there is no restriction on exercise in England. \nAnd that's why some police officers believe they are stuck between a rock and a hard place as people who don't want to be locked down find more and more creative ways to stretch the rules to breaking point.\nFines start at \u00a3200 in England and Northern Ireland, and \u00a360 in Wales and Scotland. Large parties can be shut down by the police, with fines of up to \u00a310,000.\nDame Cressida told the Today programme the move towards greater enforcement was \"common sense\" rather than a show of \"dictatorial policing\". \nShe also said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's cycle in east London at the weekend was \"not against the law\", but added the \"stay local\" guidance on exercise for England could be made more clear.\nUnder Scotland's lockdown restrictions, people must start and finish their exercise in the same place - and to do so, they may travel up to five miles from the boundary of their local authority area. People in Wales should start and finish exercising from their home, while those in Northern Ireland are advised not to go more than 10 miles from home when exercising.\nAsked if she would like to see similar detail in England's guidance, Dame Cressida said: \"That is certainly something the government could consider. \n\"Anything that brings greater clarity, for officers and the public, in general, will be a good thing.\"\nPolice chiefs have been under increasing pressure to enforce the lockdown laws - with a number of news reports about breaches of Covid rules in recent days.\nIn one case, Derbyshire Police withdrew penalties for two women who had been fined \u00a3200 each when they drove five miles for a walk together - following widespread media attention.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has defended the way police have handled breaches, saying there is a need for \"strong enforcement\".\nEngland is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home.\nSimilar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - which are in charge of making their own coronavirus restrictions.\nIn her article, Dame Cressida said she was \"delighted to hear\" that a proposal to prioritise frontline officers to get vaccinated was being \"actively discussed\", as the rate of officers self-isolating has risen. \nSo far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, as part of the government's plan to vaccinate tens of millions of people by the spring.\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said members of the armed forces were working \"hand in hand with the NHS\" to help with the response to the UK's epidemic. \nSome 5,300 members of the armed forces are currently involved in the Covid response including personnel to help with vaccinations and community testing across the UK, he said."

      "text": "Parler has hit back after Amazon pulled support for its so-called \"free speech\" social network.\nParler is suing the tech giant, accusing it of breaking anti-trust laws by removing it.\nParler had been reliant on the tech giant's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing service to provide its alternative to Twitter.\nThe platform was popular among supporters of Donald Trump, although the president is not a user.\nAmazon took the action after finding dozens of posts on the service that it said encouraged violence.\nIn response, the platform has asked a federal judge to order Amazon to reinstate it.\n\"AWS's decision to effectively terminate Parler's account is apparently motivated by political animus,\" the complaint reads.\n\"It is also apparently designed to reduce competition in the microblogging services market to the benefit of Twitter.\"\nAmazon has issued a statement in response.\n\"There is no merit to these claims,\" it said.\n\"AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we respect Parler's right to determine for itself what content it will allow. However, it is clear that there is significant content on Parler that encourages and incites violence against others, and that Parler is unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which is a violation of our terms of service. \n\"We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening.\"\nExamples Amazon had provided included posts calling for the killing of Democrats, Muslims, Black Lives Matter leaders, and mainstream media journalists.\nGoogle and Apple had already removed Parler from their app stores towards the end of last week saying it had failed to comply with their content-moderation requirements.\nHowever, it had still been accessible via the web - although visitors had complained of being unable to create new accounts over the weekend, without which it was not possible to view its content.\nParler has been online since 2018, and may return if it can find an alternative host.\nHowever, chief executive John Matze told Fox News on Sunday that \"every vendor from text message services to email providers to our lawyers all ditched us too\".\n\"We're going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we're having a lot of trouble because every vendor we talk to says they won't work with us because if Apple doesn't approve and Google doesn't approve, they won't,\" he added.\nAWS's move is the latest in a series of actions affecting social media following the rioting on Capitol Hill last week.\nFacebook and Twitter have also banned President Trump's accounts on their platforms, citing concerns that he might incite further violence.\nParler's users included the Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who had led an effort in the Senate to delay certifying Joe Biden's electoral college victory.\nHe had about five million followers on the platform - more than his tally on Twitter.\n\"Why should a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires have a monopoly on political speech?\" he tweeted over the weekend.\nParler's downfall appears to have benefited Gab - another \"free speech\" social network that is popular with far-right commentators.\nIt has claimed to have \"gained more users in the past two days than we did in our first two years of existing\". \nParler has long been a home for what you might call untouchables, people who had been excluded from mainstream services for offences such as blatant racism or incitement to violence.\nDuring a brief excursion onto the site over the weekend, I observed plenty of examples of such behaviour, with users exhibiting vile anti-Semitism, displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika and uttering incoherent threats against those they perceive to be enemies of America. \nBut as Amazon's deadline approached something like panic took hold, with users desperately urging their followers to join them on other platforms. \nMost seemed to accept that Parler was doomed, while vowing to continue their fight elsewhere. \n\"Well this is the end,\" wrote one user, who proclaimed his support for the American Nazi Party."

He murdered three innocent people. But there must be accountability on the part of services that should have supported him,\" it said.\nBut passing sentence Mr Justice Sweeney said it was \"clear that the defendant did not, and does not, have any major mental illness\".\nGary Furlong said: \"Given the volume of crimes he's committed and the information that they had on him, for an assessment to be done the night before to say that he's not a danger to the public - it is beyond me. \n\"How was he ever allowed to stay in this country? How was he allowed in, in the first place?\"\nHistory teacher James Furlong and pharmaceutical manager Mr Ritchie-Bennett each died from a single stab wound to the neck, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed once in the back.\nDespite treatment from paramedics and doctors, all three friends, who were members of the LGBT community, died at the scene.\nGary Furlong described his son as \"an amazing, kind boy\" who was loved by family, friends and students."

It will have the capacity to vaccinate thousands of people daily.\nThe park has been closed to visitors since mid-March - unlike its sister resort, Walt Disney World in Florida, which has been open to reduced numbers of guests since July.\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom announced similar vaccination sites would be opening up as early as this week at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium, Cal Expo in Sacramento and Petco Park in San Diego.\n\"We recognise that the current strategy is not going to get us to where we need to go as quickly as we all need to go,\" Mr Newsom said. \n\"That's why we're speeding up the administration not just for priority groups but opening up large sites to do so.\"\nThe state's current vaccination campaign is focusing on high priority individuals, like health care workers and long-term care facility residents. \nThe Golden State has the third highest death rate in the country. \nMore than 22,600 people have been admitted to hospital due to the virus, and state data shows that as of Monday, just over 1,200 intensive care beds were still available statewide.\n\"The damaging impact to our families and our local hospitals from this surge is the worst disaster our county has experienced for decades,\" Los Angeles County's top public health official, Barbara Ferrer told reporters on Monday.\nThe US has seen 22.6m Covid-19 cases and more than 376,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Wednesday morning. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel has said while most people are doing the \"right thing and staying at home\", a minority is \"putting the health of the nation at risk\". Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, she backed police officers in enforcing the regulations. She said that \"far too often\" they were risking their own health and lives by coming into close contact with people, \"including those who deny the very existence of coronavirus\". The latest government figures show 45,533 more people have tested positive for Covid in the UK, with another 1,243 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. And 2,431,648 people have now received a vaccine in the UK. \nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused excess deaths to rise to the highest level since World War Two. It refers to the number of deaths over what would be expected, based on the average over the previous five years. There were nearly 697,000 deaths in the UK in 2020 - nearly 85,000 more than would be expected under that measure. Matthew Reed, of the end-of-life care charity Marie Curie, said the focus on Covid should not hide the fact there has been a \"silent crisis\" of deaths at home, with people dying prematurely of other causes. The UK's most senior police officer has warned that lockdown rule-breakers are more likely to be fined as Covid laws will be enforced \"more quickly\". \nConcerns have been raised about the supply of food parcels being provided during lockdown for children on free school meals in England - with footballer Marcus Rashford among those speaking out. He shared images of what appeared to have been parcels sent out, saying they were \"just not good enough\". The prime minister's official spokesman said Downing Street was aware of the images and that the contents of those food parcels were \"completely unacceptable\". Read more here about what those on free school meals are entitled to. Rashford had campaigned for food to be provided to children entitled to free school meals over the summer holidays. \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the country's current lockdown is \"very unlikely\" to be lifted at the end of the month. A review of the restrictions is due to be carried out at the end of January, but she said it was possible there would be no easing at that point. More than 5,000 people have now died in Scotland after testing positive for the virus. Ms Sturgeon said the figures were a reminder of the toll the virus had taken, with every death causing heartbreak to friends, families and loved ones across the nation.  \nSir David Attenborough has had the Covid-19 vaccine, his representative has confirmed. He's the latest well-known person to say they have been vaccinated - a few days ago it was the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh. It's not known which of the two vaccines currently being used in the UK he was given, or exactly when he had it. There are now three vaccines approved for administration in the UK - Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, although supplies of the latter are not expected to arrive until spring.

      "tags": "Retailing,Social distancing,Supermarkets,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Morrisons will bar customers who refuse to wear face coverings from its shops amid rising coronavirus infections.\nFrom Monday, shoppers who refuse to wear face masks offered by staff will not be allowed inside, unless they are medically exempt.\nSainsbury's also said it would challenge those not wearing a mask or who were shopping in groups.\nThe announcements come amid concerns that social distancing measures are not being adhered to in supermarkets.\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government is \"concerned\" shops are not enforcing rules strictly enough.\n\"Ultimately, the most important thing to do now is to make sure that actually enforcement - and of course the compliance with the rules - when people are going into supermarkets are being adhered to,\" Mr Zahawi told Sky News.\n\"We need to make sure people actually wear masks and follow the one-way system,\" he said.\nMorrisons said it had \"introduced and consistently maintained thorough and robust safety measures in all our stores\" since the start of the pandemic.\nBut it said: \"From today we are further strengthening our policy on masks.\" \nSecurity guards at the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain will be enforcing the new rules.\nMorrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: \"Those who are offered a face covering and decline to wear one won't be allowed to shop at Morrisons unless they are medically exempt.\n\"Our store colleagues are working hard to feed you and your family, please be kind.\"\nFollowing Morrisons' announcement, Sainsbury's said that it was also putting trained security guards at the front of its stores to challenge shoppers who did not comply.\nChief executive Simon Roberts said: \"I've spent a lot of time in our stores reviewing the latest situation over the last few days and on behalf of all my colleagues, I am asking our customers to help us keep everyone safe. \n\"The vast majority of customers are shopping safely, but I have also seen some customers trying to shop without a mask and shopping in larger family groups. \n\"Please help us to keep all our colleagues and customers safe by always wearing a mask and by shopping alone. Everyone's care and consideration matters now more than ever.\"\nEarlier on Monday, Mr Zahawi stopped short of saying that supermarket staff should be responsible for enforcing rules on face masks.\nEnforcement of face coverings is the responsibility of the police, not retailers. Wearing face masks in supermarkets and shops is compulsory across the UK. \nIn England, the police can issue a \u00a3200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a \u00a360 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines.\nHowever, retail industry body the British Retail Consortium said that, workers have faced an increase in incidents of violence and abuse when trying to encourage shoppers to put them on.\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, added: \"Supermarkets continue to follow all safety guidance and customers should be reassured that supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit during lockdown and beyond. \n\"Customers should play their part too by following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers.\"\nUnder current lockdown restrictions across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people must only leave home for essential reasons, such as buying food or medicine.\nIn a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus, supermarkets introduced social distancing measures during the UK's first nationwide lockdown last March. They included limits on the numbers of customers in the shops at any one time, protective plastic screens at tills and \"marshals\" to ensure shoppers were maintaining a two-metre distance.\nBut amid rising numbers of infections, some have expressed concerns about a \"lack of visible protections\" implemented by supermarkets in recent weeks.\nThe First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturday that he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown as people were worried the strict enforcement of rules did not \"appear to be there this time\".\n\"Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,\" he said.\nSupermarket Waitrose said that it was taking a \"cautious approach\" to the virus, with marshals checking that customers are wearing face coverings on the door, hand sanitiser stations at its entrances and written communications to shoppers reminding them to maintain their distance.\nTesco said it was limiting the number of customers in store and was also reminding customers to wear masks.\n\"We have clear signage explaining this, and we have packs of face coverings available for purchase near the front of our stores for any customers who have forgotten them.\"\nMeanwhile, Asda announced last week that it would extend its marshals' hours to 08:00 to 20:00 and increase how often baskets and trollies are cleaned.\nShop workers' union Usdaw has also called for firms to apply more stringent measures again.\nThe union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said that it had received reports that \"too many customers are not following necessary safety measures like social distancing, wearing a face covering and only shopping for essential items\".\n\"It is going to take some time to roll out the vaccine and we cannot afford to be complacent in the meantime, particularly with a new strain sweeping the nation,\" Mr Lillis said.\nThe trade union also suggested that \"'one-in one-out\" policies and proper queuing systems should be reintroduced in supermarkets. \nIt added that these systems should be managed by trained security staff where necessary.

Our work is being overlooked.\"\nLucy wants shoppers to start taking their store visits more seriously. \n\"Treat it the way we treated it at the start of the pandemic where people were being a lot more careful with what they were doing. \n\"People are forgetting how dangerous it actually is. Everybody's scared so if we all work together and we all wear masks and wash our hands we can end it sooner.\"\nSupermarkets are reacting to the concerns of their workers, with Morrisons now saying they will ban shoppers who refuse to wear a mask when they don't have a medical exemption.\nPaddy Lillis, from union USDAW, which represents shop workers, says \"people are being verbally abused, having things thrown at them and spit on - it's downright nasty.\"\n\"We've written to supermarkets saying they've got to reinforce the message that social distancing, the numbers [of people] in stores, and face coverings needs to be strictly reinforced.\"\nHe says he's also contacted the governments in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to see if shop rules can be enforced by law too. \nLiv works at a supermarket in Ipswich and had a different view on whether people should wear masks when she spoke to Newsbeat back in October.\n\"I do think masks give people a sense of security and a little bit of extra protection but I wouldn't say it bothers me whether people wear them or not,\" she said.\n\"I know the government says it's compulsory in some places but on the whole I do think it's a personal choice.\"\nThe 28-year-old also thinks people who are exempt get a backlash if they're not wearing them. \n\"If you see someone not wearing a mask, just mind your business. As long as you're two metres away from them, I don't see how it affects you.\"\nLiv's supermarket doesn't order people to wear masks because customers could have an underlying health condition they don't want to disclose.\nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, says shops are meeting their responsibilities in encouraging mask wearing.\nIt says they're communicating the rules through things like signs, in-store announcements and other reminders.\nBut more general rules across the UK now say face masks are compulsory in shops.\nLiv's store has brought in a marshal who \"politely\" asks people without masks if they'd like to wear one. She says she feels safe at work and says social distancing rules are being followed.\nThe advice from the World Health Organisation is that masks should be worn in public places. But for Liv, there's not enough evidence they work.\n\"I've worked through the whole pandemic in a supermarket. At the start we were told we didn't need to wear them, so it's just a bit far-fetched for me now.\"\nMasks became mandatory inside shops in the summer - after the first lockdown.\nScotland was the first nation to require masks in shops in early July, followed by England later that month.\nThey became mandatory in Northern Ireland in August and in Wales in September 2020.\nLiv does have one request though when it comes to mask wearing.\n\"What annoys me the most is when people are wearing masks but don't wear them properly so it's not over their nose,\" she says.\n\"You're either going to wear it or you're not going to wear it.\"\nCorrection 4  February 2021: This article originally included a picture of  a supermarket in London, which we have replaced because it was taken before face coverings were compulsory in shops in England.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

The police watchdog said initial tests showed Mr Hassan was not killed by any injuries. \nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said toxicology tests were now being carried out and it was awaiting the full post-mortem results.\nEarlier, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the reports of Mr Hassan's death were \"deeply concerning\".\nMr Hassan was arrested at his Roath home on Friday on suspicion of breach of the peace but released without charge on Saturday morning.\nMr Hassan's aunt Zainab Hassan told BBC Wales she had seen Mr Hassan within an hour of his release.\n\"He was released on Saturday morning with lots of wounds on his body and lots of bruises,\" she said.\n\"He didn't have these wounds when he was arrested and when he came out of Cardiff Bay police station, he had them.\"\nIn a virtual session of the Welsh Parliament on Monday, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: \"Every effort should be made to seek the truth of what happened.\"\nHe said he wanted to know why Mr Hassan was arrested and what happened during his arrest.\n\"Why did this young man die?,\" he added.\nMr Price said any inquiry should not be prejudged, but asked if the first minister would \"help the family find those answers\".\nIn response, Mr Drakeford said reports of the story were \"deeply concerning\".\n\"Our thoughts must be with the family of a young man who was... a fit and healthy individual,\" the Cardiff West MS said.\nMr Drakeford, who said the death must be \"properly investigated\", said the first step in any inquiry would be to allow the IOPC to carry out their work, which he said he expected \"to be done rigorously and with full and visible independence\".\nHe added that if there were things the Welsh Government could do \"I will make sure that we attend properly to those\".\nProtesters on Tuesday afternoon chanted \"no justice, no peace\" and called for the police force to release CCTV of Mr Hassan's time in custody.\nSome held signs that read \"Black Lives Matter\".\nIn a statement on Monday, South Wales Police said Mr Hassan was arrested at his home in Newport Road on Friday night and taken to Cardiff Bay police station.\nHe was released at 08:30 GMT on Saturday and officers returned to the property at about 22:30 following his death.\nIt added: \"As part of the South Wales Police investigation CCTV and body-worn video has already been, and will continue to be, examined.\n\"This will assist in establishing and understanding the events that took place.\n\"Early findings by the force indicate no misconduct issues and no excessive force.\"\nCatrin Evans, the IOPC's director for Wales, said its investigation would focus on Mr Hassan's arrest, the journey in a police van to custody and his time at Cardiff Bay police station, including whether relevant assessments were made before he was released.  \nShe said they would be \"urgently examining the extensive relevant CCTV footage and body-worn video\" and would be speaking to the officers involved as well as witnesses who saw his arrest on Friday evening and his movements the next day after leaving custody.\nShe added: \"I send my condolences to Mr Hassan's family and friends, and to everyone affected by his sad death.\n\"We are aware of concerns being expressed and questions being asked about use of force by police officers. We will look carefully at the level of force used during the interaction and I would urge people show patience while our inquiries, which will take some time, are made.\"\nMs Evans added: \"An interim report from a post-mortem examination is awaited.\n\"Preliminary indications are that there is no physical trauma injury to explain a cause of death, and toxicology tests are required.\""

      "tags": "Policing,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Metropolitan Police Service,Cressida Dick,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lockdown rule-breakers are more likely to be fined as Covid laws will be enforced \"more quickly\", the UK's most senior police officer has said.\nLondon's Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said her officers have had to break up parties, despite hospitals struggling to cope with rising patient numbers.\nA minister confirmed her pledge that fines were \"increasingly likely\".\nKit Malthouse said people have a \"duty\" to make this lockdown \"the last one\".\n\"We are urging the small minority of people who aren't taking this seriously to do so now, and [are illustrating] to them that if they don't they are much more likely to get fined by the police,\" Mr Malthouse, the policing minister, told BBC Breakfast.\n\"These current measures should in theory, if we all stick by them, be enough to drive the numbers down so that we can start to move through the gears of tiers from mid-February,\" he added.\nAsked if tighter restrictions for England were on the way - something the health secretary has refused to rule out - Mr Malthouse said ministers were \"on tenterhooks\" watching the daily figures for Covid deaths, new cases and hospital admissions, as rules continue to be kept under review.\nHe said the government's ramped-up efforts to give vulnerable people the coronavirus vaccine should help the UK to \"get back to some sort of normality later this year\".\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was currently no expectation that Westminster will impose more extensive restrictions.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she discussed possible tighter restrictions with members of her cabinet on Tuesday morning.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel and chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, will hold a coronavirus press conference at Downing Street later.\nThe latest figures on Monday showed a further 529 people had died within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, while another 46,169 cases were reported. \nThere are also more than 32,200 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, data shows.\nDame Cressida told BBC Radio 4's Today programme some 75 police officers are joining 185 firefighters in being trained to drive ambulances in the capital, to help London Ambulance Service as the number of cases of the virus continues to rise.\nAnd writing in the Times, she said her officers had found people hosting raves, house parties and basement gambling events, despite clear laws that ban social gatherings.\n\"It is preposterous to me that anyone could be unaware of our duty to do all we can to stop the spread of the virus,\" she said, adding that people breaking Covid laws were \"increasingly likely to face fines\".\nPolice chiefs in other parts of England have also warned \"patience is running out\" with rule-breakers, with the public increasingly willing to report alleged rule breaches.\nSince March, some 32,000 penalties for breaching Covid laws have been issued in England and Wales - with a sharp rise in penalties during England's November lockdown.  \nAlmost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out in the weeks up to Christmas as police began moving more quickly from \"engage\", \"explain\" and \"encourage\" to the fourth \"e\" - \"enforcement\".\nExpect the rate of fines to continue upwards during January, given the scale of the emergency and the pressure from government on constabularies to enforce the law. \nBut there is also a tension here. Police chiefs have told their officers they will often have to use their own judgement because the list of \"reasonable excuses\" in the law for why someone can be outside is not fixed in stone. \nThere is a lot of wriggle room in the law to allow daily lives to continue. \nWhile ministers, scientists and health experts are all hammering home the message that people should stay at home as much as possible, the law is more liberal - for instance, there is no restriction on exercise in England. \nAnd that's why some police officers believe they are stuck between a rock and a hard place as people who don't want to be locked down find more and more creative ways to stretch the rules to breaking point.\nFines start at \u00a3200 in England and Northern Ireland, and \u00a360 in Wales and Scotland. Large parties can be shut down by the police, with fines of up to \u00a310,000.\nDame Cressida told the Today programme the move towards greater enforcement was \"common sense\" rather than a show of \"dictatorial policing\". \nShe also said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's cycle in east London at the weekend was \"not against the law\", but added the \"stay local\" guidance on exercise for England could be made more clear.\nUnder Scotland's lockdown restrictions, people must start and finish their exercise in the same place - and to do so, they may travel up to five miles from the boundary of their local authority area. People in Wales should start and finish exercising from their home, while those in Northern Ireland are advised not to go more than 10 miles from home when exercising.\nAsked if she would like to see similar detail in England's guidance, Dame Cressida said: \"That is certainly something the government could consider. \n\"Anything that brings greater clarity, for officers and the public, in general, will be a good thing.\"\nPolice chiefs have been under increasing pressure to enforce the lockdown laws - with a number of news reports about breaches of Covid rules in recent days.\nIn one case, Derbyshire Police withdrew penalties for two women who had been fined \u00a3200 each when they drove five miles for a walk together - following widespread media attention.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has defended the way police have handled breaches, saying there is a need for \"strong enforcement\".\nEngland is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home.\nSimilar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - which are in charge of making their own coronavirus restrictions.\nIn her article, Dame Cressida said she was \"delighted to hear\" that a proposal to prioritise frontline officers to get vaccinated was being \"actively discussed\", as the rate of officers self-isolating has risen. \nSo far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, as part of the government's plan to vaccinate tens of millions of people by the spring.\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said members of the armed forces were working \"hand in hand with the NHS\" to help with the response to the UK's epidemic. \nSome 5,300 members of the armed forces are currently involved in the Covid response including personnel to help with vaccinations and community testing across the UK, he said."

I'm getting a lot of contact from families and I just can't give them anything,\" she said.\nThe home's owner said he had now taken matters into his own hands.\nKevin Edwards, managing director of Meddyg Care, said he had spent hours ringing around GP surgeries \"begging\" for spare vaccines.\nHe said the residents would now be vaccinated on Tuesday.\n\"We're a specialist dementia home, you can't just turn up one day and give the vaccine to the residents, there needs to be an element of preparation,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board said it was working to ensure those with the highest priority are vaccinated.\nTeresa Owen, the health board's executive director of public health, said: \"Last week we vaccinated nearly 10,000 people in north Wales.\n\"This week, staff from primary care practices will be going into the local nursing and residential homes to administer the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccination to residents.\n\"The initial supply of vaccinations to the west of BCUHB has caused some logistical problems with commencing this programme, but vaccines have now been allocated for all the nursing and residential homes in the locality.\""

      "text": "A Dutch TV network has filmed border officials confiscating ham sandwiches and other foods from drivers arriving in the Netherlands from the UK, under post-Brexit rules.\nThe officials were shown explaining import regulations imposed since the UK formalised its separation from the EU.\nUnder EU rules, travellers from outside the bloc are banned from bringing in meat and dairy products.\nThe rules appeared to bemuse one driver.\n\"Since Brexit, you are no longer allowed to bring certain foods to Europe, like meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, that kind of stuff,\" a Dutch border official told the driver in footage broadcast by TV network NPO 1.\nIn one scene, a border official asked the driver whether several of his tin-foil wrapped sandwiches had meat in them. \nWhen the driver said they did, the border official said: \"Okay, so we take them all.\"\nSurprised, the driver then asked the officials if he could keep the bread, to which one replied: \"No, everything will be confiscated - welcome to the Brexit, sir. I'm sorry.\"\nThe UK officially finished its formal separation from the EU on 31 December, 2020.\nFrom 23:00 GMT on that date, the UK stopped following EU rules, with new arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation coming into force.\nA trade deal with the EU was agreed on 24 December, and a week later, UK lawmakers voted in favour of the agreement.\nThe UK's departure means big changes for business - with the UK and EU forming two separate markets - the end of free movement, and new regulations, including those governing the import of personal goods.\nThe UK government has issued guidance to commercial drivers travelling to the EU, warning them to \"be aware of additional restrictions to personal imports\".\n\"You cannot bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (e.g. a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU,\" the guidance says. \"There are exceptions to this rule for certain quantities of powdered infant milk, infant food, special foods, or special processed pet feed.\"\nOn its website, the European Commission says the ban is necessary because such goods \"continue to present a real threat to animal health throughout the Union\".\n\"It is known, for example, that dangerous pathogens that cause animal diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease and classical swine fever can reside in meat, milk or their products,\" the Commission says.\nSeparately, the Dutch customs agency shared a picture of foodstuffs it had confiscated from motorists in the ferry terminal the Hook of Holland. \n\"Since 1 January, you can't just bring more food from the UK,\" the agency said. \"So prepare yourself if you travel to the Netherlands from the UK and spread the word. This is how we prevent food waste and together ensure that the controls are speeded up.\"\nThe BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam described the confiscation of ham sandwiches and other foodstuffs at the EU's borders with the UK as \"a standard implication of [the] Brexit deal\"."

      "title": "Did Nicola Sturgeon break the ministerial code?",
      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is facing questions after her predecessor Alex Salmond accused her of \"repeatedly\" misleading parliament and breaking the ministerial code.\nMs Sturgeon has rejected the accusations, but has referred herself for an independent investigation. What exactly are the claims, who will adjudicate and what could it all mean?\nThe row centres on the Scottish government's botched investigation of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond, something which has now been subject to a wide range of inquiries.\nA special Holyrood committee has been looking into the circumstances which saw the government admit its probe had been \"unlawful\" and pay Mr Salmond more than \u00a3500,000 in legal costs.\nQuestions have been raised about the role of Ms Sturgeon, and her contact with Mr Salmond during the investigation in 2018 - questions which prompted her to refer herself to an independent panel which adjudicates on the ministerial code.\nThere has always been a code of conduct for Scottish ministers, setting out expected behaviours and responsibilities, but it was Mr Salmond who introduced the panel in 2008. He was investigated and cleared of breaching the code on five occasions.\nSuggestions that Ms Sturgeon might have broken the rules came to the fore thanks to Mr Salmond, who claimed his successor in Bute House had \"repeatedly misled\" parliament and made \"wholly false\" statements.\nMs Sturgeon has insisted she has \"nothing to hide\", did not mislead parliament, and will set out her side of the story to both inquiries in the coming weeks.\nMr Salmond may get to put his side across first, having been invited to give evidence to the Holyrood committee next week.\nOne central question is when Ms Sturgeon learned of the two internal complaints against her predecessor.\nThe first minister has said on a number of occasions that she first heard about them from Mr Salmond himself, at a meeting at her Glasgow home on 2 April, 2018.\nShe has since accepted that she met Mr Salmond's former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein at her office four days earlier, on 29 March, but had \"forgotten\" about it.\nMs Sturgeon still maintains that she learned of the fact and detail of the complaints from Mr Salmond himself - an encounter which she says was \"seared on my memory\" and had \"somehow overwritten in my mind a much more fleeting, opportunistic meeting that took place a few days earlier\".\nHowever, Mr Salmond says this claim is \"simply untrue\" and \"untenable\". \nHe says Mr Aberdein's evidence is that he \"personally discussed the existence of the complaints and summarised the substance of the complaints\" in a \"pre-arranged meeting\" on 29 March - and had shared this information with Mr Salmond and others at the time.\nSection 1.3 of the ministerial code states that \"ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the first minister\".\nPressed about this, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I do not consider that I misled parliament, but that is for others to judge.\"\nMs Sturgeon has also insisted that she did not intervene in the complaints process - and that she did not meet Mr Salmond in her capacity as first minister, but rather as leader of the SNP.\nThis matters in the context of the ministerial code because Section 4.22 states that \"the basic facts\" of government meetings with \"external individuals\" should be recorded, including a list of those present and the reasons for the meeting.\nThe 2 April meeting at Ms Sturgeon's home was not formally recorded - she told the inquiry committee she had \"met a friend of 30 years\" as leader of the party, because she \"suspected that he may be about to resign from the SNP\".\nMr Salmond says this position is \"ridiculous\", and that \"all participants in that meeting were fully aware of what the meeting was about and why it had been arranged\". He added: \"The first minister's claim that it was ever thought to be about anything other than the complaints made against me is wholly false.\"\nMs Sturgeon's husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, suggested in his evidence that the situation might not be quite so clear cut.\nHe says Ms Sturgeon never discussed the complaints with him because they were government business. But his view was that Ms Sturgeon could have initially agreed the meetings thinking they were a party matter, before subsequently realising they were \"something else\".\nHowever, this does not settle the fact there were two further meetings between the pair - another in Glasgow and one in Aberdeen - which again were not formally recorded.\nMs Sturgeon's response to this is that she was \"trying to protect the confidentiality and integrity\" of the complaints process.\nShe says this section of the code is designed to \"prevent a minister having meetings about decisions that they are taking in government and not declaring them\", but says \"that was a decision I was not involved in\".\nYet another row concerns whether the government followed its own legal advice while contesting the judicial review case raised by Mr Salmond.\nThe former first minister insists that counsel had informed the government before the end of October 2018 that they were staring defeat in the face, but that the case ultimately continued into the following January at the cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds.\nMr Salmond says this is contrary to Section 2.30 of the code, which sets out the \"overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law\" and to \"ensure their decisions are informed by appropriate analysis of the legal considerations\".\nThe Scottish government meanwhile says it was only much later that it became clear the case was doomed, with Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans being given explicit advice that \"the only sensible and defensible action is to concede the petition\" on 29 December.\nThe ins and outs of this may be harder to judge than the matter of the meetings, because much of the government's legal advice remains shrouded in secrecy.\nMSPs have twice voted to demand legal privilege be waived so that advice can be published in full. But the government argues that to do so would undermine the whole system of free and fair legal advice, and prevent lawyers from providing frank opinions in future.\nThe Holyrood inquiry committee has been given some access to reports summarising the advice, but are still calling for more.\nThe inquiry committee might come up with a view of Ms Sturgeon's conduct, but the one that really matters is that of James Hamilton.\nA former head of the prosecution service in Ireland, Mr Hamilton was appointed to the ministerial standards panel in 2013. He will pen a report setting out whether or not in his judgement Ms Sturgeon breached the rules.\nHowever, as an external advisor, he would not have any power to impose a punishment - that power lies with the first minister herself, as the ultimate arbiter of the code.\nIf he says there was no breach, Ms Sturgeon will move on unscathed. But what will happen if he returns a judgement saying the first minister broke the code?\nIt could be argued that Mr Salmond's goal is to remove Ms Sturgeon from office given he has called for the code inquiry to be expanded and highlighted a string of alleged infractions which the code itself suggests could prompt a resignation.\nWhether this would actually be the outcome of a breach is far less clear.\nMs Sturgeon is at the peak of her popularity, is currently leading Scotland through a pandemic, and will be facing the judgement of the voters in a few months' time anyway.\nThe defences she has offered so far also point to where mitigation of any breach could be offered - she could argue that it was right to focus on protecting the anonymity of the complainers, rather than minor matters like making sure meetings were minuted.\nOn the one hand, the history of Holyrood is littered with leaders who fell from the top over relatively technical matters - Henry McLeish for sub-letting his constituency office, David McLetchie over taxi fares and Wendy Alexander over registering donations.\nBut equally, there is a more up-to-date example of a minister being found to have breached a ministerial code and remaining in office, in Home Secretary Priti Patel.\nFew things about this inquiry have been clear-cut or straightforward, and the outcome may well turn out to be every bit as muddy as the process has been."

      "tags": "Reading stabbings,Reading",
      "text": "A killer who stabbed three men to death in a Reading park has been handed a whole-life jail term.\nKhairi Saadallah murdered James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and 39-year-old Joe Ritchie-Bennett, in June last year in Forbury Gardens.\nLondon's Old Bailey previously heard the 26-year-old \"executed\" the men as an \"act of religious jihad\".\nPassing sentence Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said it was a \"ruthless and brutal\" terror attack.\nSaadallah, who admitted the murders, had also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of three other men who were also in the park.\nThe judge said the victims \"had no chance to react, let alone defend themselves\".\nHe said he was sure the attack \"involved a substantial degree of premeditation or planning\" and was carried out \"for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause\".\nBBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson, who was in court, said the families of James Furlong and David Wails were present, while Joseph Ritchie-Bennett's loved ones watched via a link from America.\nSaadallah showed no emotion as Mr Justice Sweeney went through his sentencing remarks. \nOn the afternoon of 20 June, the park was busy due to the first lockdown restrictions being relaxed in England. \nAndrew Cafe, who witnessed the stabbings, said he saw Saadallah wielding the \"biggest kitchen knife\" and charging towards him shouting \"Allahu Akbar\". \nPharmaceutical manager Mr Ritchie-Bennett and teacher Mr Furlong died from single stab wounds to their necks, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed once in the back. \nDespite treatment from paramedics and doctors, all three friends, who were members of the LGBT community, died at the scene.\nThree other people - Nishit Nisudan, Patrick Edwards and Stephen Young - were also injured, before Saadallah threw away the knife and fled the scene, pursued by police. \nFollowing his arrest, Saadallah initially said he wanted to plead guilty to the \"jihad that I done\", but the prosecution claimed he later feigned mental illness in police interviews.\nAt a previous hearing, the court heard he had developed an emotionally unstable and anti-social personality disorder, with his behaviour worsened by alcohol and cannabis misuse.\nBut the judge said it was \"clear that the defendant did not, and does not, have any major mental illness\". \nAn examination of Saadallah's phone revealed an interest in extremist material, including images of the flag of Islamic State and Jihadi John, the court previously heard. \nWhile at HMP Bullingdon in 2017, he was seen to associate with radical preacher Omar Brookes, who has connections with banned terrorist organisation Al-Muhajiroun. \nThe court heard Saadallah, who arrived in Britain from Libya in 2012, had previously been involved with militias who had been part of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, and was pictured handling weapons, including firearms.\nSince seeking asylum in Britain, he had been repeatedly arrested and convicted of various offences, including theft and assault, between 2013 and 2020.\nHe briefly came to the attention of MI5 in 2019, but the information provided did not meet the threshold of investigation.\nSaadallah had been released from prison on 5 June, days before the attack, the court heard.\nOn 17 June, he researched the location for his attack online and carried out reconnaissance in the park. \nThe following day his probation officer alerted his mental health team over comments he made about magic. \nA day later, Saadallah contacted the crisis team himself, but when they visited he did not answer. \nFollowing concerns from his brother, police visited the killer the same day, but he told officers he was \"alright\" while he stood near a knife he bought from a supermarket.\nAfter the sentencing, James Furlong's father, Gary, said: \"The secretary of state needs to tell us why this guy wasn't put into some form of detention centre before they could deport him. \n\"He was not safe to be released back on the streets.\"\nReferring to the fact that Saadallah had been visited by police the night before the attack, Mr Furlong said: \"Given the volume of crimes he's committed and the information that they had on him, for an assessment to be done the night before to say that he's not a danger to the public - it is beyond me.\"\nHe described Mr Furlong, originally from Liverpool, as \"a lovely man, loved by his family, idolised by his mother\".\nDavid Wails' brother Andrew said: \"For us as a family it's been devastating to lose our much loved son, brother and uncle.\"\nIn a statement, the Bennett family described Mr Ritchie-Bennett as a \"devoted and loving husband\" and \"a man who cared strongly about family\".\nDet Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, described Saadallah as \"a committed jihadist\".\nShe said: \"He has caused unspeakable hurt and distress to the families of the three men who were brutally murdered as they were relaxing and enjoying socialising with friends on a Saturday evening.\n\"I'm sure there will also be lasting effects on those who were injured in the attack, who were fortunate not to have been even more seriously harmed.\"\nReading Borough Council leader Jason Brock described the attacks as \"horrific\" and \"senseless\" and said a permanent memorial to the victims was planned."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has been criticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Street to go cycling during lockdown. \nThe Evening Standard reported the prime minister had been spotted in the Olympic Park in East London on Sunday.\nGovernment advice allows people to exercise outside, but says you should not travel outside your local area.\nA No 10 spokesman would not confirm if Mr Johnson had been driven to the park or cycled there, but said the PM had complied with Covid-19 guidelines.\nLabour's Andy Slaughter said: \"Once again it is do as I say, not as I do, from the prime minister.\"\nThe Hammersmith MP added: \"London has some of the highest infection rates in the country. Boris Johnson should be leading by example.\"\nIn response to the criticism, a Downing Street source told the BBC: \"The PM has exercised within the Covid rules and any suggestion to the contrary is wrong.\"\nA woman told the PA news agency she had seen the prime minister in the park: \"He was leisurely cycling with another guy with a beanie hat and chatting, while around four security guys, possibly more, cycled behind them.\n\"Considering the current situation with Covid I was shocked to see him cycling around looking so care-free. \n\"Also, considering he's advising everyone to stay at home and not leave their area, shouldn't he stay in Westminster and not travel to other boroughs?\"\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock was asked at Monday's Downing Street press conference whether travelling seven miles for a cycle ride was within the rules.\nMr Hancock said: \"It is OK, if you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles from home, that is OK, but you should stay local.\n\"It is OK to go for a long walk or a cycle ride or to exercise, but stay local.\"\nThe issue of travelling for exercise was highlighted at the weekend after two women said they were surrounded by police and fine \u00a3200 after driving five miles from home to take a walk. \nDerbyshire Police have now dropped the fine and apologised to the women, but the incident led to a debate over the guidance. \nGovernment advice for England says you can leave your home to exercise, but adds: \"This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area.\"\nThe guidance adds: \"Stay local means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live.\"\nIn Scotland, the advice is more precise, saying exercise can be taken if it \"starts and finishes at the same place, which can be up to five miles from the boundary of your local authority area\".\nFormer Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, who represents a constituency in the Lake District, has written to the PM calling for clearer guidance on exercise similar to that in Scotland.\nHe wrote: \"On the one hand, our local police force here in Cumbria are reporting that people... have travelled hundreds of miles to take their exercise in the Lake District.\n\"And on the other hand, I have constituents writing to me, worried whether they will be punished for driving five minutes up the road to go for a walk in their local park.\"\nMr Farron added: \"We need a solution that clearly deters people from making lengthy trips and potentially spreading the virus, but also that doesn't discourage people from keeping fit and healthy.\""

To support our colleagues, we will have additional security in stores to help manage this.\"\nAn Asda spokesman said if customers had forgotten their face coverings, it would continue to offer them one free of charge. \nBut he added: \"Should a customer refuse to wear a covering without a valid medical reason and be in any way challenging to our colleagues about doing so, our security colleagues will refuse their entry.\"\nAndrew Murphy, executive director of operations at Waitrose, said: \"We've listened carefully to the clear change in tone and emphasis of the views and information shared by the UK's governments in recent days. \n\"By insisting on the wearing of face coverings, over and above the social distancing measures we already have in place, we aim to make our shops even safer for customers.\"\nOn Tuesday, Sainsbury's told the BBC it did not have the power to deny entry to shoppers without masks. However, trials showed customers complied more when asked to wear masks by security guards at the door, it said.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Sainsbury's boss, Simon Roberts, said \"we are not going to ban customers\".\nBut he urged shoppers to wear a mask and shop alone. \n\"By doing that we will help keep everybody safe,\" he said.\nThe Co-op also said it would not ban shoppers without masks from entering, and instead urged customers to take responsibility for wearing a face covering when visiting its stores, as it was mandatory by law. \nBoss of Co-op Food Jo Whitfield said: \"We've increased our in-store messaging to remind customers and government guidance does state that the police can take measures if members of the public don't comply with this law.\"\nIceland said it would take a similar approach, adding the vast majority of its customers continued to shop in compliance with the law. \n\"In view of the rising tide of abuse and violence being directed at our store colleagues, we do not expect them to confront the small minority of customers who aggressively refuse to comply with the law,\" a spokesman added. \nIn England, the police can issue a \u00a3200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a \u00a360 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines."

He died on 9 March 2021, aged 67. \nHis colleagues thought highly of him, saying: \"We have many happy memories of shifts together, laughs, nights out, and listening to all his stories of his many holidays abroad. We will miss him.\"\nBernadette White, his sister, said he was a caring, gentle and loving man with a wicked sense of humour. \nShe added: \"The last seven years, I would say, is when David started to live his life, doing the things that made him happy without having to worry about anyone else.\"\nStephen Stewart met his future wife, Heather, at a youth club when he was just 14. They got engaged on his 17th birthday and he had just turned 20 when they married. \nThe couple, who lived in Motherwell, came from \"very different\" backgrounds but they grew up together during their 25-year marriage while raising their only child. \nStephen took pride in his work for concrete manufacturer FP McCann, latterly as a lab technician working out what strength the concrete needed to be for certain projects. \nOutside work, he loved fishing, computer games, gadgets and during the first lockdown he managed to build a hot tub shelter with the help of a series of YouTube videos. \nHe died of Covid pneumonia at University Hospital Wishaw on 19 February 2021, aged 45.\nFamily of 45-year-old Covid victim warn of dangers\nNan Douglas worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. \nShe was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. \nAfter losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. \nFollowing a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a \"living wake\" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. \nShe lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she picked up Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. \nGraeme McGrath's greatest passions were rowing and the River Clyde. \nOn the day of his funeral, fellow rowers held oars in a guard of honour at Glasgow Green in a tribute appreciated by his wife Anne and their three sons.\nFor 40 years Graeme volunteered with the Glasgow Humane Society and was often called on to row rescue boats on the Clyde, or to help evacuate families during floods. \nAfter undergoing a kidney transplant in his 50s, he was unable to get out on the river as much. He retired from his job as a Thomas Cook travel agent and moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire. \nBut he still felt the pull of the Clyde and regularly returned to the city to meet friends and row safety boats at regattas. \nHe died with Covid on 15 February 2021 at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, aged 66, after being admitted for an infection affecting his heart. \nTommy Morrow spent most of his life in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, where he met his partner Jackie and raised their children, Demi and Mark. \nHis family described him as a character and not a day went by without them laughing at his jokes. \nHe loved camping and fishing in places like Stornoway with his friends but the most important people in his life were his family, including grandchildren, Lacey and Louden. \nDuring his career he worked in various well-known hotels and restaurants in Glasgow but he had not worked for some years due to poor health, including COPD. \nHe died with Covid on 15 February 2021, aged 53. \"It was so cruel - he was so close to getting the vaccine,\" his family said. \nTommy Rooney was a bus driver for 36 years and hugely popular with colleagues at First Bus in Larbert. \nOn the day of his funeral they were among dozens of people who lined the streets and applauded as his cortege passed the depot. \nFirst Bus operations manager Jason Hackett told the Falkirk Herald that Tommy was the \"heart and soul\" of the Larbert station. \nMarried to Margaret, the Bonnybridge man had two daughters and a granddaughter who described him as a \"humble but proud family man who put everyone else's needs before his own\". \nAn avid Celtic fan, he spent much of the pandemic driving key workers to their essential duties.

      "title": "Capitol riots: Trump says his speech was totally appropriate",
      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump",
      "text": "US President Donald Trump has said his speech before last week's deadly Capitol riot, when he urged his supporters to march on Congress, was \"totally appropriate\".\nMr Trump dismissed as \"ridiculous\" efforts by Democrats in Congress to impeach him for inciting insurrection.\nHe leaves office on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in.\nThe House of Representatives is expected to vote on an article of impeachment on Wednesday. \n\"I think it's [the impeachment procedure] causing tremendous danger to our country and it's causing tremendous anger. I want no violence,\" Mr Trump said. \nHe was speaking as he left the White House for a visit to Texas to inspect a section of the border wall with Mexico. It was his first public appearance since the violence at the Capitol, in which five people died and dozens of people were injured, including at least 60 police officers.  \nDuring his speech at the rally in Washington on 6 January, Mr Trump repeated his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud during the 3 November presidential election and urged his supporters to march on Congress. \n\"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength,\" he told the crowd of several thousand supporters. \nHe said Vice-President Mike Pence should have \"the courage to do what he has to do\", claiming without foundation that Mr Pence had the constitutional power to overturn the votes which were being formally tallied in Congress that day. \n\"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,\" Mr Trump said. \nDozens of people have since been detained in connection with last week's violence. Of the five who lost their lives, one was a police officer and one was a rioter shot dead by police.\nMeanwhile, a third US lawmaker has said he has Covid-19 after sheltering with maskless Republicans in a safe room during the events of 6 January.\nThe House of Representatives will vote on Tuesday to ask Mr Pence to invoke the 25th amendment to the constitution to remove Mr Trump from office - an idea Mr Pence is said to oppose. \nThat vote is expected to fail, and so the House will then consider an article of impeachment against Mr Trump for \"incitement of insurrection\". \nDemocrats have the majority in the House, so the impeachment vote is likely to pass. If it does, Mr Trump will become the first president in US history to be impeached twice. \nHowever, the impeachment will only lead to his removal from office if a two-thirds majority votes in favour of his conviction in the Senate.\nThat would need the assent of a substantial number of Republicans and so far, few have shown any willingness to vote against a president from their own party. \nSpeaking on his visit to Texas, Mr Trump brushed off the threat of removal from office under the constitution.\n\"The 25th amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration,\" he said. \nAccording to the New York Times, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has told confidants he is pleased Democrats want to impeach the president.\nThe Kentucky senator believes the punishment will make it easier to cleanse Mr Trump from the Republican party, reports the newspaper.\nMr McConnell has also told associates he believes the president committed impeachable offences, reports the Washington Post.\nNeither Mr McConnell nor his Republican counterpart in the House, Kevin McCarthy, plan to whip votes for or against impeachment, according to US media.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, one of the most senior House Republicans, Liz Cheney, said she would vote to impeach Mr Trump.\nThe Wyoming representative said in a statement: \"There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.\"\nMs Cheney, the number three Republican in the lower chamber and the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, said Mr Trump had \"summoned this mob, assembled the mob, lit the flame of this attack\".\nTrump almost never shies away from a fight. He didn't on Tuesday, either. When asked about his incendiary speech to supporters outside the White House last week - the one many allege helped incite a riot - he did not apologise. Instead, he lashed out at his critics and cast himself as a victim. \nThe Democrats, he said, were the problem. Their effort at impeachment, he explained, was \"causing tremendous danger to our country\", along with \"tremendous anger\". It was vintage Trump. \nIn his final days, he is relying on a strategy borrowed from his beloved sport, mixed martial arts, to defend himself: throw quick punches and duck. Meanwhile in the West Wing, offices are emptying, cardboard boxes are lying on the floor next to people's desks, and aides are leaving in droves.\nCalls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots in Congress.\nThe FBI is warning of armed protests in all 50 states by right-wing extremists ahead of Mr Biden's inauguration. Up to 15,000 National Guard troops will be deployed in Washington DC for the event. \nThe leaders of the US military's different branches, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, issued a message describing the riots as a direct assault on Congress and the constitution, Reuters news agency and CNN report. \nThe message said Mr Biden would be inaugurated on 20 January and warned service members: \"Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law.\""

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: When will I be vaccinated against the virus?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus vaccination campaign is now well under way in Scotland, and we have a good idea of how plans to deploy the vaccine are shaping up. \nThe Scottish government has said the first two priority groups - including care home staff and residents, frontline health workers and over-80s in the community - would have had their first jab by 5 February. \nThose aged 70 and over will be vaccinated by mid-February.\nPeople aged over 65 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be vaccinated by early March.\nThis covers the first five of the nine priority groups, which is just over 1.4 million people.\nThree vaccines have now been approved by UK regulators - those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna. \nThey have been purchased by the UK government and Scotland will get a share of them, based on its population. \nCurrent modelling indicates that Scotland will have the capacity to deliver about 400,000 vaccinations a week from the end of February.  \nGP practices, health centres and local clinics have already been delivering vaccinations.\nFrom Monday 1 February, mass vaccination centres, including Edinburgh International Conference Centre (EICC) and Aberdeen's P&J LIVE at TECA, will be in operation. \nThe Scottish government said the EICC will have capacity to vaccinate more than 21,000 people a week at 45 stations. \nThe centre in Aberdeen will start with 20 booths, vaccinating around 6000 people weekly. \nThe NHS Louisa Jordan mass vaccination centre in Glasgow has been operating since 8 December, carrying out 1,000 to 5,000 vaccinations daily. The facility has the capacity to move to 10,000 per day.\nOther large centres will operate at Ravenscraig Sports Facility in Motherwell and Queen Margaret University in Musselburgh - as well as at leisure centres and town halls. \nCentres were planning initially to be opened seven days from 08:00 to 22:00, but that could be extended.\nIt won't be practical for everyone in Scotland to travel to receive their vaccine. \nSo, in some remote communities, a mobile vaccination unit will be set up to offer immunisations. \nIn this case, public health officials say they will likely make one trip to the area and vaccinate everyone in the priority group at once - which might mean someone lower down the priority list will get vaccinated earlier than they would had they lived in an urban area.  \nOne plan public health officials are looking at is using mobile libraries to deliver vaccines in remote communities. \nThe hope is to have people aged 50 and over vaccinated by the start of May.\nThe number of injections vaccinators will administer will be dependent on supply - so there might not be a smooth increase in how many people have received their immunisation. \nQuite quickly it's expected the number of injections given to begin increasing. \nThat's because initially things were very focused on getting those in care homes vaccinated first. \nBecause the vaccine had to be taken to the homes, it has taken a longer time to get through than if the same number of people had been able to turn up at a mass vaccination site. \nBy the autumn everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 should have been offered one of the Covid vaccinations. That's 4.4 million people. \nBut this will depend entirely on supplies - and just now, public health experts say they only know how many doses they can expect until June. \nFrom March, a second stream of second doses of the vaccinations will also be getting under way as the latest guidance is that the second jab should be received up to 12 weeks after the first. \nThere are no plans to make vaccinations mandatory.\nThe UK government is ordering vaccines on behalf of the four nations, and the supply is then be divided up between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland on the basis of population. \nScotland's share of the UK's vaccine supply equates to its 8.2% share of the UK population.\nThe UK government has secured early access to more than 400 million doses of experimental vaccines.\nThere are more than enough supplies of approved vaccines to give every adult in the UK both doses. \nData suggests that whilst the efficacy of both vaccines is optimised when a second dose is administered, they offer considerable protection after a single dose, at least in the short term.  \nSo the new plan is for more people to be given a first dose, rather than holding back stock to administer down the line as second doses. \nEveryone should still receive a second dose within 12 weeks of the first. \nTrials of the Oxford vaccine, which was developed by British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca and Oxford University, show it stops an average of 70% of people developing Covid symptoms.\nNobody who was given the vaccine in the trial developed severe disease or needed hospital treatment. \nThere is also data that suggests adjusting the dose could increase protection up to 90%. \nThis vaccine takes a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees and genetically modifies it to resemble coronavirus to try to provoke an immune response.\nThe manufacturers of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine say the jab could prevent 95% of people from becoming ill with Covid-19.\nIt is what's known as an RNA vaccine - a new type of technology. It involves injecting part of the virus' genetic code into the body to train the immune system.\nAntibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus.\nThere were fears that the requirement for it to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures would pose problems in getting it to care homes or to remote communities. \nHowever, it has since transpired that the vaccine can be moved around in an unfrozen state for up to 12 hours and can be stored undiluted for up to five days.\nThe Moderna vaccine is an RNA vaccine, like Pfizer's, which uses part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response.\nIt requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer.\nSeveral other vaccines are in the final testing stage, and more results from other teams working on advanced trials are also expected in the coming weeks and months.\nThe JCVI has said it does not have a preference for one vaccine above the other, but it's unlikely you'll get to choose which you get. \nThat depends on a number of factors - what is available, where you are being vaccinated, and what we know about how the vaccines work by the time you are being vaccinated. \nThe Scottish government has said that it will be distributing supplies so that they can offer the most \"extensive and timely\" coverage possible, so for that reason \"one vaccine may be offered in certain settings over another\".\nAnd scientists will be studying the efficacy of the injections as people are given them, and it may well turn out that different vaccines suit different parts of the population. \nSo, it may be that what vaccine you get is dependent on your age or where you live, for example. But it is early days - we'll learn more in the months ahead. \nPublic health officials said when the Pfizer jab was approved that pregnant and breastfeeding women should not be given the injection, due to the limited amount of data available on its use within that group.\nHowever, the regulator has since updated its advice to say that when the potential benefits outweigh the risks, the decision can be made for the woman to be vaccinated. \nFor the Oxford vaccine, the advice is the same - it can be administered when the potential benefits outweigh the risk. \nMost children aged 18 and under will not get the Pfizer vaccine. This is because not enough research on using this vaccine on children has been carried out yet. \nAnd, so far, the Oxford vaccine has only been approved for those over 18.  \nRegulators initially said that people with a history of significant allergic reactions should not have the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab. \nBut they have now said they have received further assurances, and that those with allergies to food or other medicines or vaccines can have this injection. \nHowever, anyone with a history of allergic reaction to this vaccine or any of its ingredients should not receive this injection. \nThe Oxford vaccine can also be given to those with allergies to other medicines or food. \nAgain, it's only those with a known history of reacting to any of its ingredients who should not have it. \nAnyone who has previously reacted to a vaccine should speak to their doctor first.

      "tags": "Schools,Gavin Williamson",
      "text": "An extra 300,000 laptops and tablets have been bought to help disadvantaged children in England learn at home, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.\nMr Williamson said the devices would be delivered to schools.\nHe also pledged to publish a remote education framework to support schools and colleges with delivering lessons during the latest national lockdown.\nIt comes as research says children from poorer families are likely to struggle more with remote learning.\nThe Department for Education said its data showed that over 700,000 devices had been delivered to schools in England so far during the pandemic - 100,000 of which were delivered last week.\nThe department says the additional 300,000 laptops and tablets lifts government investment by another \u00a3100m, meaning over \u00a3400m will have been invested in supporting disadvantaged children who need help with access to technology during the pandemic.\nBut the department has faced mounting criticism over huge percentages of pupils not having access to digital devices, nine months into the pandemic.\nMr Williamson said the DfE was \"doing everything in our power to support schools with high-quality remote education\".\nHe said: \"These additional devices, on top of the 100,000 delivered last week, add to the significant support we are making available to help schools deliver high-quality online learning, as we know they have been doing.\"\nOn top of this, the remote education framework would support schools and colleges with delivering education for pupils who are learning from home, he said.\nThe frameworks, which are voluntary and should be adapted for schools' individual circumstances, will \"help them to identify the strengths and areas for improvement in the lessons and teaching they provide remotely\".\nBut Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said:  \"While we welcome the extra laptops and tablets announced, it is pretty poor that nearly a year after this crisis began we are only now inching up to the number of devices that are needed.\n\"The reality is that this extra provision is coming when we are already well into the new lockdown and after a heavily disrupted autumn term in which many children had to self-isolate in line with coronavirus protocols,\" he said.\n \"The government was slow off the mark to address the digital divide early in the crisis and is now trying to make up for lost time.\"\nMr Williamson's laptop announcement comes as research by the University of Sussex found that nearly one in five less advantaged parents said they struggled with home-learning during the first lockdown.\nThe research surveyed 3,409 parents in the UK between 5 May until 31 July last year and found  families of lower socioeconomic status were more likely to report their home environment made it harder for pupils to complete schoolwork from home.\nThe study says secondary school pupils eligible for free school meals (39%) were more likely to report that a lack of technology - such as laptops and computers - made learning from home more difficult, compared to 19% of pupils who are not eligible for free school meals.\nPrimary school pupils from struggling households were found to be more likely to find home learning learning harder than their more comfortable off peers due to the environment - such as noise levels (59% to 50%), lack of space (45% to 22%), lack of technology (45% to 26%) and lack of internet (35% to 16%).\nThe researchers warned that educational inequalities were likely to increase due to further school closures this year.\nLead researcher Dr Matthew Easterbrook said: \"These results show that school closures disproportionately disrupt the education of those who are most economically disadvantaged, suggesting that educational inequalities are likely to rise because of the pandemic.\n\"The results show that parents of pupils from disadvantaged families - those who are eligible for free school meals, who have lower levels of education, or who are financially struggling - are much more likely to report that learning from home is challenging.\"\nReport co-author Lewis Doyle, doctoral researcher at the University of Sussex, added: \"School closures, while clearly necessary during this public health crisis, risk entrenching inequality.\"\nOn Tuesday the government also published figures on how many pupils were physically in schools across England before the Christmas holidays.\nThe data shows 79% of pupils in state schools were in class on Wednesday16 December - down from 85% on Thursday 10 December.\nIn secondary schools, attendance fell from 80% to 72% on 16 December, while  pupil attendance in primary schools fell from 89% to 86%, the figures show.\nBetween 9% and 11% of pupils - up to 872,000 children - did not attend school for Covid-19 related reasons on  16  December.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Poverty,Schools,Department for Education,UK government,State schools,Marcus Rashford,Child poverty,Free school meals",
      "text": "The company at the centre of an outcry over the size of food parcels going to the poorest pupils while schools are in lockdown in England has apologised.\nMarcus Rashford sought a meeting with the firm, Chartwells, after seeing a photo of the measly parcel on Twitter.\nThe post, by someone calling herself Roadside Mum, was picked up by news outlets which then quizzed Downing Street officials about it.\nSome hours later the firm agreed the parcel had fallen short on quantity.\nFood parcels are currently being sent to school children in England who would normally get free school meals.\nThe mother, who posted the photo of two carrots, two potatoes and a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items, said she calculated the cost to be only about \u00a35. \nIt was retweeted 15,000 times on Twitter and received 36,000 likes.\nThe mother, who does not want to be identified, had thought it was supposed to last 10 school days and should have been worth \u00a330.\nChartwells said it was actually only intended to last one school week, but acknowledged it was insufficient.\nIt said in a statement: \"For clarity, this shows five days of free school lunches (not 10 days) and the charge for food, packing and distribution was actually \u00a310.50 and not \u00a330 as suggested. \n\"However, in our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.\"\nIt added that its \"10-day hampers\" typically included a wide variety of nutritious food items to support the provision of lunches for children. \nMarcus Rashford had shared images of what appeared to be food parcels, saying they were \"not good enough\", that children should not go hungry and that \"we must do better\" - and he asked for a meeting with Chartwells.\nThis prompted Downing Street to say it was \"completely unacceptable\", and that the parcels should be healthy and sufficient for the task.  \nChildren's minister Vicky Ford then began an investigation.\nA spokesman for Chartwells, which is owned by Compass group, said the firm would further enhance its food parcels following the Department for Education's additional allowance of \u00a33.50 per week per child, in line with nutritional guidelines.\nThe DfE, which has clear guidelines for parcels, will shortly be opening a similar voucher scheme to the one operational during the first school lockdown.\nDuring the lockdown, schools have been told to continue providing free meals for those who are learning at home and have currently been urged to use their usual caterers to offer food parcels.\nIf schools cannot provide parcels, they can consider other arrangements which might include vouchers for local shops and supermarkets.\nThe post prompted others to complain about the quality and quantity of the food in the parcels. \nMother-of-three Kerry Wilks, from Redcar in north-east England, received a package at her youngest child's school containing a loaf of bread, three yoghurts, a tin of beans, tuna, two potatoes, four pieces of fruit and two slices of cheese.\n\"Even the teaching staff were quite embarrassed by giving them out,\" Ms Wilks, 38, said.\n\"I think what's really bugged me about it is the fact that there's two pieces of square cheese wrapped in cling film - I just find it so degrading.\"\nElaine Stacey, 41, from Reading, said she received a loaf of bread, weighed-out pasta in a sandwich bag, three jelly pots and a jar of Dolmio sauce to feed her 17-year-old son for a week. \nThe parcel fell so short of what he needed that she said she was having to give up food herself so he would have enough.\nChef Wayne Sullivan, who lives in the Cotswolds and has three school-age children, criticised school food more generally, saying he has been collecting packed lunches from his two boys' school daily and was \"horrified\" by the contents.\nMr Sullivan, a former MasterChef contestant, told the BBC: \"There's probably about 55p worth of food. It's not been prepared with any care or attention, and nutritionally it's not balanced.\"\nJack Monroe, food campaigner and chef, said the government should reinstate the voucher system \"that gave people dignity\" and allowed people to make choices about what they could feed themselves and their children \"in these difficult times\".\nMeanwhile, some head teachers have been going to extraordinary lengths to make sure their pupils can eat.\nZane Powles, assistant head teacher at Western Primary School in Grimsby, said the night after the school lockdown was announced he went to the supermarket to get \"all our packed lunches for the next two days\".\nWhat he bought was \"much better\" and cheaper than what he gets from the company he uses, he said.\nA spokesman for Laca, the professional body for catering managers in schools, said it was \"disappointed\" to see the pictures of food parcels, adding they did not meet the standards.\nAfter his meeting with Chartwells, Rashford said: \"One thing that is clear is that there was very little communication with the suppliers that a national lockdown was coming. \n\"We MUST do better. Children shouldn't be going hungry on the basis that we aren't communicating or being transparent with plans. That is unacceptable.\"\nReacting to the initial images, Sir Keir Starmer tweeted that the food appeared to be \"woefully inadequate\" and said it needed \"sorting immediately\".\nAnne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner, criticised the food parcels posted online and called on companies to provide \"real food and real amounts that will really help families\".\n\"Children need nutritious food for their lunch that helps them learn and keeps them warm in winter. Some lunch boxes I've seen are great but they all should be and there are too many examples of very poor ones on view today that are paltry, cheap and demeaning,\" she said.\nChildren's minister Vicky Ford said: \"Food parcels should cover all lunchtime meals and be nutritious.\n\"We've increased funding for parcels and will support local vouchers - national voucher also rolling out ASAP, working night and day on this.\" \nThe DfE says it will open a national scheme to provide supermarket vouchers via an online portal \"as soon as possible\".\nSource: Department for Education\nRashford has been a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals and brought about several U-turns on the provision of food during the school holidays.\nIn Wales, free school meals during the holidays has been extended by a year, and the Northern Ireland Executive made a pledge in November to provide free school meals in holidays until Easter 2022.\nIn Scotland - where holiday provision is currently promised up to Easter 2021 - both the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives have pledged to fund free school meals for all primary school pupils during term-time and holidays if they win the 2021 Scottish election."

      "tags": "Spain,France,Germany,Sweden,Coronavirus vaccines,Russia,Czech Republic,Coronavirus pandemic,Belgium",
      "text": "A global race is on to vaccinate people against Covid-19 - and with infections soaring in Europe many have complained that the roll-out is too slow in the EU.\nMember states decide individually who to vaccinate, when and where, but the EU is coordinating strategy and buying vaccines in bulk. On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021.\nBBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch.\nIn an election year, the vaccine has become a political battleground, writes Jenny Hill, in Berlin.\nThe fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation.\nA recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground.\nVaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than 477,000 first doses had been administered. \nBut some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses.\nMuch of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order.\nGermany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. \nMr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand.\nGermany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer.\nThe Czech prime minister has hit out at apparent delays in distributing the vaccine, writes Rob Cameron, in Prague.\nThe Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager.\nBut the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. \"We believed when we contributed \u20ac12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,\" he told a newspaper this week.\nThe country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to 19,918 people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. \nIt has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature.\nHowever, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer.\nA sluggish start is being blamed on bureaucracy and vaccine scepticism, writes Hugh Schofield, in Paris.\nFrance's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to 45,500 - still so small as to be statistically meaningless.  \nSo why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used.\nThe primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. \nEach recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives.\nAnother problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers.\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings.\nPolitically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a \"state scandal\", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free.\nNational pride accelerated Russia's rollout, but one man is conspicuously absent from the list of people vaccinated, writes Sarah Rainsford, in Moscow. \nRussia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity.\nSputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded.\nA poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week that more than a million people had been vaccinated.\nBut one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown.\nRussia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped.\nAs infection rates grow in a country praised by many for its no-lockdown approach, a successful vaccine programme is crucial writes Maddy Savage, in Stockholm.\nAlmost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is still no official tally of how many others have received the vaccination. \nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains \"feasible\". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. \nAlongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February.\nSwedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine.\nA successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. \nMeanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands.\nA new government in Belgium seems unified on the vaccine rollout - for now at least, writes Nick Beake, in Brussels.\nIt seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further 700 elderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial.\nThe mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be \"seamless and fast\", tweeting: \"If that does not work, shoot me.\"\nThe first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September.\nYou may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed.\nAfter getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its \"careful\" approach.\nAnd there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. \nIn a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least.\nRegional variances and political rows have marked the beginning of Spain's vaccination programme writes Guy Hedgecoe, in Madrid.\nSpain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with 277,976 people vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. \nEach of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. \nGovernment data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. \nAlthough vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination.\nHowever, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. \nThe arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by \"political affiliations or parliamentary needs\", a claim the central government has rejected. \nFigures correct as of 17:00 GMT."

      "text": "Supermarket workers are facing abuse for challenging shoppers not wearing masks during the pandemic, staff say.\nOne Mold supermarket worker said she was challenging people every day and seeing \"loads of people walking around\" the store without masks and in groups.\nThe Welsh Government has hinted rules will be tightened amid concerns Covid-19 rules are not being followed.\n\"This is not a social event, come in on your own, not as a family of five,\" the supermarket worker said.\nSupermarket workers spoke to BBC Radio Wales as Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the \"onus\" was on supermarkets to make sure shoppers abided by the rules.\nThere has been an \"escalation of abuse\" towards supermarket staff in the last nine months, and the role of policing such rules must not fall on those on the shop floor, Nick Ireland Divisional Officer of the Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) said.\nHe said measures in stores had \"rolled back\", with many no longer enforcing systems, and people walking the wrong way down one-way systems, and \"whole families\" shopping with just one basket.\nMeanwhile Bally Auluk, an area organiser in Cardiff and Barry for Usdaw, said abuse towards shopworkers was happening on \"a daily and weekly basis\".\nHe said retailers and the Welsh Government should \"start protecting shop workers\" after dealing with members himself who were \"threatened with physical violence and spat on\".\n\"Customers now are treating it almost like it was last year, that it's not a problem, that is where the big issues arises,\" he said.\nMorrisons and Sainsbury's had pledged to challenge shoppers not wearing face coverings in store, unless they have a medical exemption.\nTesco, Asda and Waitrose are the latest supermarkets to follow the move and challenge those who flout the rules.\nUnder coronavirus rules, people must wear face coverings in order to enter shops across the UK, while supermarkets should have social distancing and strict hygiene measures in place.\nThe Welsh Government has been in talks with retailers on how to improve safety and return to the strict observance of social distancing from the first lockdown, although no new guidance has been issued. \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said he had heard concerns from people \"expressing anxiety\" about a lack of \"visible protections\" in supermarkets, such as limited numbers allowed in store, hand sanitiser and security on doors.\nThe Mold supermarket worker said staff had been told not to challenge people not wearing masks, and had seen people being yelled at.\nJane, who did not give her last name, told BBC Wales customers were offered a mask on the way in, but many did not want them.\n\"You do see a lot of customers walking around without a mask on,\" she said.\n\"Of course there are people with hidden disabilities who can't wear a mask but there can't be that many of them.\"\nJane said enforcement needed to be greater, but it should not be led by the shopfloor staff.\"We're told not to challenge people as we don't know someone's personal situation and we don't want to face any abuse if they don't want to wear it or don't agree with it,\" she said.\n\"At the moment people will ask politely, but I have witnessed quite a few occasions where customers have been verbally abusive to the person greeting them on their way in. \n\"There needs to be someone enforcing this, it can't be left to retail staff: whether its a police officer or a security guard.\"\nOne security guard at a supermarket in Aberdare said he had had more \"hassle\" working in the past 10 months at the store, than from drinkers while working as a nightclub doorman for more than 20 years.\n\"The attitude towards yourself... they don't appreciate that you're standing there for 12 hours a day, they don't understand how hard it is to try and keep people distancing,\" he told Dot Davies on BBC Radio Wales.\n\"When they go inside the shop it all goes out the window... we keep the two metres outside, but we've got people coming outside to tell us we should be in there sorting it out.\"\nOne supermarket manager said the lengths people were going to in order to shop together were \"ridiculous\", with families coming in with a number of trolleys or baskets in order not to be challenged.\n\"We've seen families turning up to go shopping for a basket shop, it's just not on,\" said Mr Ireland, who called on supermarket staff to be prioritised for vaccines.\nHe suggested those who do not observe the rules should be banned and fined.\nBut one mother said that she had no choice but to shop with her children, and she had been unable to get a click and collect or delivery slot.\n\"It's easy to get caught up in the fear of it, but some people are at the shops as they have no choice,\" she said. \nOthers have spoken of shop staff themselves not wearing masks.\nJames Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said it was \"everyone's responsibility\" to abide by the rules, rather than for shop workers to enforce.\n\"Doing that [enforcement of rules] in a small store, where you don't have lots of colleagues around, has been a trigger for more abuse and even violence,\" he said.\nMr Lowman said making businesses Covid secure was down to the local authority, while individuals' behaviour was a matter for police, but \"in practicality\" it is everyone's responsibility.\nBut Mr Gething said the \"onus\" for getting shoppers to follow Covid-19 rules, such as wearing masks, social-distancing and cordoning off non-essential items, was on the supermarket managers.\n\"[It needs to be made] clear that you do need to wear a mask unless you can demonstrate that you have a particular exemption,\" he said.\n\"I don't think there's any lack of understanding. We've been through this before and I do think a number of supermarkets are going to go and make clear there are a range of items that are off-limits for shoppers coming in.\n\"Supermarkets understand what they need to do.\""

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's first minister has said the country's current lockdown is \"very unlikely\" to be lifted at the end of the month.\nNicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed that more than 5,000 people have now died after testing positive for the virus.\nA review of the current restrictions is due to be carried out at the end of January.\nMs Sturgeon said it was possible that there would be no easing at that point. \nA further 54 deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours - bringing the total by that measure to 5,023.\nBut the most recent figures from the National Records of Scotland - which record all deaths registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate - put the total at 6,686.\nMs Sturgeon told her daily briefing that the figures were a reminder of the toll the virus had taken.\nAnd she said every death had caused heartbreak to friends, families and loved ones across the country. \nThe first minister also said Scotland's NHS would be under far greater pressure if the current restrictions had not been put in place on Boxing Day. \nAnd she urged people not to raise their expectations about what will be announced when the lockdown review is completed in a fortnight as wholesale lifting of the restrictions was \"very unlikely\".\nShe added: \"There may not even be any lifting of these restrictions as soon as the end of January - we will have to consider all of that carefully and set it out in due course.\"\nAll of mainland Scotland and some islands were placed into level four restrictions on 26 December, with schools remaining closed to most pupils until at least the end of the month. \nA further 1,875 positive cases of the virus were recorded on Monday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 153,423.\nThe number of people in hospital with the virus stands at 1,717 - an increase of 53 since yesterday and higher than the peak of about 1,500 in the first wave in April.\nOf these, 133 patients are intensive care units, with Ms Sturgeon saying that the virus was putting \"very acute pressure\" on hospitals. \nThe first minister also said that 175,942 people in Scotland had received their first vaccine dose by Monday.\nOpposition parties have claimed that the rollout of the vaccine has been \"sluggish\" in Scotland compared to south of the border - a charge that the government denies. \nAnd they have called for greater transparency over how many people are being given the jab every day.\nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman said on Monday that the government was aiming to vaccinate about 560,000 people in Scotland by 31 January.\nThe Scottish government has previously said it is concerned that too many people have not been following the \"stay at home\" rules that are in place across the whole of the mainland and some islands. \nMinisters have been discussing the possibility of imposing tougher rules on click and collect shopping and takeaway food, with an announcement expected to be made on Wednesday.\nRetail industry representatives have described click and collect services as a \"lifeline\" for struggling businesses amid the forced closure of all non-essential shops.\nAnd they said they had not been shown any evidence that click and collect was driving transmission of the virus. \nMs Sturgeon told her daily coronavirus briefing that the government may not stop click and collect services altogether. \nBut she added: \"If we are saying to people right now that you should not be out of your home for shopping unless it is essential, then do we need to have click and collect for non-essential services instead of having that for delivery?\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Scotland that he did not want to see further restrictions put in place unless there was evidence that they would have the desired effect. \nHe also suggested that restricting click and collect would simply result in more people going back into supermarkets to do their shopping. \nThe Scottish government is also under pressure to lift the the current ban on public Sunday worship, with a group of 500 church leaders from across the UK - including 200 in Scotland - insisting that there is \"no evidence of any tangible contribution to community transmission through churches in Scotland\".\nIn a letter to the first minister, they claim that the ban may be unlawful and accuse the government of failing to understand that \"Christian worship is an essential public service, and especially vital to our nation in a time of crisis\".\nA Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"Test and Protect tells us where people were in their 48-hour infectious period.\n\"So we know that on one day last week the seven-day number for places of worship was 120, and data from yesterday shows the seven-day number for places of worship is 38, underlining the essential decision to require places of worship to close for public health reasons.\"\nMeanwhile, it has been confirmed that everyone arriving in Scotland from overseas will need to show proof of a negative test from Friday. \nThe test will need to be \"highly reliable\", the first minister said, and will need to have been from the previous three days - although young children may be exempt from the restriction. \nThose travelling from countries not on the quarantine exemption list will still need to self-isolate on arrival. \nThe new rules, which will also come into force in England, were first outlined last week.

      "text": "Retailers suffered their worst annual sales performance on record in 2020, driven by slump in demand for fashion and homeware products, figures show.\nWhile food sales growth rose 5.4% on 2019, non-food fell about 5%, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.\nIt meant an overall fall of 0.3% in a year dominated by the Covid-19 impact, the worst annual change since the BRC began collating the figures in 1995.\nChristmas offered little cheer, with much of the High Street still closed.\n\"Physical non-food stores, including all of non-essential retail, saw sales drop by a quarter compared with 2019,\" said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive.\n\"Christmas offered little respite for these retailers, as many shops were forced to shut during the peak trading period,\" she said.\nThe 5.4% rise in food sales was fuelled by shoppers flocking to supermarkets and online grocers to ensure they were stocked up during the pandemic.\nIn December, total retail sales increased by 1.8% as shoppers spent more in the run-up to Christmas. Like-for-like sales for the month were up 4.8% as overall shop takings were still affected by restrictions and temporary closures.\nOnline non-food sales jumped by 44.8% in December, according to the new figures, as a higher proportion of shopping took place online.\nThe BRC's sales monitor is collated with the consultancy KPMG, whose UK head of retail, Paul Martin, said: \"In the most important month for the retail industry, there was some positive growth due to the ongoing shift of expenditure from other categories such as travel and leisure.\n\"Once again we saw big swings in the types of products being purchased and the channels used for shopping, with much of the growth taking place online, where nearly half of all non-food purchases were made.\"\nBut he warned that the new lockdown would worsen conditions for many non-essential shops and the High Street generally.\nLast week, a report from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping.\nNearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, the CRR said."

      "tags": "Eyesight,Blindness and visual-impairment,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "An eye health charity is recommending people learn the \"20-20-20\" rule to protect their sight, as lockdown has increased people's time using screens. \nFight for Sight advises looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds, every 20 minutes you look at a screen.\nOut of 2,000 people, half used screens more since Covid struck and a third (38%) of those believed their eyesight had worsened, a survey suggested.\nOpticians remain open for those who need them, the charity said. \nThe representative survey of 2,000 adults suggested one in five were less likely to get an eye test now than before the pandemic, for fear of catching or spreading the virus. \nRespondents reported difficulty reading, as well as headaches and migraines and poorer night vision.\nThe research charity, which commissioned a survey from polling company YouGov, said it wanted to emphasise the importance of having regular eye tests and to remind people \"the majority of opticians are open for appointments throughout lockdown restrictions\".\nFight for Sight chief executive Sherine Krause said: \"More than half of all cases of sight loss are avoidable through early detection and prevention methods. Regular eye tests can often detect symptomless sight-threatening conditions.\" \nBut even simple screen breaks can help to prevent eye strain, the charity suggested.\nGovernment guidance states that under lockdown people can leave home for medical appointments and to \"avoid injury, illness or risk of harm\". \nThe College of Optometrists said its members should continue to provide eye care under lockdown for people who experience any eyesight changes or problems. \nOptometrists are the professionals who will carry out your eye test when you visit an optician's practice. \nRoutine appointments can also be provided \"if capacity permits, and if it is in the patients' best interests\", the guidance states. \nClinical adviser Paramdeep Bilkhu said the college's own research suggested just under a quarter of people noticed their vision deteriorate during the first lockdown. \n\"Our research showed us that many people believe that spending more time in front of screens worsened their vision,\" he said. \n\"The good news is that this is unlikely to cause any permanent harm to your vision. However, it is very important that if you feel your vision has deteriorated or if you are experiencing any problems with your eyes, such as them becoming red or painful, you contact your local optometrist by telephone or online.\"\nUK health and safety legislation states employers must pay for eye tests for their employees if they have to use a screen for work for more than one hour a day. \nIn the summer, the UK Ophthalmology Alliance and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists calculated that at least 10,000 people had missed out on essential eye care in Britain. \nIn the most extreme cases, the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it feared some people were at risk of losing their sight because of a fear of attending hospital during the coronavirus pandemic.\nA Royal College of Ophthalmologists spokesperson said: \"It is important that people who have found significant changes in their vision seek the advice of an optometrist who will examine, and determine if the changes require further investigation by an ophthalmologist - a medically-trained eye doctor.\""

      "tags": "Swansea Bay University Health Board,Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board",
      "text": "There have now been more than 5,100 deaths in Wales involving Covid-19 since the pandemic began. \nThe latest weekly figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show 310 deaths in the week ending 1 January, which is 32 more than the week before.  \nThis is nearly 42.6% of all deaths.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg saw the highest numbers of weekly deaths in Wales, the most since the end of April at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic.\nThere were 76 deaths in the area - including 66 in hospitals and six in care homes.  \nLooking at council areas, Rhondda Cynon Taf had the second highest number of hospital deaths across England and Wales, with 34. The London borough of Newham had 35.\nThe ONS again urged caution when interpreting this week's figures, due to the Christmas and new year holidays, which will affect the number of registrations.\nThe total number of Covid deaths in Wales, up to and registered by 1 January, was 4,963.\nBut when deaths registered over the following few days are included, there was a total of 5,169.\nThe Aneurin Bevan health board, with 68 deaths registered involving Covid, also had its highest number in a single week since the end of April. \nHywel Dda health board reported 37 deaths - its highest weekly figure since the pandemic began. Of these, 18 were patients in hospital from Carmarthenshire and 10 were hospital patients from Pembrokeshire.\nSwansea Bay health board had 61 deaths in this week. The Swansea council area itself had the seventh highest number of hospital deaths across England and Wales.\nThere were 36 deaths in Cardiff and Vale, 25 deaths in Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales - 10 of which were hospital deaths in Wrexham - and seven in Powys.\nAll counties recorded at least one death involving Covid-19.\nRhondda Cynon Taf, with 685 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales up to the latest week, followed by Cardiff with 578. \nWhen looking at crude death rates - based on the number of deaths compared to local populations - Wales has three of the five worst across England and Wales.\nRhondda Cynon Taf has 283 deaths per 100,000 in total so far in the pandemic. \nMerthyr Tydfil is second with 253.6 and Blaenau Gwent is ranked fourth.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing.\nIn Wales, the number of deaths fell from 825 to 727 in the latest week, but this was still 209 deaths (40.3%) higher than the five-year average for that week. This is the second highest proportion after London.\nThe ONS figures report where doctors mention Covid-19 on death certificates, including confirmed and suspected cases.\nThey include deaths occurring in all places, not only hospitals and care homes but also people's own homes.\nIt has been estimated that Covid is the underlying cause in around 90% of these deaths and not just a contributory factor."

      "tags": "Netherlands,Brexit",
      "text": "A Dutch TV network has filmed border officials confiscating ham sandwiches and other foods from drivers arriving in the Netherlands from the UK, under post-Brexit rules.\nThe officials were shown explaining import regulations imposed since the UK formalised its separation from the EU.\nUnder EU rules, travellers from outside the bloc are banned from bringing in meat and dairy products.\nThe rules appeared to bemuse one driver.\n\"Since Brexit, you are no longer allowed to bring certain foods to Europe, like meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, that kind of stuff,\" a Dutch border official told the driver in footage broadcast by TV network NPO 1.\nIn one scene, a border official asked the driver whether several of his tin-foil wrapped sandwiches had meat in them. \nWhen the driver said they did, the border official said: \"Okay, so we take them all.\"\nSurprised, the driver then asked the officials if he could keep the bread, to which one replied: \"No, everything will be confiscated - welcome to the Brexit, sir. I'm sorry.\"\nThe UK officially finished its formal separation from the EU on 31 December, 2020.\nFrom 23:00 GMT on that date, the UK stopped following EU rules, with new arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation coming into force.\nA trade deal with the EU was agreed on 24 December, and a week later, UK lawmakers voted in favour of the agreement.\nThe UK's departure means big changes for business - with the UK and EU forming two separate markets - the end of free movement, and new regulations, including those governing the import of personal goods.\nThe UK government has issued guidance to commercial drivers travelling to the EU, warning them to \"be aware of additional restrictions to personal imports\".\n\"You cannot bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (e.g. a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU,\" the guidance says. \"There are exceptions to this rule for certain quantities of powdered infant milk, infant food, special foods, or special processed pet feed.\"\nOn its website, the European Commission says the ban is necessary because such goods \"continue to present a real threat to animal health throughout the Union\".\n\"It is known, for example, that dangerous pathogens that cause animal diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease and classical swine fever can reside in meat, milk or their products,\" the Commission says.\nSeparately, the Dutch customs agency shared a picture of foodstuffs it had confiscated from motorists in the ferry terminal the Hook of Holland. \n\"Since 1 January, you can't just bring more food from the UK,\" the agency said. \"So prepare yourself if you travel to the Netherlands from the UK and spread the word. This is how we prevent food waste and together ensure that the controls are speeded up.\"\nThe BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam described the confiscation of ham sandwiches and other foodstuffs at the EU's borders with the UK as \"a standard implication of [the] Brexit deal\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A fall in Northern Ireland's rate of Covid-19 infection has been achieved by many people \"doing the right thing\", Arlene Foster has said.\nBut she said she was concerned by reports of some employers not adhering to the \"stay-at-home\" order for staff.\nEarlier, ministers also discussed a potential crackdown on larger retailers selling non-essential items.\nThe first minister said that was a \"selfish spirit\" which would not help beat the virus.\nStormont's first and deputy first ministers were appearing in Dungannon, County Tyrone, at their first joint press conference in more than a month.\nTheir comments came as a further 1,205 cases of the virus were reported by Northern Ireland's Department of Health on Tuesday. \nTwenty-two more people have died with the virus, taking the department's total number of deaths to 1,498.\nThere are 785 people in hospital with Covid-19, 55 are in intensive care.\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations.\nBut it has now fallen \"significantly\", according to the Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young.\nThe first and deputy first ministers will meet the PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne on Tuesday evening to discuss enforcement of the coronavirus laws.\nMichelle O'Neill, NI's Deputy First Minister, said there would also be an \"urgent roundtable\" with the retail sector to reinforce the need to \"comply with the spirit and letter\" of the restrictions.\n\"Adherence will get us through this difficult period,\" said Ms O'Neill.\nNorthern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with many sectors forced to close. \nPeople have also been told they should only leave home for exercise, food and medical needs or if they cannot work from home.\nMrs Foster said the evidence provided to ministers showed that the restrictions were working, and she paid tribute to the public for complying.\n\"It's people choosing to Facetime and phone friends rather than visiting, it's doing one big shop and not nipping out every day, doing the best job you can at home and not going into the work place when you don't have to,\" she added.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer warned that there are \"some hard yards to go\" and lockdown would not be ending soon.\n\"I'm not certain we will be emerging from lockdown in February. I think that would be optimistic in the extreme,\" said Dr Michael McBride.\n\"We have a long, long way to go with this virus. I don't think any of us can anticipate a return to normality come the 6th of February.\"\nMr McBride said restrictions would be in place for a considerable number of months, until a time when more of the population who are extremely clinically vulnerable are vaccinated.\nEarlier, Prof Young said Northern Ireland had passed the peak in terms of new cases of Covid-19 for this wave of the pandemic.\nBut he warned: \"We still have a long way to go and the number of cases we are seeing each day is still averaging well over 1,000 cases a day - which by any measure in the course of the epidemic represents a very high level.\" \nHe said he expects the number of hospital inpatients to continue to rise \"until some time in last two weeks in January\".\nProf Young said he believed that the current restrictions are \"sufficient\" for the moment, if people stick to them.\nNorthern Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said it was estimated that on average about one in 60 people have Covid-19 in Northern Ireland.\nHe said the rising number of cases was a \"payback\" for the relaxation of restrictions in December.\nNew lockdown restrictions came into force in Northern Ireland on Friday 8 January, meaning people can only leave their home for essential reasons.\nProf Young said while compliance with the stay-at-home order was better than it was at the start of December, it was still not as good as it was in the first lockdown in March.\nAmid the pressure on the health service, health trusts have said more cancer operations could be cancelled.\nThe Belfast Health Trust has already cancelled urgent cancer surgeries.\nFather James O'Reilly, a chaplain at Antrim Area Hospital, said he has been called to the hospital almost every day in the past year to give Covid-19 patients their last rites and to provide comfort to families and staff.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme he said: \"You can see the toll it's taking on the nurses and doctors now.\n\"They are giving everything and quite honestly they don't have much more to give it seems.\n\"That's a scary thought because they're our last line of defence against this disease.\"\nAs of Monday evening, almost 92,000 people in Northern Ireland had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.\nDr Frances O'Hagan, whose clinic in Armagh city began vaccinating people aged over 80 last week, expects to have administered the jab to more than 300 patients by the end of the week.\nShe said she hoped to get more stock of the vaccines \"very shortly\" for the next groups on the priority list.\n\"We are ready to go... we will get those [vaccines] into patients' arms as soon as they are given us,\" she added."
