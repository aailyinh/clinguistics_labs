      "tags": "Hordle,West Parley",
      "text": "A married police officer who strangled his lover after she exposed their affair has had his prison sentence increased on appeal. \nTimothy Brehmer was jailed for 10-and-a-half years after admitting the manslaughter of 41-year-old Claire Parry in Dorset on 9 May.\nHe had claimed she died accidentally during a \"kerfuffle\" in his car.\nThe Court of Appeal ruled that Brehmer's sentence should be increased to 13-and-a-half years.\nBrehmer, of Hordle, Hampshire, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter ahead of his trial at Salisbury Crown Court, where a jury cleared him of murder. \nThe Attorney General's Office referred the case to the Court of Appeal under the unduly lenient sentence scheme.\nThe Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said that sentencing judge Mr Justice Jacobs \"gave too little weight to the aggravating factors he had identified\".\nHe added that Mr Justice Jacobs had given too large a discount for Brehmer's guilty plea as it did not \"reduce the impact of the crime upon victims\" or save witnesses from having to testify.\n\"The offender's conduct and lies after the attack were reprehensible and calculated to deflect attention from what he had done,\" Lord Burnett said. \nAttorney General Michael Ellis QC, who welcomed the increase in sentence, said: \"Because of his actions, Claire Parry's family have lost a wife and mother, and her community have lost a dedicated nurse.\"\nThe trial heard Mrs Parry, a nurse who was married to another police officer, met the defendant outside the Horns Inn in West Parley to confront him about another of his extra-marital affairs.\nMrs Parry, who been been in a secret relationship with Brehmer for more than 10 years, took his phone before sending a text to his wife which said: \"I am cheating on you.\"\nBrehmer said he strangled Mrs Parry by accident during a \"kerfuffle\" in his car and that his arm \"must have slipped in all the melee\". \nHe later attempted to cover up his crime by using a knife to wound himself and claiming he had been stabbed by Mrs Parry, a statement he later retracted. \nFootage from a police body-worn camera showed him covered in blood and crying in the minutes after he killed his victim. \nThe trial also heard from another woman he had an affair with, Det Con Kate Rhodes, who said Brehmer used \"grooming\" techniques to exert \"coercive and controlling behaviour\" over women.\nMs Rhodes said he had been a \"womaniser\" and described him by the nickname \"Mr Smooth\". \nMrs Parry's husband, Andrew, previously said he was \"incredibly disappointed\" after Brehmer was cleared of murder and branded the former police officer a \"well-practised liar\".\n\"He has shown himself - as the trial exposed - to be consistently dishonest, deceitful and devious,\" he added. \nThe Court of Appeal rejected an attempt by Brehmer's lawyers to have his jail term reduced.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "A five-year jail term for a man who killed his wife during the first Covid lockdown has been referred to the Court of Appeal as being \"unduly lenient\".\nAnthony Williams, 70, was found not guilty of murdering his wife Ruth, 67, at their home in Cwmbran, Torfaen, after a trial at Swansea Crown Court.\nBut Williams, who had anxiety and depression, admitted to manslaughter by diminished responsibility.\nThe attorney general Michael Ellis wants the sentence length reviewed.\nA spokesman for Mr Ellis said he was \"shocked by this case\".\n\"After careful consideration he has decided to refer the sentence of Anthony Williams to the Court of Appeal as he believes the sentence is unduly lenient,\" added the official.\n\"It is now for the court to decide whether to increase the sentence.\" \nDuring the trial earlier this year, the court heard Williams, of Brynglas, Hollybush, had not slept for several days due to worries over money, coronavirus and his health.\nA psychiatrist told the jury his mental health had dramatically deteriorated after retiring in 2019, and the coronavirus pandemic had made things worse.\nHe told police he had \"choked the living daylights\" out of Mrs Williams after an argument on 28 March 2020.\nJudge Paul Thomas called it \"a tragic case on several levels\".\nHe added: \"The overwhelming greatest tragedy is that a lady of 67 years who was in good health had her life ended at the hands of a man she had loved for nearly 50 years.\n\"It is also a tragedy that an act of a couple of minutes and one you immediately repented will define you for the rest of your life. And tragic that you have now left your daughter without her beloved mother.\"\nHome Secretary Priti Patel had already ordered an inquiry is carried out into the death, adding she was \"not satisfied\" with Torfaen council's decision not to carry out a domestic homicide review.\nAfter writing to the council, Ms Patel said: \"This was an appalling case and my thoughts are with the family and friends of Ruth Williams.\"\nThe local authority's public service board said it would now carry out the inquiry.\nLabour's Harriet Harman, Jess Phillips and Alex Davies-Jones all wrote to attorney general Suella Braverman in February,  calling on her to refer the case to the Court of Appeal. \nMs Braverman has since gone on maternity leave, and new attorney general Mr Ellis has now taken the action."

      "tags": "China,United States,China-US relations",
      "text": "US and Chinese officials have exchanged sharp rebukes in the first high-level talks between the Biden administration and China, taking place in Alaska.\nChinese officials accused the US of inciting countries \"to attack China\", while the US said China had \"arrived intent on grandstanding\".\nRelations between the two superpowers are at their most strained for years.\nThe US pledged to raise contentious issues such as Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.\nThe ill-tempered talks in Anchorage involved Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on the US side, facing off with China's most senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and foreign minister Wang Yi.\nHowever, a US official said the subsequent talks behind closed doors had been \"substantive, serious and direct\" and ran over the planned two hours. \nIn a blunt opening statement before the talks in private, Mr Blinken said the US would \"discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies\".\n\"Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability,\" he said.\nIn response, Mr Yang accused Washington of using its military might and financial supremacy to suppress other countries.   \n\"It abuses so-called notions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges, and incite some countries to attack China,\" he added.\nMr Yang said human rights in the US were at a low point, with black Americans being \"slaughtered\".\nMr Sullivan hit back, saying Washington did not seek a conflict with China, but added: \"We will always stand up for our principles for our people, and for our friends.\"\nThe exchange, which took place in front of the world's media, went on for more than an hour. It came at the start of three sessions, which are due to end on Friday morning. \nIt is the first high-level meeting between the US and China since last June - during the administration of the previous US President, Donald Trump. \nIt was an unusually undiplomatic sparring match, especially for a meeting called to take stock of the US-China relationship under a new American administration. \nBeforehand the Biden team had been blunt in public criticism of Beijing. So the Chinese knew what to expect and seemed to have come prepared to hit back. \nThey were particularly angry that Washington had imposed sanctions on them the day before the talks, over a crackdown on pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong. \nThere may have been a certain amount of posturing involved, as a US official said the private conversation that followed was substantive and serious. \nThe Biden administration has said it will be tough on issues of concern, but willing to work with Beijing on matters of interest. However, it has described the relationship as a geopolitical competition between democracy and autocracy. \nAnd the Chinese have refused to compromise on what they say are matters of national sovereignty and security. Whether or not they can find pragmatic points of co-operation will be the measure of how the relationship moves forward. \nAfterwards, the US delegation accused China of violating the agreed protocol of two minutes of opening remarks by each side.\n\"The Chinese delegation... seems to have arrived intent on grandstanding, focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance,\" a senior administration official said.\nThe official said the US would continue with the talks as planned, adding that \"exaggerated diplomatic presentations often are aimed at a domestic audience\".\nIn later remarks via state media, Chinese officials said it had been the US, not China, that had violated protocol by exceeding the agreed time in opening remarks. They accused the US of making a \"groundless attack on China's domestic and foreign policies\".\nOn a more positive note, it quoted Mr Yang as saying that \"serious difficulties in China-US relations in the past should not continue\".\nThe BBC's Barbara Plett Usher says the talks are the first chance for the Biden administration to show how it intends to deal with what Mr Blinken has called \"the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st Century\".\nChina is looking for a reset after relations hit rock bottom under the Trump administration, our correspondent adds. Mr Wang has said that Beijing is ready to reopen \"constructive dialogue.\"\nQuite a lot. \nTrade for instance. The US accuses China of unfair practices, such as subsidising industries, stealing intellectual property, keeping its currency low and putting up barriers to trade.\nFor its part, China wants the big trade tariffs introduced by the Trump administration on Chinese goods eliminated. It also accuses the US of \"suppressing\" successful Chinese tech companies, such as Huawei. \nHuman rights and democracy. The US accuses China of genocide against the Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang, and trampling on democratic rights in Hong Kong with a recently introduced security law. \nBut China calls on the US to stop interfering in what Beijing considers its internal affairs and accuses the US of \"smearing\" the ruling Communist Party.\nChina is also pushing back against what it sees as US naval encroachment in the South China Sea, which Beijing considers Chinese territory.

It's really frustrating because I've got plans and my own car but I can't do anything with it.\"\nHarry Nicholls was hoping to take his test on Friday, having been postponed from last summer, but Covid rules mean he is not allowed. The next available date is not until September.\n\"I started learning after my birthday in March, which was when lockdown started,\" said the 17-year-old from Monmouth.\n\"I passed my theory test and my parents booked me 10 lessons, but I couldn't start them because of lockdown. \n\"After [the first] lockdown I went out for 15 lessons with an instructor and by the end I was in a good position to pass my test.\"\nThen lockdown happened again and having spent \u00a3450 on lessons, Harry has also spent \u00a34,500 on a Kia Rio that has sat outside the house.\n\"It's a nightmare.

She is hopeful it will be third time lucky later in the year.\n\"It would be a lot less stress knowing I could get in the car and go wherever,\" she said.\nThe Welsh government said it had been a difficult time, especially for business owners.\nA spokesman added: \"If the public health situation continues to improve, we will be able to carry on relaxing restrictions in a phased way, being careful not to undermine all the progress made by everyone in Wales to bring coronavirus cases under control.\"\n\"We hope driving lessons will be able to resume from April 12 and tests from April 22, in line with the DVSA's [Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency] roadmap.\"\nProtests have been staged in multiple cities on Friday hoping to see driving lessons resume soon.\nLuke Thompson, is the director of M4 motoring driving school and the Newport protest organiser. \nHe said they wanted \"clarity\" from the Welsh government about restarting their businesses. \n\"We believe we've done enough to ensure our cars are safe.\"\nThomas Netherway is also at the Newport protest and the halt on driving lessons have caused a financial struggle.\n\"I haven't been able to work since December - I've had no money coming in and I don't know how I'll provide for my family\"."

      "tags": "France,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Paris,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The French capital is set to go into a month-long Covid lockdown as the country fears a third wave.\nSome 21 million people in 16 areas of France will be placed under the measures from midnight on Friday.\nThese measures will not be as strict as the previous lockdown, Prime Minister Jean Castex said, with people allowed to exercise outdoors. \nFrance has recorded more than 35,000 new infections within the past 24 hours.\nMr Castex said a \"third wave\" of infections in the country was looking increasingly likely.\nThe situation in Paris is particularly worrying with 1,200 people in intensive care there, more than at the peak of the second wave in November, Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said.  \nUnder the new measures, non-essential businesses will be forced to close, but schools will remain open, along with hairdressers if they follow a \"particular sanitary protocol\". \nGovernment spokesman Gabriel Attal stressed there would be differences with the two earlier lockdowns and said further details would be given of which business could stay open or would have to shut.\nPeople will be allowed to exercise outdoors within 10km (6 miles) of their home and are not allowed to travel to other parts of the country unless they have a valid reason. Those in the affected areas will have to fill out a form to explain why they have left their homes. \nThere is a weary resignation about Paris, as people prepare for another four weeks of tedium. Yes, we know this third lockdown won't be quite as bad as the second - which was itself a lighter version of the first. But still.\nAnother month of bits of paper for the police; another month of having to justify a trip to the supermarket; another month without meaningful social contact. It's enough to drive you to distraction.\nExcept it hasn't. In general, most Parisians simply knuckle under. Those who can are leaving by train or car, but because schools are staying open, most families will stick it out in the city.\nEveryone's made the calculation. The long Easter weekend in two weeks is a bust. But the Paris school holidays start on 17 April - exactly when the lockdown is supposed to end.\nThat's the light that will keep people going. Spring break.   \nAs well as the greater Paris region, the northern Hauts-de-France, Seine-Maritime and Eure areas will go under lockdown as well as the Alpes-Maritimes on the French Riviera.\nFrance's nationwide curfew will remain in place. However, it will begin an hour later at 19:00 (18:00 GMT), taking into account the longer hours of daylight. \nFears of a third wave come as the French government faces criticism for its slow vaccine rollout. \nFrom Friday, France will resume vaccinating using the AstraZeneca jab following the EMA's announcement that it was fit for use. Mr Castex said he would be getting the vaccine straight away to prove that it was OK.\nFrance had suspended the jab after a number of people in Europe reported blood clots developing after the vaccine was administered. \nA survey conducted just as the suspension was announced found that only 20% of the French have confidence in AstraZeneca."

But after her appointment at Teen Vogue, the posts resurfaced, leading to criticism. They were published on Instagram by journalist Diane Tsui.\n\"Outdone by [an] Asian #whatsnew,\" read one of Ms McCammond's earlier tweets.\n\"Give me a 2/10 on my chem [chemistry] problem, cross out all of my work and don't explain what I did wrong\u2026 thanks a lot stupid Asian T.A [teaching assistant] you're great,\" read another.\nReferencing the comments, Tsui wrote: \"Time and time again this shows that gatekeepers pay lip service to diversity.

Police have not yet confirmed if the shootings were racially motivated.\nTeen Vogue, which has a large following among teenagers and readers in their 20s, has built a reputation for explicit anti-racist and feminist journalism.\nIn one of its most famous pieces, it said in 2016 that US President Donald Trump was \"gaslighting America\".\nStaff at the magazine said Ms McCammond's appointment had threatened the outlet's core values.\n\"We've built our outlet's reputation as a voice for justice and change - we take immense pride in our work and in creating an inclusive environment,\" more than 20 staff wrote in a letter posted on Instagram.\n\"That's why we have written a letter to management at Cond\u00e9 Nast about the recent hire of Alexi McCammond as our new editor-in-chief in light of her past racist and homophobic tweets.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK economy,UK national debt,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Government borrowing levels continued to set new records last month, reflecting the cost of supporting the UK's economy during the pandemic.\nThe government borrowed \u00a319.1bn in February, the highest figure for that month since records began in 1993.\nMeasures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard.\nHowever, February's borrowing figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was not as high as some economists had forecast.\nBorrowing for the financial year to date - between April and February - has now reached \u00a3278.8bn, the Office for National Statistics said, a record for that period.\nThe Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: \"Coronavirus has caused one of the largest economic shocks this country has ever faced, which is why we responded with our \u00a3352bn package of support to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\"This was the fiscally responsible thing to do and the best way to support the public finances in the medium term.\"\nChristine Jardine, Treasury spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said that while the latest figures showed scale of the challenge posed by the pandemic, \"they can not be used as an excuse by the government to end support prematurely, and leave behind people and businesses struggling across the UK\".\n\"Thousands of small businesses are due to stay closed for months to come, and millions of people are still worried about their jobs. Yet the chancellor failed to provide them with long-term certainty and direct support in the Budget.\"\nThe latest ONS figures showed the government spent \u00a33.9bn last month on job support measures alone.\nThey also revealed a fall in tax income, notably from lower VAT, business rates and fuel duty, although they also showed money coming in from self-employed tax payments rose by \u00a3900m from last year.\nTotal public sector debt has risen to \u00a32.13 trillion, according to the ONS. The figure almost exceeds the size of the UK's economy, with debt having reached 97.5% of annual economic output.\nDebt levels as high as this have not been seen since the early 1960s.\nUltimately, if it's consistently spending much more than it has in the past, the state has to raise more money in taxes. But the key word there is \"ultimately\". There is no urgency to repaying the government's debt. More urgent are the debts of small businesses and poorer households.\nOrdinary households rightly fear getting into too much debt because if interest rates rise, lenders can close in and deploy lawyers and bailiffs with all the attendant unpleasantness.\nBut it is profoundly wrong and misleading to infer that it's like that for governments who issue their own sovereign currency. \nUnlike households, governments controlling their own currency can borrow without limit money that they have freshly created. \nThey therefore can't go bankrupt. Because almost all of the money borrowed by the government in this financial year (by issuing gilts) will be owed to another public sector body, the Bank of England, it's nothing like a household borrowing from a bank.\nAnd in fact, as the government tacitly acknowledged in its recent Budget, it makes sense in the midst of an economic contraction for the government to spend more, not less - not least because other parts of the economy (households and businesses) aren't spending anything like what they normally would. \nWithout the additional government spending the economic contraction would, without a shadow of a doubt, be worse.\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that despite the high level of borrowing, the government's increased spending was the only sensible course at this time.\n\"Today's figures are pretty terrible but it is important to take in to account the economy as well. The chancellor is doing the right thing in continuing to support the economy,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"His action in the Budget to extend many of the existing schemes means the rug will not pulled out from under the feet of households and businesses.\n\"If we can limit the damage to the economy now, when the crisis ends it means the country will be stronger amore able to cope with that debt.\"\nSeparately, the government said it would receive \u00a31.1bn from selling part of its stake in NatWest Group.\nThe sale will cut the size of the government's stake in the bank - which was previously called Royal Bank of Scotland - from almost 62% to 59.8%.\nThe government bought shares in the bank to help keep it afloat during the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe value of those shares has since fallen, meaning the government has made an overall loss of \u00a31.84bn excluding dividend payments.\nThe Treasury said \"its ambition is to return the bank to private ownership once the original goal of preserving financial stability has been achieved\"."

      "text": "First-year bankers at investment bank Goldman Sachs have warned that they might quit unless their gruelling working conditions improve. \nAn internal survey among 13 employees showed they averaged 95 hours of work a week and slept five hours a night. \nTheir personal relationships also suffered as did their physical and mental health. \nThe analysts warned that they would be likely to leave within six months unless things changed.\nThe survey offers a rare glimpse into the fiercely competitive work culture of Wall Street's top firms, where junior analysts scramble for well-paid career paths. \nThe survey, which began circulating on social media on Wednesday, is presented on Goldman Sachs-branded slides that note they were produced within the investment banking division.\nBut the BBC understands that the survey was conducted by a \"self-selected\" group of US-based first-year investment banking analysts among themselves.\n\"The sleep deprivation, the treatment by senior bankers, the mental and physical stress\u2026 I've been through foster care and this is arguably worse,\" one respondent said in the survey, which has been seen by the BBC. \n\"This is beyond the level of 'hard-working', this is inhumane/abuse,\" said another. \nAll of the respondents said the job had negatively affected their relationships with friends and family, while 77% said they had been victims of workplace abuse. \nIt's not just those in the world of finance who endure long days and little sleep.\nDavid works in software development. Before the pandemic he would travel from his home in Torquay in Devon to London on a Sunday night and only return on Friday evening - sometimes not getting through the door before midnight.\nOn top of his full-time job, he always has a side project that can keep him up until 02:00 and intrudes on weekends.\nHe says his wife would describe him as a workaholic but he doesn't use the term himself.\n\"I'm definitely the kind of person who would sleep less if I could,\" David says. \"It's wasted time.\"\nBefore working for the firm, the analysts assessed their own mental health at 8.8 out of 10 and their physical health at 9 out of 10. \nAfter starting the job, they rated their mental health at 2.8 and their physical health at 2.3.  \n83% said they had experienced \"excessive monitoring or micromanagement\", while 17% said they frequently experienced shouting or swearing. \nThe survey recommended maximum 80-hour work weeks with no work on Saturday or after 9pm on Friday. \nIt also urged more realistic deadlines and better work flows aimed at reducing stress.\nThe analysts presented their findings to Goldman Sachs' management in February, and the bank said it has since taken steps to address employee burnout among this small group, and wider teams.\n\"We recognise that our people are very busy, because business is strong and volumes are at historic levels,\" a spokeswoman for the bank told the BBC.\n\"A year into Covid, people are understandably quite stretched, and that's why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them.\"\nThe bank says it has been reinforcing its \"Saturday Exception\" policy and moving to automate certain tasks for junior staff.\nGoldman Sachs reported net revenues of $44.6bn (\u00a332.1bn) for 2020.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK economy,UK national debt,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Government borrowing levels continued to set new records last month, reflecting the cost of supporting the UK's economy during the pandemic.\nThe government borrowed \u00a319.1bn in February, the highest figure for that month since records began in 1993.\nMeasures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard.\nHowever, February's borrowing figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was not as high as some economists had forecast.\nBorrowing for the financial year to date - between April and February - has now reached \u00a3278.8bn, the Office for National Statistics said, a record for that period.\nThe Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: \"Coronavirus has caused one of the largest economic shocks this country has ever faced, which is why we responded with our \u00a3352bn package of support to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\"This was the fiscally responsible thing to do and the best way to support the public finances in the medium term.\"\nChristine Jardine, Treasury spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said that while the latest figures showed scale of the challenge posed by the pandemic, \"they can not be used as an excuse by the government to end support prematurely, and leave behind people and businesses struggling across the UK\".\n\"Thousands of small businesses are due to stay closed for months to come, and millions of people are still worried about their jobs. Yet the chancellor failed to provide them with long-term certainty and direct support in the Budget.\"\nThe latest ONS figures showed the government spent \u00a33.9bn last month on job support measures alone.\nThey also revealed a fall in tax income, notably from lower VAT, business rates and fuel duty, although they also showed money coming in from self-employed tax payments rose by \u00a3900m from last year.\nTotal public sector debt has risen to \u00a32.13 trillion, according to the ONS. The figure almost exceeds the size of the UK's economy, with debt having reached 97.5% of annual economic output.\nDebt levels as high as this have not been seen since the early 1960s.\nUltimately, if it's consistently spending much more than it has in the past, the state has to raise more money in taxes. But the key word there is \"ultimately\". There is no urgency to repaying the government's debt. More urgent are the debts of small businesses and poorer households.\nOrdinary households rightly fear getting into too much debt because if interest rates rise, lenders can close in and deploy lawyers and bailiffs with all the attendant unpleasantness.\nBut it is profoundly wrong and misleading to infer that it's like that for governments who issue their own sovereign currency. \nUnlike households, governments controlling their own currency can borrow without limit money that they have freshly created. \nThey therefore can't go bankrupt. Because almost all of the money borrowed by the government in this financial year (by issuing gilts) will be owed to another public sector body, the Bank of England, it's nothing like a household borrowing from a bank.\nAnd in fact, as the government tacitly acknowledged in its recent Budget, it makes sense in the midst of an economic contraction for the government to spend more, not less - not least because other parts of the economy (households and businesses) aren't spending anything like what they normally would. \nWithout the additional government spending the economic contraction would, without a shadow of a doubt, be worse.\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that despite the high level of borrowing, the government's increased spending was the only sensible course at this time.\n\"Today's figures are pretty terrible but it is important to take in to account the economy as well. The chancellor is doing the right thing in continuing to support the economy,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"His action in the Budget to extend many of the existing schemes means the rug will not pulled out from under the feet of households and businesses.\n\"If we can limit the damage to the economy now, when the crisis ends it means the country will be stronger amore able to cope with that debt.\"\nSeparately, the government said it would receive \u00a31.1bn from selling part of its stake in NatWest Group.\nThe sale will cut the size of the government's stake in the bank - which was previously called Royal Bank of Scotland - from almost 62% to 59.8%.\nThe government bought shares in the bank to help keep it afloat during the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe value of those shares has since fallen, meaning the government has made an overall loss of \u00a31.84bn excluding dividend payments.\nThe Treasury said \"its ambition is to return the bank to private ownership once the original goal of preserving financial stability has been achieved\"."

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been cleared of breaking rules during an investigation into her predecessor, Alex Salmond, but she's been criticised in a separate report by MSPs.\nAn independent report found that Ms Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code during the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond. \nHowever, a separate inquiry by MSPs has described the government's actions as \"deeply flawed\", and questioned some of Ms Sturgeon's evidence. \nThe pair dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade. They led the campaign for Scotland to become independent from the UK. \nAlex Salmond was Scotland's first minister and Scottish National Party leader before Ms Sturgeon, who had been his deputy. She took over after the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scotland back remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%. \nThe row began when allegations of sexual harassment - strongly denied - were made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants in 2018.\nThe complaints were made after Ms Sturgeon asked for new government policies on sexual harassment to be put in place in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Mr Salmond believed the policy was aimed at him.  \nThe Scottish government eventually admitted it had acted unlawfully. It had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000.\nMr Salmond has accused officials close to Ms Sturgeon - including her husband Peter Murrell, the SNP's chief executive - of plotting against him. They all deny these claims.\nThen, in January 2019, Mr Salmond was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, including attempted rape.\nMr Salmond was cleared of all 13 charges - which were alleged to have happened while he was first minister - after a trial last March. \nThe nine women who made the allegations included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. \nIn court, Mr Salmond said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\", or \"exaggerations\".\nAfter being acquitted, he said there was \"certain information\" he had been unable to talk about during the trial, but which would \"see the light of day\" in the future. \nHe has since claimed there was a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" from some in the Scottish government and leading SNP figures to damage him and even have him sent to prison.\nMs Sturgeon has accused him of peddling false conspiracy theories and suggested her predecessor is angry because she \"did not collude with him\" to make the sexual harassment allegations \"go away\". \nFollowing the trial, two separate inquiries began. One was by a committee of MSPs and the other by James Hamilton, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions.\nMr Hamilton's inquiry looked at whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. It examined whether she had interfered with the civil service investigation into the allegations against Mr Salmond, or misled parliament about what she knew and when.\nThis report cleared Ms Sturgeon of breaching the ministerial code, but said it was up to parliament to decide whether she had misled them.\nSeparately, the committee of MSPs examined the Scottish government's handling of the initial complaints against Mr Salmond. \nIts report said the Scottish government's actions had been \"seriously flawed\". \nMSPs on the committee voted by five to four that Ms Sturgeon misled their inquiry during her marathon evidence session earlier this month. \nThe committee also said the female civil servants who had made the complaints against Mr Salmond had been badly let down by the government.\nThe row has divided the SNP ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May, with some prominent MPs and many grassroots activists openly backing Mr Salmond. \nSome opinion polls have suggested that the fallout could threaten the SNP's hopes of winning an overall majority in the election - although it remains on course to once again finish as the largest party.\nPanorama on Salmond v Sturgeon is available on BBC iplayer."

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "text": "A US private investigator has told BBC News he was paid by the Sun newspaper to obtain personal information about the Duchess of Sussex in the early days of her relationship with Prince Harry.\nBut Daniel Hanks says he unlawfully accessed detailed information including Meghan's social security number.\nThe Sun's publisher said it requested legitimate research and instructed Mr Hanks he must act lawfully.\nMeghan and Harry said it was a \"moment of reflection\" for the media industry.\nBBC News has seen the so-called \"comprehensive report on Meghan and her family\" which the investigator, also known as Danno Hanks, passed to the Sun. \nIt included her phone number, addresses and social security number as well as information on her family members. His report also included information on her ex-husband and a former boyfriend.\nIn the US, licensed private investigators are allowed full access to databases of personal information for some permitted reasons such as court reports. But accessing this additional level of detail for journalistic purposes is unlawful.\nMr Hanks said: \"Pretty much everything I found out they could find out themselves using legal means - with the exception of the social security numbers.\n\"When you have that information\u2026 it's the key to the kingdom.\"\nWhile there is no evidence it happened in this instance, social security numbers in particular could potentially be used to further other intrusive investigations.\nA spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: \"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex feel that today is an important moment of reflection for the media industry and society at large, as this investigative report shows that the predatory practices of days past are still ongoing, reaping irreversible damage for families and relationships.\n\"They are grateful to those working in media who stand for upholding the values of journalism, which are needed now more than ever before.\"\nThe duke and duchess have had a fraught relationship with the UK's tabloid press. During the couple's recent interview with Oprah Winfrey, they said this had created a \"toxic environment\" of \"control and fear\" and was largely to blame for them leaving the UK.\nPrince Harry is currently suing the publisher of the Sun, and the former publisher of the Daily Mirror, over allegations of phone hacking before 2011.\nSeveral stories appeared in the Sun, and other newspapers, at the beginning of the couple's relationship. They included an article claiming Prince Harry had \"bombarded\" his future wife with text messages and another detailing a weekend they spent together at Meghan's home in Toronto.\nDanno Hanks worked as a private investigator in the US for over 40 years gathering information on celebrities and high-profile people including Michael Jackson and Jeffrey Epstein.\nHe achieved some notoriety in the 1990s via appearances on daytime television and has been jailed four times, most recently in 2017 for extortion.\nMr Hanks said he had provided reports for most of the British tabloid newspapers. \nHe said the Sun wrote to him after the Leveson Inquiry into press standards and asked him to sign documents, seen by the BBC,  committing to act within the law and he repeated this assurance when he billed the Sun for his work. \nBut he claims no-one ever asked where he got his information. \"They didn't care. They just wanted the information,\" he said.\nMr Hanks came forward after being approached by Graham Johnson, a freelance journalist and editor of Byline Investigates, which publishes stories on the British media.\nMr Johnson, a former investigations editor at the Sunday Mirror, pleaded guilty to two counts of phone hacking in 2013.\nHis website has received money from prominent supporters of press reform, including actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, who were both victims of phone hacking, and his partner Emma Jones is on the board of Hacked Off, the press reform campaign group.\nMr Johnson, who paid Mr Hanks for access to his documents, said: \"This story definitely sticks out in the post-Leveson world because it has taken place five years after we thought these practices had stopped.\" \nMost victims of phone-hacking have settled their claims. Prince Harry hasn't. That's the vital context of this story.\nIn the course of nearly a year reporting on the complex, often fraught relationship between the monarchy and the media, it's become clear that he is, in an important sense, the last man standing among those victims. \nA News UK source told me that it was a \"huge priority\" and \"preoccupation\" for the company to repair relations with the royals after the severe damage done by the hacking revelations. \nBut the revelation that the Sun paid a private investigator to supply information on Meghan and her family, and that too in the period leading up to Prince Harry's bombshell public statement of 8 November 2016 in which he said a line had been crossed, will not improve relations. \nPrince Harry has been advised by many people both to make peace with Britain's tabloids, and to settle his claims against them. He hasn't. He may strike some journalists as an unlikely champion of press reform. But it is a role he seems keen on.\nMr Hanks, who has now retired, said watching Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah had also prompted him to speak out.\n\"I'm just doing it to clear my conscience,\" he said. \nAsked what he would say to Meghan and Harry directly, he said: \"I'm deeply sorry for what I did... and I'm available if your lawyers need to talk to me.

      "title": "Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon?",
      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Alex Salmond has accused Nicola Sturgeon of breaking the ministerial code and misleading parliament. \nHe believes senior people around Scotland's first minister were part of a malicious attempt to have him removed from public life and ultimately jailed.\nMs Sturgeon has dismissed the claims and said he has no evidence. \nThe crisis could have significant implications for Scottish politics. \n\"He's trying to bring the house down.\" That was the conclusion of one of Ms Sturgeon's close allies shortly after it emerged Mr Salmond was publicly accusing her of misleading the Scottish Parliament and breaking the ministerial code.\nFor months, some around Scotland's first minister hoped Mr Salmond would hold back from directly criticising Ms Sturgeon in a way which could threaten her job. \nThey believed directly attacking Ms Sturgeon would alienate supporters of Scottish independence - something Mr Salmond would want to avoid. \nThat calculation changed with Mr Salmond's submission to an inquiry into whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. \nThe picture above was taken days before the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, when Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon were the dream team of the pro-indy movement.\nFor a decade, as leader and deputy leader, the pair had dominated nationalist politics.\nWhen Mr Salmond stood down, there was no question of who would take over: Ms Sturgeon was the natural successor.\nThat relationship collapsed completely as a result of sexual allegations later made against Mr Salmond.\nWhen the complaints emerged, Mr Salmond successfully took Ms Sturgeon's Scottish government to court over its process for investigating him. That process, it was found, was unlawful and \"tainted by apparent bias\".\nMr Salmond's victory cost the taxpayer at least \u00a3500,000.\nThe former first minister then stood trial accused of sexual assault - and was cleared of all charges. \nNow it is Ms Sturgeon and her government facing questions over the handling of complaints against Mr Salmond. \nThe former first minister of Scotland has made extraordinary allegations against the Scottish government and SNP - two institutions he used to lead. \nHe has claimed the process set up by the Scottish government, under which he was investigated, was unfair. \nMr Salmond alleges there was a malicious and concerted effort among a range of individuals to damage his reputation - and even to have him sent to jail. \nHe names people he believes helped to damage his reputation - including Ms Sturgeon's husband, the SNP chief executive Peter Murrell and her Scottish government chief of staff, Liz Lloyd.\nAnd he has made serious allegations against the first minister too, arguing she has not told the truth about meetings with him, that she misled parliament and that she broke the code which governs the behaviour of ministers. \nA lot of the controversy surrounds what Ms Sturgeon knew and when - and accounts she gave publicly.\nMs Sturgeon originally said she first found out about a complaint against Mr Salmond, being investigated by her Scottish government, on 2 April 2018.\nThat meeting took place in her home and was not recorded. \nBut it has since been claimed Ms Sturgeon was told a few days earlier at the Scottish Parliament by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff.\nThat's raised questions over what Ms Sturgeon knew, why she met Mr Salmond privately and why it wasn't recorded as official government business. \nIt is not simply a question of a few days difference - it is a question of whether the second meeting should have been reported and treated as Scottish government businesses if Ms Sturgeon had indeed known what it was about in advance. \nMy colleague Phil Sim has written about the ins and outs of meetings here. \nMr Salmond has also made claims that Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code by not conceding earlier that the Scottish government's process for investigating him was flawed. \nHe alleges it was clear the Scottish government would lose a judicial review months before it was conceded it court - something which cost the taxpayer money. \nThere are two inquiries into the Scottish government's alleged mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond.\nOne is by James Hamilton, the first minister's independent adviser on the ministerial code, into whether she has breached it.\nThe second is a cross-party Holyrood inquiry into how her government handled complaints about Mr Salmond.\nThis has been beset by legal difficulties - with significant delays to Mr Salmond's evidence being published. After senior MSPs decided it should be made public, the Crown Office, Scotland's public prosecution service, raised concerns which led to further changes. \nMr Salmond has accused Ms Sturgeon of holding positions which are \"simply untrue\", \"manifestly untrue\" and \"untenable\".\n\"Parliament has been repeatedly misled,\" Mr Salmond contends.\nThere are many in the SNP - including a small but loyal group of elected politicians - who believe there was a conspiracy against him which could lead to several key officials in the Scottish government and SNP standing down.\nSome include Ms Sturgeon in that group.  \nMs Sturgeon says this is all nonsense and denies breaking the ministerial code.\nHer spokesman has accused Mr Salmond of trying to deflect from complaints made by women about his behaviour - and accused her former mentor of \"spinning false conspiracy theories\".\nMs Sturgeon said this week: \"He appears to be suggesting some kind of conspiracy or concerted campaign against him, without a shred of evidence.\n\"If he can't substantiate it, it's time for him to stop making these claims.\"\nNicola Sturgeon's political opponents have struggled to land any political blows in recent months.\nPolls suggest support for the SNP is as high as ever - and that backing for Scottish independence has been rising.\nAlthough there have been criticisms of the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, polling suggests Scots are happy Ms Sturgeon is making the decisions - and not Boris Johnson.\nTo many in Scottish politics, it appears the biggest threat to Ms Sturgeon's position now comes from her predecessor.\nMr Salmond's claims that his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 failed to tell the Scottish Parliament the truth - and that she broke the ministerial code - are serious.\nIn normal times such a breach of the code would lead to a resignation.\nThe code is clear: \"Ministers who knowingly mislead the parliament will be expected to offer their resignation.\"\nMs Sturgeon's political opponents have insisted that if she is found to have breached the code, she will have to stand down.\nPrivately, although they're confident it won't come to that, some around the first minister have admitted she would not be able to survive such a finding from her adviser on the code.\nMany senior figures in Scotland in the devolution era have resigned for less.\nThere is also nervousness in the SNP about the impact of these allegations hitting the headlines just weeks ahead of the Scottish Parliament elections. \nAlthough most would argue that the public just isn't paying attention, some acknowledge a number of party activists side with Mr Salmond - as do a section of SNP voters. \nIf the SNP are going to win a majority, they will need to mobilise their support ahead of 5 May. \nSome are worried this situation - combined with increasingly public splits on other issues - might turn some voters off, and lead to some activists staying at home.\nFor months, well connected opposition figures have talked about this inquiry being a moment of real danger for Ms Sturgeon's leadership. \nThey believe it raises questions about whether her government can be trusted. \nBut while many in Scottish politics discuss Ms Sturgeon's future - very few people are confidently predicting her demise.\nThe main reason is the pandemic. \nMs Sturgeon has high approval ratings for her response to the coronavirus pandemic.\nScots seem to approve of the way she is trying to deal with the health emergency - and some believe voters would forgive a breach of the rules in the midst of a crisis.\nIt's a view I've heard from Ms Sturgeon's critics as much as her allies; that these are not normal times and the normal rules of politics don't apply.\nMr Salmond's supporters are reluctant to speak on the record.\nI'm told that some elected parliamentarians are afraid of the backlash they would get if they did.\nBut one source said: \"I think in normal times she would be a goner. But I don't think she is a goner because people are rightly focused on the pandemic and her handling of the pandemic has been great.\"\nThe second is independence. \nMs Sturgeon has led the SNP and the independence movement to a point where successive polls have suggested support for leaving the UK is now a majority view. \nIf the SNP win big in May, they will use it to demand another referendum, which many think they could win.  \nThere have been criticisms from some in the SNP about a lack of strategy to force another referendum, but most accept the first minister is a key asset for the independence movement. Many think she is one of the main reasons for increasing support for leaving the UK. \nIf the SNP lost its leader that could have an impact on support for independence.\nWhile a number of names have been discussed, there is no certain successor - definitely not with the same UK and international profile.\nMr Salmond's evidence to the Holyrood inquiry will be a remarkable moment in the history of the SNP; the leader who took the party to the brink of independence accusing the leader who could deliver it of misleading parliament.\nEven if Ms Sturgeon survives, Mr Salmond's allies believe others may be \"toast\"; including senior civil servants and advisers.\nBut senior allies of Ms Sturgeon still appear confident she will lead them into the next Scottish election and beyond.\nOne concluded: \"Is she going to get through this? Yes she is.\""

      "tags": "Coronation Street,Television",
      "text": "When Tyrone and Alina stole a kiss in Friday's episode of Coronation Street, many viewers will have been rightly left wondering how they filmed it following social distancing guidelines.\nThe answer: real-life kissing doubles.\nActors Alan Halsall and Ruxandra Porojnicu were filmed talking before their kiss, but did not get within two metres of one another, ITV bosses said.\nInstead, regular Corrie extra Alex Mulvaney and his wife Hannah then stepped in for the romantic moment.\n\"My agent said that Coronation Street needed extras who were in a support bubble, and because I used to be an extra three times a week and they knew half of my family had done extra work on the show, it worked out perfectly,\" explained Mulvaney.\n\"My partner Hannah hadn't done any extra work before, but my agent knew she had dark hair like Alina's so I asked her if she wanted to do it,\" he added.\n\"Hannah was nervous at first, but she is a big Coronation Street fan. I had been on set many times before, and I was able to talk her through what to expect - she was a bit star-struck when she saw the actors.\"\nLike most other shows, Coronation Street stopped filming during the first national lockdown in March 2020 and resumed filming in a restricted manner several months later.\nPorojnicu, who plays Alina, said the (non) kissing scene was a \"challenge\" but one she \"really enjoyed\".\nAlthough their characters look like they are sitting together, the actors were filmed having the conversation separately. The footage was  composited together during post-production, giving the illusion they were next to each other. \nThe design department taped a pair of sunglasses onto a telescopic radio aerial to ensure the actors had the correct eye line, so they would appear to be looking into each other's eyes. \n\"It was difficult not being able to look into each other's eyes for the emotion of the scene but Coronation Street came up with a clever way to cheat that with sunglasses on an aerial,\" the actress said.\n\"Everything that's been said in the scene leads to the kiss which is very important for Alina because it is the first time that she has said out loud to Tyrone that she is falling for him.\"\nProducer Iain MacLeod praised the popular programme's writers, cast and crew for having \"cleverly worked around\" restrictions, for the best part of a difficult year.\nWhen the characters Debbie and Kevin were trapped in a fridge, the actors were tested for Covid beforehand and were placed in a bubble for the three days of filming, as were Alya, Yasmeen and Geoff for the dramatic rooftop scenes for the 60th anniversary show in December.\n\"We have therefore told the same stories throughout the pandemic that we would have told in 'normal' times,\" said MacLeod.\n\"But it just felt wrong to tell a story of an illicit liaison, where someone betrays their partner based on lust and sexual attraction, only for us not to see any of the chemistry and closeness.\n\"Hence the smoke and mirrors here.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "France,Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Coronavirus cases are rising exponentially in Germany, officials warn, as continental Europe braces for a third wave of infections.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was likely that the country would now need to apply an \"emergency brake\" and re-impose lockdown measures.\nFrance, Poland and other nations are also reintroducing restrictions.\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn has said that Europe lacks the vaccines needed to significantly reduce cases.\n\"We have to be honest about the situation - in Europe we don't have enough vaccines to stop a third wave through vaccinations alone,\" he told reporters. \nThe vaccine rollout across the EU has been hindered by delayed deliveries as well as the suspension in several countries of the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, over fears of possible side effects.\nOn Friday, Ms Merkel defended Germany's decision to temporarily suspend the rollout of the vaccine and said she did not believe its reputation had been damaged.\n\"I would get vaccinated with AstraZeneca,\" the 66-year-old said, adding: \"I would like to wait until it's my turn.\"\nThe increase in reported cases in Germany is said to be fuelled by outbreaks among younger people. \n\"The numbers are rising, the share of mutations is large and there are some fairly challenging weeks ahead of us,\" Mr Spahn said.\nMs Merkel said she had hoped lockdown measures would not need to be reintroduced so soon after easing restrictions, but that \"sadly\" developments meant that it was looking unavoidable.\n\"We agreed that, should the seven-day incidence rate exceed 100 per 100,000 people in a region or state, we will go back to the restrictions which were in place until 7 March - we called it the emergency brake.\"\nMinisters are particularly concerned about the Easter holidays. They are urging people not to travel and to limit gatherings to immediate family.\nJust 8% of Germany's population has so far received a first dose of vaccine, although the government on Friday resumed the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. \nVice-president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases, Lars Schaade, warned of the possibility of \"many severe cases and deaths, and hospitals that are overwhelmed\".\nThe RKI has said that cases in Germany are rising at a \"very clearly exponential rate\". \nDespite assurances from the European medicines regulator that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective, some countries remain reluctant to resume their campaigns using the jab. \nFinland's health authority has announced a pause in its use of the vaccine that will last at least a week. \nThe move, which follows two reports of blood clots in patients who had received the jab in the country, was said to be a precautionary measure. \nMeanwhile, Sweden, Denmark and Norway said on Friday that they needed more time to determine whether they should resume AstraZeneca inoculations. \nGermany, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands are among the countries that have restarted their AstraZeneca vaccination campaigns. \nHealth authorities in France have recommended that the vaccine be offered only to people aged 55 and over. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) reviewed the jab after 13 European countries suspended use of the vaccine over fears of a link to blood clots.\nIt found the jab was \"not associated\" with a higher risk of clots.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nOn Friday, experts at the WHO said the vaccine had \"tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world\". \n\"The available data do not suggest any overall increase in clotting conditions such as deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism following administration of Covid-19 vaccines,\" the WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said in a statement.\nOther European leaders have sought to reassure citizens that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is safe.\nItaly's Prime Minister Mario Draghi, 73, said he would happily have the vaccine, but that he had \"not yet made a booking\".\nHis French counterpart, 55-year-old Jean Castex, received an AstraZeneca dose on Friday.\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also received his first dose of the vaccine.\nSome 21 million people in 16 areas of France, including the capital Paris, will be placed under Covid lockdown measures from midnight on Friday as the country fears a third wave.\nTrains leaving Paris for parts of the country where lockdown restrictions do not apply, such as Brittany and Lyon, were reportedly fully booked hours before the measures were due to come into effect. Traffic jams were reported on several roads leaving the capital. \nIn Poland, coronavirus cases are continuing to surge with new daily infections reaching levels not seen since the second wave peaked in November. \nA three-week partial lockdown is being introduced on Saturday to try to slow the spread of Covid-19. Shops, hotels, cultural and sporting facilities will close across the country. "

      "tags": "Broadband",
      "text": "The government has announced the first stages of its plans to get ultra-fast broadband to the remotest of homes in the UK.\nOriginally it had promised to roll out gigabit-speed broadband to every home in Britain by 2025 but that was reduced to 85% coverage in November.\nThe budget remains at \u00a35bn - but only \u00a31.2bn of that will be made available up to 2024.\nThe infrastructure build should start in 2022, the government said.\nThe first to benefit will be homes and businesses in Cambridgeshire, Cornwall, Cumbria, Dorset, Durham, Essex, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Tees Valley.\nThe next areas are expected to be Norfolk, Shropshire, Suffolk, Worcestershire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.\nA former voucher scheme is also being relaunched to provide more immediate help to those struggling with poor broadband coverage, with up to \u00a3210m being made available.\nIt is expected that commercial deployments of gigabit-capable fibre networks will reach more than 70% of premises by the end of 2025, without government intervention.\nThe government has said that reaching the final 1% of homes in very remote areas could be prohibitively expensive.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described Project Gigabit as \"the rocket boost that we need to get lightning-fast broadband to all areas of the country\".\nThe trade organisation techUK has also welcomed the news.\nAnd speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Oliver Dowden said:  \"We've already made tremendous progress with Project Gigabit - our national mission to get everyone in the country the fastest broadband on the planet.\n\"We've gone from around 9% coverage in 2019 to 40% now - I'm confident we'll get to 60% by the end of the year.\n\"The challenge is the last 20%, which can't be delivered commercially - and that's what our plans being outlined today are all about.\"\nHe reiterated the watered-down plans to reach \"at least 85% of the country by 2025\". \n\"I think we will be able to go faster than that still - and the prime minister and I are meeting with telecoms companies again.\n\"Basically, we have the money to provide that subsidy, it's about the capacity in the telecoms market to deliver it, because remember these are very remote areas.\nYesterday BT said it would \"build like fury\" to roll out full-fibre internet connections, following new rules announced by the UK's telecoms regulator Ofcom.\nThe major broadband networks have been pressing the government to make clear how it planned to allocate the public money it's set aside for Project Gigabit, so they'll be relieved to get some detail. \nBut it's still clear that the plan to put rural Britain in the broadband fast lane is behind schedule. \nAt the 2019 election, the manifesto promise was to give every home and business a Gigabit connection  by the end of 2025. Last November that target was cut to 85% of premises, with just \u00a31.2bn available in the short term. \nNow that money is beginning to flow, but with Openreach's chief executive emphasising the need for speedy decisions, it seems there's not complete confidence that even the more limited target will be hit.\nThe issue was a key manifesto commitment for the Conservatives at the last general election, when they promised to \"bring full fibre and gigabit capable broadband to every home and business across the UK by 2025\".\nThe subject is the topic of frequent questions by Conservative MPs at PMQs - highlighting how much of an important issue it is for them and their constituents.  \nBBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake says that having promised to 'level up' and increase opportunity for parts of the UK previously left behind and under-funded, this policy is seen as a key part of that agenda for the government."

      "text": "NHS executive Helen Bevan had her two Twitter accounts, with nearly 140,000 followers, stolen by hackers and used to promote fake PlayStation 5 sales.\nShe now has the accounts back but has received dozens of messages from people who fell for the scam.\nMs Bevan also paid money to someone who said they could help - but they turned out to be a scammer too.\nShe said she wanted to highlight the importance of extra security measures.\nNHS Horizons chief transformation officer Ms Bevan mistakenly thought she had activated two-factor authentication (2FA), which requires account-holders to use two methods to log in, the second often involving a code sent by text or email.\nHowever providing those contact details does not automatically activate 2FA, so the hackers were able to simply change the email address and phone number she had linked to the accounts once they had cracked her password.\nOne was a professional account with 97,000 followers discussing Ms Bevan's work, and the other one was about her cat, a local \"celebrity\", which was followed by 36,000 people. The hackers deleted all of her original tweets, unfollowed the people she was following, and renamed the accounts.\nIt happened the day before Ms Bevan was due to lead an online event for thousands of people, and she had encouraged her audience to use Twitter as their discussion tool.\nFacing this pressure, she felt panicked that her own account was not under her control. \n\"I was the social media heartbeat of this event, I didn't know what to do,\" she said.\n\"Someone said, 'You have a basic choice, you can wait for Twitter to give your account back or you can find someone to help you.'\"\nAs her friends and network were tweeting about the hack, offers of help flooded in and she chose someone who promised to have the accounts back within 25 minutes in return for a fee of \u00a3110.\n\"I don't think he did anything, he kept sending me films of computer files whirring, saying this is me doing your work,\" she said.\n\"Then he said he had got it back, but Twitter had changed the verification and he needed an extra $100, then he wanted a service charge\u2026 they prey on desperate people.\"\nShe did not pay anything further and accepts that the money she handed over is lost.\nAfter two days, Twitter itself restored the accounts for her.\nWhen she accessed them, she found dozens of direct messages from people asking about PlayStation 5 orders.\nShe says she has no idea how many fake sales were generated by the scammers but the PS5s were being advertised at upwards of $450 (\u00a3320).\n\"They were following Walmart, Dixons, PC World, Target,\" she said. \n\"They would wait for them to tweet about PS5s and then reply, saying we've got PS5s in stock now, DM [direct message] me.\"\nThere were also Fleets - temporary Twitter posts - featuring photos of PlayStation boxes.\nMs Bevan later had to explain to all who messaged her, having paid for games consoles, that she was also a victim of the scam.\nShe said she wanted to share her story as a warning to others.\n\"There are things I now know that I wish I'd known - everybody should have two-factor authentication, it's absolutely critical that you put that on,\" she said.\n\"Also, under no circumstances, even if you're desperate, do not go to one of these services that claim they'll get your account back in 30 minutes and stuff - I think they're likely to be a scammer.\n\"The only thing you can do is go through Twitter. Do it one step at a time.\"\nLisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security, said having all the security settings enabled on all social media accounts is  \"absolutely essential\".\n\"This means using a complex and long password, turning on two-factor authentication and, in the case of Twitter, enabling the password-reset protection setting,\" she said. \"Attackers are looking for easy targets. They have amazing eco-systems of businesses that allow them to take over your account, lock you out and then charge you to gain access back again.\""

      "text": "Guidance for people in England identified as being \"clinically extremely vulnerable\" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing?\nFormal advice telling them to take extra care, or \"shield\", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. \nMost coronavirus restrictions are being lifted in England on 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else.\nHowever, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to \"think particularly carefully\" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including:\nThere is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAlthough Scotland moves to Covid protection level zero on 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said keeping the mandatory use of face coverings past then would give \"added protection and assurance\" to people who were particularly vulnerable.\nFrom 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace.\nHowever, companies still have legally binding health and safety responsibilities - and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. \nSome firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people.\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough) is available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. \nYou may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons.\nRead the updated government advice.\nAlthough the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it \"expects and recommends\" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport.\nYou should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. \nThe NHS Volunteer Responders programme is still available to offer support.\nData shows Covid vaccines are highly effective in most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection.\nBeing double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. \nYou should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not, book through the NHS website or call 119.\nThe most vulnerable people are likely to be offered booster jabs from September, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. \nYou are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions.\nThe pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The government recommends several support websites.\nIf you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on the NHS Shielded Patient List. \nA combination of factors can contribute to a person's risk, including: \nHigh risk categories include people: "

      "tags": "Artemis,Nasa,Human spaceflight,Mississippi,Space Launch System (SLS)",
      "text": "Nasa has carried out a successful test on part of the most powerful rocket in existence - the Space Launch System (SLS).\nEngines on the rocket's \"core stage\" were kept running for more than eight minutes - simulating the time it takes the SLS to go from the ground to space.\nIt's the second such test for the biggest segment of the SLS, after an attempt in January shut down early.\nThe SLS is to send humans to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972.\nThe mission is part of Nasa's Artemis project, launched by the Trump administration in 2017.\nThe launcher consists of the orange core, with its four powerful RS-25 engines, and two boosters attached to the sides. \nThe test at Stennis Space Center, near Bay St Louis, Mississippi, began at 16:37 ET (20:37 GMT).  The core was attached to a giant structure called the B-2 test stand.\nA massive plume of exhaust expanded from the stand as the engines shook the ground. The cloud was so enormous, it was spotted from space by the Goes-16 satellite.\nAlthough the target was to fire the engines for eight minutes, teams from Nasa and prime contractor Boeing only had to keep them on for 250 seconds (four minutes) in order to gather all the engineering data they needed.\n\"It was a great day and a great test,\" said acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk. \nThe chair of the US House Committee on Science, Space and Technology congratulated Nasa on the successful test. Texas democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson said: \"Achieving this significant milestone is a story of tenacity and dedication.\"\nShe added: \"Today's successful test brings us one step closer to returning American astronauts to the Moon in preparation for the human exploration of Mars.\"\nThe core that was part of Thursday's test will be used for the maiden flight of the SLS - currently scheduled for late 2021.\nIn the 1960s, the stand tested engines used in the massive Saturn V rocket that launched the Apollo astronauts to the Moon.\nJohn Shannon, Boeing's vice president and program manager for the SLS, told me before the first hotfire attempt: \"When the engines start and then throttle up, we will do what's called a gimbal profile at 60 seconds. The engine nozzles move in a pre-programmed set of movements.\"\nThis gimbal movement of the nozzles allows the rocket to be steered during flight.\n\"This is the most heavily instrumented vehicle we will ever fly so we will get a tremendous amount of engineering data on vibration and temperature and stress, acoustics,\" said Mr Shannon.\nBefore Thursday's hotfire, engineers filled the core stage with more than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million litres) of propellant.\nThat propellant consisted of liquid hydrogen, which is the rocket's fuel, and liquid oxygen, which helps the fuel burn. They react explosively inside the engines, generating super-heated water vapour from the exhaust.\nWhen they're fed to the engines, the propellants are at more than two hundred degrees below zero (F), but the exhaust that emerges is 6,000F (3,316C) - hot enough to boil iron.\nHundreds of thousands of gallons of water were directed into the flame bucket to cool the exhaust. In addition, tens of thousands of gallons were used to create a water \"curtain\" around the engines to suppress the noise generated when they fire for eight minutes.\nThis was done to protect the core stage from vibrations while it is anchored to the stand.\nThe RS-25s, built by California-based Aerojet Rocketdyne, are the same ones that powered the space shuttle.\nThe engines tested on Thursday contributed to 21 successful shuttle flights over the vehicle's 30-year operational history.\nTwo were used on the last space shuttle mission, STS-135 in 2011. One flew on the 1998 mission that launched the oldest person ever to go to space - US senator and Project Mercury astronaut John Glenn, who was 77 at the time. The other was used on one of the flights to service the Hubble Space Telescope. \nThe engines were refurbished following shuttle missions, but they will be discarded after the maiden flight of the SLS later this year.\nThat mission, called Artemis-1, will send Nasa's next-generation crew vehicle, Orion, around the Moon to thoroughly test its systems.\nTom Whitmeyer, from Exploration Systems Development at Nasa, said it would take about a month to refurbish the core stage, after which it would be put on a ship to Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare it for launch.\nHere, it will be installed on a structure called the mobile launcher between the two booster rockets, completing the SLS vehicle.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "Families seeking support for children with special educational needs face a \"postcode lottery\", a report suggests. \nChildren from the poorest areas are less likely to get help than those in more affluent areas, the Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank says.\nPupils have missed out on support due to remote learning and those in academy schools were less likely to be identified as needing support, it adds. \nThe Department for Education said the system needed to be more consistent.\nIt added that the government had increased funding to \u00a38bn in 2021-22.\nThe EPI study tracked the experiences of hundreds of thousands of pupils from a single year group through primary school.\nThe report it found \"deeply concerning\" inconsistencies in how children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in England have been identified and supported. More than a million children currently have special educational needs in England.\nChildren living in the most disadvantaged areas of the country were less likely to be formally recognised as having special needs than similar pupils in more affluent areas, researchers say. They said it highlighted how there was a \"rationing of support\" in many areas of need. \nMany of the most vulnerable children - such those who have suffered abuse or neglect or those frequently out of school - were less able to get support for more complex needs.\nThe report says the pandemic was likely to have exacerbated pre-existing problems with the system. With many children not in school and with growing delays, increasing numbers of vulnerable pupils were likely to have missed out on support.\n\"It is especially concerning that many of the most disadvantaged children with unstable home lives are less likely to access support for more complex learning needs\", said David Laws, executive chairman of the EPI. \n\"The government must drastically improve its efforts to ensure that it is reaching the most vulnerable children in society.\"\nPupils at academy schools - state-funded schools, which are independent from local authorities - are half as likely to be identified and given help than similar pupils in other schools, it said. \nFor children with more severe needs, those living in areas with very few academy schools are 10 times more likely to be identified with SEND by their local authority than similar children living in areas that have many academy schools. \nAcademy schools \"may be overlooking pupils who require SEND support\", the study said. But with limited data available, further research on SEND identification in academies was needed, it added.\nThe report contains a number of recommendations including more specialist training and support for teachers and a funding system that is far more responsive to pupils' needs. \nThe ASCL head teachers' union leader, Geoff Barton, urged caution before jumping to conclusions.\nHe said it was \"an extremely complex educational landscape\", adding: \"Everybody in the school system - in whatever type of school or area - is utterly committed to correctly identifying SEND and providing the support that children require.\n\"Schools have not been helped by the fact that government funding for this support has not matched the level of need, and that the SEND funding system is byzantine in its complexity.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department for Education said it had boosted high needs funding by nearly a quarter, to \u00a38bn in 2021-22.\n\"We know that despite the important reforms introduced to improve support for young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), the system is not working for every pupil - that's why our SEND Review is looking at how to make sure it is consistent all over the country, high quality, and integrated across education, health and care.\""

      "text": "The prime minister has received his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine and has urged the public to do the same, saying he \"did not feel a thing\". \nBoris Johnson was given the vaccine at St Thomas' Hospital in central London, where he was treated for Covid-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. \nAfter being vaccinated, the PM said: \"I cannot recommend it too highly\".  \nIt comes as several European countries said they would resume using the jab.\nLeaving hospital, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"I literally did not feel a thing. It was very good, very quick - I cannot recommend it too highly. \n\"Everybody, when you do get your notification to go for a jab, please go and get it, it is the best thing for you, best thing for your family and for everyone else.\"\nMore than 26 million people have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, according to the latest government figures. About two million people have had a second dose.\nIn England, 22,337,590 people had been given a first jab as of 18 March, according to NHS England,  the equivalent of 50.5% of the population aged 18 and over.\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi also received his vaccination at a pharmacy in Lewisham, south-east London, earlier.\nMeanwhile countries including France, Germany and Italy began restarting their vaccine programmes with the AstraZeneca jab - reversing earlier decisions to suspend them over blood clot concerns.\nThe resumption of the use of the vaccine comes after the European Medicines Agency confirmed it was \"safe and effective\".\nThe regulator reviewed the jab over fears about blood clots, but said it was \"not associated\" with a higher risk of such events, and that the benefits outweighed any risks.\nThe World Health Organization and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency have said the jab is safe and have encouraged people to take up their vaccine appointments. \nThe WHO's advisory committee on vaccine safety issued a statement on Friday saying the vaccine \"continues to have a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world\".\nOn Thursday, the prime minister reiterated that the jab was safe and urged people to take the vaccine if they were offered it. \nHe said: \"The thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it's so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes.\"\nHe also insisted that delays to the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April would not affect people getting their second doses, or England's road map out of lockdown. \n\"The way to ensure this [lockdown easing] happens is to get that jab when your turn comes, so let's get the jab done,\" he said. \nIn other developments, ONS figures suggest infection levels have continued to fall across England and Wales but have \"levelled off\" in Northern Ireland and increased in Scotland.\nAn estimated one in 335 people in the UK had Covid-19 in the week to 13 March, according to the figures, down from one in 280 last week.\nOn Friday, the UK reported a further 101 deaths and 4,802 cases, according to the government's separate daily coronavirus figures.

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The rollout of Covid vaccines in European Union (EU) countries is picking up speed, with more than 300 million jabs  administered.\nAs of 20 June, nearly half of the EU's adult population have had at least one one dose, while 28% have been fully vaccinated.\nEarlier this year, the rollout was hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.\nIn the week to 20 June 2021, Germany administered an average of 1 dose per 100 people a day, with Italy and France close behind on  0.9 dose per 100 people - all higher than the UK's 0.6 per 100.\nHungary - which is using Russian and Chinese vaccines as well as the EU-approved ones - has fully vaccinated 46% of its population, the same proportion as the UK. \nIn France, children who are 12 and over can be vaccinated, with parental consent. The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " The rate at which coronavirus infection is falling in the UK - as measured by the R number - has continued to level off. \nThe latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9, up slightly from the week before.\nIt means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people.\nThe R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. \nR is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average.\nMeasles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. \nThat means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others. \nCoronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading.\nYou can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.  \nData - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. \nIf the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing.\nBut if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.\nGovernments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one.\nThe R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops. \nMathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020. \nBefore any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one. \nAlthough the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences.\nScotland's estimated R number is between 0.8 and 1.0, up slightly on the previous week.\nIn Wales the number is between 0.6 and 0.9 - while in Northern Ireland it remains between 0.75 and 0.95.\nIn England, the number is risen slightly to between 0.8 and 1.0.\nThe R number is one of the big three.\nAnother is severity - some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly. \nThe last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.\nA vaccination programme, like the one currently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number.\nA coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one."

      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, Boris Johnson has said, adding he will be receiving it himself on Friday. \nThe benefits of the vaccine preventing Covid far outweighed any risks, the prime minister said, as he urged people to take up the jab when offered.\nIt comes after UK and EU regulators said there was no evidence the Covid vaccine caused blood clots.\nMr Johnson also said delays to vaccine supply next month would not affect England's roadmap out of lockdown.\n\"The progress along the road to freedom remains unchecked,\" he told a Downing Street briefing, after NHS England warned vaccine supplies would be reduced in April.\nProf Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, told the briefing the Covid vaccines were \"very effective\" against what remained a \"very dangerous disease for many people\".\nHe added that there were \"real issues that we always have to think about with all drugs\", but they were \"so much smaller than the benefits of getting the vaccine\".\n\"The risk-benefit is really strongly in favour of getting vaccinated,\" he said.\nRegulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain, prompting some European countries to pause rollout.\nBut earlier, the MHRA and the EMA said people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised.\nFrance and Italy have since announced that they will resume using the jab.\nA phrase used repeatedly today is the risk-benefit ratio. But what does that mean?\nThe EU and UK regulators were unable to completely rule out the vaccine as a cause of rare blood clots that have been seen.\nBecause the clots are so rare, it is hard to tell if they are above the levels you would normally expect without vaccination.\nBut even if a link is proven - and there is no suggestion it will be - the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.\nThere have been 18 cases of this rare blood clot out of 20 million vaccinations in Europe. That's about one in a million.\nSomeone who is over the age of 75 and becomes infected with Covid has a one in nine chance of dying.\nEven in younger age groups the benefits are clear. Someone in their 40s has a one in 1,000 risk of dying.\nThe vaccines have been proved to be highly effective. They will save lives, rather than cost them.\nAlso during the briefing, Mr Johnson confirmed that supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been affected by a delayed shipment from the Serum Institute of India.\nAfter opening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April.\n\"There is a delay as I have described, as there are very frequently in vaccine rollout programmes,\" he said.\nHe put it down to \"various technical reasons\" and said the Indian government \"hasn't stopped any export\".\nThe Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries.\nEarlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest held up by four weeks.\nThe Serum Institute said: \"Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India.\"\nIts chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been \"directed to prioritise the huge needs of India\".\nHe has also raised concerns about raw material shortages, attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines, such as specialised bags and filters."

      "text": "Karl Maroni, 33, has spent all his adult life in jail. \nAged 18 he committed three violent offences and was convicted. \nHe was told the minimum time he'd be in prison would be three and a half years. \nBut 16 years and 17 jails later he's still there, \"left to rot\", he says. \nHe's never had a bank account, never owned a smartphone and never used social media. \nSpeaking from the low-secure mental unit where he's currently detained, he says he's come close to \"giving up\". \n\"I was self-harming, getting into trouble, feeling really low and depressed, not knowing when I was going to get out,\" he said. \n\"It's like a death sentence.\"\nMaroni is serving a sentence known as an IPP - Imprisonment for Public Protection - which were abolished by the coalition government eight years ago because they were seen to be unfair. \nYet there are still 1,900 people in custody in England and Wales with no end date and no idea when they are getting out. \nFormer Conservative Justice Secretary Lord Kenneth Clarke, who got rid of them in 2012, has told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme it's a \"tragedy\" there are still so many people serving IPPs. \nAnother former Tory Justice Secretary, Sir David Lidington, told the programme that all remaining IPP cases should be reviewed \"as soon as possible\".\nAs a teenager, Maroni took part in a robbery of a bookmakers in London. \nHe and an accomplice threatened the pregnant cashier with an imitation gun and demanded cash, leaving with \u00a3200. \nHe also refused to pay a taxi fare and showed the driver a knife, as well as carrying out a street robbery.   \nHe says he now feels remorse for his victims. \n\"I was an offender,\" he says. \n\"Growing up I was a street kid. People shouldn't feel sorry for me but I have changed. I've been punished enough.\"\nIPPs were designed for the most violent and sexual offenders. \nBack in 2005, the Labour government thought they'd be used for around 900 offenders - but 6,000 people received the sentence. \nMany were kept in jail for years after their tariff expired. \nThe prison and parole system couldn't cope with the need to give inmates access to rehabilitation programmes in order to demonstrate they were safe to be let out.\nAccording to official probation documents, Maroni had a difficult childhood. \nHis mum was an alcoholic and drug user and her partner used to beat her and Maroni. \nHe missed three years of school and attempted to take his own life using his mother's drugs. \nSince he's been in custody, his mental health has deteriorated significantly - exacerbated, he says, by having a sentence which gave him no hope. \nHe's self-harmed, had panic attacks and says he's been diagnosed with a personality disorder and schizophrenia.\nHis application for parole has been rejected several times because the parole board thought he still posed a risk to the public. \nHe's due to have another hearing this summer and is feeling optimistic.\nSir David Lidington and Lord Clarke say setting a firm release date for IPP inmates would bring their treatment in line with prisoners on determinate sentences of a fixed length, but warn it could also mean \"letting out people who were still considered dangerous\". \nLord Blunkett, who as Labour home secretary introduced IPPs back in 2005, has expressed regret before about the way they were used for many more people than he intended or expected. \nHe has now told the World at One the fact there are still 1,900 people in jail on an IPPs \"weighs heavily on him\".\nFamilies want all those on IPPs with a minimum tariff of under five years - like Maroni - to have their cases reviewed and given a sentence with an end date. \nOnly then, they say, will the legacy of these \"disgraceful\" sentences end.\nThe Ministry of Justice said in a statement: \"The number of IPP prisoners has fallen by two-thirds since 2012 - and is down 13% in the last year.\n\"We are helping those still in custody progress towards release, but as a judge deemed them to be a high risk to the public, the independent Parole Board must decide if they are safe to leave prison.\""

      "tags": "Queen Elizabeth University Hospital,NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,Glasgow",
      "text": "An infection \"probably\" linked to Glasgow's children's hospital was the \"primary cause of death\" of a young cancer patient, the BBC has learned.\nInfections from contaminated water at the hospital were also found to have been an \"important contributory factor\" in another child's death.\nA review looked into the cases of 84 children who developed infections while undergoing treatment at the hospital.\nIt found that a third of infections \"probably\" originated in the hospital.\nAnd it said the rest were \"possibly\" acquired there.\nThe authors of the \"case note review\", which should be published next week, said they recognised that some families would be disappointed that they could not have \"greater certainty\" about the links between their child's infection and the hospital environment.\nThey said this was down to the limits of a retrospective review but also criticised the shortcomings in the data provided by the health board.\nThe review was commissioned by the health secretary as part of wider investigations into problems with the drainage and ventilation system at the \u00a3850m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital Campus, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children.\nAn official probe found \"widespread contamination\" in the water supply, with at least 23 children contracting bloodstream infections in the cancer wards in 2018.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde was placed in \"special measures\" in November 2019 and in January last year two experts were appointed to oversee a review of infections.\nAmong them was 10-year-old Milly Main who died in August 2017.\nMilly, who had leukaemia, underwent a successful stem cell transplant in July 2017 and was making a good recovery when the following month her Hickman line, a catheter used to administer drugs, became infected. Milly went into toxic shock and died some days later.\nHer death certificate lists a Stenotrophomonas infection of the Hickman line among the possible causes of death but her mother Kimberley Darroch says the family were kept in the dark about a potential link to contaminated water problems at the hospital. \nThe health board previously insisted it was impossible to determine the source of Milly's infection because there was no requirement to test the water supply at the time.\nThe case note review looked at how many children were affected by a particular type of serious infection caused by Gram-negative environmental (GNE) bacteria between 2015 and 2019. \nIt then looked to see whether it was possible to link these to the hospital environment.\nThe review does not name the children it investigated.\nBut it does say that one child was in the very early phase of a stem cell transplant and that a bacterial infection was the \"primary cause of death\".\nThe review says that although disease progress was a major factor it judged that GNE bacterium was a \"significant factor\" in the cause of death. It says the infection was \"probably\" related to the hospital environment.\nA further child death was noted to have occurred within six weeks of an infection episode. The bacterium was said to be \"implicated\" in the death. It was recorded as possible contributory factor in the death certificate.\nThe review looked at 84 children and 118 episodes of infection.\nThe report was critical of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for not having a system in place that would have helped establish whether there was a link between bacteria in a patient and the place where they were treated.\nIn statement, Milly Main's mother, Kimberley Darroch said: \"There is nothing that can bring Milly back and a tiny part of me still hoped that the link to the water supply wasn't true.\n\"Finally we are starting to get answers after all these years.\"\nProf John Cuddihy, whose daughter Molly survived a rare infection in 2018, told the BBC there had been significant failings on the part of management and leadership within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.\nHe said they had failed to adequately protect vulnerable children who were exposed to additional risk while undergoing treatment for cancers.\nProf Cuddihy said the report had been made possible \"due to the tenacity of families and those clinical staff who bravely exposed failings, at significant personal and professional cost\".\nHe said the report laid bare the impact of bacterial infection and the relationship with the environment at the hospital.\n\"This report identifies 84 cases and 118 episodes of bacterial infection- that's 84 critically ill, vulnerable children that have been exposed to significant additional risk, which has affected them physically, psychologically and emotionally,\" Prof Cuddihy said.  \n\"Sadly, the report also highlights that two of those children who died did so, at least in part, as a result of their infection.\""

      "text": "All children will be taught about racism and the contributions of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities, the education minister said.\nAlmost 35,000 people have called for Britain's colonial past to be taught in school lessons. \nUnder changes to the new curriculum the teaching of BAME histories will be mandatory, Kirsty Williams said.\nMs Williams said it would help pupils become \"informed citizens of the world\".\nHowever, Plaid Cymru argued the changes were not included in the school curriculum law, passed in the Senedd last week, but instead in a code which could be changed or got rid of by ministers. \nThe Welsh government said this was \"incorrect\" and the teaching of BAME stories would be required in every school.\nWales' new curriculum, set to be introduced in 2022, is based on six \"areas of learning and experience\" and does not set out exactly what schools should be teaching.\nHowever, the changes will now mean all learning areas will need to reflect the diverse experiences and contributions of BAME communities and individuals to both past and present Wales.\nFollowing worldwide protests after the death of George Floyd in US police custody, there were calls for greater recognition of Wales' role in colonialism and slavery to be taught in schools.\nProf Charlotte Williams, who led a working group set up by the Welsh government to look at how BAME contributions through history was taught in schools, said there was considerable evidence of \"racial inequality\" in Wales' education system.\nShe said the new curriculum was an opportunity for \"significant change\", and it was the right of \"every child to learn about histories and contributions that have shaped the Welsh nation\".\nIn a report published on Friday, Prof Williams said with schools able to set their own curriculum under the national framework BAME histories could \"continue to be marginalised or ignored\", unless made mandatory.\nWhile learning about diversity, identity and equality is mandatory under the new curriculum, there is no requirement for schools to teach pupils about slavery, the British Empire, or the Holocaust, Ms Williams writes.\nProf Williams said this was concerning as these areas were \"topics of central understanding to the histories of racism and diversity\".\nIn 2019, 12% of all pupils aged five and over came from minority ethnic backgrounds, but this differs widely across Wales, from 34.4% in Cardiff to 4.1% in Anglesey, according to Pupil Level Annual School Census data.\nFewer than 1% of teachers in Wales say they are black, Asian, or from other or mixed minority ethnic backgrounds, according to the 2019-20 school workforce census.\nForty of the 1,065 students who began training to become teachers in Wales in 2018-19 said they were from a minority ethnic group.\nProf Williams, who has previously spoken about growing up in Llandudno where her family were the only black family, said children were being \"failed\" by a lack of positive role models in schools and a curriculum that did not represent their histories.\nShe said all children should be able to learn about diverse history and talent regardless of their background or where they lived.\nThe report states that current resources to support the teaching of ethnic minority themes is disproportionately focused on slavery, colonialism and Empire, and that positive contributions and role models needed to be celebrated.\nThe report makes 51 recommendations for changes in the new curriculum and teacher training including:\nThe Welsh government has said all of the recommendations in the report had been accepted, and it had allocated \u00a3500,000 to help with their implementation.\nMs Williams said: \"Our new curriculum can only be enriched by revealing the diversity of perspectives and contributions made by the ethnic minority communities to the development of Wales across its history and in the present.\"\nAngel Ezeadum, member of UK Youth Parliament for Cardiff, said it was a relief that \"finally we are doing something\" to tackle racism and inequality.\nThe 16-year-old student said she hoped the changes would lead to the next generation of pupils having more opportunity to have a \"different mindset to perhaps their parents or grandparents\".\n\"If we want a society which is better for all, where there's equality, and there's fair representation then we need this,\" she said.\n\"It's massive in terms of shaping who young people are going to be in the future whether that's a police officer, a teacher, a politician.\"\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said that schools were not required to deliver Welsh history under the newly-passed curriculum law, which was a \"major flaw\".\nWhile teaching humanities is one of the learning areas under law, Welsh history and the teaching of BAME stories is included in statutory guidance, called the What Matters Code.\n\"It has the potential of being transformational in the way our society is developing...and it has been left out [of the law],\" Ms Gwenllian said.\n\"It has to be mandatory in our schools, otherwise we are not going to be equipping our young people with the information that they want, with the knowledge about where we have come from as a people and as a nation.\"\nHowever, the Welsh government said the What Matters Code was mandatory and must be taught to all pupils.\n\"It is incorrect to claim otherwise,\" a spokesman said."

She has every opportunity to do the right thing and resign.\n\"No first minister is above the fundamental principles of honesty and trust. There is no question that Nicola Sturgeon has misled parliament and broken the promises she made to tell the truth.\n \"The SNP's erratic outburst today against the committee shows the panicked spiral they are now in.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would not \"prejudge\" the outcome of the report\nBut he said that if the report found the first minister had misled parliament, and potentially broken the ministerial code, then it would be \"incredibly serious\".\n\"The code itself is clear, if the code has been breached the individual should resign,\" he said.\nHowever, Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the process had \"turned into a complete farce\", with \"party politics over-riding the public interest\".\nWithin a week, Holyrood will be on a break for the election and a six-week campaign for votes will be under way. \nWe know there will be arguments over coronavirus recovery and indyref2, but there will also be another major theme: truth and trust. \nThat debate will feed off the two reports due in the next few days on the Scottish government's mishandling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. \nWhen the Holyrood committee publishes its findings on Tuesday, we know the opposition majority will conclude that Nicola Sturgeon gave them a misleading account, which the first minister denies. \nA separate independent investigation by Ireland's former prosecution chief, James Hamilton, will decide whether or not the first minister broke conduct rules and recommend sanctions, if required. \nThe Conservatives have already decided Ms Sturgeon lied to parliament and should resign, and they intend to hold a vote of no confidence in her on Wednesday if she does not quit. \nWith the continued support of the Scottish Greens, the first minister can survive what she regards as a nakedly political attempt to oust her and let the public decide whether she should remain in office. \nThere has never been a Holyrood election campaign curtain-raiser anything like this. \nThe committee's convener, SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, expressed her anger that \"accounts of the conclusions of the draft report\" had been leaked to the media.\n\"I am dismayed by the damage this may do to the value of the committee's work, which I have long hoped would improve the treatment of the complainers of sexual harassment,\" she said.\n\"The selective leaking of particular committee recommendations has shifted the focus away from these goals, and the recommendations which seek to achieve it, and onto party political terrain which will likely frustrate, not assist, the women at the heart of this.\"\nThe inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants.\nThe former first minister was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses following a judicial review, and was subsequently acquitted of sexual assault charges in a High Court trial.\nA separate inquiry into whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code is being carried out by James Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer. He is also expected to publish his report in the coming days.\nYou can find out more about the background to this story on Panorama: Salmond v Sturgeon, available on iPlayer now."

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Health Minister Robin Swann says every adult in Northern Ireland will still get their first vaccine dose by the end of July.\nIt follows an expected reduction in the UK's Covid-19 vaccine supply.\nThat is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nMr Swann said officials were doing all they could to ensure any delays to the department's timeline were shortened as much as possible.\nSpeaking on BBC Newsline, Mr Swann said he did not expect any changes to the lifting of Northern Ireland's coronavirus restrictions in light of the vaccine supply.\n\"We don't put dates to anything and I think it's exactly these sorts of unforeseen circumstances that allow us to take that approach,\" he said.\n\"The announcements made on Tuesday in regards to the next phase of lifting restrictions won't be affected by the delay of this supply of vaccine.\n\"I don't think this delay should have an effect on what the executive wants to do in easing further restrictions.\"\nA paper from the Department of Health shows that the R number in Northern Ireland is currently at between 0.9-1.10.\nThe minister said it showed the rate of infection was still decreasing, which meant the executive had been allowed to progress with making some changes to the lockdown regulations.\n\"One of the things we've always been aware of is keeping R below one... considering where we were back in mid-December, early January we are still moving in the right direction,\" he added.\n\"That comes about by the observance of restrictions and regulations but also by greater uptake of the vaccine as well and when we look to the hope that the vaccine brings that will allow us to come out of an incredibly dark time.\"\nEarlier on Thursday, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme told the Stormont Assembly more Pfizer doses would be used until extra AstraZeneca jabs arrive.\nShe said anyone expecting a second dose or who had already booked their first would have their appointments honoured.\nFirst jabs would continue in April, if at a slightly reduced rate, she added.\nOn Thursday, another Covid-19-related death and 169 new cases of the virus were recorded  in Northern Ireland.\nThere were no coronavirus-related deaths reported in the Irish Republic on Thursday.\nHowever, there were 582 confirmed new cases of the virus in the country.\nVaccine delivery issues could put the rollout plan back by four weeks in a \"worst-case scenario\", Ms Donnelly told Stormont's Health Committee, but the delay was more likely to be about two weeks.\n\"The mitigation measures that we put in place we hope will only delay us by two weeks, so it won't have a huge impact,\" she said.\nIt had been hoped vaccinations would be on offer to all people over the age of 40 when a mass vaccination centre at Belfast's SSE Arena opened on 29 March, but this would likely be delayed by two weeks, said Ms Donnelly.\n\"It will very much depend on the remaining deliveries that we get from AstraZeneca,\" she said.\n\"We have tried to find some mitigation through further use of the Pfizer vaccine. \nMs Donnelly said three of Northern Ireland's five health trusts would now rely mainly on Pfizer doses until more AstraZeneca supplies arrived.\nOn Wednesday, NHS England warned there could be a \"significant reduction\" in the number of doses available in April.\nEarlier, Health Minister Robin Swann said Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout was ahead of schedule and would be able to adapt.\nNews of the UK vaccine shortage was frustrating, if not surprising, said the chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee in Northern Ireland.\n\"The pace of vaccination has depended on the supply from the outset,\" tweeted Dr Alan Stout.\n\"We've done so well, so far, that the vast majority of those people who are at risk have now had their first dose,\" He told The Nolan Show.\n\"If it does mean that the consequences of delaying a first dose to someone we know who is at less risk, then that's going to have to be a decision that's made to protect those second doses.\"\nNorthern Ireland was still on course to meet its target of having most adults vaccinated by June or July, said Justice Minister Naomi Long.\nMeanwhile, more than 300 pharmacies have signed up to be part of the vaccination scheme.\nOfficial launch of the rollout will begin on 30 March, although some pharmacies may start before then.\n\"Their contribution to getting as many people vaccinated as possible will be invaluable,\" said Mr Swann.\nThe chief executive of Community Pharmacy NI, Gerard Greene, said. \"The accessibility and reach of the community pharmacy network, with pharmacists as skilled vaccinators, means they are well equipped to take part in the vaccine programme.\"\nMr Greene called their inclusion in the programme \"a fantastic and welcome step forward\" and said that this will not affect other pharmacy services.\nCommunity pharmacies were used to having to deal with supply issues, he said, adding that the anticipated drop in vaccine supply was unlikely to undermine Northern Ireland's programme."

      "text": "US actor Armie Hammer has been accused of raping a woman in Los Angeles in 2017.\nThe woman, a 24-year-old named only as Effie, made the allegations during a virtual news conference on Thursday.\nHammer, 34, denied the allegations. His lawyer said they were \"outrageous\" and Hammer \"welcomes the opportunity to set the record straight\".\nLos Angeles police told the BBC Hammer was a suspect in a sexual assault investigation opened on 3 February.\nThe accuser broke down while reading a prepared statement about the allegations against Hammer, known for films including The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name.\nShe spoke alongside high-profile women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred, alleging she first met Hammer on Facebook in 2016, when she was 20.\n\"I fell in love with him instantly,\" she said. \nThe woman alleged that, as the relationship progressed, Hammer used \"manipulation tactics in order to exert control over me\".\nShe said he would \"test my devotion to him, finally removing and crossing my boundaries as he became increasingly more violent\".\nThe woman accused the actor of abusing her \"mentally, emotionally and sexually\". \nShe said the alleged rape happened on 24 April, 2017.\nShe said: \"Armie Hammer raped me for over four hours in Los Angeles, during which he repeatedly slapped my head against a wall, bruising my face.\n\"During those four hours, I tried to get away and he wouldn't let me. I thought that he was going to kill me. \n\"He then left with no concern for my wellbeing. I was completely in shock and I couldn't believe that someone I loved did that to me.\" \nShe said she was left suicidal by the alleged rape, adding she felt \"immense guilt\" at not speaking out sooner.\nIn a statement sent to the BBC, Hammer's lawyer Andrew Brettler dismissed the allegations.\nThe lawyer said all of Hammer's relations with the woman had been \"completely consensual, discussed and agreed upon in advance, and mutually participatory\". \nMr Brettler sent the BBC a screengrab of text messages purported to have been sent by the accuser that contained suggestions of extreme sexual behaviour. He said Hammer had responded to the woman, making it clear that he did not want to maintain that type of relationship with her.  \n\"[Her] attention-seeking and ill-advised legal bid will only make it more difficult for real victims of sexual violence to get the justice they deserve,\" the statement added.\nIn January, Hammer pulled out of a new film, Shotgun Wedding, with American actress and singer Jennifer Lopez after what he described as \"vicious and spurious online attacks against me\".\nHammer's starring role in the action comedy has been recast. He also left The Offer, a drama series about the making of The Godfather.\nHammer and his wife, TV host Elizabeth Chambers, announced their divorce in July 2020. Ms Chambers released a statement last month, saying she supported \"any victim of assault or abuse\"."

      "text": "The UK government is to make an unprecedented move to give the Northern Ireland secretary new powers to compel Stormont to implement abortion laws.\nNorthern Ireland's abortion laws changed last March after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution.\nBut the commissioning of full services has been stalled due to differences within the five-party executive.\nStormont and Westminster are facing legal action from the Human Rights Commission over the delay.\nThis latest development, first reported by the Guardian, will see Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis lay new regulations in Parliament early next week.\nThe move will let him direct Northern Ireland's Department of Health to commission the services.\nA Whitehall source said there was frustration and disappointment at the failure of the Northern Ireland Executive to act.\n\"It has not commissioned abortion services consistent with the regulations originally set out by the UK government nearly a year ago,\" the source said.\nThey added Mr Lewis was clear that the devolution settlement should not be a barrier.\nHowever, the move is likely to draw criticism from some of the Stormont parties.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and First Minister Arlene Foster and one of the party's MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson met the Northern Ireland secretary on Thursday.\nSpeaking afterwards, Sir Jeffrey said the government's move would \"raise serious questions about when and in what areas [it] can make interventions in a devolved administration\".\nHe said the DUP would \"vigorously oppose such steps\" and warned that the government \"should leave it with the devolved structures to make such decisions\".\nLate on Thursday night, Northern Ireland's Department of Health said Mr Swann's position was that the issue of abortion services was controversial and required the support of the whole executive.\n\"He does not believe that a ministerial decision to commission and fund abortion services would be defensible in court in the absence of executive approval,\" it added.\nThe timing of this move by Brandon Lewis is far from coincidental.\nIt's almost a year exactly since the UK government introduced the abortion laws that were supported by Westminster MPs but opposed by a number of Northern Ireland parties who accused No 10 of trampling over devolution.\nThe government remains bound by law to ensure the services are implemented and it's understood frustration was mounting behind the scenes at the slow pace within Stormont.\nThere is also an incoming legal challenge which may have focused minds in London.\nThis development will certainly turn up the political heat but it won't lead to imminent change as Mr Lewis will likely take the powers and wait to see how the executive reacts before deciding to go further.\nSinn F\u00e9in's Emma Sheerin called on the health minister to \"fulfil his legal obligations and responsibilities\" by commissioning abortion services.\nAlliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said it was \"bewildering\" that legislation approved last year had not been put into effect.\n\"The requirement in law and in treaty is for women in Northern Ireland to have the same access to health services as in the rest of the UK,\" she said.\n\"There is no excuse for any minister, either though action or inaction, to stand in the way of that.\"\nThe law changes meant abortion laws in Northern Ireland altered significantly last year, with terminations available in all circumstances of the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nIt is legal in other circumstances up to 24 weeks and beyond that for cases of non-fatal fetal disabilities and fatal fetal abnormalities.\nHowever, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is challenging the UK government, the Stormont executive and the Department of Health for delaying the commissioning of services.\nAt present health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England.\nThe DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion laws by Westminster, has proposed a piece of legislation at Stormont seeking to restrict abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities.\nIt passed its second reading on Monday with the support of a number of parties.\nSinn F\u00e9in abstained on that vote but has separately called for the Department of Health to commission full abortion services as required under the regulations.\nThe Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists view the issue as a matter of conscience for individual assembly members."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "text": "The Queen and Duchess of Cornwall have thanked volunteers for supporting people during the pandemic, saying they have been a \"great help\". \nThey took part in a video call to thank members of the Royal Voluntary Service to mark one year since it launched the NHS Volunteer Responders Scheme. \nThe Queen, patron of the RVS, said they had done \"wonderful work\", including delivering books to people. \nNearly one million volunteers have been recruited to the scheme. \nThey have helped with tasks such as picking up prescriptions and doing food shopping for those shielding and unable to leave their homes, as well as taking part in check-up calls. \n\"I think it's wonderful work,\" said the Queen. \"Thank you to everybody - and all the others too who have been volunteering. It has been a great help.\" \nOne of those on the call was retired police officer Tracy Clarke, who spoke about her work with the RVS Gateshead Home Library Service. She told them that the delivery of books had become a lifeline during the pandemic for those who loved reading. \nThe Queen said this must have been a great comfort and \"very helpful\", as \"books are very important to people\".\nCamilla, who is president of the RVS, told the volunteers: \"Thank you all very much for all you've done throughout the year, throughout the pandemic. We couldn't have done without you.\"\nRVS chief executive Catherine Johnstone, who hosted the call, told the Queen and duchess of her pride at how the UK had stepped forward to volunteer during the coronavirus pandemic. \nOne of the volunteers the royal pair spoke to was Anderson Akponeware, from Middlesbrough, who has also been studying for his PhD and home-schooling during the past year. \nHe told them: \"People have been living in their own small bubbles, and I wouldn't have known how isolated those small bubbles could be until I took on this role.\"\nMembers of the Royal Family, including Camilla, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex, have taken part in RVS \"check in and chat\" calls with those living alone or shielding during the pandemic. \nAhead of this week's call, Camilla said she had had \"lots of happy conversations\" with Doris Winfield, 86, who she met through the scheme and who died earlier this year. The pair were able to meet in person last year at the Royal Voluntary Service Lunch Club in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire.  \nThe Duchess of Cambridge is in regular contact with 85-year-old Len Gardner from Batley, Yorkshire, who she first spoke to last May through the NHS Volunteer Responder scheme, while the Countess of Wessex has been speaking to 89-year-old Edna Farley from Liverpool every fortnight. \nThe Queen has been patron of the RVS since 1952, when it was known as the Women's Voluntary Service (WVS). \nMeanwhile, Clarence House has said Camilla and the Prince of Wales will travel to Greece next week for an official two-day visit.\nDuring their visit to Athens, arranged at the request of the government, they will attend Bicentenary Independence Day celebrations, a reception at the National Gallery of Greece, a wreath-laying ceremony and a traditional military parade."

Perhaps it's less fixed desks and more casual meeting areas, and we need to consider colleague wellbeing, too,\" he said.\nHowever, he emphasised that plans to sell Waterside were still at a very early stage. It is thought the airline has only recently hired property consultants to evaluate options.\nIn a separate statement to the BBC, BA said on Thursday: \"The global pandemic has shown us that many of our colleagues enjoy working remotely and want to continue, and this has accelerated our approach to offering more agile and flexible ways of working.\n\"Our aim is to find a hybrid working model that suits our business, blending the best of office and remote working for our people. We've also re-structured our business to emerge from the crisis and are considering whether we still have the need for such a large headquarters building.\"\nThe move to hybrid working after the pandemic is growing. \nThe Nationwide building society has indicated that it does not intend to force people to return to the office if they have been successfully able to work from home during the pandemic.\nOil giant BP has told office-based staff they can spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease.\nAnd banks HSBC and Lloyds are among many other companies looking into split working arrangements. \nEarlier this month the boss of IWG, which provides office space across the world, told the BBC he expected hybrid working \"to become the norm\" for many companies.\nMark Dixon said: \"It works for companies, because it's a lot cheaper.

      "text": "As I write, nine members of the Scottish Parliament are still in a virtual meeting, discussing, voting, likely indeed arguing, over their conclusions on the future of the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.\nTheir inquiry is part of the machinations of a long running dispute between one of the most successful political duos this country has seen for decades, as the first minister and her predecessor, and very much former friend, have come to blows. Remind yourself what the very sorry saga is all about here.\nWhat we know from inside that committee room is that the MSPs have voted by a margin of one vote, 5-4, that Nicola Sturgeon misled them. \nBefore we see the final report, which may not come for a while, it's hard to know what caveats they have applied, precisely what the circumstances are that they describe. The details will matter. \nMs Sturgeon's team is already trying to dismiss the findings as a partisan attack, a predictable political play from a committee of MSPs, designed to damage the first minister, whose popularity they envy, who has been almost untouchable for so long. \nThe findings they really fear are from the separate Hamilton Inquiry, being carried out by an independent lawyer in to whether she broke the rules that govern ministers' behaviour. \nIf she's found to have done that, convention suggests she would have to resign. \nIt is clear that Nicola Sturgeon has no intention of giving into opposition demands out there to get her to quit on the basis of the MSPs' conclusions.  \nOf course this is intensely political, it's not just about who said what, when and where. \nBut a public finding from a parliamentary committee that she misled them can't just be brushed away. \nIt's a serious accusation from a group of senior politicians after an investigation that looked at thousands of pages of evidence. \nIt's a huge distraction just before the official start of vital Scottish elections. It underlines the bitter lines drawn inside the SNP during this saga. \nAnd it's damaging to the reputation of one of the country's most important politicians, whose personal standing is key not just to what happens in Scotland, but what happens to the whole of the UK. \nThe SNP has been all powerful under Ms Sturgeon's leadership. And her personal profile has been a vital part of creating a powerful political sense, although importantly never a certainty, that another referendum on Scottish independence was somehow inevitable. \nIf the SNP clinches a majority in May, it's her intention to use that to claim a mandate for another ballot. (Remember, it is also the UK government's firm intention to say no, which is, as things stand, its legal right.) \nBut in turn, anything that tarnishes her, could damage the SNP's standing in those May elections. \nAnd anything that harms her credibility, chips away at the sometimes lazy political sentiment, that the events of the last few years have set Scotland firmly on a path out of the UK. \nThe arguments of a group of politicians won't settle all of this. \nBut what they decide is one part of the overall wrangle over the future of the union itself.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson will get his first Covid jab today - after reassuring the public that it was safe. Mr Johnson, 56, will have the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, which has been subject to controversy in the EU. Some 13 countries stopped using it when a small number of people got blood clots after being vaccinated. But reviews by UK and EU regulators say the jab is safe - blood clots can occur naturally, and there seems to be no link to the vaccine. Almost all 13 countries will resume using the jab, and Mr Johnson said: \"The thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it is so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes.\" Mr Johnson also said the plan to end lockdown in England would not change, despite an upcoming drop in vaccine supply. Watch his comments below.\nThe government borrowed \u00a319.1bn last month - the highest figure for February since records began in 1993 - as the cost of the pandemic mounts. The figure was up \u00a317.6bn from the same month a year earlier. This graph, produced last month, shows how public sector net debt has increased in the past year.\nParis is set to go into a month-long Covid lockdown as France fears a third wave of infections. Another 15 regions in the country will also be placed under the same measures from midnight on Friday. Non-essential businesses will be forced to close but schools will remain open. People will be allowed to exercise outdoors within 10km (6 miles) of their home.\nNominees for this year's Oscars have been told that appearing by Zoom will not be an option. The 93rd Academy Awards are due to take place on 25 April in Los Angeles, and a letter to nominees said: \"For those of you unable to attend because of scheduling or continued uneasiness about travelling, we want you to know there will not be an option to Zoom in for the show. We are going to great lengths to provide a safe and enjoyable evening for all of you in person, as well as for all the millions of film fans around the world, and we feel the virtual thing will diminish those efforts.\"\nOver the past year, more than 30,000 nursing students have stepped forward and volunteered to work for the NHS during the coronavirus pandemic.

But we've had so much last-minute changes it's almost what we've come to expect.\"\n\"We've lost income, I haven't been paid since 2019 because everything I have has gone into running the business,\" she said.\n\"People need certainty. At the moment customers are debating whether or not to come thinking the pub won't be open, or the takeaway won't be available.\"\n\"We have a lot of regular guests who have all been very supportive. And they're looking forward to coming back,\" she said.\n\"The business has been running for 17 years, some of them have become like family. There have been first dates, proposals, and families brought to stay.\"\nHywel James Davies, who runs the South Wales Touring Park in Llanelli, said: \"I'm not sure that two days is enough time to prepare everything to open up but we'll cross our fingers and hope that everything will go to plan.\"\nMr Davies and his sister Cathrin have made the most of the lockdown by making improvements to the site for when customers come back.\n\"It's been very hard. But it's looking good this year, we're booked up,\" he said.\n\"I'm looking forward to reopening to tell the truth. It's what we want, for people to come on their holidays and enjoy their stay with us.\"\nMr Drakeford also refused to rule out local lockdown restrictions in two hot spot areas in Wales, after a spike in cases.\nRates on Anglesey stand at 127.1 for every 100,000 people, and 147.5 in Merthyr Tydfil.\nThose higher levels of infection compare with an average falling rate for Wales of 43.7 per 100,000 people.\nMr Drakeford said the rise in cases in the communities was linked to \"household and social mixing\", and there were concerns people were not engaging with contact tracers.\nA delayed shipment from India to the UK could also impact the easing of lockdown, the first minister warned.\nAn estimated 250,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca doses due to arrive in Wales by mid-April are set to be delivered a month late.\nMr Drakeford said he could not pretend the delayed doses would \"have no affect at all\".\nFrom Monday garden centres will be allowed to reopen, and supermarkets to sell \"non-essential goods\", under slight easing of lockdown rules.\nMr Drakeford said he hoped more could be allowed - including outdoor children's activities and the reopening of castle grounds - in coming weeks if cases continued to fall.\n\"Of course our ability to lift restrictions is linked to the successful vaccination programme,\" he said.\n\"But our hope must be that we continue to see the position in Wales [as] stable and reducing, and that we will continue to have the headroom to lift restrictions in the way that we hope.\"\nHe said he was confident that no vaccine appointments would be cancelled due to the delay, but that the loss of such a large amount of doses would have an effect.\n\"We are doing everything we can to mitigate the effect on appointments for people to get vaccinated, there are a number of different ways in which we are looking to do that,\" he said.\nReacting to the briefing, the Conservative group leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies said it was \"unfair\" for supermarkets to be allowed to sell non-essential goods, and called for the high street to reopen.\n\"If he feels it's safe for supermarkets why persecute the high street and say the high street can't do that?\" he said.\nMember of the Senedd for Ynys Mon Rhun ap Iorwerth said while he did not want to see his area placed under local lockdown again, the option was needed to stop case rates rising further.\nThe Plaid Cymru MS called for more support for people who were told to self-isolate in the area."

That's why we would have published a roadmap, with windows of opportunity, showing a clear path to the light at the end the Covid tunnel.\"\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"We have a situation in Wales where businesses often don't know until the last minute if they're going to be able to open. \n\"Even with this revised guidance, it is not clear what criteria need to be met for lifting of some restrictions.\n\"The balance between providing hope and raising false expectations is a fine line, but this uncertainty and lack of ability to forward plan even by a few weeks is making this more challenging for the public and for businesses.\""

We needed paramedics with expertise and better equipment there as quickly as possible,\" he said. \nThe inquiry was told \"cleaning cloths or sponges\" were used as improvised bandages.\nSgt Hare spoke to the casualties to reassure them and was recorded on his body-worn camera saying to one person: \"We're getting ambulances and medics to you\u2026 just hang in there.\" \nMinutes later he was heard using an expletive and saying to a police officer that they \"need the... medics\".\nAt one stage an officer told him: \"They've [paramedics] just turned up but they're dealing with the ones outside.\"\nThe inquiry heard Sgt Hare and his team only had a small first aid box containing \"a few bandages and plasters\" when they ran into Victoria Station. \nHe said he had only received basic first-aid training, which did not include putting on tourniquets or triaging patients.\nWhen asked whether the emergency services worked well together in the City Room in the immediate aftermath of the bombing, Sgt Hare said: \"Those who were in the room were trying their best to communicate and doing whatever we could there.\"\nHe said he knew there were risks to him and his team from a secondary device but he said this risk was outweighed by the need to help those who were injured.\nSgt Hare also told the hearing that \"no training could have prepared us for what happened\".\nThe inquiry continues. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Care workers across the UK who have to sleep at their workplace in case they are needed are not entitled to the minimum wage for their whole shift, the Supreme Court has ruled. \nThe case was brought by Clare Tomlinson-Blake against the learning disability charity, Mencap.\nIf she had won, care providers feared an estimated \u00a3400m bill for backpay, which they said they could not afford.\nThe case sought to overturn a 2018 Court of Appeal ruling. \nHer union, Unison, argued on her behalf that care staff should get the minimum wage for nightshifts even if they are asleep. \nMs Tomlinson-Blake told the BBC she was \"stunned\" by the ruling. \n\"I was deeply disappointed. I thought this was an opportunity for things to change, and for health and social care workers to start to be valued more, and the work that they do, which is the most important work that you can ever do,\" she said.\n\"Caring for another person that should be valued and just isn't being.\"\nShe added: \"Sleep-in shifts aren't about just being on call. It's work. \n\"Staff are constantly on guard to protect the most vulnerable in society. The sound of a cough in the night could mean someone's in danger.\"\nUnison general secretary Christina McAnea said: \"No-one is a winner from today's judgement.\n\"Everyone loses until the government intervenes to mend a broken system that relies on paying skilled staff a pittance.\"\nMrs Tomlinson-Blake, from East Yorkshire, was paid less than \u00a330 by Mencap for a sleep-in shift between 22:00 and 07:00. \nAlthough she could sleep, she was expected to keep a \"listening ear\" out for the home's residents and provide them with support if needed during the night. \nOver 16 months, she was called on six times, receiving no extra money for the first hour she was disturbed, although after that she was paid at the full day-time rate.\nA second case was brought by John Shannon, a Surrey care worker whose case was heard at the same time as Mrs Tomlinson-Blake's. \nHis case against his former employers was also dismissed.\nThe Supreme Court concluded there was an exemption in national minimum wage legislation which applied to sleep-ins.   \nIn the court's written ruling, Lady Arden said that \"sleep-in workers... are not doing time work for the purposes of the national minimum wage if they are not awake\".\nEdel Harris, chief executive of Mencap, said: \"Support workers within Mencap and across the sector do an exceptional job.\n\"They are dedicated in their care for people with a learning disability and should be paid more.\"\nBut she added: \"It is no exaggeration to say that if the ruling had been different, it would have severely impacted on a sector which is already underfunded and stretched to breaking point.\n\"Some providers would have gone bust and, ultimately, the people who rely on care would have suffered.\" \nA Downing Street spokesman praised the \"tireless\" work of care workers but would not say whether social care reforms, promised this year, would address the issue of overnight pay. \n\"We are aware of the judgement from the Supreme Court,\" said the spokesman. \n\"Care workers perform a vital role and they have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to support our most vulnerable, and we are committed to supporting them.\"\nLiz Kendall, Labour's shadow minister for social care, said the ruling showed the law on sleep-in shifts was \"unfair and in urgent need of updating\".  \n\"This must form a part of the social care reforms we expect from ministers later this year,\" said Ms Kendall.

      "text": "A probationary police officer who assaulted a woman in a \"terrifying\" attack has been given a curfew, prompting criticism he was not jailed.\nWest Midlands Police PC Oliver Banfield grabbed and manhandled Emma Homer last July while drunk. He has been suspended and faces disciplinary action.\nThe investigating force has apologised for delays in the prosecution.\nLabour MP Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: \"Must have been terrifying for her... but no prison sentence.\"\nMs Homer said the attack had left her with \"anxiety, insomnia and stress\" and her family said they were \"disappointed\" with 25-year-old Banfield's sentence, a night-time curfew.\nDuring the sentencing hearing at Leicester Magistrates' Court, CCTV was shown in which Banfield could be seen shouting at Ms Homer.\nHe is seen grabbing her and forcing her to the floor during the assault in the early hours of 26 July in Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire.\nIn her victim personal statement which was read out in court, she said she thought he was \"fulfilling a violent cop movie fantasy\". \nDescribing the assault, Ms Homer, 37, said: \"I often ask myself if the impact of the attack would have been so severe if my assailant was not a police officer.\n\"During the assault as I struggled to get to safety, I was sure this drunk man was fulfilling a violent cop movie fantasy.\n\"To be verbally abused with misogynistic slang, grabbed by the neck, and forced to the floor on a dark road by a drunk man a foot taller than me is terrifying, but to then find that he was a police officer shook my belief system to its core.\"\nShe said: \"I considered myself a confident, relaxed, and independent wife and mother, but since the attack I live with constant anxiety.\n\"I have changed simple things like my route home, and I have had to ask my family not to discuss the case as it sends me into a panic attack - indeed whenever the subject is brought up I feel a rush of anxiety and a tightening at my throat.\"\nWarwickshire Police said it had personally apologised to Ms Homer for delays in the investigation. \nInitially the CPS said there was not enough evidence to bring a prosecution. But after Ms Homer appealed, further inquiries were made and Banfield was charged. \nWarwickshire's Chief Superintendent Ben Smith said the force recognised \"the strength of feeling that has come about as a result of Sarah Everard's tragic death and understand the concerns relating to violence against women and girls nationally\".\nAnd he added: \"We acknowledge that, due to internal process errors, the initial response to the report of the assault was not as swift as it should have been and an apology has been issued with regards to this.\"\nBanfield pleaded guilty to assault by beating at a hearing in January and at Friday's hearing received a 14-week curfew order banning him from leaving his house between 19:00 and 07:00. He was also ordered to pay his victim \u00a3500 compensation as well as a victim surcharge and court costs.\nMs Homer's family said a night-time curfew during lockdown was \"not really a punishment at all\".\nCriticising the non-custodial sentence in a tweet, Ms Harman wrote: \"He continues in post. WMPolice (West Midlands Police) must review.\n\"This is proof, if any needed, that system fails women and protects men.\"\nIn a statement, West Midlands Police said Banfield, of Bidford-on-Avon, had been suspended from duty and would now face charges of gross misconduct. \nDeputy Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine said: \"Our role is to protect the public, who should be able to trust us. We therefore hold all our officers to the highest standards and we will take appropriate action against anyone whose actions fall below what is expected.\" \nThe West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said he had asked Chief Constable Sir David Thompson to brief him on steps taken by the force.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Their public comments have made that clear.\n\"So this very partisan leak tonight before they've actually finalised the report is not that surprising.\n\"Let's wait and see the final report, but more importantly the question of whether or not I breached the ministerial code is being considered independently by James Hamilton and I hope and expect he will publish that report soon.\"\nMr Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer, has been specifically examining whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code, which says that any minister who knowingly misleads parliament would be \"expected to offer their resignation\".\nHis inquiry is separate from the committee and is also expected to publish its report in the coming days. \nThe cross-party committee includes four SNP MSPs, two Conservatives, one Labour, one Liberal Democrat and independent Andy Wightman.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Parliament said the committee was still finalising its report, and it would not make any comment until it was published.\nMs Sturgeon and Mr Salmond - her predecessor as first minister and SNP leader - have both taken part  in lengthy evidence sessions in front of the committee in recent weeks. \nMr Salmond claimed to have been the victim of a \"malicious scheme\" drawn up by figures within the SNP who are close to Ms Sturgeon. \nBut Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that any suggestion there had been conspiracy were \"absurd\", and insisted she had not been out to \"get\" Mr Salmond. \nShe told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that Mr Salmond and his \"cronies\" In the \"old boys' club\" had been spinning \"conspiracy theories\" which opposition politicians had bought into.\nIt came after Conservative MP David Davis - a longstanding friend of Mr Salmond - used parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons to read out messages that he suggested showed a \"concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints\" against the former first minister.\nNicola Sturgeon did not intervene in the investigation into harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. The dispute is about whether or not she was ever prepared to. \nAlex Salmond claims she was and is backed up in that by his lawyer, Duncan Hamilton who went with him to see Nicola Sturgeon on 2 April 2018. \nNicola Sturgeon claims she made clear an intervention would not be possible, although she has also acknowledged that in trying to let Mr Salmond down gently she may not have been blunt enough. \nHer testimony is understood to be supported by written evidence from one of her colleagues, shared with the committee in private. \nThe opposition majority appears to have found Team Salmond's evidence more persuasive. SNP members refuse to accept Team Sturgeon has given a misleading account. \nWith the committee divided along party lines over the first minister's conduct, the conclusions of James Hamilton - the Irish lawyer who's independently examining the evidence - gain ever greater importance. \nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"All the evidence points to the fact that Nicola Sturgeon misled parliament, misled the people of Scotland and has to resign.\n\"I have said for weeks that evidence against Nicola Sturgeon has been mounting, it has been growing and it is clear she has breached the ministerial code. \n\"You cannot continue as first minister of Scotland if you have misled Parliament and breached the ministerial code.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said it would be \"incredibly serious\" if the committee concluded that the first minister had misled parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code. \nHe added: \"This is about the integrity of our Scottish Parliament and upholding standards in public life.\"\nAnd you can find out more about the background to this story on Panorama: Salmond v Sturgeon, available on iPlayer now."

Mizzima's operating licence was revoked by the military government earlier this month. \nThe men who detained the journalists arrived in an unmarked van at around midday local time (05:30 GMT) on Friday and demanded to see them. The BBC has been unable to contact Aung Thura since. \n\"The BBC takes the safety of all its staff in Myanmar very seriously and we are doing everything we can to find Aung Thura,\" the corporation said in a statement. \n\"We call on the authorities to help locate him and confirm that he is safe.   Aung Thura is an accredited BBC journalist with many years of reporting experience covering events in Nay Pyi Taw.\" \nForty journalists have been arrested since a military coup on 1 February, which saw the detention of elected civilian leaders including Aung San Suu Kyi.

      "tags": "Abortion,Abortion in Northern Ireland",
      "text": "A move by the UK government to compel Stormont to implement abortion laws will have \"serious consequences for devolution\", a DUP MP has said.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson said it would be a \"very serious breach of the devolution settlement\".\nWestminster is planning to give Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis new powers to take such action.\nNorthern Ireland's abortion laws changed last March after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution.\nSpeaking on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, the DUP leader in the House of Commons, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the action should be a concern even for those who support the provision of abortion services. \nHe said people \"should recognise the danger of what the secretary of state is doing here\" and \"if he can do it on this, then it could happen on many other areas\". \nBBC News NI understands that Northern Ireland's attorney general advised the Stormont executive that commissioning abortion services could be regarded as a controversial matter under the terms of the ministerial code.\nThe code states issues which are \"significant or controversial\" must be brought to the executive.   \nSome Stormont parties had been calling on Health Minister Robin Swann to commission the services.\nBut he has maintained that it requires the support of the whole executive.\nIt is believed Attorney General Brenda King gave the advice to Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey, who asked her whether Mr Swann was required to get approval of the executive before setting up abortion services through the Department of Health.\nIt is understood Ms King's view was that if Mr Swann acted without consensus of the full executive, there was a risk of a legal challenge.\nA statement issued earlier by the Department of Health reflected this, and stated that Mr Swann's position was that the issue of abortion services was controversial and required the support of the whole executive.\n\"He does not believe that a ministerial decision to commission and fund abortion services would be defensible in court in the absence of executive approval,\" it added.\nWhile the law was passed last March, commissioning of full services has been stalled due to differences within the five-party executive.\nThis latest development, first reported by the Guardian, will see the NI secretary lay new regulations in Parliament early next week.\nThe move will let him direct Northern Ireland's Department of Health to commission the services.\nStormont and Westminster are also facing legal action from the Human Rights Commission over the delay.\nThe law changes meant abortion laws in Northern Ireland altered significantly last year, with terminations available in all circumstances of the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nIt is legal in other circumstances up to 24 weeks and beyond that for cases of non-fatal fetal disabilities and fatal fetal abnormalities.\nAlliance Party assembly member (MLA) Paula Bradshaw said the responsibility for providing abortion services lay with the health minister.\nShe said he had the power, responsibility and legal duty to provide a \"comprehensive framework for our healthcare professionals to operate within\". \nMs Bradshaw said while she believed in devolution, she welcomed the intervention of the NI secretary.\nAgriculture Minister Edwin Poots, of the DUP, wrote on social media the UK government \"would do well to listen to first minister on this issue\" and that there was anger among assembly members at \"this act of destruction on the devolution settlement\".\nThe Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, Steve Aiken, said the \"controversial\" issue of abortion should be dealt with by the whole executive. \n\"Any unilateral decision by the health minister to commission and fund new abortion services without executive approval would be a breach of the Northern Ireland Act and the Ministerial Code,\" he said.\nHe added that it was \"deeply regrettable that some political parties are seeking to score points on such a sensitive issue\".\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was a \"matter of regret\" the executive had not been able to \"commission services in line with its legal obligations\". \n\"The SDLP has been warning for weeks that this British government has shown no restraint when it comes to interfering with the devolution settlement,\" he said. \nMs Hargey said it was \"unfortunate and unnecessary\" that the action was not able to be taken locally. \nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MLA said the \"executive as a whole, and certainly those parties who are blocking the commissioning of these services, need to be implementing them as soon as possible\". \nShe said she had unsuccessfully tried to have the issue placed on the agenda for the executive last week, and would try again for next week. \nThe Church of Ireland said the move was \"unjustified\" now Stormont was sitting again. \nArchbishop of Armagh John McDowell said it was \"clearly a devolved matter\".\nThe Presbyterian Church said it would \"seriously undermine\" devolution and called on Mr Lewis to withdraw the proposal. \nAt present health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England.\nThe DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The prime minister is to receive his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after reassuring the public it was \"safe\".\nBoris Johnson, 56, has urged people to get inoculated and said England's roadmap out of lockdown was \"on track\".\nHe said there was \"no change\" to the plan despite a drop in vaccine supply.\nSeveral European countries are to resume using the AstraZeneca jab after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) confirmed it was \"safe and effective\".\nThe regulator reviewed the vaccine amid fears about blood clots, but said it was \"not associated\" with a higher risk and the benefits outweighed any risks.\nMr Johnson told a Downing Street conference on Thursday that the AstraZeneca jab was safe but \"the thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it is so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes\".\nThe prime minister was himself treated in hospital for Covid-19 in April 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic.\n\"The way to ensure this [lockdown easing] happens is to get that jab when your turn comes, so let's get the jab done,\" he said.\nProf Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said there were \"anecdotal reports\" of small numbers of people not turning up for vaccine appointments following the controversy over the AstraZeneca jab in Europe.\nBut he said he expected many of those would decide to get the jab after \"a pause for thought\", adding that Covid was still a \"very dangerous disease\".\n\"People dying, people getting significant blood clotting problems, that's one of the risks of Covid, people having long-term physical and mental effects from Covid,\" he said. \nMr Johnson said England's progress towards leaving restrictions on daily life was \"unchecked\" by vaccine supply issues, where fewer doses have arrived from India than initially expected.\nThere were often delays with vaccine rollout programmes, he said, and he stressed the Indian government had not stopped any exports.\nProf Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said while the delay was \"disappointing\" he did not think it would have \"an enormous effect\" on the rollout. \nHowever, he warned the UK needed to keep variants of concern \"at bay\" until it could update vaccines and roll them out to the whole population. \nProf Ferguson, who is a member of the government's SPI-M modelling group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there should be particular concern about cases being imported from France, where infection levels are increasing. \nHe added that 5-10% of cases in France were the South African variant, which is of concern because it could be more resistant to current vaccines. \nBut Prof Ferguson suggested that adding France to the \"red list\" of countries, from which arrivals are required to quarantine in a hotel, would not be \"practical\" given the amount of essential trade between the UK and France. \nInstead he said \"a more bespoke arrangement\" to mitigate the risks, perhaps including testing of arrivals, would be needed. \nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden said rising infection rates in Europe should act as a \"wake-up call\" and the travel red list was kept under \"regular review\". \nThe European medical regulator had reviewed the AstraZeneca jab after 13 countries in Europe suspended its use over fears about blood clots in a very small number of patients.\nFrance, Germany and Italy, along with Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania, are to resume use of the jab on Friday while Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands will do so next week.\nBut Norway, Sweden and Denmark have said they will continue to pause the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine while they conduct their own independent reviews.\nLike his UK counterpart, French Prime Minister Jean Castex will receive the AstraZeneca vaccine in an effort to sway a doubtful French public.\nSir Kent Woods, former chairman of the EMA, told BBC Breakfast the pause of the rollout of the AstraZeneca jab in some European countries was \"unfortunate\" because it could damage public confidence. \nProf Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group, said the EMA findings would help \"rebuild confidence\" and it was \"reassuring\" that safety monitoring was taking place. \nIn the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) also concluded that any link between the jab and clots was unproven.\nThe MHRA and the EMA say people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised but anyone with a headache lasting more than four days after vaccination should seek medical advice, as a precaution.\nThe same advice applies if someone develops unusual bruising.\nThat is because the regulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain.\nIt is this type of clot that triggered some European countries to pause rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIn the UK, five cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT), among 11 million people who have received the vaccine, occurred in men aged between 19 and 59. One of these was fatal.\nThe EMA has received an additional 13 reports of CSVT.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to continue using the vaccine, and is due to release the results of its own review into the vaccine's safety later on Friday.\nMeanwhile, the UK saw 7% more deaths than would be expected in 2020 based on the previous five years, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics covering up to mid-December. \nIt experienced one of the worst death rates in Europe in the first half of 2020 but has since been overtaken by Poland, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.

      "title": "Covid deaths: Why is the UK's death toll so bad?",
      "tags": "Mers virus,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 100,000 people in the UK have died from a virus, that, this time last year, felt like a far-off foreign threat. How did we come to be one of the countries with the worst death tolls?\nThere is no quick answer to that question, and there is sure to be a long and detailed public inquiry once the pandemic is over. But there are plenty of clues that, when pieced together, help build a picture of why the UK has reached this devastating number.\nSome will point a finger at the government - its decision to lock-down later than much of western Europe, the stuttering start to its test-and-trace network and the lack of protection afforded to care home residents.\nOthers will spotlight deeper rooted problems with British society - its poor state of public health, with high levels of obesity, for example.\nOthers, still, will note that some of the UK's great strengths - its position as a vibrant hub for international air travel, its ethnically diverse and densely-packed urban populations - exposed its vulnerability to a virus that spreads effortlessly between people.\nIn some people's eyes, the UK's island status might have helped it.  New Zealand, Australia and Taiwan managed to stop the virus getting a foothold and deaths have been kept to a minimum - Australia has seen fewer deaths throughout the pandemic than the UK is recording every day on average.\nAll introduced strict border restrictions immediately and lockdowns to contain the virus before it had spread. The UK did not. It was not until June that quarantine rules were introduced for all arrivals and even then travel corridors were soon set up, relaxing the rules for travellers from certain countries. Only this month were these scrapped.\nProf Devi Sridhar, an expert in public health from Edinburgh University, is one of those who has been critical of the approach the UK has taken from the start.\nShe says the UK, like much of Europe, was \"complacent\" about the threat of infectious disease -  choosing to treat the new coronavirus \"like flu\" and allowing it to spread, while talking about the desire to achieve herd immunity.\nThis all changed in late March, when a full lockdown eventually came. But there was a crucial delay of a week which is estimated to have cost more than 20,000 lives, according to government modeller Prof Neil Ferguson, because of how quickly infection rates were doubling at that point. \nThis, of course, is said with the benefit of hindsight. Government modellers themselves acknowledge the data was \"really quite poor\" making it difficult to make a decision that would have significant repercussions. It is a point acknowledged by Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser. Speaking in the summer he said there had been \"very limited information\" in early March.\nBy then, the virus was ripping through care homes. Around 30% of deaths in the first wave happened in care homes; 40% if you include care home residents who died in hospital.\nThose at the heart of government acknowledge mistakes were made. UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said recently: \"The lesson is go earlier than you think you want to, go harder than you think you want to, and go a bit broader than you think you want to in terms of applying the restrictions.\"\nBy May, restrictions were beginning to be eased. But was this too soon?\nThe government seized on the relative lull to focus on building what the prime minister promised would be a \"world-beating\" test-and-trace system. The idea was that new outbreaks could be nipped in the bud, with comprehensive tracking by a centralised team of tracers.\nThe mere fact this had to be done some months after the virus had struck, illustrates another factor behind the high number of deaths - the UK was simply not prepared for a pandemic of this nature in the way some Asian nations had been. Countries such as South Korea and Taiwan had established test-and-trace systems in place that were ready to be activated.\nThe UK had a chance to bed in its system in the summer but it was riven with teething problems, with tracers struggling to reach many contacts and the testing capacity slowing down as demand rose.\nLow levels of infection over the summer had created a false sense of security.\nDesperate to boost the economy, the government launched the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, offering people discounted meals out during August. To what extent it contributed to the rise in the autumn is much argued about but certainly some doctors blame it in part for an increase in patients seen.\nThe truth is the virus never went away. Testing in the summer showed even at the lowest levels there were still around 500 cases a day being diagnosed - and random testing in the population subsequently showed the true level may have been twice that.\nIn late August around 1,000 people a day were testing positive. By mid-September that had trebled and from there it rose five-fold to 15,000 by mid October. The numbers testing positive have never returned below 10,000 a day on average since.\nAnother decision that has been heavily criticised was the refusal of ministers to introduce a short two-week lockdown, or \"circuit breaker\", in September - despite their advisers on Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) recommending such a step. The argument was it would have set the spread of the virus back by at least a month, giving test and trace time to regroup.\nWales, however, did introduce its own \"fire-breaker\" - a 17-day lockdown in October. It got infection rates down, but as soon as it was lifted they rebounded. This is, of course, why lockdowns have been criticised.\nEdinburgh University infectious diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, one of the modellers who feeds data into Sage, is on the record in the autumn questioning the logic of them for this very reason. It remains up for debate how effective a circuit-breaker would actually have been.\nThis after all is the time of year when respiratory illnesses start to increase. Schools had returned as had university students, creating new environments for the novel coronavirus to spread.\nWhen a lockdown was eventually introduced in England in November it was to last four weeks, with Sage members lamenting the delay. \"The absence of a decision is a decision in itself,\" says Wellcome Trust director Sir Jeremy Farrar.\nBut even before that lockdown was lifted cases had started going up in the south-east of England. Within weeks it became clear what was happening. The virus had mutated and a new faster-spreading variant was on the rise. \nBy mid-December the clamour for lockdown was growing again, but the plan for a Christmas relaxation of restrictions had already been announced. In every nation of the UK, ministers waited.\nAt the start of 2021, with hospital admissions rising rapidly, the UK's four chief medical officers intervened, issuing a joint statement warning the NHS was at \"material risk\" of being overwhelmed. Within hours the UK was back in lockdown.\nWhat has struck some is just how similar the mistakes have been in terms of locking down late. \n\"It will take years to unpick why Covid has gone so badly in the UK,\" says University College London infectious diseases expert Dr Neil Stone. \"But the failure to learn from wave one stands out.\"\nBut it must also be recognised that there are factors outside the control of the government - certainly in terms of its pandemic response - that have contributed to the high number of deaths.\nOne of the reasons the virus was able to take a hold and spread so quickly was because of geography and the fact the UK - and London in particular - is a global hub. Genetic analysis has shown the virus was brought into the UK on at least 1,300 separate occasions, mainly from France, Spain and Italy, by the end of March. \nIt was here before we knew it. That's not something Australia or New Zealand had to deal with on such a scale. \nDensity of population is also a factor. The UK is among the 10 most densely populated big nations - those with populations of more than 20 million. What is more, our cities are more inter-connected than they are in many places.\nIt meant the virus was able to seed everywhere quite quickly. Contrast this with Italy which saw the vast majority of cases in the north of the country in the first wave.\nThe ageing population also needs to be taken into account. Once you do this, and adjust for the size of the population - known as age-standardised mortality - deaths have risen, but not by as much as some of the headline figures suggest.\nThe health of the nation has also been a factor. The UK has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world. And obesity increases the risk of hospitalisation and death, according to Public Health England. One study found the risk of death was almost double for those who are severely obese.\nConditions such as diabetes, kidney disease and respiratory problems also increase the risk - a fifth of Covid deaths have listed diabetes on the death certificate.\nAgain the UK has relatively high rates of these illnesses.\nBut many have argued that these high levels of ill-health have been compounded by the levels of inequality in the UK.\nLevels of ill health and life expectancy have always been worst in the poorest areas, but the pandemic certainly seems to have exacerbated this.\nOffice for National Statistics data shows mortality rates have been twice as high in deprived areas as they have been in wealthy areas. The Health Foundation is carrying out its own inquiry into the issue, arguing the Covid death toll needs to be seen through the \"lens\" of inequality to fully understand it.\nIt is something that has also been raised by Prof Michael Marmot, one of the country's leading experts on health inequalities. \"The UK's dismal record is telling us something important about our society.\"\nAll photographs subject to copyright\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by bereavement, here is a list of organisations that may be able to help."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow.\nOfficials have warned of a huge rise in coronavirus cases in Germany as continental Europe braces itself for a third wave of infections. Germany's public health body said highly contagious variants of the virus could force the country back into lockdown. Other countries, including France and Poland, have already reintroduced restrictions. Europe lacks the vaccines needed to significantly reduce cases, said German Health Minister Jens Spahn. Only 8% of Germany's population has received a first dose of the vaccine so far. The government resumed the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab on Friday. It had been put on hold over fears of possible side effects. \nNew figures show the UK death rate during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic was not the worst in Europe, but it was one of the 10 worst-affected countries. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that by the end of June 2020, the UK had the highest excess mortality in Europe - meaning the number of deaths was above the average for that time of year. By December, it had been overtaken by Poland, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. But the UK had one of the highest excess death rates for people under the age of 65 during 2020. Separately, the daily UK coronavirus figures show the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test is continuing to fall. \nThe pandemic has changed the kind of property we want to buy or rent. Cornwall has overtaken London this year as the most searched-for location on Rightmove, according to analysis by the property portal for the BBC. Devon sits in third, and Dorset has risen from 20th to 10th. Many have turned a long-term plan to escape to the country into a short-term reality. Although the market slowed considerably during the height of the Covid outbreak, sales then lifted at a faster rate in rural areas, Rightmove says. There are signs though that with lockdown easing and businesses wanting people back in offices, tenants are moving back to London and taking advantage of lower rents. \nA 21-year-old woman is caring for her younger siblings alone after their mother died with coronavirus in October. Chelsea-Leigh Richardson's mother Sarah, 42, had been the sole parent for her and siblings Kala-Jai, 19, Jayden, 17, Preston-James, 14, and seven-year-old Bobbee-Mae. Determined the five of them would not be split up, Chelsea-Leigh says she told herself to \"be brave\". Read her story here.\nDJ Jo Whiley says she \"couldn't be happier\" that her sister is due to have her first Covid-19 vaccination this weekend. It comes after Frances, who has a learning disability, contracted the virus earlier this year and had to be taken to hospital where she ended up \"fighting for her life\". The BBC Radio 2 presenter said of the jab: \"It has been a long time coming.\" Whiley revealed her frustration last month that she had been offered the vaccination before her sister, who has the rare genetic syndrome Cri du Chat. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Health Minister Robin Swann says every adult in Northern Ireland will still get their first vaccine dose by the end of July.\nIt follows an expected reduction in the UK's Covid-19 vaccine supply.\nThat is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nMr Swann said officials were doing all they could to ensure any delays to the department's timeline were shortened as much as possible.\nSpeaking on BBC Newsline, Mr Swann said he did not expect any changes to the lifting of Northern Ireland's coronavirus restrictions in light of the vaccine supply.\n\"We don't put dates to anything and I think it's exactly these sorts of unforeseen circumstances that allow us to take that approach,\" he said.\n\"The announcements made on Tuesday in regards to the next phase of lifting restrictions won't be affected by the delay of this supply of vaccine.\n\"I don't think this delay should have an effect on what the executive wants to do in easing further restrictions.\"\nA paper from the Department of Health shows that the R number in Northern Ireland is currently at between 0.9-1.10.\nThe minister said it showed the rate of infection was still decreasing, which meant the executive had been allowed to progress with making some changes to the lockdown regulations.\n\"One of the things we've always been aware of is keeping R below one... considering where we were back in mid-December, early January we are still moving in the right direction,\" he added.\n\"That comes about by the observance of restrictions and regulations but also by greater uptake of the vaccine as well and when we look to the hope that the vaccine brings that will allow us to come out of an incredibly dark time.\"\nEarlier on Thursday, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme told the Stormont Assembly more Pfizer doses would be used until extra AstraZeneca jabs arrive.\nShe said anyone expecting a second dose or who had already booked their first would have their appointments honoured.\nFirst jabs would continue in April, if at a slightly reduced rate, she added.\nOn Thursday, another Covid-19-related death and 169 new cases of the virus were recorded  in Northern Ireland.\nThere were no coronavirus-related deaths reported in the Irish Republic on Thursday.\nHowever, there were 582 confirmed new cases of the virus in the country.\nVaccine delivery issues could put the rollout plan back by four weeks in a \"worst-case scenario\", Ms Donnelly told Stormont's Health Committee, but the delay was more likely to be about two weeks.\n\"The mitigation measures that we put in place we hope will only delay us by two weeks, so it won't have a huge impact,\" she said.\nIt had been hoped vaccinations would be on offer to all people over the age of 40 when a mass vaccination centre at Belfast's SSE Arena opened on 29 March, but this would likely be delayed by two weeks, said Ms Donnelly.\n\"It will very much depend on the remaining deliveries that we get from AstraZeneca,\" she said.\n\"We have tried to find some mitigation through further use of the Pfizer vaccine. \nMs Donnelly said three of Northern Ireland's five health trusts would now rely mainly on Pfizer doses until more AstraZeneca supplies arrived.\nOn Wednesday, NHS England warned there could be a \"significant reduction\" in the number of doses available in April.\nEarlier, Health Minister Robin Swann said Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout was ahead of schedule and would be able to adapt.\nNews of the UK vaccine shortage was frustrating, if not surprising, said the chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee in Northern Ireland.\n\"The pace of vaccination has depended on the supply from the outset,\" tweeted Dr Alan Stout.\n\"We've done so well, so far, that the vast majority of those people who are at risk have now had their first dose,\" He told The Nolan Show.\n\"If it does mean that the consequences of delaying a first dose to someone we know who is at less risk, then that's going to have to be a decision that's made to protect those second doses.\"\nNorthern Ireland was still on course to meet its target of having most adults vaccinated by June or July, said Justice Minister Naomi Long.\nMeanwhile, more than 300 pharmacies have signed up to be part of the vaccination scheme.\nOfficial launch of the rollout will begin on 30 March, although some pharmacies may start before then.\n\"Their contribution to getting as many people vaccinated as possible will be invaluable,\" said Mr Swann.\nThe chief executive of Community Pharmacy NI, Gerard Greene, said. \"The accessibility and reach of the community pharmacy network, with pharmacists as skilled vaccinators, means they are well equipped to take part in the vaccine programme.\"\nMr Greene called their inclusion in the programme \"a fantastic and welcome step forward\" and said that this will not affect other pharmacy services.\nCommunity pharmacies were used to having to deal with supply issues, he said, adding that the anticipated drop in vaccine supply was unlikely to undermine Northern Ireland's programme."

      "text": "A \"remarkable\" suppression of seasonal flu has seen only 18 cases recorded in Wales this winter, with no confirmed cases in the most recent week of data.\nThis compares with 1,657 recorded cases last winter, the largest year-on-year drop ever recorded.\nCatherine Moore of Public Health Wales said measures to slow the spread of Covid had led to levels of flu in winter she had never seen before.\nBut she said it could mean \"slightly more severe\" flu cases next winter.\nPublic Health Wales has said the flu virus is not currently circulating in Wales.\nCovid restrictions have been in place for most of the typical flu season, with strict limits on social contact in place. \nAcross a five-year average, flu has been the third-highest cause of death in Wales during winter months.\nHowever four out of the 11 leading causes of death are significantly lower than the five-year average. \nIn February 2021 flu and pneumonia were the ninth-highest causes of death, 73.2% lower than the five-year average. \nThe consultation rate for flu-like illnesses per 100,000 of the population hit a peak of 1.5 in early December. \nIn 2019-2020, that rate hit a high of just under 40 consultations per 100,000 over the Christmas period. \nLast winter, the level of flu circulating in Wales was seen as \"medium intensity\" - this winter has not even come close to meeting the threshold for \"low intensity\".\nConsultant virologist Dr Moore said: \"Any mitigation factor that we know reduces the transmission of a virus with a high transmissibility rate is likely to have a huge impact on a virus with a lower transmissibility rate.\n\"So people not moving around, people hand washing, all of the distancing, face cover wearing, all of that has a huge impact on viruses that perhaps don't transmit as well as the Sars-Cov-2 virus.\n\"The only time we see [figures this low] is in the summer months, when the virus is known not to be circulating.\n\"To see this level of suppression is remarkable, I've never seen something like this in my entire career working with influenza.\"\nDr Moore, who was appointed MBE for her work early on in the Covid-19 pandemic, said there were concerns the next flu season could be worse as a result of the lack of transmission this year.\nThis is because a large proportion of the population does not receive a flu jab, and the circulation of the most current strains of flu acts as a boost going into the next season. \n\"Immunisation is adding a boost for vulnerable groups, but a vast majority of workers don't have the immunisation, so we rely a little bit on that boosting effect to support them going into the next winter,\" she said.\n\"You will be boosted by the most current circulating virus, so if it's changed a little bit you'll have that boost to recognise the tiny changes which have happened in the virus during that year.\n\"We've completely missed a season, so the virus might have moved on a little further more than our immune system will remember.\n\"There is a potential there that we could being seeing slightly more severe flu than we would normally expect to see.\"\nThe flu vaccine uptake in Wales was the highest on record this year, with 76.5% of over-65s receiving the jab.\nLast year saw 69.4% of over-65s vaccinated, the highest number on record at the time. \nAn issue for medical professionals now is knowing what to include in the flu jab for next winter as, due to the lack of cases this winter, there is very little information on which strains have been circulating.\nNathan Sznerch, a GP in Wrexham, said Covid measures had made people more aware of hygiene measures and keeping a distance.\n\"We've certainly seen a reduction in the amount of people contacting us [for flu]. I think people are far more aware of the importance of hand hygiene, and wearing masks.\n\"All the measures we've utilised to reduce the transmission of Covid-19 have resulted in less flu transmission.\""

But in order to help ensure that you and your family members stay safe with Peloton products in your home, we need your help,\" he wrote in the letter to customers.\n\"Keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times. Before you begin a workout, double check to make sure that the space around your Peloton exercise equipment is clear.\"  \nThe US Consumer Product Safety Commission said it was investigating the incident.\nPeloton sells cycling machines and treadmills that can be connected online to virtual fitness classes. Its business has boomed as people look for alternative ways to exercise during lockdowns and gym closures.\nThe firm has said the skyrocketing demand has created supply chain pressures, leading to backlogs in orders for the machines.\nIts treadmills, which sell for more than $2,400 (\u00a31,722), were designed for use by those aged 16 and older, who weigh at least 105 pounds, it said.\nMr Foley said the company did not intend to release more information about the accidents, in order to respect privacy of those involved.\n\"While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt, each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved,\" he wrote.\nThe company is \"currently assessing ways to reinforce our warnings about these critical safety precautions to hopefully prevent future accidents,\" he added.\nLast year, Peloton recalled pedals on about 27,000 bikes in the US, citing problems after clip-on pedals broke unexpectedly during use.\nThere were an estimated 22,500 treadmill-related injuries treated at US emergency departments among all ages, including around 2,000 involving children under the age of eight, according to the consumer product safety commission.\nBetween 2018 and 2020, it received reports of 17 deaths related to the use of a treadmill, including one involving a 5-year-old."

      "text": "China has forcibly separated Uighur families by taking young children into state orphanages, according to human rights group Amnesty International.  \nIn a new report, Amnesty has called on China to release all Uighur children being held in orphanages without the consent of their families.\nThe charity spoke to parents who left children with relatives in China when they were forced to flee the country.\nRights groups say China has detained more than a million Uighurs.\nThe Chinese government has also faced allegations of a wide range of human rights abuses against the Uighur people and other Muslim minorities, including forced labour, forced sterilisation, sexual abuse and rape.\nThe government denies it is holding Uighurs in detention camps in the Xinjiang region in north-western China. It says the camps are \"re-education\" facilities being used to combat terrorism.\nBecause access to Xinjiang is heavily restricted by the Chinese, Amnesty spoke to Uighurs who were able to flee Xinjiang before the repression of the Uighur people intensified in 2017.\nMihriban Kader and Ablikim Memtinin fled from Xinjiang to Italy in 2016 after being harassed by police and pressured to give up their passports, Amnesty said. They left four children in the temporary care of grandparents, but the grandmother was taken to a detention camp while the grandfather was interrogated by police, the charity said.\n\"Our other relatives didn't dare to look after my children after what had happened to my parents,\" Mihriban told Amnesty. \"They were afraid that they would be sent to camps, too.\"\nIn November 2019, Mihriban and Ablikim received a permit from the Italian government to bring their children to join them, but the children were seized by Chinese police on the way and sent to a state-run orphanage, Amnesty said.\n\"Now my children are in the hands of the Chinese government and I am not sure I will be able to meet them again in my lifetime,\" Mihriban said.\nOmer and Meryem Faruh, who fled to Turkey in late 2016, left their two youngest children, aged five and six, with grandparents because they did not yet have their own travel documents, Amnesty said. They found out later that the grandparents had been arrested and sent to a camp and have not heard from their children since.\nAmnesty's report calls on China to provide full and unrestricted access to Xinjiang for UN human rights experts, independent researchers and journalists, and for all children held without their parents consent to be released to family.\n\"China's ruthless mass detention campaign in Xinjiang has put separated families in an impossible situation: children are not allowed to leave, but their parents face persecution and arbitrary detention if they attempt to return home to care for them,\" said Alkan Akad, Amnesty International's China researcher.\nThe Chinese state has created a vast and secretive network of camps in Xinjiang and is estimated to have detained more than a million Uighurs and people from other Muslim minority groups.\nReports have emerged in recent years of appalling human rights abuses, from forced sterilisation of Uighur women to torture and systematic rape inside camps.\nChina denies there are any human rights abuses taking place, and has called former camp detainees in exile liars and actors. China is also accused of intimidating and smearing witnesses who have spoken up, and of using witnesses's relatives in Xinjiang as leverage against them.\nThe US, Canada, and the Netherlands have declared that China is committing a genocide against the Uighur people. A similar bill was rejected by the UK parliament."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "The government has announced the first stages of its plans to get ultra-fast broadband to the remotest of homes in the UK.\nOriginally it had promised to roll out gigabit-speed broadband to every home in Britain by 2025 but that was reduced to 85% coverage in November.\nThe budget remains at \u00a35bn - but only \u00a31.2bn of that will be made available up to 2024.\nThe infrastructure build should start in 2022, the government said.\nThe first to benefit will be homes and businesses in Cambridgeshire, Cornwall, Cumbria, Dorset, Durham, Essex, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Tees Valley.\nThe next areas are expected to be Norfolk, Shropshire, Suffolk, Worcestershire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.\nA former voucher scheme is also being relaunched to provide more immediate help to those struggling with poor broadband coverage, with up to \u00a3210m being made available.\nIt is expected that commercial deployments of gigabit-capable fibre networks will reach more than 70% of premises by the end of 2025, without government intervention.\nThe government has said that reaching the final 1% of homes in very remote areas could be prohibitively expensive.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described Project Gigabit as \"the rocket boost that we need to get lightning-fast broadband to all areas of the country\".\nThe trade organisation techUK has also welcomed the news.\nAnd speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Oliver Dowden said:  \"We've already made tremendous progress with Project Gigabit - our national mission to get everyone in the country the fastest broadband on the planet.\n\"We've gone from around 9% coverage in 2019 to 40% now - I'm confident we'll get to 60% by the end of the year.\n\"The challenge is the last 20%, which can't be delivered commercially - and that's what our plans being outlined today are all about.\"\nHe reiterated the watered-down plans to reach \"at least 85% of the country by 2025\". \n\"I think we will be able to go faster than that still - and the prime minister and I are meeting with telecoms companies again.\n\"Basically, we have the money to provide that subsidy, it's about the capacity in the telecoms market to deliver it, because remember these are very remote areas.\nYesterday BT said it would \"build like fury\" to roll out full-fibre internet connections, following new rules announced by the UK's telecoms regulator Ofcom.\nThe major broadband networks have been pressing the government to make clear how it planned to allocate the public money it's set aside for Project Gigabit, so they'll be relieved to get some detail. \nBut it's still clear that the plan to put rural Britain in the broadband fast lane is behind schedule. \nAt the 2019 election, the manifesto promise was to give every home and business a Gigabit connection  by the end of 2025. Last November that target was cut to 85% of premises, with just \u00a31.2bn available in the short term. \nNow that money is beginning to flow, but with Openreach's chief executive emphasising the need for speedy decisions, it seems there's not complete confidence that even the more limited target will be hit.\nThe issue was a key manifesto commitment for the Conservatives at the last general election, when they promised to \"bring full fibre and gigabit capable broadband to every home and business across the UK by 2025\".\nThe subject is the topic of frequent questions by Conservative MPs at PMQs - highlighting how much of an important issue it is for them and their constituents.  \nBBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake says that having promised to 'level up' and increase opportunity for parts of the UK previously left behind and under-funded, this policy is seen as a key part of that agenda for the government."

      "title": "Covid vaccine: PM to have AstraZeneca jab as he urges public to do the same",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The prime minister is to receive his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after reassuring the public it was \"safe\".\nBoris Johnson, 56, has urged people to get inoculated and said England's roadmap out of lockdown was \"on track\".\nHe said there was \"no change\" to the plan despite a drop in vaccine supply.\nSeveral European countries are to resume using the AstraZeneca jab after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) confirmed it was \"safe and effective\".\nThe regulator reviewed the vaccine amid fears about blood clots, but said it was \"not associated\" with a higher risk and the benefits outweighed any risks.\nMr Johnson told a Downing Street conference on Thursday that the AstraZeneca jab was safe but \"the thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it is so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes\".\nThe prime minister was himself treated in hospital for Covid-19 in April 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic.\n\"The way to ensure this [lockdown easing] happens is to get that jab when your turn comes, so let's get the jab done,\" he said.\nProf Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said there were \"anecdotal reports\" of small numbers of people not turning up for vaccine appointments following the controversy over the AstraZeneca jab in Europe.\nBut he said he expected many of those would decide to get the jab after \"a pause for thought\", adding that Covid was still a \"very dangerous disease\".\n\"People dying, people getting significant blood clotting problems, that's one of the risks of Covid, people having long-term physical and mental effects from Covid,\" he said. \nMr Johnson said England's progress towards leaving restrictions on daily life was \"unchecked\" by vaccine supply issues, where fewer doses have arrived from India than initially expected.\nThere were often delays with vaccine rollout programmes, he said, and he stressed the Indian government had not stopped any exports.\nProf Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said while the delay was \"disappointing\" he did not think it would have \"an enormous effect\" on the rollout. \nHowever, he warned the UK needed to keep variants of concern \"at bay\" until it could update vaccines and roll them out to the whole population. \nProf Ferguson, who is a member of the government's SPI-M modelling group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there should be particular concern about cases being imported from France, where infection levels are increasing. \nHe added that 5-10% of cases in France were the South African variant, which is of concern because it could be more resistant to current vaccines. \nBut Prof Ferguson suggested that adding France to the \"red list\" of countries, from which arrivals are required to quarantine in a hotel, would not be \"practical\" given the amount of essential trade between the UK and France. \nInstead he said \"a more bespoke arrangement\" to mitigate the risks, perhaps including testing of arrivals, would be needed. \nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden said rising infection rates in Europe should act as a \"wake-up call\" and the travel red list was kept under \"regular review\". \nThe European medical regulator had reviewed the AstraZeneca jab after 13 countries in Europe suspended its use over fears about blood clots in a very small number of patients.\nFrance, Germany and Italy, along with Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania, are to resume use of the jab on Friday while Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands will do so next week.\nBut Norway, Sweden and Denmark have said they will continue to pause the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine while they conduct their own independent reviews.\nLike his UK counterpart, French Prime Minister Jean Castex will receive the AstraZeneca vaccine in an effort to sway a doubtful French public.\nSir Kent Woods, former chairman of the EMA, told BBC Breakfast the pause of the rollout of the AstraZeneca jab in some European countries was \"unfortunate\" because it could damage public confidence. \nProf Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group, said the EMA findings would help \"rebuild confidence\" and it was \"reassuring\" that safety monitoring was taking place. \nIn the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) also concluded that any link between the jab and clots was unproven.\nThe MHRA and the EMA say people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised but anyone with a headache lasting more than four days after vaccination should seek medical advice, as a precaution.\nThe same advice applies if someone develops unusual bruising.\nThat is because the regulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain.\nIt is this type of clot that triggered some European countries to pause rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIn the UK, five cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT), among 11 million people who have received the vaccine, occurred in men aged between 19 and 59. One of these was fatal.\nThe EMA has received an additional 13 reports of CSVT.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to continue using the vaccine, and is due to release the results of its own review into the vaccine's safety later on Friday.\nMeanwhile, the UK saw 7% more deaths than would be expected in 2020 based on the previous five years, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics covering up to mid-December. \nIt experienced one of the worst death rates in Europe in the first half of 2020 but has since been overtaken by Poland, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The EU's leading states are to restart their roll-out of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after Europe's medicines regulator concluded it was \"safe and effective\".\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) reviewed the jab after 13 European countries suspended use of the vaccine over fears of a link to blood clots.\nIt found the jab was \"not associated\" with a higher risk of clots.\nGermany, France, Italy and Spain said they would resume using the jab.\nIt is up to individual EU states to decide whether and when to re-start vaccinations using the AstraZeneca vaccine. Sweden said it needed a \"few days\" to decide.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday called on countries to continue using the vaccine, and is due to release the results of its own review into the vaccine's safety on Friday. \nThe agency's investigation focused on a small number of cases of unusual blood disorders. In particular, it was looking at cases of cerebral venous thrombosis - blood clots in the head. \nDecisions to suspend use of the vaccine sparked concerns over the pace of the region's vaccination drive, which had already been affected by supply shortages.\nFrench Prime Minister Jean Castex announced new measures for his country on Thursday, saying the pandemic was clearly accelerating and a \"third wave\" of infections looked increasingly likely.\nMr Castex, 55, said he would receive the jab himself on Friday afternoon.\nEmer Cooke, the agency's executive director, told a news conference: \"This is a safe and effective vaccine.\"\n\"Its benefits in protecting people from Covid-19 with the associated risks of death and hospitalisation outweigh the possible risks.\" \nThe EMA's expert committee on medicine safety, Mrs Cooke said, had found that \"the vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of... blood clots\".   \nBut the EMA, she added, could not rule out definitively a link between the vaccine and a \"small number of cases of rare and unusual but very serious clotting disorders\".\nTherefore the committee has, she said, recommended raising awareness of these possible risks, making sure they are included in the product information. Additional investigations are being launched, Mrs Cooke added. \n\"If it was me, I would be vaccinated tomorrow,\" Mrs Cooke added. \"But I would want to know that if anything happened to me after vaccination what I should do about it and that's what we're saying today.\"\nWelcoming the review's endorsement of the vaccine as safe and effective, German Health Minister Jens Spahn added, \"Doctors should be informed about the risk of venous thrombosis in women under 55 years of age, so that they in turn can inform patients.\"\nThirteen European countries suspended use of the vaccine, after reports of a small number of cases of blood clots among vaccine recipients in the region.\nLeading EU states said they had opted to pause their use of the drug as a \"precautionary measure\".\n\"There were a few very unusual and troubling cases which justify this pause and the analysis,\" French immunologist Alain Fischer, who heads a government advisory board, told France Inter radio. \"It's not lost time.\"\nIn Germany, the health ministry also pointed to a small number of rare blood clots in vaccinated people when justifying its decision. It postponed a summit on extending the vaccine rollout ahead of the EMA's announcement. \nOther countries, such as Austria, halted the use of certain batches of the drug, while Belgium, Poland and the Czech Republic were among those to say they would continue to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nDecisions to halt rollouts of the AstraZeneca vaccine were criticised by some politicians and scientists.\nA spokeswoman for Germany's opposition Free Democrats said the decision had set back the country's entire vaccination rollout. German Greens health expert Janosch Dahmen, meanwhile, argued that authorities could have continued using the drug.\nDr Anthony Cox, who researches drug safety at the UK's University of Birmingham, told the BBC it was a \"cascade of bad decision-making that's spread across Europe\".\nThe company says there is no evidence of an increased risk of clotting due to the vaccine.\nIt said it had received 37 reports of blood clots out of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the EU and UK as of 8 March.\nThese figures were \"much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed Covid-19 vaccines\", it said.\nProfessor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group which developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, told the BBC on Monday that there was \"very reassuring evidence that there is no increase in a blood clot phenomenon here in the UK, where most of the doses in Europe [have] been given so far\".\nBritish Health Secretary Matt Hancock this week urged people to \"listen to the regulators\" and to \"get the jab\".
