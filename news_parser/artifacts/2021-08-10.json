      "title": "Highers and Nat 5s: Four things to look out for on results day",
      "tags": "Schools,Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pupils across Scotland have had confirmation of their grades for their National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher qualifications.\nThe official texts from the SQA (Scottish Qualifications Authority) gave pupils the results but they won't be a surprise.\nExams were cancelled again this year so their results are based on school assessments and teacher judgements, while the SQA sampled work from different schools for \"quality assurance\".  \nThis all happened before the end of June so the results won't be new to the young people. \nSo what do the statistics tell us?\nIn \"normal\" years, the pass rate for Higher exams has been sitting between 75% and 78%. In 2020, the first year when there were no exams due to Covid, it was 89%.\nThis year the rate is 87.3%, down slightly on 2020 but still much higher than usual.\nThere were also a record number of A grades this year.\nA total of 47.6% of Higher candidates achieved an A grade, compared to 40% in 2020 and 28.3% in 2019, when traditional exams were used.\nFor National 5 the percentage of As went up to 46.7% from 42.3% in 2020.\n2020 was a statistical outlier because all results were teacher estimates. \nThis year, teachers have been involved in coming up with grades but they had to show solid evidence in the form of assessment material, so it's not quite exams, not quite teacher judgement. \nBoth the SQA and Scottish government warned against comparing last year's statistics with previous years. 2020 was, as I have already said, an outlier.\n2021 is also something of an outlier too.\nThe SQA said that in the latest results the poverty-related attainment gap was narrower than in 2019, although slightly wider than in 2020.\nBefore the two pandemic years, the gap between the achievements of pupils in the poorest areas and the richest was much larger than it has been for 2020 and 2021.\nIn 2019 the pass rate at National 5 for the poorest students (the bottom fifth on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation) was 68.8%. Whereas for those in the wealthiest areas it was 85.9%, a gap of 17 percentage points.\nIn 2020 pupils were eventually given their teacher estimates as grades and not those moderated to take into account a schools' past performance - the infamous \"algorithm\", which was scrapped after it was claimed it disadvantaged pupils at schools that had performed poorly in the past.\nThis closed the attainment gap to 7.9 percentage points.\nThis year the gap widened to 8.9 percentage points but it is still well below the 2019 figure.\nHowever, while the gap in passes has closed on the pre-pandemic figures. The gap between the number of the most deprived pupils and the least deprived getting an A grade at Higher has remained actually increased.\nDespite the number of A passes almost doubling for pupils in the most deprived areas it remains 22% lower than the rate for least deprived.\nSo while it is likely that those from the least deprived backgrounds have had the most support during online learning, there has been a continued uplift in results in deprived areas too.\nWithout traditional exams and with teachers able to, in theory, use their judgement, those in the most deprived group could potentially have more of an advantage than they normally do.\nWe seem to have ended up in a scenario where, on the whole, everyone does better, which is good for the individual, but hasn't closed the attainment gap any further.\nThis year, for the first time, pupils can appeal directly to the SQA if they are unhappy with their grade, instead of involving their school. They can appeal for three reasons:  against an academic judgement; because of an administrative error; or on the grounds of discrimination. \nPupils have had the ability to lodge their interest in an appeal since they were told their results on a provisional basis and the deadline for this is Thursday.\nThe number who are planning an appeal is not part of today's statistics.\nNumbers are not expected to be particularly high, although there could be a conversation around the choice to not include a right of appeal for exceptional circumstances and the decision to allow marks to be downgraded as well as upgraded, and whether this has put young people off.  \nBoth of these decisions were criticised by the Children and Young People's Commissioner and the Scottish Youth Parliament.\nEach year, the Scottish government pays Scottish universities for Scottish students to go there. Usually it puts a cap on the number of places. Last year and this year, the government has increased the cap by about 2,500 places to more than 38,000 places. \nIt means that even with more pupils than usual meeting the entry requirements for the courses of their choice, they should still get a place on that course.\nThey may have already been in touch with the university to let them know they have what they need. But institutions could not make anything official until today, when the results are there in black and white.\nThose stats show a record number of Scottish-domiciled students being offered a place at Scottish universities.\nAt the same time there has been a sharp drop in EU students coming study in Scotland as a consequence of Brexit\nThe Scottish government has committed to extra funding for this year but we are still waiting for confirmation of whether they will do the same for next year's entrants, many of whom will have been sitting Highers this year.\nAnd because of the large numbers of children taking qualifications this year, the number of Higher passes is at a record level."

      "title": "Wagner: Scale of Russian mercenary mission in Libya exposed",
      "tags": "Khalifa Haftar,Libya crisis,Russia,Libya",
      "text": "A BBC investigation has revealed the scale of operations by a shadowy Russian mercenary group in Libya's civil war, which includes links to war crimes and the Russian military.\nA Samsung tablet left by a fighter for the Wagner group exposes its key role - as well as traceable fighter codenames. \nAnd the BBC has a \"shopping list\" for state-of-the-art military equipment which expert witnesses say could only have come from Russian army supplies.\nRussia denies any links to Wagner.\nThe group was first identified in 2014 when it was backing pro-Russian separatists in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Since then, it has been involved in regions including Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic. \nWagner's fighters appeared in Libya in April 2019 when they joined the forces of a rebel general, Khalifa Haftar, after he launched an attack on the UN-backed government in the capital, Tripoli. The conflict ended in a ceasefire in October 2020.\nThe group is notoriously secretive, but the BBC has managed to gain rare access to two former fighters. They revealed what type of person was joining Wagner - and its lack of any code of conduct.\nThere is little doubt that they kill prisoners - something one ex-fighter freely admits. \"No-one wants an extra mouth to feed.\"\nThis supports other parts of the TV documentary - Haftar's Russian Mercenaries: Inside the Wagner Group - by BBC News Arabic and BBC News Russian. Its other revelations include evidence of suspected war crimes, including the intentional killing of civilians.\nOne Libyan villager describes how he played dead as his relatives were killed. His testimony helped the BBC team identify a suspected killer.\nDescribing another possible war crime, a Libyan government soldier also recalls how a comrade, his friend, surrendered to Wagner fighters but was shot twice in the stomach. The soldier has not seen him since, nor three other friends taken away at the same time.\nThe Samsung computer tablet also provides evidence of the mercenaries' involvement in the mining and booby-trapping of civilian areas.\nPlacing landmines without marking them is a war crime.\nJust hours after the release of the BBC's report into Wagner's activities in Libya, the deputy public prosecutor at the Libyan Military Prosecutor's Office, Mohamed Gharouda, announced that an arrest warrant had been issued for the son of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.\nAccording to the order, which was released internally last week, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi is wanted on charges of war crimes committed by the group during Gen Haftar's offensive against the capital Tripoli.\nHe was arrested during the 2011 uprising in Libya and later sentenced to death in absentia over violence against protesters. In 2017, however, he was released by the militia holding him.\nSaif al-Islam has long been suspected of having connections to Russia and the Wagner group, and is believed to be Moscow's favourite candidate to rule Libya. \nThe tablet was left behind by an unknown Wagner fighter after the group's fighters retreated from areas south of Tripoli in spring 2020. \nIts contents include maps in Russian of the frontline, giving confirmation of Wagner's significant presence and an unprecedented insight into the group's operations.  \nThere is drone footage and codenames of Wagner fighters, at least one of whom the BBC believes it has identified. The tablet is now in a secure location.\nA comprehensive list of weapons and military equipment is included in a 10-page document dated 19 January 2020, given to the BBC by a Libyan intelligence source and probably recovered from a Wagner location.\nThe document indicates who may be funding and backing the operation. It lists materiel needed for the \"completion of military objectives\" - including four tanks, hundreds of Kalashnikov rifles and a state-of-the-art radar system. \nA military analyst told the BBC that some of the weapons technology would only be available from the Russian military. Another expert, a specialist on the Wagner group, said the list pointed to the involvement of Dmitry Utkin. \nHe is the ex-Russian military intelligence man believed to have founded Wagner and given it its name (his own former call-sign). The BBC tried to contact Dmitry Utkin but has received no reply.\nAnd in our visual breakdown of the \"shopping list\" and another document, the expert says the words Evro Polis and General Director suggest the involvement of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a rich businessman close to President Vladimir Putin.\nThe US Treasury sanctioned Evro Polis in 2018, calling it a Russian company contracted to \"protect\" Syrian oil fields that were \"owned or controlled\" by Mr Prigozhin.\nInvestigations by Western journalists have linked Mr Prigozhin to Wagner. He has always denied any link to Evro Polis or Wagner.\nA spokesperson told the BBC that Yevgeny Prigozhin has nothing to do with Evro Polis or Wagner. Mr Prigozhin commented that he had not heard anything on the violation of human rights in Libya by Russians: \"I am sure that this is an absolute lie.\"\nRussia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BBC it is doing \"its utmost to promote a ceasefire and a political settlement to the crisis in Libya.\"\nThe ministry added that details about Wagner in Libya are mostly based on \"rigged data\" and were aimed at \"discrediting Russia's policy\" in Libya. \nOfficially, it does not exist - but up to 10,000 people are believed to have taken at least one contract with Wagner since it emerged fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.\nAbout 1,000 Wagner men are estimated to have fought with Gen Khalifa Haftar in Libya from 2019 to 2020.\nThe BBC in Russia asked one of the ex-fighters to describe Wagner. He replied: \"It is a structure, aimed at promoting the interests of the state beyond our country's borders.\"\nAs for its fighters, he said they were either \"professionals of war\", people looking for a job, or romantics looking to serve their country.\nThe other ex-fighter told the BBC there were no clear rules of conduct. If a captured prisoner had no knowledge to pass on, or could not work as a \"slave\", then \"the result is obvious\".\nAndrey Chuprygin, an expert working with the Russia International Council, said the stance of the Russian government was - \"let them join this thing, and we'll see what the result is. If it works out well, we can use it to our advantage. If it turns out badly, then we had nothing to do with it\".\nDownfall of Gaddafi in 2011: Col Muammar Gaddafi's more than four decades of rule end in an Arab Spring uprising. He tries to flee but is captured and killed\nThe country splinters:  After 2014, major competing factions emerge in the east and west\nThe advance on Tripoli in April 2019: Gen Haftar, leader of the eastern forces, advances on Tripoli and the UN-backed government there. Both sides get military and diplomatic support from different regional powers, despite a UN arms embargo\nCeasefire in October 2020:  Then in early 2021 a new unity government is chosen and sworn in, to take the nation to elections in December. Foreign fighters and mercenaries were supposed to have left, but thousands remain"

      "title": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigns in wake of harassment report",
      "text": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has resigned after an inquiry found that he sexually harassed multiple women, prompting efforts to remove him.\n\"The best way I can help now is if I step aside,\" he said, while continuing to deny the claims. The resignation will take effect in 14 days. \nLt Governor Kathy Hochul will become the first woman to lead New York state.\nMr Cuomo had been facing pressure to resign from fellow Democrats, including President Joe Biden. \nJust a year ago he was basking in adulation as millions of Americans tuned in daily to his no-nonsense televised briefings on the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr Cuomo is the third New York governor in a row to leave office under a cloud of scandal.\nThe independent investigation by the New York Attorney General's office found that Mr Cuomo, 63, sexually harassed 11 women, including state employees. \nWomen alleged that he made sexual comments, inappropriately touched or groped them, and kissed them without consent. \nThe report led many prominent Democrats to turn against Mr Cuomo, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Senate leader Chuck Schumer and New York's two US senators.\nHis fellow New York Democrats had begun plans to impeach him. He is still facing criminal investigations relating to the harassment claims.\nAs he announced his resignation on Tuesday, Mr Cuomo continued to deny allegations of sexual harassment but said he wanted to \"deeply, deeply\" apologise to any women who may have been offended by his actions.\n\"In my mind I've never crossed the line with anyone. but I didn't realise the extent to which the line has been redrawn,\" he said. \nHe added that his instinct was \"to fight through this controversy, because I believe it is politically motivated\". \nBut he said he was resigning because the \"current trajectory\" of the scandal would generate months of distractions and \"cost taxpayers millions of dollars\".\nMr Cuomo said the allegations had harmed his relationship with his daughters.\n\"I have sat on the couch with them, hearing the ugly accusations for weeks. I have seen the look in their eyes, and the expression on their faces. It hurt,\" he said. \nHe said he told them he \"never did and would never intentionally disrespect a woman\".\nFollowing Mr Cuomo's announcement, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a long-time critic of the governor, said \"it was past time\" for him to resign.\n\"I respect the governor's decision,\" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House. \"I respect the decision he made.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki earlier said the president had not spoken to his old friend since the report was published and did not have advance notice of his resignation.\nMr Cuomo's brother, CNN primetime anchor Chris Cuomo, has also faced calls to resign after it emerged he had been advising the governor ahead of his Tuesday announcement. \nThe younger Cuomo in May had apologised to viewers for strategizing with his brother about how to handle the initial misconduct claims. He recused himself from covering the matter on air, and has not commented on the official report. He has since gone on holiday.\nA separate federal inquiry is also looking into whether the governor's office deliberately undercounted the number of Covid deaths in New York care homes.\nThis is a stunning reversal of fortunes for a former heavyweight of the Democratic Party - who was hailed as a national hero during the Covid pandemic just last year. His image now is closer to that of a villain.\nBefore the report came out - and initially after its release - Andrew Cuomo tried to survive the scandal. He knew the #MeToo movement had changed the conversation around sexual assault, after all he had passed legislation with new protections for victims. So in public statements he tried, in a sense, to have it both ways. \nHe said women should be heard, but then tried to discredit his accusers. He said what the women had described as sexual advances were in his view harmless gestures that arose from his upbringing and culture's physical warmth. \nThe pressure did not let up and it became increasingly clear that Andrew Cuomo was backed into a corner. Still, when the resignation announcement did come from this defiant politician, it was major surprise that rocked New York and the country.\nKathy Hochul will become the first female governor of the fourth most populous US state.\nThe 62-year-old is a centrist Democrat from the Buffalo area of New York state. She joined the governor's team in 2014, and has held the largely ceremonial role of lieutenant governor.\nShe was not part of Mr Cuomo's inner circle, but he described her on Tuesday as \"smart and competent\".\nMs Hochul had joined the chorus of politicians denouncing the New York governor last week, and said his resignation on Tuesday was the \"right thing to do\".\n\"As someone who has served at all levels of government and is next in the line of succession, I am prepared to lead as New York State's 57th Governor,\" she said in a statement. \nIt's unclear whether she will seek a full term in the 2022 election."

      "text": "Men claiming to speak for Mexico's most powerful drug cartel have released a video threatening to murder a prominent female news anchor over what they deem to be unfair coverage. \nThe warning was made by a man who said it was on behalf of the leader of the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG).\nHe complained that Milenio Television was favouring so-called self-defence groups organised to resist the CJNG.\nIn the video, journalist Azucena Uresti is threatened directly.\n\"I will make you eat your words even if they accuse me of femicide,\" the masked speaker, who is surrounded by six heavily armed men, warns.\nHe accuses Ms Uresti and the Milenio network of being biased in their coverage of the battle between the cartel and vigilante groups.\nMs Uresti is one of the best-known TV anchors in Mexico and presents Milenio TV's nightly news programme. \nShe gained further visibility when she anchored some of the presidential debates ahead of the 2018 election and was widely praised for her questions to the candidates. \nGroups representing journalists have come out in her support and demanded that the government offer her protection.  \nSpeaking during his daily morning news conference, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said that Ms Uresti \"was not alone\".  \nThe president said the threatened journalist \"could count on us\" without providing further details of what the government would do to protect her.\nMexico is one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a journalist. But while attacks on local reporters are common, such public warnings are rare.\nIn the past weeks, there have been fierce battles between members of the CJGN and vigilante groups in the state of Michoac\u00e1n for control of the region west of the capital, Mexico City. \nThe vigilantes say they have taken up arms to defend themselves against the cartel whose leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, is one of the country's most-wanted men. The US is offering a $10m (\u00a37.2m) reward for information leading to his capture.\nBut the groups are controversial. Some analysts say they often turn criminal themselves or act as a cover for rival criminal groups. \nThe area has been the scene of clashes between vigilantes and gangs for years but in recent weeks the gun battles have been particularly fierce and sometimes lasted for days.\nMs Uresti interviewed one of the vigilantes involved in the fight for control of the town of Ecatepec earlier this month.\nThe vigilante alleged that the CJNG would \"kill everyone\" in the town if they managed to defeat those defending it. \nBut in the video, the masked man alleges that the vigilante groups are in fact drug traffickers themselves and extort money from the local population."

      "text": "Former Prime Minister David Cameron personally promoted Greensill Capital to investors before the controversial company collapsed.\nBBC Panorama discovered Mr Cameron appeared with the company's founder, Lex Greensill, at an event hosted by the Swiss bank Credit Suisse in 2019.\nThe collapse of Greensill in March has left the bank's clients facing billions of dollars in losses. \nMr Cameron says there was no wrongdoing in any of the actions he took.\nEducation secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Radio Four's Today programme on Tuesday that Mr Cameron had been \"absolutely cleared\" of any wrongdoing by two independent investigations.\nHe added he had made himself \"available to parliamentary scrutiny\", which was \"the right thing to do\".\nMr Cameron worked for the company as a part-time adviser for two-and-a-half years after stepping down as prime minister. \nPanorama has also discovered documents indicating his role earned him about $10m before tax. \nMr Cameron's spokesman has said his remuneration was a private matter.\nThe June event Mr Cameron attended was called \"The Future of Supply Chain Finance\", and the audience were wealthy Credit Suisse clients.\nCredit Suisse was marketing and selling Greensill investments at the time, and the bank told investors they were low risk.\nInvestors thought their money was being loaned to companies that were awaiting payment for goods and services they had sold. \nThe loans were supposed to be backed up by unpaid invoices, but earlier this year it was revealed that some of the invoices simply did not exist.\nUS court papers show how between 2018 and 2021, Greensill lent $850m of investors' cash to a US coal company called Bluestone Resources.\nOnly $70m of that money was secured against real invoices for coal that Bluestone had actually sold.\nInvestors did not know it, but the remaining $780m was only backed by predicted coal sales that may or may not happen in the future.\nLex Greensill told Panorama that this type of financing was commonplace in the financial services industry.\nHe said the predicted Bluestone business was all \"based upon future trade that is likely to occur with current customers\".\nPanorama discovered that was not true.\nThe programme obtained the names of the companies that Lex Greensill said were current customers of Bluestone.\nSix of the companies said they were not Bluestone customers and they weren't planning to buy its coal in the future.\nLex Greensill later told Panorama the coal buyers did not have to be current customers. Bluestone only had to state it expected to make the sales at some future point and Greensill was not obliged to make checks, he said.\nMr Greensill denied misleading investors. He said his company made all the appropriate disclosures to Credit Suisse and the Swiss Bank was \"solely responsible for making any disclosures to their investors\".\nHe said the loans were always secured against assets and personal guarantees, and were backed up by insurance that would pay 100% of any shortfall.\nCredit Suisse says its focus is on returning cash to investors and that 59% has been returned so far.\nMr Cameron's spokesman told Panorama he was neither a director of Greensill, nor involved in any lending decisions, and that he had no special insight into what ultimately happened.\nThe spokesman said: \"It is also preposterous to suggest that he would work for any company if he was aware that it was behaving improperly, or was in any way seeking to mislead investors.\" \nWatch Panorama: David Cameron and the Missing Billions on BBC iPlayer"

      "text": "Covid rules for travelling to the UK will be relaxed for thousands of delegates attending the UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.\nUp to 25,000 government representatives, media and campaigners from around the world are expected.\nThey will not be required to be fully vaccinated but officials said it would be strongly encouraged.\nVaccines have been offered to registered delegates unable to get a jab by other means. \nUnder the regulations specifically for COP26, delegates from red list countries will only have to quarantine in hotels for five days if they have been fully vaccinated. \nThose who have not received their jabs will have to isolate for 10 days.\nThere will be no requirement for COP26 attendees coming from amber or green list countries to isolate on arrival to the UK whether vaccinated or not, officials said. \nMost people are expected to travel to the conference via London.\nUnder current rules, people cannot travel to England from red list countries unless they are British or Irish citizens or have the right to live in the UK, with the same rules applying to Scotland with some other limited exceptions.\nThose who do arrive from red list countries have to quarantine for 10 days in quarantine hotels, even if they are double jabbed.\nThere are also requirements to self isolate for 10 days for those coming from amber countries who are not fully vaccinated via approved programmes in the UK, US or Europe.\nThe red list can change but it currently includes dozens of countries, all of whom are expected to send delegates to COP26, and some of which are among the most vulnerable to climate change.\nA UK government spokesperson said COP26 was a necessary event, as the science was clear for the need to take immediate and far-reaching action to have any chance of avoiding the devastating impacts of rising temperatures.\nThey added: \"We know that achieving the ambitious global action needed to tackle climate change requires everyone sitting around the same table. To achieve this, we have been working tirelessly to make arrangements for an in-person event.\n\"Hosting it safely is of the utmost importance to the UK. Like many recent international events, COP26 will have to adapt in line with Covid.\"\nThe spokesperson said details of how the summit would run were progressing after close collaboration with all partners, including public health officials in Scotland and England, the Scottish government, Glasgow City Council and the UN's climate body, the UNFCCC.\n\"We believe these arrangements strike a balance between allowing critical climate talks at this exceptional event to continue with representation from around the globe, while continuing to have measures in place to protect public health,\" they said.\nDelegates will also be subject to a strict testing regime and they will have to sign a charter agreeing to abide by the protocols for the summit. \nThe UK is recognising all Covid-19 vaccinations as valid for the event, but officials also said they would not prevent people attending who had not been vaccinated.\nThe issue of who pays for the regime, including testing and quarantine hotels, has yet to be finalised. Isolation protocols during the event for those who test positive for the virus are also being finalised.\nThe rules have been signed off by the UK and Scottish governments, but Covid-19 protection measures for the summit could still change, officials said.\nA Scottish Government spokesperson said:  \"COP26 represents the world's best chance - and possibly one of our last chances - to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. \n\"The circumstances make this a unique event and exceptional arrangements will be needed to ensure it can be delivered safely and successfully. \n\"Following close discussions with the UK government and other delivery partners, we are pleased to have agreed measures that will support the full and active participation of international delegates and protect public health.\""

      "text": "Paddy Power-owner Flutter has said its UK betting shop revenue has jumped higher than pre-Covid levels.\nBetting shops were closed during lockdowns but since reopening in June, Flutter said UK retail revenue rose 7% ahead of sales before the pandemic.\nLike its rivals, Flutter has seen strong growth in online gambling as shops closed and people were forced to work from home.\nBut one gambling helpline said calls had risen by 9% in the year to March.\nAnd punters came back to betting shops after they re-opened as Covid restrictions eased in the second quarter, with UK retail revenue 7% higher than pre-Covid levels, it said.\nThe number of people using Flutter's online gambling in the UK leapt even more, increasing nearly 60%.\nA UK gambling helpline said calls had increased by 9% in the year to the end of March.\nFlutter said global revenue rose 28% to \u00a33bn as its average number of gamblers rose 40% to more than 7.5 million.\nChief executive Peter Jackson said: \"The first half of 2021 exceeded our expectations as we made substantial progress against our operational and strategic objectives while maintaining excellent momentum in growing our player base.\"\nMany countries around the world closed down betting shops during coronavirus lockdowns, and gamblers shifted their focus online.\nFlutter attracted new customers during lockdowns, and kept hold of many of them in the first half, said Alistair Johnson, analyst at Redburn.\nStudies have suggested that online gambling soared during coronavirus lockdowns, with vulnerable groups particularly at risk.\nIn the UK, Flutter, which owns brands such as Betfair and Sky Betting and Gaming, said it had 59% more online customers than in the same period in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis.\nOverall, its UK and Ireland average monthly numbers grew 44% to 3.3 million customers. This outpaced revenue growth of 30% - so on average, revenue per active customer was lower, it said.\nFlutter has been pouring money into its US business, spending more than $1bn to date on marketing its flagship FanDuel sports betting brand.\nUS revenues were more than $900m in the first half, putting distance between it and its main rivals, it said.\nThe gambling giant competed its acquisition of Canadian gambling business the Stars Group on 5 May 2020.\nFreetrade analyst Gemma Boothroyd said the pandemic \"lent a helping hand to online betting, speeding up its transition to digital\".\nShe said US revenue growth, which soared by 159% to \u00a3652m, was \"driven by six additional states legalising sports betting\".\n\"As vaccination ramps up and Flutter's main markets return to business-as-usual, it may be ill-prepared for lockdowns easing,\" Ms Boothroyd added.\nLast year a House of Lords report found that there were a third of a million problem gamblers in the UK, with young people being most at risk.\nThe amount of harm was wider, though. For each problem gambler, six were harmed by their activities. So two million people were harmed by \"the breakup of families, crime, loss of employment, loss of homes and, ultimately, loss of life\", the report said.\nIt found that 60% of gambling companies' profits come from the 5% of customers who are already problem gamblers, or who are at risk of becoming so.\nA study in May this year suggested that online gambling soared in 2020 in the UK, with regular gamblers more than six times more likely to gamble online.\nThe University of Bristol study suggested that \"although many forms of gambling were restricted, a minority of regular gamblers significantly increased their gambling and betting online\" with vulnerable groups \"worse affected\".\nThere was also a strong link between binge drinking and regular gambling, researchers said.\nGamCare, which operates the National Gambling Helpline, said it had received 41,000 calls for help in the year to the end of March, a 9% increase on the previous year.\nIt said there was a big increase in gambling due to boredom, but also more gamblers were using it as a coping strategy during the pandemic.\nTwo thirds of the gamblers calling the helpline had debt issues, and three quarters had financial difficulties due to gambling.\nThe most problematic online products were slots, betting, and casino games.\nOffline, betting in shops and gaming machines were problematic, gamblers said.\nFlutter said that it was developing steps \"focused on protecting those that are vulnerable without unnecessarily impinging on the freedoms of the majority of customers\".\nThe UK government is reviewing gambling laws."

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The percentage of pupils achieving A grades hit a record high this year as the pass rate for Scottish school qualifications dropped slightly.\nFormal exams were cancelled for the second year running due to Covid-19, with grades based on teacher judgement.\nThe percentage of pupils achieving A to C grades in their Highers fell from 89.3% in 2020 to 87.3% in 2021.\nBut that total is still significantly above the 75% pass rate from 2019, and a record high number of awards overall.\nEducation Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said pupils had delivered \"a strong set of results, achieved under extraordinary circumstances\".\nA total of 90.2% of Advanced Higher candidates achieved a pass, down from 93.1% in 2020, while National 5 scores dropped from 89% to 85.8%.\nHowever, the percentage of students who got an A grade in Higher and Advanced Higher courses leapt by around 20 percentage points from pre-pandemic levels.\nA total of 47.6% of Higher candidates achieved an A grade, compared to 40% in 2020 and 28.3% in 2019, when traditional exams were used.\nIn Advanced Higher courses, 51% of pupils got an A, up from 46.3% in 2020 and 31.8% in 2019. In National 5s, the figure rose from 42.3% in 2020 to 46.7% this year, up from 35.1% in 2019.\nMeanwhile, the attainment gap between pupils from more deprived and more affluent backgrounds widened compared to 2020 - but was still narrower than it was pre-pandemic.\nFor National 5 qualifications, 90.2% of pupils from the least deprived backgrounds achieved a passing grade, compared to 81.3% from the most deprived backgrounds - a gap of nine percentage points.\nThis was an increase from the gap of 7.9 percentage points in 2020 - but still significantly down from the 17.1 percentage point gap in 2019.\nThere was a similar trend for Higher qualifications - where the gap increased from 6.5 percentage points to 7.9, compared to 16.9 pre-pandemic - and Advanced Highers, where the gap went from 3.0 percentage points to 5.5.\nSenior pupils sat a series of assessments in May following disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\nTeachers then decided their grades and informed students before the end of term, and these grades were made official on Tuesday.\nKatie Wilson, a 5th year pupil at Lochgelly High School in Fife, said this meant that results day had been less stressful than last year.\nShe had to isolate during the academic year, and said: \"Our teachers were really supportive, they understood what we were going through, that we may have needed extra support when we came back - so it worked well I think.\"\nThe results reflect the highest number of Higher passes since at least 1999, and a record high percentage of entries at National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher courses resulting in an A grade.\nMs Somerville said \"significant challenges\" had been thrown at young people in \"one of the toughest academic years we've ever known\".\nShe added: \"Learners can be confident that their awards are fair, consistent and credible. Indeed, industry representatives have made it clear how much they value this year's qualifications.\n\"As in any year, the results highlight some areas for us to focus attention on. Closing the poverty-related attainment gap and ensuring every young person has the chance to fulfil their potential remains central to our work.\"\nMinisters also said a record high number of Scottish-domiciled students had been offered a place at Scottish universities as of results day, rising 10% to 31,070.\nThere were more than 200,000 entries for Higher and Advanced Higher courses this year, and almost 300,000 for National 5 courses.\nMinisters said final grades would be based on \"teacher judgement supported by assessment\", but the process was criticised by some parents and pupils - who described the assessments as \"exams by another name\". \nThe Scottish government had faced anger from pupils, parents and teachers over the previous results system, introduced after lockdown in 2020.\nGrades were initially drawn up using teacher estimates for each pupil which were then moderated using results from previous years.\nHowever, this sparked an outcry after 125,000 results were downgraded, with claims the moderation system unfairly penalised children at schools which had historically not performed as well.\nIn a 'normal' exam year, if too many people are doing too well then boundaries can be changed to make it harder to get a certain grade. \nWith assessments marked by schools this year and no central system, more young people than normal are celebrating hitting the top spot. \nBut does it mean an A this year is less valuable?\nThe SQA, the government, universities and employers are all keen to stress that's not the case.\nWhich begs another question. Would these A grade students - who deserve what they have got - have lost out under our usual exam system?\nWe still don't know how grades will be decided next year. This conversation could have a bearing on that.\nThe government subsequently agreed to accept the original teacher estimates of grades - and pledged that 2021's awards would not be \"given or taken away on the basis of a statistical model or on the basis of a school's past performance\".\nThe government has already announced wide-ranging changes to the education system, with the SQA to be replaced with a new agency overseeing the curriculum.\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the exams system was a \"disgrace\", and that pupils had been \"judged more harshly\" than the previous year's cohort.\nEducation spokesman Oliver Mundell said: \"Compared to last year, grades are down across the board. The attainment gap is up. \n\"That should set alarm bells ringing that this year's system is just as flawed and unfair as the shambles pupils suffered last year.\"\nScottish Labour's education spokesman Michael Marra said pupils and teachers had \"performed nothing short of miracles this year\" - but that there had been a \"total lack of leadership\".\nHe added: \"This system has widened the educational attainment gap in Scotland, meaning that poorest pupils have been impacted the worst by the SQA and Scottish government mismanagement.\n\"The result is that there are many young people, particularly in our poorest communities, who have not achieved the grades they had hoped for, or deserved.\"\nThe Scottish Greens said the decision to cancel exams in 2021 was taken \"far too late\", and there had been a \"near-total failure to plan for the effects of Covid disruption\".\nAnd the Scottish Lib Dems said the results \"make a mockery of SNP promises to close the attainment gap\" after pupils were \"forced into exams in all but name\".\nScottish business leaders have assured school leavers that their qualifications will be valued as much as in any other year.\nMore than 100 employers and business groups, including the Scottish Retail Consortium, Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Tourism Alliance, have backed a new Young Person's Guarantee.\nIt aims to provide everyone aged between 16 and 24 with the opportunity of a job, apprenticeship, further or higher education, training programme or volunteering."

for many, that has become a path into university.\nAs formal exams were cancelled for a second year due to the coronavirus pandemic, schools calculated the grades to be awarded to pupils.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen praised young people's \"incredible resilience\", acknowledging the exceptional circumstances they had faced over the past year.\n\"Our young people have demonstrated a determination not to let this pandemic put their lives on hold,\" she said.\n\"They have been awarded qualifications which reflect their hard work and will enable them to move forward confidently with their future plans.\"\nThe vast majority of AS and A-level entries in Northern Ireland are made through the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) exams board.\nHowever, some pupils take some A-levels through English exam boards.\nThere had previously been a significant rise in the proportion of A-level entries to CCEA awarded top grades in 2020.\nIn 2020, after the change in how results were awarded, 14.5% of A-level entries through CCEA achieved the top A* grade compared with 8.9% in 2019.\nAccording to CCEA, that has risen to 15.8% of entries in 2021.\nAlmost 45% of A-level entries to CCEA in 2020 were awarded A* or A grades compared with 32.2% in 2019.\nThat has risen to 50.8% in 2021.\nAcross Northern Ireland, England and Wales as a whole almost 45% of A-levels entries received A* or A grades.\nPupils in Scotland take Highers and they also received results this morning and some students in Northern Ireland also receive their BTEC results.\nAlana Cahoon from Portadown, County Armagh, said she was \"so relieved and extremely grateful\" after receiving three Bs at A-level.\nThe 18-year-old, who is a member of youth-led charity Pure Mental NI, said it was important that fellow students remembered to take care of their mental health on results day.\n\"It's important not to compare yourself to other people, don't compare yourself to what you see on your Facebook feed and Instagram feeds, Ms Cahoon said. \n\"It's ok if you didn't get what you wanted, everyone has their own path.\"\nProf Paul Seawright, deputy vice-chancellor of Ulster University, told BBC News NI: \"We have over 5,000 places available across four campuses... more than we've ever had.\n\"If you meet the conditions of your offer the university is obliged to take you and we'll be delighted to welcome you.\"\nProfessor David Jones, pro-vice chancellor for education and students at Queens University Belfast, said: \"What we really want is to make sure that we can get as many people in as wish to come.\"\nHe said there were opportunities not only at Northern Ireland's universities but also by entering the further education sector and moving to university through that route.\nFurther education colleges in Northern Ireland estimate that at least 60% of those receiving BTecs go on to further study at college or university.\nBrian Doran, principal of Southern Regional College, said: \"Whatever happens with offers today, it is really important that students understand the many options they have to continue to further study, particularly with the amount of higher education routes available to them at the six further education colleges, through foundation degrees, Higher National Diplomas and Higher Level Apprenticeships.\n\"This year, colleges and universities are working closely together to make sure students are signposted towards these alternative routes.\"\nEllen Fearon, the president of the National Union of Students and Union of Students in Ireland (NUS-USI), said everyone receiving results should feel proud of themselves.\nShe said the government and the education sector had to make sure the necessary places were made available at universities and colleges to accommodate new students.\n\"Students have done their part and it's now on the sector to do theirs,\" she said.\nLimavady High School principal Darren Mornin said every pupils should be congratulated after what had been an incredibly difficult 18 months.\n\"There has obviously been that disruption to face-to-face teaching so they most definitely will have been worried,\" he said.\n\"The results that they are getting today - especially from a Limavady High School point of view - have all been fantastic and I am just so proud of them all.\"\nMeanwhile, at AS-level in Northern Ireland, almost three-quarters of entries (73.9%) received the top A or B grades.\nHowever, those AS results will not count towards a pupil's A-level grade in 2022.\nEvidence for samples of results calculated by schools has been checked by exam boards, including CCEA in Northern Ireland.\nA pupil can appeal their result if they are unhappy with it, with some appeals classed as \"priority\" if a pupil's place on a higher education course depends on a change to their results.\nPupils can appeal if they think an \"unreasonable academic judgement\" was made by their school but CCEA will only change a grade if they decide it does not match the evidence provided by the school.\nThe rise in results will inevitably spark a debate about grade inflation compared to years when pupils sit exams at the end of their course.\nBut the head of England's exam regulator Ofqual has said that grades are a fair reflection of the efforts pupils have made.\nSimon Lebus said teacher assessments give a \"much more accurate reflection\" of what students can achieve.\nPupils awaiting GCSE results will receive them on Thursday.\nCCEA will operate a results helpline from Tuesday until Friday 20 August on 028 9026 1220.\nFormal GCSE, AS and A-level exams are expected to take place again in the 2021-2022 school year."

The anxiety comes in waves.\"\nMolly worries how fair the system of teacher-assessed grades has been on students. \n\"Everybody has had a different experience and everyone has done a different type of assessment and I just don't think, when we get the grades, that it will be a true reflection of how well we could have done.\"\nShe is hoping for an A* and two As on Tuesday, and originally applied to do a psychology degree. But the experience of studying in a pandemic led her to defer to do a high-level diploma in dance at the Northern Ballet School.\nShe is also concerned her qualifications may be less valued in the future. \n\"I feel employers might look at our grades and say that was the year Covid happened and you didn't sit proper exams.\"\nFatima from south London is feeling quite optimistic about achieving her target of three A grades in her A-level exams - in English literature, geography and psychology. \nBut she's not always felt that way. She's had ups and downs throughout the year and her views have fluctuated. She had to go into isolation twice and missed four weeks of school.\nShe says: \"After the second lockdown, I was unsure if I could pass exams but I really just wanted to sit them. When I found out I couldn't do exams, I was really upset.\"\nFatima believes teachers will grade her fairly but worried when exams were cancelled. \n\"I didn't want a repeat of last year, especially because I live in a low-income neighbourhood. Are they going to assume I'm going to get bad grades because of the area I live in? I don't trust the government to decide that for me.\"\nLike Molly, Fatima decided not to go to university - she's doing a two-year public policy apprenticeship at Ofcom.\nShe found her involvement with youth charity The Mix a great help during lockdown. It allowed her to hook up with other young people remotely, to watch and discuss films. \n\"Especially because I'm quite extroverted, being in my house all day is literally the worst thing you could do to me,\" she says.\nHolly Turner from the Mix says the number of conversations around school and education has almost tripled on their helpline year-on-year.\n\"We've seen just how difficult it has been for students since the start of the pandemic. They have experienced severe disruption to their education, and the constant change and uncertainty is having a serious impact on their mental health.\" \nZoya, aged 16, from Lancashire, says she is feeling really nervous about getting her GCSE results, which are out two days after A-levels. \n\"Normally, Year 11 would feel stress at the end of the year but we had stress from the beginning because we'd missed so much.\n\"Last year, in Year 10, they didn't teach us anything new. We were just catching up while studying for our mocks so it was very hectic. So many isolated so much, they were off for most of the school year.\"\nThe experience has not put her off studying. She's aiming to do A-levels next year in psychology, English literature, English language. performing arts and fine arts.\nDavid, 17, will get his results in the three BTec subjects he took in computing, media and criminology. \nBTecs are based more on coursework than exams, and David says he \"found it tough to get into the mindset of working from home,\" especially not seeing his friends from college.\n\"It really affected my mental health at one stage, which took a toll not only on me personally but also my work, because I was finding it hard to have the motivation.\"\nThe lack of resources at home created problems for his coursework. He struggled, for example, to do the work needed for his media course, as he didn't have access to the cameras and lighting equipment available in the college.\nDespite finding the process tiring, David saw it through and has a conditional offer from the University of Hull to study social work, although he is keeping his options open.\nWhat questions do you have about this year's results?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Poland's coalition government has been thrown into disarray, after the prime minister sacked his deputy on Tuesday.\nParliament is expected to vote on a draft media law that critics say is an attempt to silence a TV channel critical of the government.\nFormer Deputy PM Jaroslaw Gowin - who opposes the law change - leads a junior partner in the United Right coalition that has ruled since 2015.\nThousands of people have been protesting against the draft law.\nThe government said Mr Gowin had \"undermined confidence\" in its actions.\nHis party, Agreement, had been increasingly at odds with its senior coalition partner, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki's Law and Justice (PiS) party, and has now voted to quit the coalition.\nThe loss of Agreement's 13 MPs means the coalition will no longer command a majority in the lower house of parliament.\nMr Gowin had criticised the coalition's flagship economic programme, claiming it would lead to tax increases for ordinary Poles.\nAnd he opposes the new broadcasting bill, which he says \"clearly violates the principle of media freedom\".\nLawmakers are expected to vote on Wednesday evening on an amendment that would strengthen a ban on non-European firms controlling Polish broadcasters. The much-anticipated vote was due in the afternoon but briefly postponed as opposition MPs tried to adjourn the session.\nThe government says the law is needed to stop hostile foreign powers taking control of its broadcasters.\nBut opponents say it is an attempt to push US company Discovery to sell the country's biggest TV network, TVN, which is critical of the government. US officials have criticised the bill.\nIf approved, the law threatens to sour relations with the US, a key ally, and deepen concern in the European Union over media freedom in Poland.\nThousands of demonstrators took to the streets across Poland on Tuesday to express their anger at the proposals.\nA crowd gathered outside the parliament in Warsaw, and rallies were held in Krakow, Wroclaw, Poznan, Lublin and Szczecin.\nA government spokesman said he thought the bill would still pass, despite Agreement's exit from the governing coalition.\n\"There will be people in the United Right and in the rest of the Polish parliament who will support the beneficial reforms that we have proposed,\" he said."

My. God. It's a movie. I made that up. It's. Not. Real.\" \nBaseless posts and memes which cite the film as a reason not to get vaccinated against Covid have appeared on social media platforms for months, with some being labelled by Facebook as containing misinformation. \nOne meme claims in the film vaccinations cause humans to turn into zombies, both misrepresenting the plot and the fictional nature of the film.\nAnother meme claims the film was set in 2021, which would correspond to the pandemic and the global vaccination rollout - despite the fact the plot was actually set in 2012.  \nI Am Legend is not the only film used by activists to spread misinformation about Covid and vaccines. Other films such as Children of Men and The Matrix have appeared in similar memes and posts."

Grades have been decided by teachers' estimates, by looking at various pieces of work and mock exams over the past year.\nIt is different to last year's controversial system, which caused chaos by using an algorithm and was eventually scrapped.\nMr Lebus, whose job it is ensure there is not a repeat of last year's fiasco, told the BBC that this system gives a better overall view of students' ability.\n\"Exams are a bit like a snapshot, a photograph - you capture an instant,\" he said. \n\"Whereas teacher assessment allows teachers to observe student performance over a much longer period, taking into account lots of different pieces of work and arriving at a holistic judgement.\"\nHe said Ofqual wanted a system where every student has a fair chance to show what they can do, and \"I'm very confident that when they get their grades on Tuesday and Thursday this week they'll be able to feel satisfied that that's happened.\"\nHe reassured students that there have been three stages of checks, including Ofqual checking the policies that schools have for awarding grades and exam boards looking over the grades.\nEach teacher's grades have also been checked by another teacher as well as the school principal, Mr Lebus added.\nStudents who are unhappy with their grades are able to appeal on two grounds - either because of administrative problems for example work being lost, or disputing a teacher's judgement.\nBut Mr Lebus said the bar for proving a teacher gave an unfair grade is \"substantial\". \"They'll have to have very solid grounds for thinking something's gone wrong,\" he said.\nThere will also be the opportunity to take exams in the autumn.\nThe Ofqual chief added that he understood young people were anxious, but \"they should feel proud of the fact that they reflect the reality of what they've achieved in remarkably difficult circumstances\".\nA-level students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will get their results on 10 August, while those in Scotland will receive their Scottish Higher and Nationals results.\nGCSE results will be give to students in England, Wales and NI on 12 August.

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The percentage of pupils achieving A grades hit a record high this year as the pass rate for Scottish school qualifications dropped slightly.\nFormal exams were cancelled for the second year running due to Covid-19, with grades based on teacher judgement.\nThe percentage of pupils achieving A to C grades in their Highers fell from 89.3% in 2020 to 87.3% in 2021.\nBut that total is still significantly above the 75% pass rate from 2019, and a record high number of awards overall.\nEducation Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said pupils had delivered \"a strong set of results, achieved under extraordinary circumstances\".\nA total of 90.2% of Advanced Higher candidates achieved a pass, down from 93.1% in 2020, while National 5 scores dropped from 89% to 85.8%.\nHowever, the percentage of students who got an A grade in Higher and Advanced Higher courses leapt by around 20 percentage points from pre-pandemic levels.\nA total of 47.6% of Higher candidates achieved an A grade, compared to 40% in 2020 and 28.3% in 2019, when traditional exams were used.\nIn Advanced Higher courses, 51% of pupils got an A, up from 46.3% in 2020 and 31.8% in 2019. In National 5s, the figure rose from 42.3% in 2020 to 46.7% this year, up from 35.1% in 2019.\nMeanwhile, the attainment gap between pupils from more deprived and more affluent backgrounds widened compared to 2020 - but was still narrower than it was pre-pandemic.\nFor National 5 qualifications, 90.2% of pupils from the least deprived backgrounds achieved a passing grade, compared to 81.3% from the most deprived backgrounds - a gap of nine percentage points.\nThis was an increase from the gap of 7.9 percentage points in 2020 - but still significantly down from the 17.1 percentage point gap in 2019.\nThere was a similar trend for Higher qualifications - where the gap increased from 6.5 percentage points to 7.9, compared to 16.9 pre-pandemic - and Advanced Highers, where the gap went from 3.0 percentage points to 5.5.\nSenior pupils sat a series of assessments in May following disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\nTeachers then decided their grades and informed students before the end of term, and these grades were made official on Tuesday.\nKatie Wilson, a 5th year pupil at Lochgelly High School in Fife, said this meant that results day had been less stressful than last year.\nShe had to isolate during the academic year, and said: \"Our teachers were really supportive, they understood what we were going through, that we may have needed extra support when we came back - so it worked well I think.\"\nThe results reflect the highest number of Higher passes since at least 1999, and a record high percentage of entries at National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher courses resulting in an A grade.\nMs Somerville said \"significant challenges\" had been thrown at young people in \"one of the toughest academic years we've ever known\".\nShe added: \"Learners can be confident that their awards are fair, consistent and credible. Indeed, industry representatives have made it clear how much they value this year's qualifications.\n\"As in any year, the results highlight some areas for us to focus attention on. Closing the poverty-related attainment gap and ensuring every young person has the chance to fulfil their potential remains central to our work.\"\nMinisters also said a record high number of Scottish-domiciled students had been offered a place at Scottish universities as of results day, rising 10% to 31,070.\nThere were more than 200,000 entries for Higher and Advanced Higher courses this year, and almost 300,000 for National 5 courses.\nMinisters said final grades would be based on \"teacher judgement supported by assessment\", but the process was criticised by some parents and pupils - who described the assessments as \"exams by another name\". \nThe Scottish government had faced anger from pupils, parents and teachers over the previous results system, introduced after lockdown in 2020.\nGrades were initially drawn up using teacher estimates for each pupil which were then moderated using results from previous years.\nHowever, this sparked an outcry after 125,000 results were downgraded, with claims the moderation system unfairly penalised children at schools which had historically not performed as well.\nIn a 'normal' exam year, if too many people are doing too well then boundaries can be changed to make it harder to get a certain grade. \nWith assessments marked by schools this year and no central system, more young people than normal are celebrating hitting the top spot. \nBut does it mean an A this year is less valuable?\nThe SQA, the government, universities and employers are all keen to stress that's not the case.\nWhich begs another question. Would these A grade students - who deserve what they have got - have lost out under our usual exam system?\nWe still don't know how grades will be decided next year. This conversation could have a bearing on that.\nThe government subsequently agreed to accept the original teacher estimates of grades - and pledged that 2021's awards would not be \"given or taken away on the basis of a statistical model or on the basis of a school's past performance\".\nThe government has already announced wide-ranging changes to the education system, with the SQA to be replaced with a new agency overseeing the curriculum.\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the exams system was a \"disgrace\", and that pupils had been \"judged more harshly\" than the previous year's cohort.\nEducation spokesman Oliver Mundell said: \"Compared to last year, grades are down across the board. The attainment gap is up. \n\"That should set alarm bells ringing that this year's system is just as flawed and unfair as the shambles pupils suffered last year.\"\nScottish Labour's education spokesman Michael Marra said pupils and teachers had \"performed nothing short of miracles this year\" - but that there had been a \"total lack of leadership\".\nHe added: \"This system has widened the educational attainment gap in Scotland, meaning that poorest pupils have been impacted the worst by the SQA and Scottish government mismanagement.\n\"The result is that there are many young people, particularly in our poorest communities, who have not achieved the grades they had hoped for, or deserved.\"\nThe Scottish Greens said the decision to cancel exams in 2021 was taken \"far too late\", and there had been a \"near-total failure to plan for the effects of Covid disruption\".\nAnd the Scottish Lib Dems said the results \"make a mockery of SNP promises to close the attainment gap\" after pupils were \"forced into exams in all but name\".\nScottish business leaders have assured school leavers that their qualifications will be valued as much as in any other year.\nMore than 100 employers and business groups, including the Scottish Retail Consortium, Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Tourism Alliance, have backed a new Young Person's Guarantee.\nIt aims to provide everyone aged between 16 and 24 with the opportunity of a job, apprenticeship, further or higher education, training programme or volunteering."

There was also an impact on the patient's family's rights in terms of witnessing her debilitating decline.\"\nThe report has brought only some consolation for Mrs Jones' family. \n\"The most relevant part is that she shouldn't have suffered,\" said her daughter Charlotte Finlay.\n\"I don't think anything stays with us more than that. She should not have suffered for eight to nine months with that pain. There should've been more done.\"\nMrs Jones underwent colon surgery in February 2019 at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.\nShe returned home but was readmitted in May before being transferred to Llandudno Community Hospital. \nShe went home again in July, only to return Glan Clwyd Hospital on 3 August. \nBy then she was deemed too unwell to survive surgery and died on 24 August of acute peritonitis - inflammation caused by an infection.\n\"She had scans as early as March and the results show that she had a blockage of her bowel when she could've been strong enough to be given the chance for an operation back then,\" said Mrs Finlay.\n\"As a family that'll never leave us, that question of 'would she be here if she would've been operated on in March?'\"\nOmbudsman Nick Bennett later added: \"This tragic case involved an alarming, systemic misdiagnosis. Numerous significant failings and deficiencies took place before, during and after Mrs M's discharge from hospital.\"\nDenbighshire council was also criticised for the inadequate home care support offered to Mrs Jones when she was discharged from hospital. \nA further complaint that both the health board and council failed to issue a co-ordinated response to the family after Mrs Jones died was also upheld.\nThe council issued their response six months after the health board.\nThe report recommended both organisations give fulsome apologies to Mrs Jones' family, that the health board paid \u00a35,000 for the distress caused, and staff were given feedback and training to learn lessons from what happened.\nGill Harris, deputy chief executive at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said: \"We sincerely apologise for the failures in care and for the way the subsequent complaint was handled. \n\"We accept the findings and recommendations in full and we are currently working with the relevant clinical teams to implement the necessary improvements.\"\nDenbighshire council said it was \"sincerely sorry\" for the distress caused to the family and had issued a written apology to her husband.\nA council official added: \"The council fully accepts the findings and recommendations made in this report and we are making sure these are implemented with the relevant staff and departments involved.\""

      "text": "At least 27 children have been killed in Afghanistan in three days amid fierce fighting between the Taliban and government forces, the UN has said.\nThe UN children's agency Unicef said it was shocked by the \"rapid escalation of grave violations against children\".\nThe Taliban have been making major advances across the country as foreign troops withdraw, taking six regional capitals since Friday.\nThey have rejected international calls for a ceasefire.\nMore than 1,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the conflict in the past month. \nIn a statement on Monday, Unicef said the atrocities being committed against children were growing \"higher by the day\". \nThe 27 fatalities were recorded across three provinces - Kandahar, Khost, and Paktia. Some 136 children were also injured in these areas over the past three days, Unicef said. \n\"Afghanistan has long been one of the worst places on Earth to be a child but in recent weeks and, indeed, the last 72 hours, that's got a lot worse,\" Unicef Afghanistan's Samantha Mort told the BBC.\nChildren have been killed and injured in roadside bombs and in the crossfire. One mother told the group that her family were asleep over the weekend when their home was hit by shrapnel, which started a fire and left her 10-year-old son with \"horrific burns\". Many children are also sleeping outside after fleeing their homes. \nUnicef has called on all sides to ensure that children are protected. \nViolence has escalated across Afghanistan now that US-led forces have all but withdrawn following 20 years of military operations. \nThe Taliban have rapidly captured large swathes of countryside, and are now targeting towns and cities.\nIn their most significant gain since May, the Taliban are reported to have overrun the northern city of Kunduz. \nThe city of 270,000 people is considered a gateway to mineral-rich northern provinces. It is in a strategically important location close to the border with Tajikistan, which is used for the smuggling of opium and heroin. \nIt also holds symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001. The militants captured the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but have never been able to hold it for long. \nAfghan officials say security forces are still fighting in the city.\nThe southwestern city of Zaranj was the first provincial capital to fall to the group under their sweeping offensive. \nThe northern cities of Sheberghan, Sar-e-Pul, Taloqan and Aybak are now also reported to be under Taliban control. \nThe insurgents entered Aybak, the capital of Samangan province, without a fight after community elders asked for the city to be spared more violence, deputy governor Sefatullah Samangani told AFP news agency.\n\"The governor accepted and withdrew all the forces from the city,\" he said.\nTolo News and Shamshad TV also tweeted that Afghan forces had retreated from the city without fighting. There was no immediate word from the armed forces.\nElsewhere, US and Afghan planes have been carrying out airstrikes - the advance of the militants has not been halted, but Afghan officials say dozens of Taliban have died. \nHeavy fighting has been reported in Pul-e-Khumri and in Mazar-e-Sharif, a trading hub on the border with Uzbekistan. Army commanders say they have pushed back militants from its outskirts. \nOn Monday morning a loud explosion was heard outside police headquarters in the southern city of Lashkar Gah, where the two sides have been fighting for more than a week.\nResidents said about 20 civilians had been killed in the past two days, and a school and a clinic destroyed.\nThe capture of several cities and ongoing heavy fighting in others has led thousands of civilians to flee. Families, some including young children and pregnant women, have abandoned their homes and headed for the capital Kabul.\nThe US Department of Defense on Monday said the security situation in Afghanistan was \"not going in the right direction\", but that Afghan security forces were capable of fighting the group. \n\"These are their military forces, these are their provincial capitals, their people to defend and it's really going to come down to the leadership that they're willing to exude here at this particular moment,\" spokesman John Kirby said."

The majority of our learning was online and we didn't get that in-person teaching experience, so it was very difficult.\"\nNearly half of this year's A-level grades were top A* and A grades in Wales, official results show.\nHowever, avoiding the \"chaos\" of last year's results has been a priority after protests led to ministers ditching an algorithm which downgraded thousands of results.\nResults day at Gower College, at times, resembled the pre-pandemic version.\nGroups of teenagers gathered outside in the sun, envelopes in hand, taking photos and discussing plans.\nBut there were strict Covid measures still in place inside and fewer nerves for A-level and AS students who had sight of their grades two months ago.\nAll in education are emphasising those individual achievements.\nBut ministers and qualifications bodies will also have to unpick the implications for the system of two years of substantial hikes in grades.\nWhat happens next year if exams are back?\nEducation Minister Jeremy Miles told me the priority will be, as it was this year, to make sure young people are not disadvantaged.\nBut as last year's results showed, balancing individuals' achievement with the 'integrity' of the system has many pitfalls.\nOne deputy head teacher insisted schools had gone \"above and beyond\" to ensure results are robust.\n\"The important thing is to celebrate the success of students,\" said Matt Salmon, of Swansea's Olchfa Comprehensive School.\n\"And to make sure we don't lose sight of the fact that these are the right results for the students on the back of what can only be described as an incredibly challenging GCSE and A-level experience for them.\"\nMr Salmon, also vice president of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said he had more confidence in this year's system than last year when results decided by teachers were downgraded by what he called \"the horror of the algorithm\".\n\"I don't think anybody ever wants to repeat that,\" he said.\nIfan Gwyn, 18, from Ruthin, hopes to study physics at a university in London and feels this years' cohort deserve their grades after so much lost learning.\n\"We've been challenged just as hard as other years,\" he said.\n\"We've missed loads of school, had to adapt really quickly to online lessons, lessons being cancelled at a minute's notice and we've still been given assessments which have challenged us throughout the year.\"\nA-level student Shenona Mitra, 18, from Bangor, said it had a been a hectic and unsettled year.\nShe said she felt anxious about her results, though her provisional grades mean she is set for a place at medical school after studying biology, chemistry and maths.\n\"It was a big thing at GCSE, we all went into school and got letters - but I don't think that's going to happen this year,\" she said.\n\"There's definitely a bit of apprehension but I'm looking forward to finally seeing that I've got my place at university.\"\nOscar Ffredwyn Jones, from Gellilydan near Blaenau Ffestiniog, is spending the summer working at Portmeirion, in Gwynedd, before heading to university with an unconditional offer.\nHe said: \"I'm feeling quite confident about it - you're fairly certain of what grades you're going to be getting [so] I don't think there'll be any surprises.\"\nCommenting on the results, Dr Patrick Roach, from NASUWT - The Teachers' Union, said students and teachers had worked \"extremely hard to secure this year's results in the face of unique and hugely difficult circumstances\". \nSchool and college staff \"deserve recognition of the huge pressures and additional workload they have faced\" over the past 18 months, he added.\nWhat questions do you have about this year's results?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,COP26,UK climate change protests,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways, a major UN scientific report has said.\nThe landmark study warns of increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts and flooding, and a key temperature limit being broken in just over a decade. \nThe report \"is a code red for humanity\", says the UN chief.\nBut scientists say a catastrophe can be avoided if the world acts fast.\nThere is hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures. \nEchoing the scientists' findings, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said: \"If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe. But, as today's report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success.\" \nThe sober assessment of our planet's future has been delivered by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of scientists whose findings are endorsed by the world's governments.\nTheir report is the first major review of the science of climate change since 2013. Its release comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26.\nIn strong, confident tones, the IPCC's document says \"it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land\".\nAccording to Prof Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, UK, and one of the report's authors, the scientists cannot be any clearer on this point.\n\"It is a statement of fact, we cannot be any more certain; it is unequivocal and indisputable that humans are warming the planet.\"\nPetteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, said: \"By using sports terms, one could say the atmosphere has been exposed to doping, which means we have begun observing extremes more often than before.\"\nThe authors say that since 1970, global surface temperatures have risen faster than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years.\nThis warming is \"already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe\". \nWhether it's heatwaves like the ones recently experienced in Greece and western North America, or floods like those in Germany and China, \"their attribution to human influence has strengthened\" over the past decade.\nThe new report also makes clear that the warming we've experienced to date has made changes to many of our planetary support systems that are irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia. \nThe oceans will continue to warm and become more acidic. Mountain and polar glaciers will continue melting for decades or centuries.\n\"The consequences will continue to get worse for every bit of warming,\" said Prof Hawkins.  \n\"And for many of these consequences, there's no going back.\"\nWhen it comes to sea level rise, the scientists have modelled a likely range for different levels of emissions.\nHowever, a rise of around 2m by the end of this century cannot be ruled out - and neither can a 5m rise by 2150.\nSuch outcomes, while unlikely, would threaten many millions more people in coastal areas with flooding by 2100. \nOne key aspect of the report is the expected rate of temperature rise and what it means for the safety of humanity.\nAlmost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015.\nThis pact aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C.\nThis new report says that under all the emissions scenarios considered by the scientists, both targets will be broken this century unless huge cuts in carbon take place. \nThe authors believe that 1.5C will be reached by 2040 in all scenarios. If emissions aren't slashed in the next few years, this will happen even earlier.\nThis was predicted in the IPCC's special report on 1.5C in 2018 and this new study now confirms it.\n\"We will hit one-and-a-half degrees in individual years much earlier. We already hit it in two months during the El Ni\u00f1o in 2016,\" said Prof Malte Meinshausen, an IPCC author from the University of Melbourne in Australia. \n\"The new report's best estimate is the middle of 2034, but the uncertainty is huge and ranges between now and never.\"\nThe consequences of going past 1.5C over a period of years would be unwelcome in a world that has already experienced a rapid uptick in extreme events with a temperature rise since pre-industrial times of 1.1C.\n\"We will see even more intense and more frequent heatwaves,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the IPCC report's authors.\n\"And we will also see an increase in heavy rainfall events on a global scale, and also increases in some types of droughts in some regions of the world.\"\nProf Carolina Vera, vice-chair of the working group that produced the document, said: \"The report clearly shows that we are already living the consequences of climate change everywhere. But we will experience further and concurrent changes that increase with every additional beat of warming.\"\nSo what can be done?\nWhile this report is more clear and confident about the downsides to warming, the scientists are more hopeful that if we can cut global emissions in half by 2030 and reach net zero by the middle of this century, we can halt and possibly reverse the rise in temperatures. \nReaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible using clean technology, then burying any remaining releases using carbon capture and storage, or absorbing them by planting trees.\n\"The thought before was that we could get increasing temperatures even after net zero,\" said another co-author, Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, UK.\n\"But we now expect nature to be kind to us and if we are able to achieve net zero, we hopefully won't get any further temperature increase; and if we are able to achieve net zero greenhouse gases, we should eventually be able to reverse some of that temperature increase and get some cooling.\"\nWhile the future projections of warming are clearer than ever in this report, and many impacts simply cannot be avoided, the authors caution against fatalism.\n\"Lowering global warming really minimises the likelihood of hitting these tipping points,\" said Dr Otto. \"We are not doomed.\"\nA tipping point refers to when part of the Earth's climate system undergoes an abrupt change in response to continued warming.\nFor political leaders, the report is another in a long line of wake-up calls, but since it comes so close to November's COP26 global climate summit, it carries extra weight.\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

Information and advice is also available on the My World of Work website.\nThe #NoWrongPath campaign is again encouraging people to share their own stories on social media to highlight the different paths available to young people who may be feeling disheartened by their results.\nThe SQA's candidate advice line will run from 08:00 to 18:00 on Tuesday, and from 08:30 to 17:00 on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. The number is 0345 279 1000.\nSupport and advice is also available on the SQA website and on BBC Bitesize. Young people can also call Childline on 0800 1111 or get advice about exam results on its website.\nJorja Kemp also knew what her results would be before Tuesday morning - and that she had already been accepted to university.\nThe S6 leaver had passed a foundation apprenticeship, an NPA - or Nat 5 - in laboratory science and had been assessed on her Advanced Higher in music - therefore was relatively comfortable as she awaited results for her crash Higher in chemistry.\n\"I knew I'd got it because I've been doing music my whole life,\" she said. \"Chemistry was a bit of an unknown but I got what I needed.\n\"I think it was better for me, choosing things that were assessed throughout the year, so they took a lot of that pressure and stress off me that I know a lot of my friends had - especially with all the things that were going on with Covid.\"\nJorja believes the overall grading process was dealt with \"pretty well\", though added the final assessments \"felt like exams\".\n\"There was definitely ups and downs the whole way through - but I think the teachers and the school did everything they could, you knew they were there to support you. \n\"It was definitely difficult with technology at times but dealt with as well as could have been. Thankfully it's all over now.\""

      "text": "The world is \"dangerously close\" to running out of time to stop a climate change catastrophe, the UK government's climate chief Alok Sharma has said.\nMr Sharma - who is leading COP26, the climate summit hosted by the UK this year - said the effects were already clear with floods, fires and heatwaves.\n\"We can't afford to wait two years, five years, 10 years - this is the moment,\" he told the Observer.\nBut he did not condemn the government for allowing more fossil fuel projects.\nAnd he defended his decision to travel to more than 30 countries in seven months.\nMr Sharma's interview with the Observer comes ahead of a major report being released on Monday from the United Nations' climate change researchers.\nThe report is set to be the strongest statement yet from the UN group on the science of climate change - and will likely give details about how the world's oceans, ice caps and land will change in the next decades.\nThe summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments, which - having signed off on the findings - will be under pressure to take more action at COP26 in November.\nDoug Parr, chief scientist with Greenpeace UK, said \"world leaders have done a terrible job of listening\" to warnings about climate change.\n\"This year, this has to change. We don't need more pledges, commitments and targets - we need real action right here right now.\"\nWildfires are currently raging in Greece, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes - and fires have also been burning in Turkey and California in the US. This summer, western Europe also saw its worst flooding in decades, which killed dozens of people.\nMr Sharma said if urgent action was not taken, the consequences would be \"catastrophic\". \n\"I don't think there's any other word for it,\" he said. \"You're seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world. Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record.\"\nHe added: \"We're seeing the impacts across the world - in the UK or the terrible flooding we've seen across Europe and China, or forest fires, the record temperatures that we've seen in North America. Every day you will see a new high being recorded in one way or another across the world.\"\nMr Sharma said the report released on Monday is \"going to be the starkest warning yet that human behaviour is alarmingly accelerating global warming\".\n\"I don't think we're out of time but I think we're getting dangerously close to when we might be out of time. We will see [from the IPCC] a very, very clear warning that unless we act now, we will unfortunately be out of time.\"\n\"Africa has been waiting for the rest of the world to catch up and act on climate change for years,\" Fredrick Njehu, Christian Aid's senior climate change and energy adviser for Africa, highlighting the \"changing rainfall patterns or overbearing heat\" endured by the continent in recent years.\nHe added: \"The important thing now is that rich world governments make up for lost time and act quickly to reduce emissions and deliver promised financial support for the vulnerable.\" \nGlasgow is set to host the COP26 summit in November - which is the UN climate change conference. \nThe summit is seen as vital if climate change is to be brought under control, and leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. \nBut campaigners have accused the UK of hypocrisy, as there are plans to tap a new oil field off Shetland. The government has also said more oil and gas wells can be drilled in the North Sea, and there are plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria.\nEarlier this year, the global energy watchdog the International Energy Agency said there cannot be any new investment in oil, gas or coal projects if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C.\nMr Sharma refused to criticise the government's plan for the projects, saying: \"Future [fossil fuel] licences are going to have to adhere to the fact we have committed to go to net zero by 2050 in legislation.\n\"There will be a climate check on any licences.\"\nMr Sharma's interview comes after he was criticised for flying abroad for meetings - and visiting more than 30 countries in seven months.\nHowever, since then some environmental campaigners including Greenpeace have defended him, saying face-to-face meetings are important to persuade other nations to tackle climate change.\nMr Sharma told the Observer that in-person meetings were \"incredibly vital and actually impactful\".\n\"It makes a vital difference, to build those personal relationships which are going to be incredibly important as we look to build consensus,\" he said.\nIt also emerged in the Sunday Mirror that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did not self-isolate after returning from France, which was on the amber plus list meaning all arrivals must quarantine.  \nA government spokesman said it was Mr Raab's job to represent the UK abroad and he followed Covid guidelines on return. \nThere is an exemption for ministers to avoid quarantine when returning from abroad."

      "text": "A former prison officer has been jailed for forming a relationship with an inmate and helping him escape. \nErica Whittingham, 33, became \"smitten\" with violent robber Michael Seddon after her marriage broke down.\nDerby Crown Court heard she believed Seddon loved her, but he then got into a relationship with another woman while on the run from HMP Sudbury.\nWhittingham, from Bramshall, Uttoxeter, was given a three-year prison sentence after admitting two offences.\nThe first was harbouring an escaped prisoner, between 30 September 2019 and 18 March 2020.\nThe other was misconduct in a public office, between 8 January 2017 and 3 October 2019, which related to the relationship she formed with Seddon.\nMark Sharman, Whittingham's defence barrister, said she had been diagnosed with depression as a result of what happened.\n\"She was smitten with this man,\" he said.\n\"It is right that history is littered with the often foolish and extreme things people have done in the name of love.\"\nThe judge, Recorder Balraj Bhatia QC, said it was a \"difficult and sad case\".\n\"I accept that you may have been going through difficult times, that your marriage of 11 years standing had dissolved, and you may have been emotionally vulnerable, but you knew what you were doing was wrong,\" he said.\n\"The evidence makes it plain that you were responsible for escorting him away from those premises in due course, in the knowledge that he was an escaped prisoner.\"\nThe court heard the pair met through work, when she was a custody officer at HMP Dovegate, a category B prison near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire.\nHe was serving a sentence of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) for robbery. These sentences were abolished in 2012, but were previously given to prisoners regarded as too dangerous to be released when their original sentences expired.\nSeddon was jailed in 2011 for tying up and attacking a 78-year-old man at his farmhouse in Bloxworth, Dorset.\nHis relationship with Whittingham continued after he was transferred to HMP Sudbury, which is an open prison in Derbyshire.\nHe escaped from the prison on 1 October 2019. Police said he climbed over a fence as staff gave chase, then fled in a waiting car driven by Whittingham.\nShe drove him to Stoke-on-Trent the following morning where he then caught a train to Liverpool.\nDaren Samat, prosecuting, said the pair remained in contact and met up \"on no fewer than eight occasions\" at various locations around the country, with Whittingham paying for accommodation and also hotel stays.\nHowever, he said there was a break between 22 January 2020 and 26 March 2020, when Seddon formed a relationship with a woman in the Bournemouth area.\nSeddon was eventually arrested on 27 March 2020 and taken to HMP Winchester. His phone calls at the prison were monitored, and these revealed his relationship with Whittingham. \nMr Sharman said his client had initially resisted Seddon's advances.\n\"Mr Seddon had put some pressure on her for want of a better word, once he noticed she was no longer wearing her wedding ring,\" he said.\n\"She sadly, eventually, succumbed to the attentions of Mr Seddon and the advances he was making.\n\"She is brutally honest in the pre-sentence report when she recalls that she had found someone to love her, someone she could talk to. Whether that was reciprocated or not, that was how she genuinely feels he felt towards her.\"\nSeddon was previously jailed for an extra six months after admitting escaping lawful custody.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "R&B singer R. Kelly has appeared in court in New York, as jury selection for his sex trafficking trial begins. \nIt comes more than two years after he was charged with abusing women and underage girls for almost two decades. \nThe Grammy Award-winning singer faces charges including child sexual exploitation, racketeering and bribery. He has pleaded not guilty. \nPotential jurors are being questioned over whether they can keep an open mind in the case.          \nFollowing jury selection, the trial is due to begin on 18 August and could last several weeks. A conviction could result in decades in prison for the 54-year-old.\nCases have also been filed against him in Illinois and Minnesota.\nWhen asked how he was feeling, Kelly's lawyer Deveraux Cannick told AFP news agency: \"Just another Monday.\"\nKelly, one of the biggest R&B stars of the 1990s, has been in custody since July 2019. \nThe New York indictment accuses the singer - whose real name is Robert Kelly - of leading an entourage of managers, bodyguards and others who recruited and groomed women and girls for sex. Prosecutors say victims were selected at concerts and other venues. \nIt says he isolated victims from family and friends and required them to call him \"Daddy\".\nProsecutors have also charged Kelly with bribing an Illinois official to obtain fake ID to marry the singer Aaliyah in 1994, when she was 15 and he was 27.\nSome of the allegations against him were discussed in the 2019 documentary series Surviving R Kelly.

      "text": "Top grades for A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland have reached a record high - with 44.8% getting A* or A grades.\nThis second year of replacement results after exams were cancelled, has seen even higher results than last year when 38.5% achieved top grades.\nHeads' leader Geoff Barton said it was \"comparing apples with oranges\" to compare these results with other years.\nMore than 200,000 students are also getting vocational BTec results.\nIn Scotland, the pass rates for Highers and Nationals dropped slightly - but scores were still well above pre-pandemic levels.\nThe sharp rise in top grades at A-level means that the proportion getting top A* and A grades has risen by almost 75% since the last time conventional exams were taken in 2019.\nWith more top grades and record numbers applying for university, it will put pressure on places for the most competitive universities and courses.\nThis is likely to be most acute for medicine courses - and students asked to change to another medical school because of a lack of spaces will be offered \u00a310,000 as an incentive.  \nThe Medical Schools Council, representing medical schools across the UK, has launched a \"brokerage programme\" to match applicants to available spaces, with more people than usual getting the required grades.\nUnder this scheme for oversubscribed schools, students that need to move medical schools will receive a payment of \u00a310,000 \"for the inconvenience\".\nOn Tuesday morning, the admissions service Ucas said a record 396,000 students have been confirmed in their first choice course - up 8% on last year.\nDr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of leading universities, warned increases in the top grades meant that some university courses \"may not be able to accept students who narrowly missed their offer grades this time.\" \nSimon Lebus, interim chairman of the exams watchdog, Ofqual, said: \"We've always said outcomes from this year were likely to be different,\" said  but he assured students they had been \"fairly treated\" and grades, based on teachers' judgements, could be trusted.\nExam board officials said the higher grades this year reflected that no one had a \"bad day\" in an exam and that students had \"multiple chances\" to show that they could do well.\nSchools could use a range of evidence for grades, including \"mini-exams\", coursework and mock exams - with one in five schools having a sample of their grades checked by exam boards. \nDuring the checking process, exam boards queried submitted grades in 15% of schools and colleges, but only 1% were altered.\nNational Association of Head Teachers' leader Paul Whiteman rejected warnings of \"grade inflation\", saying: \"The results in 2021 cannot be easily compared to any other year.\"\nThe Education Policy Institute said grades had been expected to be much higher overall, but of more concern would be \"inconsistencies\" at a local level.\nVocational exam results are also being published - and Kirstie Donnelly, of City & Guilds, said young people should \"explore all the options open to them\", including apprenticeships and degree apprenticeships.\nEngland's Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, praised students for their work in an \"extraordinary and challenging year\".\n\"We should all celebrate their resilience and ability to overcome adversity,\" he said.\nBut Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the government had not supported young people and \"let them down at every turn\".\nThere was an atmosphere of profound relief pervading the entrance hall of Loughborough College.\nAbout 40 students made the trip in person to collect their A-level and BTec results - rather than the 300 who would usually attend, so the Covid pandemic even affected the result-collecting process.\nShivani had been trying to stay as calm as possible before receiving her grades.\nIn the end it was good news, she got the grades needed to study accountancy and finance at the University of Loughborough.\nIt's not really sunk in yet but she's pleased - and says it's strange not to have sat exams this year and it might seem more real if she had.\nThis year has been hard, Shivani says, and although she has tried to be resilient, it has had an impact on her mental and emotional health. She really \"missed being around people\".\nShe says remote learning helped her in a way -  she lives with her grandmother and her family were very cautious - but she was upset when the exams were cancelled.\n\"There is still a part of me that thinks, I would feel more deserving if I sat the exams - but I realise it is out of my control.\"\nCollege principal Jo Maher said it may have been a challenging year, but the students have been amazingly resilient, and that her staff could not have worked harder.\nFinn says he in a state of \"slight disbelief\" that he's done so well, getting the grades to study law at Oxford University.\n\"Uncertainty has been the overriding aspect of this experience - but I like challenges,\" he says.\n\"There is a lot of talk about grade inflation and I appreciate that is a real concern - but ultimately in the circumstances that have prevailed, the alternatives would not have been fair.\" \nOur experts are on hand to answer your questions about this year's results.\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Her abuser was convicted 27 years later.  \nBy the time she applied to the Criminal Injuries and Compensation Authority Ms Mitchell was told she was no longer eligible because of her own conviction.\nThe rule, which bars crime victims from compensation if they have an unspent conviction, was introduced in 2012.\nSome victims' organisations argue it disproportionately affects victims of child sex abuse. \nIn 2018, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse (IICSA) recommended the rule be revised. \nThe government said it would consult on the IICSA recommendations but then said an internal review had been conducted and the rule would not be changed.\nMs Mitchell challenged the justice secretary's decision and High Court judge Mrs Justice Lang on Monday ordered Robert Buckland to conduct a public consultation.\nThe Criminal Injuries and Compensation Authority oversees compensation awards in England, Wales and Scotland.\nMs Mitchell said: \"It shouldn't take a court case to make the government do what it has promised.\n\"But I'm pleased this decision means victims of child abuse like me can now tell policy makers directly how the rule affects us. \n\"The rule is unfair and must be changed.

      "tags": "Inflation,Car industry",
      "text": "Second-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in the last few months after a shortage of new models.\nYear on year, the used car market grew 108.6% in the second quarter, with more than 2.2 million vehicles changing hands, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.\nThe number of sales was up 6.6% on pre-pandemic levels in 2019.\nPetrol cars made up most of the sales, but demand for electric cars is growing fast.\nIncreased demand led to a rise in sales of older used cars, with only 12.7% of all vehicles sold being made within the last three years, the lowest on record.\nThe SMMT said the increase in sales tracked the country's easing of Covid restrictions, with demand rising as businesses reopened.\nFord Fiestas, Vauxhall Corsas, Ford Focuses and Volkswagen Golfs were the most popular models, with black, silver, blue and grey being the most common colour choices.\nMarshall Motors, which is one of UK's top ten car dealerships, said on Tuesday that it had recorded revenue and underlying profit in the first half of the year.\nChief executive Daksh Gupta said the company had \"seen exceptional market tailwinds in the used car market\" as a shortage of computer chips reduced the numbers of new cars on the market.\n\"Ultimately what that has done is push used car prices up significantly,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\nHe added that it is \"difficult to call\" how long there would be such a high demand for used cars \"because the whole situation links to new car supply\".\n\"The position is unclear and many manufacturers are having to deal with very complex production challenges,\" he said. \"We expect this disruption to go well into 2022.\"\nSMMT boss Mike Hawes said many consumers had turned to the second hand market due to the shortage of new cars at a time of \"increased need for personal mobility with people remaining wary of public transport as they return to work\".\nThe shortage has been linked to a lack of parts. When lockdowns forced production lines to halt, microchip manufacturers diverted the chips that would normally go into new cars to the consumer electronics market, and supply is yet to fully recover. \nIt has driven up the price of second hand cars, said the SMMT. One dealership, Nuneaton Cars, said buyers were attempting to gazump each other to get hold of used cars already marked as sold.\nSales of second- hand battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles more than tripled in the second quarter.\nHowever, electric vehicles made up just 1.3% of second-hand car sales in the second quarter of 2021.\nThe SMMT said the used electric car market \"is not yet seeing the acceleration of uptake as has been seen in the new car market\".\n\"The scale of the challenge to transition the entire used car [fleet] away from traditional fuels remains significant,\" the industry body said.\nThis comes amid a major UN scientific report that said human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways.\nDespite this, Mr Hawes said the rebound in sales was \"welcome news\" due to a buoyant used car market being \"necessary to maintain strong residual values which, in turn, supports new car transactions\".\n\"We now need to see a similar rebound in new car sales to accelerate the fleet renewal necessary to deliver immediate and continuous improvements in air quality and carbon emissions,\" he said.\nNew car registrations fell by almost a third last month, marking the worst July sales since 1998.\nJust 123,296 new cars were registered in the UK, a 29.5% decline on July 2020."

It is not even robbing Peter to pay Paul, it is just recirculation of Greensill funds.\"\nA second email sent at the start of May suggests an insolvency practitioner should be sent in to review Mr Gupta's businesses. It said: \"It may well be that administration is required.\"\nInstead of raising the alarm about GFG's inability to make loan payments, Greensill Capital looked for a new investor. \nIt turned to the UK government - and David Cameron was sent in to try to make it happen.\nMr Cameron sent 56 messages lobbying ministers and senior civil servants. He wanted the Bank of England to invest more than \u00a310bn of taxpayers' money in Greensill's loans. \nThe Bank of England turned Greensill down, but in June 2020 Greensill was approved as a lender under a government scheme designed to get emergency cash to companies affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan (CLBIL) scheme run by the government-owned British Business Bank allowed Greensill to make loans backed by an 80% taxpayer guarantee. \nGreensill was only supposed to lend a maximum of \u00a350m to a single borrower or group of companies under the CLBIL scheme.\nBut Greensill Capital lent Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance \u00a3350m by making seven taxpayer-backed loans of \u00a350m to seven of his companies.\nGreensill also made an eighth loan of \u00a350m to another company closely associated with Mr Gupta.\nThe companies have all failed to make repayments on the taxpayer-backed loans.\nThe government guarantee has been suspended while the loans are investigated - but that is being challenged and the taxpayer could still lose \u00a3320m.\nMr Gupta's company, GFG Alliance, and its financing arrangements with Greensill Capital, are now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office.\nGFG Alliance said it takes the investigation seriously and that all allegations of improper conduct are denied in the strongest terms. \nThe company said it has been working tirelessly to stabilise the businesses affected by the collapse of Greensill and deliver refinancing. \nGFG said: \"We remain fully committed to UK industry and to a solution that will enable GFG to repay creditors and create a sustainable future for its UK businesses.\" \nLex Greensill, the founder of Greensill Capital, said the government guarantee on the loans should not be withdrawn.\n\"Our access to any government-backed schemes with respect to funding our clients has always drawn upon robust advice from leading law firms to ensure Greensill complied with relevant rules,\" he said.\nHe also said he was not aware his staff had recommended sending in an insolvency practitioner to GFG.\nMr Cameron's spokesman said he was not involved in lending decisions and had no knowledge of GFG's financial situation.\n\"He was a part-time adviser to the company - one of several - and had no Executive or Board responsibilities whatsoever,\" he said.\n\"He made the representations he did to the UK government not just because he thought it would benefit the company, but because he sincerely believed there would be a material benefit for UK businesses at a challenging time.\"\nPanorama has also discovered how investors were misled about Greensill Capital's investments.\nGreensill made money through supply chain finance - which involves making loans to companies that are waiting for invoices to be paid by their customers.\nWhen the invoices were paid, the cash would be there to pay investors back, with interest.\nTo fund the loans, it teamed up with Swiss bank Credit Suisse, which raised $10bn from investors.\nIt was the Swiss bank's job to market and sell the Greensill investments, and to inform investors about potential risks. \nInvestors thought their cash was safe, because it was supposed to be secured against the unpaid invoices.\nBut this year it was revealed that some of the invoices simply did not exist.\nUS court papers show how between 2018 and 2021, Greensill lent $850m of investors' cash to a US coal company called Bluestone Resources.\nOnly $70m of that money was secured against real invoices for coal that Bluestone had actually sold.\nInvestors did not know it, but the remaining $780m was only backed by predicted coal sales that may or may not happen in the future. \nLex Greensill told Panorama that this type of financing was commonplace in the financial services industry.\nHe said the predicted Bluestone business was all \"based upon future trade that is likely to occur with current customers\".\nPanorama discovered that was not true.\nThe programme obtained the names of the companies that Lex Greensill said were current customers of Bluestone.\nSix of the companies said they were not Bluestone customers and they weren't planning to buy its coal in the future.\nLex Greensill later told Panorama the coal buyers did not have to be current customers. Bluestone only had to state it expected to make the sales at some future point and Greensill was not obliged to make checks, he said.\nMr Greensill denied misleading investors. He said his company made all the appropriate disclosures to Credit Suisse and the Swiss Bank was \"solely responsible for making any disclosures to their investors\".\nHe said the loans were always secured against assets and personal guarantees, and were backed up by insurance that would pay 100% of any shortfall. \nCredit Suisse says its focus is on returning cash to investors and that 59% has been returned so far.\nPanorama: David Cameron and the Missing Billions is on BBC One at 19:35 BST on Monday or later on iPlayer"

      "tags": "China,Canada",
      "text": "A Canadian citizen has lost his appeal against a death sentence in China for drug smuggling.\nThe court said it upheld Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's sentence because evidence against him was \"sufficient\".\nSchellenberg was initially sentenced to 15 years in jail, but in 2019 an appeal court said this was too lenient, leading to a retrial and a death sentence.\nThe verdict comes as relations between Canada and China remain fraught. \nThe Canadian ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, condemned the Chinese court's ruling, saying it was \"no coincidence\" that the verdict was released while an extradition battle involving senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was ongoing in Canada.\nMs Meng, the daughter of the founder of the Chinese telecoms company, is currently detained in Canada on a US warrant.\nCanada had earlier accused China of conducting \"hostage diplomacy\", though Beijing denies the cases are linked.\nSchellenberg was detained in 2014 and charged with planning to smuggle almost 500lb (227kg) of methamphetamine from China to Australia.\nHe denies the charges, and said he went to China as a tourist. \nIn November 2018, he was sentenced to 15 years in jail. \nBut a few days later, Canada detained Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei, on a US extradition warrant.\nChina at the time warned of unspecified consequences unless Ms Meng was released.\nSchellenberg later appealed against the 15-year prison term, but instead of reducing his sentence, judges ruled that his previous sentence had been too light and instead sentenced him to death. \nAt his hearing, the judges said that evidence proved he was more seriously involved in international drug smuggling.\nAt the time, Zhang Dongshuo, Schellenberg's lawyer, told Reuters that the sentence should not have been increased because no new evidence was presented at the trial.\nAnother high-profile case involving a Canadian citizen is expected to be handed down by a Chinese court later this week.\nMichael Spavor, a businessman accused of espionage, was arrested in China two years ago along with fellow Canadian and former diplomat Michael Kovrig. Their detentions came days after Canada detained Ms Meng. \nIn March, the trial of Mr Spavor, lasting just two hours in the northern Chinese city of Dandong, ended with no verdict. \nCanadian diplomats including the charge d'affaires to China were denied entry to the court. \nAt the time, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the closed-door proceedings \"completely unacceptable\".\nA man convicted of trying to smuggle drugs, a businessman, a former diplomat; all are Canadian citizens. All are incarcerated in China. \nBeijing says they are criminals - sentenced, convicted or awaiting trial. But Canada believes all are all inextricably linked to the fate of a Chinese telecoms executive sitting in her house in Canada, accused of fraud and fighting extradition. \nMeng Wanzhou was detained just after Robert Shellenberg was first tried. At his subsequent retrial the Chinese court increased his sentence to death. The crimes committed by the \"Two Michaels,\" as they've become known, are far less clear. \nCanada's government believes their arrest and detention, in the weeks following Meng's apprehension at an airport, was retaliation. An intimidatory move linked directly to efforts to put the Huawei executive on trial in the US. China has denied that.\nIn 2019 the founder of Huawei Ren Zhengfei - who is the father of Meng Wanzhou - claimed in an interview that her arrest was politically motivated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Senior school pupils are in the middle of sitting assessments which will decide their qualifications.\nFormal exams were cancelled for the second year in a row because of disruption caused by the pandemic.\nThe replacement system is meant to be based on \"teacher judgement\" backed up by assessment. So how is it going?\nThe system put in place to award grades for National 5s, Highers and Advanced Highers this year is called the Alternative Certification Model. \nIt was first created after Deputy First Minister John Swinney announced the cancellation of National 5 final exams, which are mostly sat in fourth year.\nThen it was updated when Highers and Advanced Highers, which are sat in fifth and sixth year, were also cancelled in December last year. \nInstead of final, end-of-year national tests, the model was meant to rely on teachers gathering evidence throughout the remainder of the school year and using that to support the grades they submit to the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA).\nThe second national lockdown and a return to remote learning in January meant that the model had to be adapted to focus on just \"teaching and learning\" until after the Easter holidays. \nThis has resulted, for many, in a bulk of assessments coming at once, leading to claims these were \"exams by another name\".\nSome schools are giving study leave, others are doing the assessments within the normal school day.\nIt's a scenario which earlier documents from the SQA show it was hoping to avoid.\nThe organisation's update from 16 December, before the latest lockdown was announced, said \"schools and colleges will need to plan accordingly to give all learners appropriate time to prepare for each subject. This will help to avoid learners being overloaded with multiple assessments at any one time.\"\nThe SQA has since cut back on the number of pieces of evidence teachers need to provide, and pushed back the date that they have to submit grades until 25 June.\nThe SQA is currently sampling work from schools to make sure the marking schemes are correct, and providing feedback to teachers.\nColleagues across local authorities are also involved in what's being called \"quality assurance\", to make sure marking is fair.\nTeachers will tell pupils their provisional grades before the end of term.\nThe model calls them provisional, but there are reassurances that these grades will not be changed unless there has been some sort of computer or human error - and not because of an algorithm or external marking. Official certificates will arrive on 10 August.\nSome teaching unions have argued against the certification model. Seamus Searson, from the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the system would \"not work in the best interests of pupils\". He is worried that time constraints will mean teachers \"can't get enough evidence to prove what the youngsters can really achieve\".\nDr Patrick Roach, NASUWT general secretary, said a \"failure to make timely decisions\" had led to schools \"having insufficient time to undertake what is a mammoth task of preparing assessments, marking and quality assurance\".\nHowever, the EIS teaching union helped create the model and says it gives pupils \"the best opportunity to demonstrate what they have learned\".\nSome pupils have told the BBC about the stress they are under, and Scotland's largest independent parents' group has questioned the fairness of assessments.\nThe Scottish government and the SQA have repeatedly argued that the model is the best way to measure how well pupils are doing academically in the current circumstances. \nAn SQA spokesman said: \"We fully appreciate that this is a challenging time for learners across Scotland.\n\"The National Qualifications 2021 Group, which includes the representation from across the education system, co-created this year's alternative certification model.  \n\"SQA has provided a flexible and consistent framework for schools and colleges this year, including detailed guidance, material and support, based on assessment standards that teachers and lecturers are familiar with.\"\nWe still don't know.\nThe SQA started a consultation on how it could work. This included options which would have schools deal directly with appeals, and ones where they are passed on to the SQA. \nThe final plan, which was due in \"early May\", is now expected imminently. It's thought the new education secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, will have to give it the final go-ahead. \nWhat will be worth watching closely is whether the system allows for grades to be revised down as well as up when they are re-marked during an appeal.\nThis could be seen as discouraging pupils not to put themselves forward, if their mark could go down."

      "tags": "Inflation,Car industry",
      "text": "Second-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in the last few months after a shortage of new models.\nYear on year, the used car market grew 108.6% in the second quarter, with more than 2.2 million vehicles changing hands, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.\nThe number of sales was up 6.6% on pre-pandemic levels in 2019.\nPetrol cars made up most of the sales, but demand for electric cars is growing fast.\nIncreased demand led to a rise in sales of older used cars, with only 12.7% of all vehicles sold being made within the last three years, the lowest on record.\nThe SMMT said the increase in sales tracked the country's easing of Covid restrictions, with demand rising as businesses reopened.\nFord Fiestas, Vauxhall Corsas, Ford Focuses and Volkswagen Golfs were the most popular models, with black, silver, blue and grey being the most common colour choices.\nMarshall Motors, which is one of UK's top ten car dealerships, said on Tuesday that it had recorded revenue and underlying profit in the first half of the year.\nChief executive Daksh Gupta said the company had \"seen exceptional market tailwinds in the used car market\" as a shortage of computer chips reduced the numbers of new cars on the market.\n\"Ultimately what that has done is push used car prices up significantly,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\nHe added that it is \"difficult to call\" how long there would be such a high demand for used cars \"because the whole situation links to new car supply\".\n\"The position is unclear and many manufacturers are having to deal with very complex production challenges,\" he said. \"We expect this disruption to go well into 2022.\"\nSMMT boss Mike Hawes said many consumers had turned to the second hand market due to the shortage of new cars at a time of \"increased need for personal mobility with people remaining wary of public transport as they return to work\".\nThe shortage has been linked to a lack of parts. When lockdowns forced production lines to halt, microchip manufacturers diverted the chips that would normally go into new cars to the consumer electronics market, and supply is yet to fully recover. \nIt has driven up the price of second hand cars, said the SMMT. One dealership, Nuneaton Cars, said buyers were attempting to gazump each other to get hold of used cars already marked as sold.\nSales of second- hand battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles more than tripled in the second quarter.\nHowever, electric vehicles made up just 1.3% of second-hand car sales in the second quarter of 2021.\nThe SMMT said the used electric car market \"is not yet seeing the acceleration of uptake as has been seen in the new car market\".\n\"The scale of the challenge to transition the entire used car [fleet] away from traditional fuels remains significant,\" the industry body said.\nThis comes amid a major UN scientific report that said human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways.\nDespite this, Mr Hawes said the rebound in sales was \"welcome news\" due to a buoyant used car market being \"necessary to maintain strong residual values which, in turn, supports new car transactions\".\n\"We now need to see a similar rebound in new car sales to accelerate the fleet renewal necessary to deliver immediate and continuous improvements in air quality and carbon emissions,\" he said.\nNew car registrations fell by almost a third last month, marking the worst July sales since 1998.\nJust 123,296 new cars were registered in the UK, a 29.5% decline on July 2020."

The UN's chief has labelled it a \"code red for humanity\".\nThe report says there is \"unequivocal\" evidence that humans are to blame for increasing temperatures. Within the next two decades, temperatures are likely to rise 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, it adds.\nThat could lead to sea levels rising by half a metre, but a rise of 2m by the end of the century cannot be ruled out.\nThat could have a devastating impact on low-lying coastal countries, said Diann Black-Layne, ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda, and lead climate negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.\n\"That is our very future, right there,\" Ms Black-Layne said.\nThe report comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26.\nBoris Johnson, who is hosting the conference, said the report showed help was needed for countries bearing the brunt of climate change.\n\"Today's report makes for sobering reading, and it is clear that the next decade is going to be pivotal to securing the future of our planet,\" he said.\n\"We know what must be done to limit global warming - consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline.\"\nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, more than 190 governments agreed the world should limit global warming to 2C or ideally 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nBut the new report says that under all scenarios, both targets will be broken this century unless huge cuts in carbon take place.\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry said that to reach the targets, countries urgently needed to change their economies.\n\"This is the critical decade for action, and COP26 in Glasgow must be a turning point in this crisis,\" Mr Kerry said.\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg, who confirmed on Monday that she will attend the COP26 talks, said the report \"confirms what we already know... that we are in an emergency\".\n\"We can still avoid the worst consequences, but not if we continue like today, and not without treating the crisis like a crisis,\" she said on Twitter."

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  \nThe number of UK adults who have had both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine has passed 75% of the population, just over eight months after the rollout began. Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed it as a \"huge national achievement\", but Oxford Vaccine scientist Prof Sir Andrew Pollard warned that reaching herd immunity with the highly contagious Delta variant is \"not a possibility\". He also criticised UK plans to give the most vulnerable groups a third jab as a booster, saying with so much of the world unvaccinated, doses needed to go \"where they can have the greatest impact\".\nFor students, the headline was that top grades in A-level results reached a record high of 44.8%, using teacher assessments after exams were cancelled. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will also have been celebrating the avoidance of the chaotic scenes and protests that followed last year's algorithmically determined grades. Exam officials said their approach this year reflected an ideal world where no one had a bad day in an exam hall and everyone had multiple chances to do well. After students endured two years of unprecedented educational disruption, head teachers say the decision was the right one - although it means a crush for places at top universities.\nUK travellers may still be banned from the US, but budget airline JetBlue says demand is strong enough from its North American customers to go ahead with the launch of its long-awaited New York to London service. The airline says it wants to have a \"disruptive\" effect on the market for transatlantic flights, although tickets in the days after Wednesday's launch are only a fraction cheaper than competitors. JetBlue says return fares will be available for less than $600 (\u00a3433) for people who can book further ahead.\nDays after travel rules were changed to allow fully vaccinated passengers from France to the UK to avoid quarantine, some people are reporting they have wrongly been subjected to self-isolation checks. David Tongs, a French resident staying in with his daughter in Southampton said he returned to her home to find an official outside who threatened him with a \u00a3500 fine. Alice Kirk travelled from France to West Sussex on Sunday after the rule change, and was visited a day later for a quarantine check. She was told the official had visited multiple people that day with the same issue. \nAn 11-year-old boy is getting ready to spend his 500th night camping outside as part of a fundraising challenge that began in lockdown. Max Woosey began raising money for the North Devon Hospice in March 2020 after hearing many charity events had been cancelled in the pandemic. He's now raised \u00a3640,000. He chose camping in tribute to a neighbour, cared for in the hospice during his final days, who gave him a tent \"to have an adventure in\". Max, who pitched his tent in Downing Street and met the prime minister in July, will spend tonight in a shelter he built in the woods with his parents and best friend.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nSelf-isolation rules are changing in England next week for people who are fully vaccinated or under 18.

      "text": "Scientists are testing an artificial-intelligence system thought to be capable of diagnosing dementia after a single brain scan. \nIt may also be able to predict whether the condition will remain stable for many years, slowly deteriorate or need immediate treatment.\nCurrently, it can take several scans and tests to diagnose dementia.\nThe researchers involved say earlier diagnoses with their system could greatly improve patient outcomes.\n\"If we intervene early, the treatments can kick in early and slow down the progression of the disease and at the same time avoid more damage,\" Prof Zoe Kourtzi, of Cambridge University and a fellow of national centre for AI and data science The Alan Turing Institute, said.\n\"And it's likely that symptoms occur much later in life or may never occur.\"\nProf Kourtzi's system compares brain scans of those worried they might have dementia with those of thousands of dementia patients and their relevant medical records.\nThe algorithm can identify patterns in the scans even expert neurologists cannot see and match them to patient outcomes in its database.\nIn pre-clinical tests, it has been able to diagnose dementia, years before symptoms develop, even when there is no obvious signs of damage on the brain scan.\nThe trial, at Addenbrooke's Hospital and other memory clinics around the country, will test whether it works in a clinical setting, alongside conventional ways of diagnosing dementia. \nIn the first year, about 500 patients are expected to participate.\nTheir results will go to their doctors, who can, if necessary, advise on the course of treatment.\nConsultant neurologist Dr Tim Rittman, who is leading the study, with neuroscientists at Cambridge University, called the artificial-intelligence system a \"fantastic development\".\n\"These set of diseases are really devastating for people,\" he said.\n\"So when I am delivering this information to a patient, anything I can do to be more confident about the diagnosis, to give them more information about the likely progression of the disease to help them plan their lives is a great thing to be able to do.\"\nAmong the first to participate in the trial, Denis Clark, 75, retired from his job as an executive for a meat company five years ago.\nLast year, his wife, Penelope, noticed he was sometimes struggling with his memory. \nAnd they are now concerned he is developing dementia.\nDenis tries to describe his symptoms but Penelope interjects to say he finds it hard to explain what is happening.\nThe couple are worried about having to sell their home to fund Denis's care. \nSo Penelope is relieved they should not have to wait long for a diagnosis and an indication of how any dementia is likely to progress. \n\"We could then plan financially,\" she said. \n\"We would know whether as a couple we could have a few holidays before things get so bad that I can't take Denis on holiday.\"\nAnother of Dr Rittman's patients, Mark Thompson, 57, who began having memory lapses 10 months ago, before the trial of the artificial-intelligence system began, said it would have made a big difference to him had it been available.\n\"I had test after test after test and at least four scans before I was diagnosed,\" he said.\n\"The medical team was marvellous and did everything they could to get to the bottom of what was wrong with me. \n\"But the uncertainty was causing me more... mental problems than any caused by the condition. \n\"Was it a tumour? Would they need to operate? It caused me so much stress not knowing what was wrong with me.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter."

      "tags": "Prince Andrew, Duke of York,Jeffrey Epstein death,Virginia Giuffre,UK Royal Family,Jeffrey Epstein,New York",
      "text": "A US woman who alleges she was brought to the UK aged 17 to have sex with the Duke of York has filed a civil case in New York claiming he abused her.\nVirginia Giuffre, who was an accuser of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, claims she was sexually assaulted by Prince Andrew in London and New York.\nA spokeswoman for Prince Andrew, 61, said there was \"no comment\" on the case, which was filed under New York's Child Victims Act.\nHe has consistently denied the claims.\nThe case alleges the prince sexually abused Ms Giuffre - then known as Virginia Roberts - at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little St James in the US Virgin Islands.\nIt claims the prince engaged in sexual acts without her consent, knowing how old she was and \"that she was a sex-trafficking victim\".\nThe case also says the \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" continues to cause Ms Giuffre, now 38, \"significant emotional and psychological distress and harm\".\n\"In this country no person, whether president or prince, is above the law, and no person, no matter how powerless or vulnerable, can be deprived of the law's protection,\" the documents read.\n\"Twenty years ago Prince Andrew's wealth, power, position, and connections enabled him to abuse a frightened, vulnerable child with no one there to protect her. It is long past the time for him to be held to account.\"\nSpeaking about Ms Giuffre's allegations in 2019, Prince Andrew said they \"never happened\". \n\"It didn't happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,\" he told BBC Newsnight.\nIn a later statement, Prince Andrew said: \"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. \n\"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.\"\nThe narratives put forward by Ms Giuffre and Prince Andrew are a hundred miles apart.\nPrince Andrew says he has no recollection of meeting Ms Giuffre, that he never had sex with her.\nHowever, there is a photo that clearly shows him with his arm around Ms Giuffre in a location that Ghislaine Maxwell's brother, Ian, has confirmed looks very much like her then London house.\nSome \"friends\" of Prince Andrew have anonymously suggested that the photo is a fake. There is no evidence that this is the case.\nOne person close to the prince told the BBC recently that there was a simpler explanation - that he met thousands of people and that whilst he may have met Ms Giuffre, he simply couldn't remember her.\nPrince Andrew has said he will help law enforcement authorities with their enquiries into Jeffrey Epstein. His team pushed back very hard against the allegation from the US Attorney for the  Southern District of New York that he had not offered assistance.\nBut they will see today's lawsuit as a legal fishing expedition and will do everything they can to see that it goes no further.\nThe new legal complaint alleges that the prince and his representatives have rejected requests to provide \"whatever facts, context or explanation he might have, and to explore alternative dispute resolution approaches\". \nNew York State's Child Victims Act was signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2019.\nIt allowed survivors of childhood sexual abuse to file a case which had already been time-barred or expired, and gave them a year to do so.\nThat one-year window was then extended because of disruption to court services during the pandemic and ends this week, on 14 August.\nMr Cuomo called it a \"pathway to justice\" for people who allege they were abused when under-age and was intended to help \"right wrongs that went unacknowledged and unpunished\".\nMeanwhile, an independent inquiry found this month that Mr Cuomo harassed multiple women. Mr Cuomo has denied touching anyone inappropriately.\nMs Giuffre's legal action is a civil case filed by a private party for monetary damages, as opposed to a criminal case filed by the state.\nArick Fudali, a partner at New York legal firm Bloom, which has represented nine of Epstein's victims, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"very few\" of such cases ended up going to trial but there was a \"small chance\" this could.\nThe alternatives are that it is settled beforehand, it is struck out by a judge, or the complainant ceases the action.\nMelissa Murray, professor of law at New York University, said Prince Andrew \"could be on the hook for significant money damages\".\n\"This is not about whether or not Prince Andrew will go to jail - he has no criminal exposure from this particular case,\" she told the BBC.\nAsked how likely it was that the case would to go to trial, she said Prince Andrew's team would probably be more worried that it comes at a \"really unfortunate time\", as Ms Maxwell is due to stand trial in November.\nShe has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that she conspired with Epstein in the abuse of four under-age girls. \nProf Murray said: \"With this civil suit pending and her about to go to trial on these criminal charges, there may be even more pressure - and indeed temptation - for her to co-operate with federal prosecutors and perhaps provide more information about all of the individuals who were in the orbit of Jeffrey Epstein and that could, allegedly, include the prince himself.\""

      "text": "JetBlue has said the Covid pandemic will not stop the airline from launching its long-awaited New York to London service on Wednesday.\nChief executive Robin Hayes told the BBC there was \"strong demand\" for the route in the US where, he said, JetBlue had returned to 2019 levels.\nThe move comes as the global travel industry continues to recover.\nHoliday Inn-owner Intercontinental Hotels said holiday demand was \"returning strongly\".\nIn its latest results statement, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), whose other brands include the Crowne Plaza chain, said it had opened 132 hotels during the January-to-June period and acquired another 203, both sizeable increases on last year.\n\"Trading improved significantly during the first half of 2021, with travel demand returning strongly as vaccines roll out, restrictions ease and economic activity rebuilds,\" said IHG chief executive Keith Barr.\n\"It has been great to see our teams welcome more and more guests back into our hotels, with domestic leisure bookings leading the way, particularly in the US and China.\"\nMeasured on revenue per available room, nearly half of the group's hotels worldwide were above 2019 levels in July, it said.\nJetBlue's first transatlantic flight will leave New York's JFK airport on Wednesday evening and will land at London's Heathrow. Flights to London Gatwick will begin on 29 September.\nHowever, travelling on the route does not come cheap, at least to start with. JetBlue's website no longer has seats available for that inaugural flight, but prices for the next few days start at $941 (\u00a3679) one-way.\nThat is still slightly cheaper than British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which are both quoting a price of $980 for the same time period.\nThanks to the likes of those established competitors, there are already as many as 28 flights a day available between London and New York.\nAnd other carriers have come a cropper on the same route, including Norwegian Air, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2020 after failing to make its low-cost strategy pay.\nHowever, JetBlue will be cutting costs by using smaller aircraft, relying on the single-aisle Airbus A321LR, rather than the Boeing 787 Dreamliners that were favoured by Norwegian.\nAnd for those who can book further in advance, it is pledging to offer return fares of less than $600.\nThe airline's Mr Hayes said it had wanted to offer a New York-to-London service for a long time and flights were now \"ready to go\".\nHe said JetBlue wanted to have \"a disruptive and permanent effect\" on the market.\nUS-based travellers are now welcome to fly to the UK without having to quarantine on arrival if they have been fully vaccinated, but there is still a travel ban on people from the UK flying to the US. \nThe White House said at the end of last month that it did not intend to lift Covid-19 travel restrictions for non-Americans.\nAsked about this, Mr Hayes said JetBlue had made its views clear about the restrictions and that the current approach was \"not risk-based\"."

      "title": "Climate change: Five things we have learned from the IPCC report",
      "text": "The UN report on the science of climate change is set to make a huge impact. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers some of the key lessons from it. \nFor those who live in the West, the dangers of warming our planet are no longer something distant, impacting people in faraway places.\n\"Climate change is not a problem of the future, it's here and now and affecting every region in the world,\" said Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford, and one of the many authors on the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\nIt is the confidence of the assertions that the scientists are now making that is the real strength of this new publication.\nThe phrase \"very likely\" appears 42 times in the 40-odd pages of the Summary for Policymakers. In scientific terms, that's 90-100% certain that something is real. \n\"I think there's not one single kind of new surprise that comes out, it's the over-arching solidness that makes this the strongest IPCC report ever made,\" Prof Arthur Petersen, from University College London (UCL), told BBC News.\nProf Petersen is a former Dutch government representative at the IPCC, and was an observer at the approval session that produced this report.\n\"It's understated, it's cool, it's not accusing, it's just bang, bang, bang, one clear point after the other.\"\nThe clearest of these points is about the responsibility of humanity for climate change. \nThere's no longer any equivocating - it's us.\nWhen the last IPCC report on the science of climate change was published in 2013, the idea of 1.5C being the safe global limit for warming was barely considered.  \nBut in the political negotiations leading up to the Paris climate agreement in 2015, many developing countries and island states pushed for this lower temperature limit, arguing that it was a matter of survival for them.\nA special report on 1.5C in 2018 showed the advantages of staying under the limit were massive compared to a 2C world. Getting there would require carbon emissions to be cut in half, essentially, by 2030 and net zero emissions reached by 2050. Otherwise, the limit would be reached between 2030 and 2052. \nThis new report re-affirms this finding. Under all scenarios, the threshold is reached by 2040. If emissions aren't reined in, 1.5C could be gone in around a decade. \nReaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible using clean technology, then absorbing any remaining ones by, for example, planting trees.\nWhile the situation is very serious, it is not a sudden drop into calamity.\n\"The 1.5C threshold is an important threshold politically, of course, but from a climatic point of view, it is not a cliff edge - that once we go over 1.5C, suddenly everything will become very catastrophic,\" explained Dr Amanda Maycock, from the University of Leeds, and one of the authors of the new report.\n\"The very lowest emissions scenario that we assess in this report shows that the warming level does stabilise around or below 1.5C later on in the century. If that were the pathway that we would follow, then the the impacts would be significantly avoided.\"\nIn the past, the IPCC has been criticised for being way too conservative when it came to assessing the risk of sea-level rise. A lack of clear research saw previous reports exclude the potential impacts of the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. \nNot this time. \nThe report shows that under current scenarios, the seas could rise above the likely range, going up to 2m by the end of this century and up to 5m by 2150. While these are unlikely figures, they can't be ruled out under a very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. \nThat's bad enough - but even if we get a handle on emissions and keep temperatures around 1.5C by 2100, the waters will continue to rise long into the future. \n\"The gorilla that looms large in the background is these very scary sea-level rise numbers in the long term,\" said Prof Malte Meinshausen from the University of Melbourne and an IPCC author. \n\"In the paper it shows that even with 1.5C warming we're looking at the long-term of two to three metres. And under the highest scenarios, we could be looking at multi-metre sea-level rise by 2150. That is just scary, because it's maybe not at the end of our lifetime, but it is around the corner and it will be committing this planet to a big legacy.\"\nEven if the sea-level rise is relatively mild, it will have knock-on effects that we cannot avoid. \n\"With gradual sea-level rise, those extreme sea-level events that have occurred in the past, just once per century, will occur more and more frequently in the future,\" said Val\u00e9rie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC working group that prepared the new report.\n\"Those that occurred only once per century in the past are expected to occur once or twice per decade by mid-century. The information we provide in this report is extremely important to take into account and prepare for these events.\" \nThe warnings are clearer and more dire - but there is an important thread of hope running through this report. \nScientists have long been worried that the climate could be more sensitive to carbon dioxide than they thought. \nThey use a phrase - equilibrium climate sensitivity - to capture the range of warming that could occur if CO2 levels were doubled. \nIn the last report, in 2013, this ranged from 1.5C to 4.5C, with no best estimate. \nThis time round, the range has narrowed and the authors opt for 3C as their most likely figure. \nWhy is this important? \n\"We are now able to constrain that with a good degree of certainty and then we employ that to really make far more accurate predictions,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, and an author on the report. \n\"So, that way, we know that net zero will really deliver.\"\nAnother big surprise in the report is the role of methane, another warming gas. \nAccording to the IPCC, around 0.3C of the 1.1C that the world has already warmed by comes from methane.\nTackling those emissions, from the oil and gas industry, agriculture and rice cultivation, could be a big win in the short-term.\n\"The report quashes any remaining debate about the urgent need to slash methane pollution, especially from sectors such as oil and gas, where the available reductions are fastest and cheapest,\" said Fred Krupp, from the US Environmental Defense Fund.\n\"When it comes to our overheating planet, every fraction of a degree matters - and there is no faster, more achievable way to slow the rate of warming than by cutting human-caused methane emissions.\" \nThe timing of this report, coming just a couple of months before the critical COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, means that it will likely be the bedrock of the negotiations. The IPCC has some form here: their previous assessment in 2013 and 2014 paved the way for the Paris climate agreement. \nThis new study is far stronger, clearer and more confident about what will happen if politicians don't act. \nIf they don't act quickly enough and COP26 ends in an unsatisfactory fudge, then the courts might become more involved. \nIn recent years, in Ireland and the Netherlands, environmental campaigners have successfully gone to court to force governments and companies to act on the science of climate change. \n\"We're not going to let this report be shelved by further inaction. Instead, we'll be taking it with us to the courts,\" said Kaisa Kosonen, senior political adviser at Greenpeace Nordic.\n\"By strengthening the scientific evidence between human emissions and extreme weather, the IPCC has provided new, powerful means for everyone everywhere to hold the fossil fuel industry and governments directly responsible for the climate emergency. \n\"One only needs to look at the recent court victory secured by NGOs against Shell to realise how powerful IPCC science can be.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "Scientists are testing an artificial-intelligence system thought to be capable of diagnosing dementia after a single brain scan. \nIt may also be able to predict whether the condition will remain stable for many years, slowly deteriorate or need immediate treatment.\nCurrently, it can take several scans and tests to diagnose dementia.\nThe researchers involved say earlier diagnoses with their system could greatly improve patient outcomes.\n\"If we intervene early, the treatments can kick in early and slow down the progression of the disease and at the same time avoid more damage,\" Prof Zoe Kourtzi, of Cambridge University and a fellow of national centre for AI and data science The Alan Turing Institute, said.\n\"And it's likely that symptoms occur much later in life or may never occur.\"\nProf Kourtzi's system compares brain scans of those worried they might have dementia with those of thousands of dementia patients and their relevant medical records.\nThe algorithm can identify patterns in the scans even expert neurologists cannot see and match them to patient outcomes in its database.\nIn pre-clinical tests, it has been able to diagnose dementia, years before symptoms develop, even when there is no obvious signs of damage on the brain scan.\nThe trial, at Addenbrooke's Hospital and other memory clinics around the country, will test whether it works in a clinical setting, alongside conventional ways of diagnosing dementia. \nIn the first year, about 500 patients are expected to participate.\nTheir results will go to their doctors, who can, if necessary, advise on the course of treatment.\nConsultant neurologist Dr Tim Rittman, who is leading the study, with neuroscientists at Cambridge University, called the artificial-intelligence system a \"fantastic development\".\n\"These set of diseases are really devastating for people,\" he said.\n\"So when I am delivering this information to a patient, anything I can do to be more confident about the diagnosis, to give them more information about the likely progression of the disease to help them plan their lives is a great thing to be able to do.\"\nAmong the first to participate in the trial, Denis Clark, 75, retired from his job as an executive for a meat company five years ago.\nLast year, his wife, Penelope, noticed he was sometimes struggling with his memory. \nAnd they are now concerned he is developing dementia.\nDenis tries to describe his symptoms but Penelope interjects to say he finds it hard to explain what is happening.\nThe couple are worried about having to sell their home to fund Denis's care. \nSo Penelope is relieved they should not have to wait long for a diagnosis and an indication of how any dementia is likely to progress. \n\"We could then plan financially,\" she said. \n\"We would know whether as a couple we could have a few holidays before things get so bad that I can't take Denis on holiday.\"\nAnother of Dr Rittman's patients, Mark Thompson, 57, who began having memory lapses 10 months ago, before the trial of the artificial-intelligence system began, said it would have made a big difference to him had it been available.\n\"I had test after test after test and at least four scans before I was diagnosed,\" he said.\n\"The medical team was marvellous and did everything they could to get to the bottom of what was wrong with me. \n\"But the uncertainty was causing me more... mental problems than any caused by the condition. \n\"Was it a tumour? Would they need to operate? It caused me so much stress not knowing what was wrong with me.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter."

      "text": "More than half of A-level entries in Northern Ireland have been awarded top A* and A grades.\nAbout 25,000 pupils received their A-level and AS-level results this morning.\nAlmost 51% of A-level entries were awarded A* or A grades, a record and a rise from about 45% in 2020.\nSome students also received their BTec results on Tuesday - for many, that has become a path into university.\nAs formal exams were cancelled for a second year due to the coronavirus pandemic, schools calculated the grades to be awarded to pupils.\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen praised young people's \"incredible resilience\", acknowledging the exceptional circumstances they had faced over the past year.\n\"Our young people have demonstrated a determination not to let this pandemic put their lives on hold,\" she said.\n\"They have been awarded qualifications which reflect their hard work and will enable them to move forward confidently with their future plans.\"\nThe vast majority of AS and A-level entries in Northern Ireland are made through the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) exams board.\nHowever, some pupils take some A-levels through English exam boards.\nThere had previously been a significant rise in the proportion of A-level entries to CCEA awarded top grades in 2020.\nIn 2020, after the change in how results were awarded, 14.5% of A-level entries through CCEA achieved the top A* grade compared with 8.9% in 2019.\nAccording to CCEA, that has risen to 15.8% of entries in 2021.\nAlmost 45% of A-level entries to CCEA in 2020 were awarded A* or A grades compared with 32.2% in 2019.\nThat has risen to 50.8% in 2021.\nAcross Northern Ireland, England and Wales as a whole almost 45% of A-levels entries received A* or A grades.\nPupils in Scotland take Highers and they also received results this morning and some students in Northern Ireland also receive their BTEC results.\nAlana Cahoon from Portadown, County Armagh, said she was \"so relieved and extremely grateful\" after receiving three Bs at A-level.\nThe 18-year-old, who is a member of youth-led charity Pure Mental NI, said it was important that fellow students remembered to take care of their mental health on results day.\n\"It's important not to compare yourself to other people, don't compare yourself to what you see on your Facebook feed and Instagram feeds, Ms Cahoon said. \n\"It's ok if you didn't get what you wanted, everyone has their own path.\"\nProf Paul Seawright, deputy vice-chancellor of Ulster University, told BBC News NI: \"We have over 5,000 places available across four campuses... more than we've ever had.\n\"If you meet the conditions of your offer the university is obliged to take you and we'll be delighted to welcome you.\"\nProfessor David Jones, pro-vice chancellor for education and students at Queens University Belfast, said: \"What we really want is to make sure that we can get as many people in as wish to come.\"\nHe said there were opportunities not only at Northern Ireland's universities but also by entering the further education sector and moving to university through that route.\nFurther education colleges in Northern Ireland estimate that at least 60% of those receiving BTecs go on to further study at college or university.\nBrian Doran, principal of Southern Regional College, said: \"Whatever happens with offers today, it is really important that students understand the many options they have to continue to further study, particularly with the amount of higher education routes available to them at the six further education colleges, through foundation degrees, Higher National Diplomas and Higher Level Apprenticeships.\n\"This year, colleges and universities are working closely together to make sure students are signposted towards these alternative routes.\"\nEllen Fearon, the president of the National Union of Students and Union of Students in Ireland (NUS-USI), said everyone receiving results should feel proud of themselves.\nShe said the government and the education sector had to make sure the necessary places were made available at universities and colleges to accommodate new students.\n\"Students have done their part and it's now on the sector to do theirs,\" she said.\nLimavady High School principal Darren Mornin said every pupils should be congratulated after what had been an incredibly difficult 18 months.\n\"There has obviously been that disruption to face-to-face teaching so they most definitely will have been worried,\" he said.\n\"The results that they are getting today - especially from a Limavady High School point of view - have all been fantastic and I am just so proud of them all.\"\nMeanwhile, at AS-level in Northern Ireland, almost three-quarters of entries (73.9%) received the top A or B grades.\nHowever, those AS results will not count towards a pupil's A-level grade in 2022.\nEvidence for samples of results calculated by schools has been checked by exam boards, including CCEA in Northern Ireland.\nA pupil can appeal their result if they are unhappy with it, with some appeals classed as \"priority\" if a pupil's place on a higher education course depends on a change to their results.\nPupils can appeal if they think an \"unreasonable academic judgement\" was made by their school but CCEA will only change a grade if they decide it does not match the evidence provided by the school.\nThe rise in results will inevitably spark a debate about grade inflation compared to years when pupils sit exams at the end of their course.\nBut the head of England's exam regulator Ofqual has said that grades are a fair reflection of the efforts pupils have made.\nSimon Lebus said teacher assessments give a \"much more accurate reflection\" of what students can achieve.\nPupils awaiting GCSE results will receive them on Thursday.\nCCEA will operate a results helpline from Tuesday until Friday 20 August on 028 9026 1220.\nFormal GCSE, AS and A-level exams are expected to take place again in the 2021-2022 school year."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has said he does not regret his move to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, as Taliban militants continue to make rapid advances.\nMr Biden urged Afghanistan's leaders to unite and \"fight for their nation\".\nA US-led military campaign began in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks on American soil - but now most of the foreign troops have pulled out.\nThe Taliban group has now seized nine of the country's 34 provincial capitals, and are threatening more.\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Biden said the US was keeping the commitments it had made to Afghanistan, such as providing close air support, paying military salaries and supplying Afghan forces with food and equipment.\nBut he said: \"They've got to fight for themselves.\"\nThe Washington Post cited unnamed officials as saying the capital Kabul could fall to the Taliban within 90 days, based on US military assessments. \nMore than 1,000 civilians have been killed amid fierce fighting between the Taliban and government forces in the past month, according to the UN. Its children's agency Unicef warned this week that atrocities being committed against children were growing \"higher by the day\".\nIn their latest major advances, Taliban militants seized three more provincial capitals in 24 hours - Faizabad, Farah and Pul-e-Khumri.\nOfficials said that on Tuesday the insurgents had raised their flag in the main square and on the governor's office in Pul-e-Khumri, the capital of Baghlan province, which is located about 200km (125 miles) from Kabul. \nA local journalist and provincial council member told the BBC that the western city of Farah had fallen.\nAnd on Wednesday, the Taliban claimed to have taken Faizabad in the north-west of the country.\nOther gains by the militant group this week include the key northern city of Kunduz. It is considered a gateway to mineral-rich provinces and is in a strategically important location close to the border with Tajikistan, which is used for the smuggling of opium and heroin. \nHeavy fighting is continuing in other parts of the country, and US and Afghan planes have been carrying out airstrikes.\nOn Wednesday Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani flew to Mazar-i-Sharif in an apparent drive to rally the defenders in the key northern city which is now threatened by the militants.\nThousands of people have been fleeing their homes in recent days.\n\"We saw bodies lying near the prison... there were dogs next to them,\" one woman who left Kunduz as the Taliban took control told AFP news agency.\nResidents still in the city said shops had begun to reopen as Taliban militants focused their attention on government forces who had retreated to the airport.\n\"People are opening their shops and businesses, but you can still see fear in their eyes,\" one said.\nThe Taliban have rejected international calls for a ceasefire. \nUK Chief of the Defence Staff Gen Sir Nick Carter told the BBC that if the Afghan state fractured, the \"ideal conditions\" could emerge for international terrorism and violent extremism."

      "tags": "Companies,Travel,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "One of the bigger providers of Covid PCR test kits has responded after images of overflowing drop boxes were shared online.\nThe firm, Randox, said it was increasing the number of drop boxes and the frequency of box collections.\nThe move comes after people posted pictures of returned test kits piled high on top of drop boxes in Sutton and Hampstead over the weekend.\nOne MP said the \"pointless\" tests were \"becoming a bad joke\".\nAt least one PCR test is required for all arrivals from international destinations within two days of landing in the UK. \nThose returning from green listed countries, or who are fully vaccinated and returning from amber list countries, are required to take only one.\nHowever, those not fully vaccinated from amber list destinations must take at least two tests, one on day two and one on day eight. \nOne of those affected, Gavin Marshall, said he had to drop off a test kit on behalf of his daughter, who had completed a PCR test two days after returning from a holiday in Portugal.\nDespite the fact that the box was full, he said: \"I had no choice but to leave the sample at that site, because there wasn't enough time to get to another drop box before collection deadline.\" \nMr Marshall called it a \"Covid travel rip-off\".  \nRory Boland, Which? Travel Editor, said he had seen problems with several testing firms and an increase in every type of complaint. Complaints included tests not arriving on time, people being unable to book tests and misleading prices. \n\"It's particularly frustrating as Which? raised this with government a few months ago,\" he added.\n\"The system isn't set up for large numbers of people travelling and now many people are travelling the system is not working properly. The government might now say it is looking into the prices of tests, but it's very late in the day and these problems were foreseeable.\"\nLabour MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted in reaction to the photos: \"These pointless rip-off day two PCR tests for people returning from amber and green list countries, most of which have a fraction of our Covid-19 rates, are becoming a bad joke.\"\nA government spokesperson said health secretary Sajid Javid had asked the competition watchdog to investigate excessive pricing and said it was working with testing providers to reduce costs.\nNancy Diaz was due to fly to Barcelona on 21 July. When her test arrived, she registered it and delivered it to a Randox Health drop box in Edinburgh, two days before her flight.\nHowever, Ms Diaz said she only received confirmation that her test had arrived at the company's laboratory the following evening, meaning she knew her results were not going to come through in time for her flight.\nDue to the delay, Ms Diaz rebooked her flight for 24 hours later, however, when she received her negative test result at 13:26 BST on 21 July, the day she had originally planned to fly on, she was required to do another test at Edinburgh Airport as her original test results were now outside of the 72-hour window.\n\"I was given no refund, as they (Randox) claim the 24 hours promise is from when the test arrives at their lab, which can be whenever, apparently,\" said Ms Diaz. \n\"The fact that the test can take more than 24 hours to arrive to their lab was not mentioned.\"\nLizzy Merrall ordered tests for her parents and for herself on 19 July, ahead of a family holiday to Spain on 27 July. \nHer parents' tests arrived, but her pre-departure test she needed to take with her on holiday to do before flying back to the UK did not.\n\"I contacted Randox on the 26 July asking where my tests were,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I asked them if they could at least offer me a refund for one of the tests but they never replied to me and I had to pay \u00a380 for a last minute test.\"\nMs Merrrall said her test pack only arrived once she was already on holiday in Spain.\nRandox has not responded to requests for comment in relation to Ms Diaz's and Ms Merrall's experiences.\nA spokesperson for the Northern Ireland-based company said it was \"constantly expanding and improving its Covid-19 testing capacity and associated logistics network, which is already the largest in the United Kingdom, to meet the rapidly growing demand resulting from the loosening of travel restrictions\". \n\"Randox continues to increase the number of drop boxes across the United Kingdom, which already totals over 200, and is increasing the frequency of box collections which are already occurring multiple times per day,\" they added.\n\"Randox is providing premium testing services in dynamic and rapidly changing circumstances and is committed to continuously improving its logistics network, to ensure that international travellers receive their results in time.  All of the sample kits pictured will be processed.\"\nPCR tests are more expensive than lateral flow tests and have been criticised by some in the travel industry for pricing many potential travellers out. \nThe government has previously defended their use, saying they are useful as they can be sequenced to check for variants of concern, unlike lateral flow tests. \nBut some have criticised the government, saying they are not sequencing enough tests. \nLast week, Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chair of the Transport select committee, said they should be dropped. \n\"PCR tests can be two to three times the cost of lateral flow testing. It's pricing out holidays for those that don't have the means to pay for those tests,\" he said.\n\"I wouldn't mind if the tests were going to be used for sequencing, so we can find all variants of concern, but if only 5% of PCR tests are being sequenced, then surely it's a complete waste of money.\"\nThe Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) has highlighted that as the vast majority of travellers into the UK do not test positive, their tests are not sent for sequencing. \nOf those sent for sequencing, a minority contain insufficient virus, but more than 95% of viable green and amber tests are sequenced, it said.\nA DHSC spokesperson said: \"All positive tests for arrivals from red list countries are sequenced and there is a legal requirement for private testing providers to sequence positive PCR tests for amber or green country travellers.\n\"We are already a world leader in genomics, with over 600,000 positive Covid-19 samples having been sequenced during this pandemic.\""

      "text": "TV presenter Storm Huntley has urged cyclists to wear helmets after she was knocked down by a car on Monday.\nThe co-host of Channel 5's Jeremy Vine show tweeted an image of her damaged helmet saying she was thankful it wasn't her skull that was cracked.\nHuntley was hit by a car that crossed her path to make a left turn while she was cycling home from work in London.\n\"I am standing here today thanking my lucky stars that I decided to put my helmet on,\" she said.\nSpeaking on Tuesday morning's episode of Jeremy Vine, Huntley said: \"I am knocked off my bike and I bang my head so hard on the pavement that I crack my helmet.  \n\"If I wasn't wearing that, that crack wouldn't be on my helmet, it would be on my skull, so I would not be here this morning.\"\nShe added: \"The driver was shaken, there was no aggression, there was nobody being competitive on the road, it was an accident.\n\"Accidents happen, please put your helmets on, and even if you think you're a good driver, double check.\"\nHuntley said her partner had got rid of her bike after the incident, telling her: \"No more cycling for you.\"\n\"If the shoe was on the other foot and he was cycling and he had an accident the way I've had and came back with a bike in a state, and a helmet, I would not want him back on that bike,\" she said\nVine, a keen cyclist himself, called the motorist \"a shocking driver\", adding: \"He shouldn't be on the road.\"\nBut he said he would \"absolutely\" still encourage people to cycle after Huntley's accident, saying: \"If you don't cycle, you end up a couch potato.\"\nVine has been vocal over the years about the potential perils of riding a bike on the road, especially in London.\nEarlier this year, he had a narrow escape when a bus swerved past him on Oxford Street, which he captured on camera. \nHe later posted it online, saying, \"This morning's bus driver is probably the most dangerous I have ever encountered. Is this one for TFL? [Transport For London]?\nLast year, he also posted footage of a couple of near misses which happened within moments of each other while he was riding home. In 2019, he was hit by a car but escaped unhurt.\nAnd in 2017, a driver filmed screaming obscenities at him in a road rage incident as he cycled through London was jailed for threatening behaviour.\nVine said accidents such as Huntley's make cyclists behave the way they do, adding: \"When people say all cyclists are so arrogant and so angry, that's why, because they have got battlefield vision.\"\nA Transport for London report published last autumn showed 125 people were killed and 3,780 people were seriously injured on London's roads in 2019.\nCycling deaths dropped to five people, a 70% decline from the 2005-09 baseline of 17. But cyclist casualties rose by 36% from the long-term average for 2005-09 to 4,634 from 3,410.\nHuntley concluded: \"I love cycling it's great to be out in the fresh air, you're not polluting anything, you're not getting involved in the congestion of all the cars.\n\"I loved cycling home but I don't want to have that battlefield mentality, it puts me off doing it. Nobody wants to be that angry all of that time and that worried all of the time.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Everyone will be hoping for an altogether more low-key results day in Wales on Tuesday. \nLast year the uproar around downgraded A-level marks led to a dramatic U-turn by ministers. \nThis summer there is no algorithm to \"standardise\" teacher grades and, crucially, the vast majority of Welsh pupils already know their results ahead of the official release.\nSo how is A-level results day in Wales going to be different in 2021?\nFor a start, it is earlier than usual. \nUsually, A-level and GCSE results days are on subsequent Thursdays in the second half of August. However they have been brought forward to ensure enough time to process any appeals. \nIn Wales, schools and colleges shared provisional results with pupils in June and they could then appeal. \nOn results day, some schools are simply confirming grades via email or post, while others, such as Olchfa Comprehensive in Swansea, are inviting pupils to celebrate their results becoming official.\nThe school's deputy head teacher Matt Salmon said it was a \"rite of passage\", even if pupils know what is inside the envelope.\n\"Whether there'll be the same level of excitement and celebration or, conversely, disappointment in some cases remains to be seen\", he said.\nBut while surprises are unlikely, it remains a significant day for those hoping to go to university with places only confirmed after the official release of results. \nAnd if you didn't quite get the grades you need, it's only now you find out whether there's any wriggle room or other options through clearing.\nShenona Mitra, 18, from Bangor hopes to study medicine in London and said having provisional results earlier gave students a sense of security. \n\"It took a little of the stress away from teachers and students because of how unpredictable things have been,\" she said.\n\"We needed that time to make sure things were ok and we could still go to university. If things needed to be changed, they could be within time.\"\nSchools and colleges set them - or to use the official term, they are Centre Determined Grades (CDGs). \nThe decision to cancel exams was made last November, but the system that replaced it had to be ditched too when schools remained closed after Christmas.\nAt that stage it was decided that teachers would decide students' end-of-year grades based on evidence of attainment. \nIn practice that meant pupils sat a series of classroom assessments when they were back in school after Easter, though some claimed they were exams in all but name.\nGareth Evans, executive director of education at the University of Wales Trinity St David, said some pupils ended up sitting 30 or 40 tests. \n\"That is not ideal after three or four months out of face-to-face teaching due to a pandemic,\" he said.\n\"Perhaps we could have considered a little better the well-being and learning loss of those pupils rather than the race to examine them for their GCSE and A-level outcomes.\"\nCardiff A-level pupil Cai Parry, 18, was part of a campaign last year calling for grades determined by teachers, rather than exams. He thinks there should be long-term changes to assessment, with more emphasis on coursework. \n\"That's a fairer reflection of how students are coping throughout the year, whereas if we pile everything on to just exams at the end\u2026 that has been a lot more stressful,\" he said.\nNo. Last year an algorithm to standardise results was blamed for lowering tens of thousands of the grades that had been assessed by teachers, and for the uproar that ensued. \nA U-turn before GCSE results day meant pupils were eventually awarded the teacher grades and similar decisions were made elsewhere in the UK too. \nTrying to avoid a repeat of last year's chaos has been a top priority. This year, the exam board WJEC has had no power to change grades, though schools and colleges have been asked to explain results that are significantly out of line with previous years. \nSomething similar but with some key differences. Pupils in England weren't given provisional grades. That means those who've been studying over the border, or who have taken qualifications in Wales under English exam boards, will be feeling the nerves more than most Welsh pupils. \nIt's the first time results day is happening at the same time across the UK, as they're usually earlier in Scotland.  \nResults for BTEC and other vocational qualifications will also be released. As they are regulated at a UK-wide level, BTEC students will not have had prior sight of their final grades. \nThere were 36,140 A-level entries for summer 2021, a rise of 16% compared with 2020. \nThis could partly be due to a bigger teenage population, while a rise in top grades at AS-level last summer might have encouraged more students to continue to A-level.\nMr Evans said there were too many variables to compare results. \n\"We're going to have to live with the fact that we can't compare year-on-year and this year's cohort of A-level and GCSE graduates have been through something nobody else has been through and, therefore, the results are not comparable,\" he said.\nThat said, nearly half of this year's A-level grades were top A* and A grades in Wales, the official results showed on Tuesday.\nA total of 48.3% of grades were A* and A after what exam awarders called \"challenging circumstances\" due to Covid-19.\nThere was an increase at A* with 21.3% of candidates getting this grade, compared with 16.3% in 2020.\nAltogether, 99.1% achieved A* to E passes."

      "text": "AMC, the US cinema chain that owns Odeon, says it will allow customers to pay for movie tickets and concessions in Bitcoin by the end of the year.\nBoss Adam Aron said it has been exploring the technology and \"how else AMC can participate in this new burgeoning cryptocurrency universe\".\nThe firm, which is the largest US cinema chain, has not said whether it will apply to its cinemas in Europe.\nBitcoin has seen wild price swings in recent weeks. \nThe highly-speculative cryptocurrency was trading at about $45,000 (\u00a332,500) on Tuesday, after falling below $30,000 last month.\nHowever, an increasing number of businesses have begun to accept it as payment as it goes mainstream, including US mobile operator AT&T, Microsoft and Wikipedia. \n\"I've had to learn more in the past six months about blockchain and cryptocurrency than I learned about it in the entire decade before that,\" Mr Aron, 66, told journalists on a conference call.\n\"This increased knowledge has given me the confidence to tell you all today that AMC is hereby formally announcing... that by year's end we will have the information technology systems in place to accept Bitcoin.\" \nCommentators suggest AMC is trying to appeal to young amateur traders that have piled into its own shares over the last six months, turning it into a so-called \"meme stock\".\nBanding together on the social media site Reddit, these investors have driven up the price of AMC stock by some 1,500% this year - although it has little bearing on the struggling chain's actual financial performance. \nFollowing the Bitcoin announcement AMC shares jumped almost 6% on Tuesday before falling back. \nAMC was also the top trending stock on social media site Stocktwits, according to Reuters.\nHowever the firm's results for the six months to 30 June, released on Monday, told a different story. \nRevenue dived almost 40% to \u00a3593m, as cinemas in many places remained shut due to the pandemic, or customers stayed away due to Covid. Demand is also yet to recover despite restrictions having eased in the US and elsewhere. \nThe firm said its ticket revenue in the third quarter was only on track to reach 45% of 2019 levels.\nHowever, AMC has struck a deal with movie studio Warner Bros to allow a 45-day theatrical window for movies before their streaming release from 2022.\nIt hopes this will drive up ticket sales - which had been falling before the pandemic - for scheduled releases including \"The Batman\" and \"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\". \nA number of Hollywood studios opted to bypass cinemas during the pandemic and release their films online instead. Now most cinemas have reopened, giants like Disney and Warner Bros have chosen to maintain a dual release strategy for their major films, angering actors and cinema chains alike. "

      "text": "The campaign to free Princess Latifa, the daughter of the ruler of Dubai, has been disbanded after she was pictured in Iceland.\nThe image was posted on Instagram on Monday by a British woman who has previously appeared in photos with her.\nBut it is unclear to what extent Latifa, who has not spoken publicly, is operating under her own free will.\nThe BBC broadcast footage earlier this year in which the princess said she was being held captive by her father.\nIt prompted an international outcry, with the UN calling for proof that the 35-year-old was still alive.\nSeveral images of Latifa have since emerged. They were posted by Sioned Taylor, who was also in one such image in June that appeared to show the pair together at Madrid airport.\nOthers showed Latifa at a shopping mall and a restaurant in Dubai.\nThe Free Latifa campaign issued a statement on Monday confirming that the princess had met her cousin, Marcus Essabri - the third person in the photo - in Iceland.\n\"Following the meeting... it has been decided that the most appropriate step at this time is to close the Free Latifa campaign,\" it said. \n\"The primary purpose of [the] campaign was to see Latifa free leading the life she chooses for herself,\" the statement added. \"We have clearly gone a long way towards achieving that goal.\"\nMr Essabri, whose aunt is Latifa's mother, said: \"[We] had an emotional reunion... It was reassuring to see her so happy, well and focused on her plans.\"\nDavid Haigh, co-founder of the Free Latifa campaign, told the BBC that the princess's current situation was \"the best position she has been in in terms of freedom [...] for two decades\".\nBut he added: \"It's quite right and understandable that everyone needs to look at everything that's happening now with extreme caution and monitor the situation closely.\"\nDubai's royal family has not commented on the latest photograph. \nLatifa, one of the 25 children of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, attempted to escape from Dubai in February 2018.\nIn a video recorded shortly before she left, she said her life was heavily constricted. \"I haven't left the country since 2000. I've been asking a lot to just go travelling, to study, to do anything normal. They don't let me,\" she said.\nBut the escape went wrong: eight days into a journey across the Indian Ocean, the boat was caught by commandos who forcibly removed Latifa and returned her to Dubai.\nHer father later said he considered this a \"rescue mission\".\nIn February, BBC Panorama broadcast videos secretly recorded by Princess Latifa and passed to friends abroad, in which she describes her capture and imprisonment after her return to Dubai.\nShe said she was being held alone without access to medical or legal help in a villa with windows and doors barred shut, and guarded by police."

      "tags": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,COP26,UK climate change protests,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways, a major UN scientific report has said.\nThe landmark study warns of increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts and flooding, and a key temperature limit being broken in just over a decade. \nThe report \"is a code red for humanity\", says the UN chief.\nBut scientists say a catastrophe can be avoided if the world acts fast.\nThere is hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures. \nEchoing the scientists' findings, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said: \"If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe. But, as today's report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success.\" \nThe sober assessment of our planet's future has been delivered by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of scientists whose findings are endorsed by the world's governments.\nTheir report is the first major review of the science of climate change since 2013. Its release comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26.\nIn strong, confident tones, the IPCC's document says \"it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land\".\nAccording to Prof Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, UK, and one of the report's authors, the scientists cannot be any clearer on this point.\n\"It is a statement of fact, we cannot be any more certain; it is unequivocal and indisputable that humans are warming the planet.\"\nPetteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, said: \"By using sports terms, one could say the atmosphere has been exposed to doping, which means we have begun observing extremes more often than before.\"\nThe authors say that since 1970, global surface temperatures have risen faster than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years.\nThis warming is \"already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe\". \nWhether it's heatwaves like the ones recently experienced in Greece and western North America, or floods like those in Germany and China, \"their attribution to human influence has strengthened\" over the past decade.\nThe new report also makes clear that the warming we've experienced to date has made changes to many of our planetary support systems that are irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia. \nThe oceans will continue to warm and become more acidic. Mountain and polar glaciers will continue melting for decades or centuries.\n\"The consequences will continue to get worse for every bit of warming,\" said Prof Hawkins.  \n\"And for many of these consequences, there's no going back.\"\nWhen it comes to sea level rise, the scientists have modelled a likely range for different levels of emissions.\nHowever, a rise of around 2m by the end of this century cannot be ruled out - and neither can a 5m rise by 2150.\nSuch outcomes, while unlikely, would threaten many millions more people in coastal areas with flooding by 2100. \nOne key aspect of the report is the expected rate of temperature rise and what it means for the safety of humanity.\nAlmost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015.\nThis pact aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C.\nThis new report says that under all the emissions scenarios considered by the scientists, both targets will be broken this century unless huge cuts in carbon take place. \nThe authors believe that 1.5C will be reached by 2040 in all scenarios. If emissions aren't slashed in the next few years, this will happen even earlier.\nThis was predicted in the IPCC's special report on 1.5C in 2018 and this new study now confirms it.\n\"We will hit one-and-a-half degrees in individual years much earlier. We already hit it in two months during the El Ni\u00f1o in 2016,\" said Prof Malte Meinshausen, an IPCC author from the University of Melbourne in Australia. \n\"The new report's best estimate is the middle of 2034, but the uncertainty is huge and ranges between now and never.\"\nThe consequences of going past 1.5C over a period of years would be unwelcome in a world that has already experienced a rapid uptick in extreme events with a temperature rise since pre-industrial times of 1.1C.\n\"We will see even more intense and more frequent heatwaves,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the IPCC report's authors.\n\"And we will also see an increase in heavy rainfall events on a global scale, and also increases in some types of droughts in some regions of the world.\"\nProf Carolina Vera, vice-chair of the working group that produced the document, said: \"The report clearly shows that we are already living the consequences of climate change everywhere. But we will experience further and concurrent changes that increase with every additional beat of warming.\"\nSo what can be done?\nWhile this report is more clear and confident about the downsides to warming, the scientists are more hopeful that if we can cut global emissions in half by 2030 and reach net zero by the middle of this century, we can halt and possibly reverse the rise in temperatures. \nReaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible using clean technology, then burying any remaining releases using carbon capture and storage, or absorbing them by planting trees.\n\"The thought before was that we could get increasing temperatures even after net zero,\" said another co-author, Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, UK.\n\"But we now expect nature to be kind to us and if we are able to achieve net zero, we hopefully won't get any further temperature increase; and if we are able to achieve net zero greenhouse gases, we should eventually be able to reverse some of that temperature increase and get some cooling.\"\nWhile the future projections of warming are clearer than ever in this report, and many impacts simply cannot be avoided, the authors caution against fatalism.\n\"Lowering global warming really minimises the likelihood of hitting these tipping points,\" said Dr Otto. \"We are not doomed.\"\nA tipping point refers to when part of the Earth's climate system undergoes an abrupt change in response to continued warming.\nFor political leaders, the report is another in a long line of wake-up calls, but since it comes so close to November's COP26 global climate summit, it carries extra weight.\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "JetBlue has said the Covid pandemic will not stop the airline from launching its long-awaited New York to London service on Wednesday.\nChief executive Robin Hayes told the BBC there was \"strong demand\" for the route in the US where, he said, JetBlue had returned to 2019 levels.\nThe move comes as the global travel industry continues to recover.\nHoliday Inn-owner Intercontinental Hotels said holiday demand was \"returning strongly\".\nIn its latest results statement, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), whose other brands include the Crowne Plaza chain, said it had opened 132 hotels during the January-to-June period and acquired another 203, both sizeable increases on last year.\n\"Trading improved significantly during the first half of 2021, with travel demand returning strongly as vaccines roll out, restrictions ease and economic activity rebuilds,\" said IHG chief executive Keith Barr.\n\"It has been great to see our teams welcome more and more guests back into our hotels, with domestic leisure bookings leading the way, particularly in the US and China.\"\nMeasured on revenue per available room, nearly half of the group's hotels worldwide were above 2019 levels in July, it said.\nJetBlue's first transatlantic flight will leave New York's JFK airport on Wednesday evening and will land at London's Heathrow. Flights to London Gatwick will begin on 29 September.\nHowever, travelling on the route does not come cheap, at least to start with. JetBlue's website no longer has seats available for that inaugural flight, but prices for the next few days start at $941 (\u00a3679) one-way.\nThat is still slightly cheaper than British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which are both quoting a price of $980 for the same time period.\nThanks to the likes of those established competitors, there are already as many as 28 flights a day available between London and New York.\nAnd other carriers have come a cropper on the same route, including Norwegian Air, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2020 after failing to make its low-cost strategy pay.\nHowever, JetBlue will be cutting costs by using smaller aircraft, relying on the single-aisle Airbus A321LR, rather than the Boeing 787 Dreamliners that were favoured by Norwegian.\nAnd for those who can book further in advance, it is pledging to offer return fares of less than $600.\nThe airline's Mr Hayes said it had wanted to offer a New York-to-London service for a long time and flights were now \"ready to go\".\nHe said JetBlue wanted to have \"a disruptive and permanent effect\" on the market.\nUS-based travellers are now welcome to fly to the UK without having to quarantine on arrival if they have been fully vaccinated, but there is still a travel ban on people from the UK flying to the US. \nThe White House said at the end of last month that it did not intend to lift Covid-19 travel restrictions for non-Americans.\nAsked about this, Mr Hayes said JetBlue had made its views clear about the restrictions and that the current approach was \"not risk-based\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "text": "Two people have been taken to hospital after an open-top bus crashed into a tree in Mumbles, Swansea.\nThe crash happened at Mumbles Road, near Knab Rock, at about 14:30 BST on Tuesday and the road was shut, with people advised to avoid the area.\nOne person was taken by air to University Hospital Wales, Cardiff, and the other by road to Morriston Hospital in Swansea. \nSeveral other passengers were assessed and discharged at the scene.\nNone are life-threatening or life-changing, South Wales Police said.\nEyewitness Shanai Neale said: \"I was just coming down Mumbles Road going down the beach and everyone just slammed [their brakes] on.\n\"I was about three cars behind and I just saw the bus had gone into the tree.\n\"There were a few people on the top deck. The police told us to turn around then so we had to turn around.  \n\"Everyone was panicking. I think there were kids on the top deck and obviously parents, so they were all shaken up. I would be too, to be honest.\"\nBob Morgan from West Cross, Swansea, was visiting Mumbles with his granddaughter when the crash happened, and said the injuries appeared minor.\n\"There were around 20 people on the bus,\" he said.\n\"They seemed to be walking wounded. I saw some young lads being treated for chest injuries and minor head injuries. Others were in shock.\n\"I saw an elderly lady who was sat down in shock.\"\nThe bus involved is one of First Cymru's \"Cymru Coasters\", operating between Swansea Bus Station and Bracelet Bay, near Mumbles Pier.\nA First Cymru spokesman said: \"We can confirm one of our vehicles operating the Swansea to Mumbles service was involved in a collision earlier this afternoon.\n\"Following the incident the operator immediately implemented its emergency procedures and sent representatives to the scene to provide support to those involved and the emergency services.\n\"We will work closely with the emergency services as part of our investigation.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThe nervous wait is finally over for hundreds and thousands of students across the country waiting to find out what grades they've achieved in their A-levels, Vocational BTecs and Higher and Nationals, for young people studying in Scotland. It's already been suggested results for A-levels, which are studied in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, will be as high again, or even higher than in 2020. Last summer 38.6% achieved an A* or A grade. This year, like the last, results are based on teacher assessment due to the pandemic.\nSince coronavirus restrictions eased and amid a shortage of new models, second-hand car sales have soared. Year on year, the market grew 108.6% in the second quarter, with more than 2.2 million vehicles changing hands, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. What's been popular? Ford Fiestas and Focuses, Vauxhall Corsas and Volkswagen Golfs - with black, silver, blue and grey being the sought-after colours.\nA popular Malaysian singer who had Covid-19 died without ever holding the baby she'd given birth to just days before. Siti Sarah Raisuddin was eight months pregnant and suffering from low oxygen levels when she was put into an induced coma so her son could be delivered via surgery. Read more here.\n\"They hadn't taken up the opportunity to get vaccinated because they were afraid,\" says Francis Goncalves. His brother, father and mother died within a week in Portugal after they contracted coronavirus at a family meal. Mr Goncalves, from Cardiff, says misinformation is behind why they refused to get jabbed and he is now urging people to get vaccinated.\nThe pandemic, and especially lockdown, made Adam Ellison want to help other people. \"I've become more conscious of everybody else,\" he says. \"Some people have had it worse.\" He's one of the many people behind a surge in activity - sparked by the pandemic - for sharing apps like Olio, which allows people to share edible food waste with others.

      "tags": "Scottish exam results,A-levels,Young people,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have received their A-level results, and final Scottish Highers results have also been released.\nBecause of the pandemic, grades have been determined by teachers' estimates, rather than exams.\nTop A-level grades have reached a record high - with 44.8% getting A* or A grades. \nThe percentage of pupils achieving A to C grades in their Highers was 87.3% - down slightly on 2020.\nA combination of coursework, mock exams and essays have been used by teachers to decide grades.\nThe head teacher of each school had to sign off the results and say there was evidence to back them up.\nThe freedom given to schools meant students have had very different experiences this year - with some doing more tests than others. \nTo ensure consistent judgements were made, some measures were put in place by exam boards - such as requiring a sample of student work to be submitted.\nLast year, when exams were also cancelled, results were initially calculated based on an algorithm, before a U-turn meant teachers estimates were used in most cases.\nIf students think a grade is wrong, they can first ask their school or college to check whether it has made a mistake.\nIf that's the case, a new grade can be sent to the exam board, which will decide what to do.\nIf the school confirms the grade but the student still believes it is incorrect, then they can ask for an appeal, which their school or college is expected to submit on their behalf.\nThe exam board may correct it, although any new grade could be higher or lower than the one given on results day.\nIn England, the deadline to send an appeal to the exam board is 17 September. \nThere is an earlier deadline of 23 August for priority appeals - for example, if a student has not got their first choice of university place confirmed. \nIn Wales and Northern Ireland the appeals process is slightly different.\nSchools and colleges will set their own deadlines for receiving appeals, which will be earlier than these dates. \nFirst of all, try not to panic.\nOne option is to contact the university's admissions office, which may have some flexibility if you narrowly missed your offer, or could suggest a different course.\nYour school or college's careers adviser can also help discuss options such as a gap year, work or an apprenticeship.\nAnother popular option is clearing, which matches students with spare university places. \nUntil 19 October, you can apply for a course through clearing if you've missed out on an offer - or have declined your firm choice. You must register and then apply on the Ucas Track system.\nBefore you add a university as a clearing choice, you need to call them directly to discuss whether they will potentially accept you.\nAdditionally, in England exams will be held in October in their normal format. Any student can take one of these exams if they were due to take one in the summer, and can use their highest grade from those or the teacher estimates.\nAdvanced level qualifications - known as A-levels - are subject-based qualifications taken mostly by pupils aged 16-18 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland after they have done their GCSEs.  \nIn England, pupils must stay in education or training until they are 18.\nStudents normally study three or more A-levels over two years which are assessed by a series of exams. They can lead to university, further study, training, or work. \nIn England, the government \"very much hopes and intends\" for exams to go ahead in 2022, according to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. \nBut schools are set to get advance notice of topics, so students are not disadvantaged by Covid disruption. Full details will not be confirmed until early in the autumn term.\nIn Wales, plans are currently being developed. However, some subjects will be adapted \"to reflect the disruption there has been\".\nExams will take place in Northern Ireland, but students will sit \"significantly fewer\" in each subject.\nPupils across Scotland are receiving confirmation of the grades for their Highers and Advanced Highers, while younger pupils get the final grades for their National 5 qualification.\nThe percentage of pupils achieving A to C grades in their Highers fell from 89.3% in 2020 to 87.3% in 2021.\nBut that total is still significantly above the 75% pass rate from 2019, and a record high number of awards overall.\nA total of 90.2% of Advanced Higher candidates achieved a pass, down from 93.1% in 2020, while National 5 scores dropped from 89% to 85.8%.\nProvisional grades based on teacher assessment were awarded across all qualifications in June to allow more time to appeal. The deadline for any appeal is 12 August.\nA decision on whether exams will be held in 2022 is due shortly."
