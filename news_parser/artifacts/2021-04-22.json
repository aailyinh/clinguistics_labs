      "text": "India has joined the UK's travel red list - effectively banning travel - as a deadly second wave of infections sweeps the country.\nBritish and Irish nationals can travel to the UK from India, but they must now isolate in a government-approved hotel.\nIndia has seen soaring infection rates, a rapidly rising death toll and the discovery of a new virus variant.\nThe spike has overwhelmed hospitals, creating a critical shortage of oxygen, intensive care beds and ventilators.\nOn Friday, India recorded 332,730 coronavirus cases, the highest one-day tally anywhere in the world for the second day in a row. Daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by a record 2,263 in the previous 24 hours.\nAt least two hospitals in the Indian capital Delhi are running out of oxygen, and at least 13 patients have died after a fire broke out in the intensive care unit of a hospital set up to treat Covid patients near Mumbai.\nThe rising number of cases has resulted in a deepening healthcare crisis that has gripped several states, and India's top court has asked the central government for a national plan by Friday on bolstering supply, oxygen, medicine, treatment and vaccines.\nNayan Gangyan is facing a 10-day hotel quarantine when he flies back to London from northern India on Saturday. He travelled to Chandigarh a few weeks ago, when his parents both contracted coronavirus. \nHe told BBC Breakfast he was left feeling \"helpless\" in the UK when his father's oxygen levels dropped, there were no beds available in hospital and his mother started to panic.\n\"It was at that point that I decided 'my family needs help and I need to go back come what may',\" he says.\nHe says the situation in India is \"really bad\", with the government healthcare system \"completely overrun\". But they eventually managed to get his father admitted to a hospital where he had previously undergone a liver transplant, and he is doing \"much better now\".\nNow Nayan is preparing to return home to London. \"The flight as of now, it's running. I really hope that it does take off,\" he says.\n\"I've already booked my quarantine hotel so I'll be going straight there. I'll be landing [then] straight to the hotel and 10 days in the room.\"\nHis wife Vani, who has been watching from a distance from their London home, says it has been difficult \"not to be able to control or influence\" events. \nOn India's red list status, she says: \"We got just over three days' notice so very little time for us to actually affect the outcome or do anything. \n\"We're just in the position where we have to be okay. After Nayan's ordeal in India he has to go through another ordeal.\"\nTina Patel and her husband arrived back in the UK on Thursday from Pune, Maharashtra, after travelling to India in March to visit her father-in-law, who was ill due to old age and later died. \nShe told the BBC people in the city were \"desperate\" - trying to find hospital beds or a slot in the crematoriums. \"We left a city with ambulances wailing away day and night,\" she said. \n\"I left broken-hearted as there was nothing we could do but catch the BA flight last night and all we could do was to be thankful that we finally got home.\"\nFriday's travel rule change means direct flights from India are still permitted, but UK and Irish nationals, as well as those with residency rights, must isolate in government-approved hotels - at their own cost - for 10 days.\nTravel to the UK is banned for all others who have been in red-list countries in the past 10 days.\nThere are 40 countries on the government's red list across the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice.\nThere are specific rules for people arriving in each UK nation, including England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nPublic Health England (PHE) confirmed on Thursday that a further 55 cases of the virus variant first identified in India - known as B.1.617 - were found in the UK in the latest week to 14 April.\nPHE experts are currently unsure whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity.\nThe final scheduled commercial flight ahead of the rule change - Vistara flight VTI017 - landed at London's Heathrow Airport at 18:48 on Thursday, according to FlightRadar24.\nFour airlines asked for a total of eight extra flights to arrive at the west London airport before the 04:00 deadline but were refused permission by airport authorities.\nHeathrow bosses are believed to have declined the requests to ensure pressures at the border, reported in recent weeks, were not exacerbated.\nLater scheduled arrivals from Delhi and Mumbai to Heathrow, and Delhi to Gatwick Airport, were cancelled on Thursday, airport data showed.\nSome of those who arrived before the red list change told the BBC they \"couldn't afford to stay away\" and \"had to get back to work\".\n\"Eventually, yesterday, a friend in the UK managed to book me a ticket from Mumbai to Manchester,\" Biju Mathew, a social services manager from Walsall, said.\nDemand for flights from India to the UK quickly became overwhelming after the government's red list announcement, according to Suresh Kumar, chairman of specialist travel agents Indra Travel.\n\"A lot of people were hoping that the [UK] government would have made arrangements for people trying to get back,\" he said. \"They were disappointed.\"\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who cancelled an official visit to India due to take place next Monday - said the addition to the red list was a \"purely precautionary\" step over a new coronavirus variant.\nHe said: \"What we're seeing in India is a result of a variant under investigation, it hasn't yet been deemed a variant of concern - I think that was why there has been the delay.\"\nThe B.1.617 variant was first noted internationally in October and first identified in the UK on 22 February.\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

      "tags": "Brit Awards,Music",
      "text": "The Brit Awards will go ahead with a live audience next month, as part of the government's research into how live events might work after the pandemic.\nThe ceremony will take place at London's O2 Arena on 11 May and will be fronted by comedian Jack Whitehall.\nThe 4,000-strong audience won't need to wear masks or be socially distanced, but will need a negative Covid test.\nIt's the latest addition to the Events Research Programme, which examines how venues and events can reopen safely.\nThe scheme also includes a Liverpool nightclub that will host 3,000 people per night on 30 April and 1 May, and a 5,000-capacity gig in the city on 2 May.\nIt also includes sporting spectacles like the FA Cup final, which will have 21,000 spectators four days after the Brits, on 15 May.\nMost tickets - 2,500 of the 4,000 - will be given to key workers from London \"to thank them for their remarkable hard work and selfless commitment\". The capital's key workers can apply for free tickets via the Brit Awards website from Thursday.\nThe other 1,500 places will go to the nominated artists, their managers and teams plus other members of the music industry and sponsors.\nAll audience members will be asked to present proof of a recent negative lateral flow test to enter the venue. Once inside, it will be as \"normal\" as possible, including serving food and alcohol.\nAttendees will also be asked to take a test after the ceremony to help gather further evidence on the safety of indoor settings, reduced social distancing and the absence of face coverings. \nAudience members will also have to provide contact details for NHS Test and Trace so everyone can be traced in the event of an audience member receiving a positive test after the event.\nThe O2 has a capacity of roughly 20,000, but only 4,000 people will be at the Brits.\nHowever, this is not because of social distancing, but is due to some sections of the arena being closed off for the event.\nThe ground floor will largely be used for staging, and will also be where the nominees and their guests sit during the ceremony.\nAs a result, the key workers and their guests will be on level one of the arena. The higher level will be largely closed off.\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: \"The Brits are always a big night in the music calendar, but this year's awards will be particularly special. \n\"They will reunite live audiences with the best of British talent for the first time in a year, while providing a vital opportunity to see how we can get large crowds back safely as soon as possible.\"\nThe Music Venue Trust said it was \"very happy\" that the awards were going ahead but questioned how much value the event would be to grassroots music venues across the UK.\n\"It isn't at all clear how anything learned from this event will directly help us to open the Hull Adelphi, 100 Club London... or any of the other 950 grassroots music venues across the country,\" said CEO Mark Davyd.\nHe said there were \"obvious concerns\" about whether enough testing and pilot events were taking place \"to give the grassroots music venue sector the data and evidence it needs to return to full capacity.\"\nSome Twitter users, meanwhile, queried why the Brits should be allowed to have 4,000 people in attendance when smaller gatherings like weddings and Parkruns remained subject to government restrictions.\nDua Lipa, Headie One, Arlo Parks and Griff will be among the performers at the ceremony.\nParks and Lipa have three nominations each, as do dance producer Joel Corry and grime duo Young T & Bugsey.\n\"This has been a long tough year for everyone and I'm delighted the night will honour the key worker heroes who have cared for us so well during that time and continue to do so,\" Lipa said in a statement.\n\"They are quite simply an inspiration. The Brit Awards are always special and this will truly make it a night to remember.\"\nThe ceremony will be broadcast live on ITV.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "David Cameron,Public Accounts Committee,Greensill Capital,Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Lobbying",
      "text": "The Treasury has published 40 pages of messages relating to its contact with David Cameron and Greensill Capital.\nThe former PM is embroiled in a row over attempts to lobby top officials on behalf of the financial firm. \nIt had already come to light that Mr Cameron contacted the chancellor and two other ministers about Greensill.\nBut the emails also revealed former Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill \"connected\" Lex Greensill with the Treasury in March 2020.\nOther emails and texts - released as a result of a Freedom of Information request - showed contact between senior civil servants in the department and the former PM and financier.\nThey also showed the rejection letters for Greensill's appeal for access to government-backed loans during the pandemic.\nEarlier, the Bank of England said Mr Cameron had contacted it multiple times last year as the finance firm sought access to a Covid loan scheme.\nThe Treasury's top civil servant, Sir Tom Scholar, also told MPs Mr Cameron had called and texted him on his official phone.\nBut he added that Greensill's proposals were ultimately rejected.\nThree MP-led inquiries and a lawyer-led government review are looking at Mr Cameron's work for the company, which collapsed in March.\nThe former Conservative leader, who began working for Greensill as an adviser two years after leaving Downing Street, has insisted he broke no lobbying rules but accepted he should have contacted ministers using more formal channels.\nBut Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the correspondence showed the firm \"was carrying the begging bowl from the Bank of England to the Treasury and back\". \n\"We need to understand why Greensill Capital was given so much time and access to the Treasury, and why so much public money was put at risk.\"\nOn Wednesday, the Bank of England released details of contacts between Mr Cameron and its officials, in response to Freedom of Information requests. \nThey show the ex-PM contacted Bank officials before and after the firm applied to join a government scheme to support lending to businesses. \nAlongside the Treasury, the Bank had been running the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), set up in the early stages of the pandemic. \nGreensill had wanted the terms of the CCFF changed so it could take part - a request the Treasury went on to reject, after concluding the firm's proposals were not suitable. \nThe published correspondence from the Bank of England includes email exchanges with Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy governor. \nIn one email from early April, Mr Cameron told Sir Jon that Greensill had \"failed to get anywhere\" with its proposals, despite \"numerous conversations\" with the Treasury. \nIn another email to him later in the month, the ex-PM said Greensill's inability to access the scheme had proved \"incredibly frustrating\".\nRecords show a phone call later took place between Sir Jon and Lex Greensill, the firm's Australian founder, to discuss the firm's ideas further. \nThey show Sir Jon telling Mr Greensill his firm fell outside the \"boundaries of the scheme\" - and changing these would be a decision for the Treasury.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Sir Tom - the Treasury's permanent secretary - said Greensill Capital had \"persistently\" approached his department about being involved. \nGiving evidence to MPs on the the Public Accounts Committee, he added: \"We listened to what they said. We analysed it, we tested it and in the end, despite them submitting a series of successive proposals, we decided to reject them all.\"\nSir Tom, who previously worked for the former PM as a Europe adviser, told them Mr Cameron had rung him directly in April 2020, although the call did not include \"substantive discussion\" of Greensill's proposals.\n\"It was simply a call to draw it to my attention,\" he said, adding that Mr Cameron had his work phone number \"because I used to work with him\".\nAsked if he would have taken a call from a lobbyist if they hadn't been a former prime minister, Sir Tom said: \"I've also from time-to-time had calls from other senior people, maybe private sector people who I've previously worked with in another capacity.\"\nHe added: \"I think it's natural when somebody that you know asks to speak to you... it's quite natural to take that.\"\nThe second most senior official at the Treasury, Charles Roxburgh, told the committee he had met Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill at nine meetings spread out over four months from March to June 2020.\nMr Roxburgh told the committee civil servants would not have consulted on their proposals \"if we didn't think there was some potential - turns out there wasn't\"."

      "tags": "Xi Jinping,Ed Miliband,Boris Johnson,COP26,Climate change,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Tackling climate change is about \"growth and jobs\" not \"expensive bunny hugging\", Boris Johnson has said.\nSpeaking at a virtual summit, the prime minister told world leaders \"we can build back better from this pandemic by building back greener.\"\nAt the same event, US President Joe Biden pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030.\nMr Johnson praised Mr Biden for \"returning the US to the front rank of the fight against climate change\".\nOne of Mr Biden's first acts as president was to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, months after his predecessor Donald Trump had taken the US out. \nForty other leaders attended the summit including China's President Xi Jinping who reiterated a promise to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.\nIt is hoped that all countries will commit to further carbon emission cuts at the COP26 conference due to be held in Glasgow this November.\nEarlier this week, the UK government announced its own plans to cut carbon emissions by 78% compared to 1990 levels by 2035. \nLabour welcomed the new commitment - which brings the current target forward by 15 years - but said the government \"can't be trusted to match rhetoric with reality\".\nThe party's shadow environment secretary Ed Miliband urged ministers to match promises with \"much more decisive action\". \nIn his speech to the Leaders Summit on Climate, Mr Johnson said UK's carbon emissions were lower than at any point since the 19th century.\nHe also praised the wind power sector in the country, describing the UK as \"the Saudi Arabia of wind\". \nThe prime minister called on other countries to \"make this decade the moment of decisive change in the fight against climate change\" by setting their own tough targets on carbon emissions.\nHe also emphasised the connection between wildlife and climate, saying: \"If we're going to tackle climate change we have to deal with the disaster of habitat loss and species loss across our planet.\"\nAnd he sought to play up the economic benefits of fighting climate change arguing: \"It's vital for all of us to show that this is not all about some expensive, politically correct, green act of bunny hugging.\n\"What I'm driving at is this is about growth and jobs.\"\nThe prime minister's contribution to today's virtual climate jamboree included familiar lines from him: the UK being the \"Saudi Arabia of wind\" power and him being a man keen on having your cake and eating it: \"cake, have, eat\" as he put it.\nHe didn't dwell on what many say would be the colossal costs and changes society will have to take on to get to net zero emissions.\nThere is a bigger picture here too: the prime minister casting himself as a globally central figure in all this, ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.\nMr Johnson welcomed the return of the United States \"to the front rank of the fight against climate change,\" with President Biden replacing Donald Trump.\nMr Biden will be an enthusiastic participant in Glasgow later this year, whereas it would have been far from certain a re-elected President Trump would have even turned up.\nClimate change, the ultimate international issue, has turned diplomacy green: for the prime minister, it is central to his vision for \"Global Britain.\""

He's been on hunger strike for more than 20 days.\nThe doctors' statement (in Russian) was published on the Mediazona website on Thursday.\nThe doctors, who have been denied access to Navalny, say their conclusions are based on the results of Tuesday's medical tests - described as more or less independent. The tests were carried out at a hospital in the city of Vladimir, just east of Moscow.\nThe doctors - who had treated the opposition leader before he was jailed - warn that problems with Navalny's kidneys and nervous system suggest he would die if the hunger strike goes on even for a little longer.\nThe physicians say Navalny should \"immediately halt the hunger strike to preserve your life and health\".\nThey are also demanding to be given access to their patient.\nThe Russian authorities have not publicly commented on the doctors' statement.\nOn Monday, Navalny was moved to a prison hospital where the authorities said his condition was \"satisfactory\". \nThe FSIN prison service added that he was being examined by a doctor daily and had agreed to take vitamins.\nIn an Instagram post (in Russian) earlier this week, Navalny told his followers: \"You'd laugh if you could see me now. A skeleton staggering round his cell.\"\nWestern countries say Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent last August and only narrowly survived. After his transfer to intensive care in Berlin, toxicologists concluded that the poison was Russian weapons-grade Novichok.\nThe West blamed the Russian state for the attack, and Navalny accused President Vladimir Putin directly. The Kremlin denied any involvement and disputed the conclusion about Novichok.\nNavalny was jailed in February for violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for fraud. He says the case is politically motivated.\nThe US has warned Russia there will be \"consequences\" if Navalny dies in jail."

      "text": "Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is shutting its two main car factories temporarily due to a shortage of computer chips.\nThe difficulties at Britain's biggest carmaker echo similar problems at other manufacturers, including Ford, who have been hit by a global shortage of chips.\nJLR said there would be a \"limited period\" of closure at its Halewood and Castle Bromwich sites from Monday.\nA mixture of strong demand and Covid shutdowns at chipmakers has also hit phone, TV and video games companies.\nTata-owned JLR said in a statement: \"We have adjusted production schedules for certain vehicles which means that our Castle Bromwich and Halewood manufacturing plants will be operating a limited period of non-production from Monday 26th April.\n\"We are working closely with affected suppliers to resolve the issues and minimise the impact on customer orders wherever possible.\" Production at a third factory, at Solihull, will continue.\nThe Castle Bromwich factory makes the Jaguar XE, XF and F-Type models, and employs about 1,900 people. Halewood makes the Range Rover, Evoque and the Land Rover Discovery Sport, and has about 4,000 workers.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has driven up demand for semiconductor chips for use in electronics such as computers, as people worked from home, and suppliers are struggling to adjust.\nThere has also been a fire at a Japanese company, part of Renesas Electronics, one of the world's biggest makers of semiconductors for the car industry. \nAlso on Thursday, France's Renault warned that the chip shortage was worsening. On Wednesday, carmaker Stellantis, which owns the UK Vauxhall brand, said it would replace digital speedometers with more old-fashioned analogue ones in one of its Peugeot models, as the fallout continues.\nDaimler, General Motors and Volkswagen have all suspended production lines at various times in recent weeks. \nModern cars contain complex electronics and are heavily reliant on semiconductors, which are used in systems ranging from engine management to parking cameras. \nToday's cars are computers on wheels, festooned with electronics such as engine management systems, driver aids, cameras and entertainment gadgets.\nAll of these need semiconductors, and right now the entire industry is struggling to get enough of them. It's fighting the consumer electronics sector for the supplies that are available.\nWhat has made the auto industry particularly vulnerable is its reliance on just-in-time delivery, where parts are brought in when needed, rather than being stockpiled.\nNormally this is seen as the efficient way to do things - but the semiconductor shortage has shown just what can happen when normally well-oiled supply chains seize up.\nFurther disruption over the coming weeks and months is inevitable, because it takes time to ramp up chip production. The question now is what carmakers can do to ensure they aren't caught out by a similar supply squeeze in future."

      "tags": "Radiation,Chernobyl disaster",
      "text": "There is no \"additional DNA damage\" in children born to parents who were exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl explosion before they were conceived.\nThis is according to the first study to screen the genes of children whose parents were enlisted to help in the clean-up after the nuclear accident. \nParticipants, all conceived after the disaster and born between 1987 and 2002, had their whole genomes screened.\nThe study found no mutations that were associated with a parent's exposure. \nThe findings are published in the journal Science. \nProf Gerry Thomas, from Imperial College London, has spent decades studying the biology of cancer, particularly tumours that are linked to damage from radiation. She explained that this new study was the first to demonstrate that \"even when people were exposed to relatively high doses of radiation - when compared to background radiation - it had no effect on their future children\".  \nThe new study was led by Prof Meredith Yeager, at the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), in Maryland. It focused on the children of workers who were enlisted to help clean up the highly-contaminated zone around the nuclear power plant, and the children of evacuees from the abandoned town of Pripyat, and other settlements within the 70km zone around it.\nOne of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Chanock, also from the NCI, explained that the research team recruited whole families, so the scientists could compare the DNA of a mother, a father and a child. \n\"Here we're not looking at what happened to those children who were [in the womb] at the time of the accident; we're looking at something called de novo mutations.\"\nThese are new mutations in DNA - they occur randomly in an egg or sperm cell. Depending on where in the genetic blueprint of a baby a mutation arises, it could have no impact at all, or could be the cause of a genetic disease. \n\"There are about 50-100 of these mutations every generation - and they're random,\" explained Dr Chanock. \"In some ways, they're the building blocks of evolution. This is how new changes are introduced into a population one birth at a time. \n\"We looked at the mothers' and the fathers' genomes and then at the child. And we spent an extra nine months looking for any signal - in the number of these mutations - that was associated with a parents' radiation exposure. We couldn't find anything.\"\nThis means, the scientists say, that the effect of radiation on a parent's body has no impact on the children they conceive in the future. \n\"There are a lot of people who were scared to have children after the atomic bombs [in Nagasaki and Hiroshima],\" Prof Thomas told BBC News. \"And people who were scared to have children after the accident at Fukushima, because they thought their child would be affected by radiation they were exposed to.\n\"It's so sad. And if we can show that there's no effect, hopefully we can alleviate that fear.\"\nProf Thomas was not involved in the genome study. She and her colleagues have carried out another piece of research on the cancers that were linked to Chernobyl. They studied thyroid cancer, because the nuclear accident is known to have caused about 5,000 cases of that specific cancer, the vast majority of which were treated and cured.\nThe authorities at the time of the accident failed to prevent contaminated milk from being sold in the region; many who were children at the time drank it, receiving large doses of radioactive iodine - one of the contaminants blasted out of the damaged reactor.\n\"Essentially, we found that there is no difference between thyroid cancers caused by Chernobyl radiation and any other thyroid cancers,\" Prof Thomas explained. \n\"So there's no 'demon tumour' that comes out of Chernobyl that we won't be able to treat - we can just treat in exactly the same way as we treat other cases.\"  \nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has told a major summit that we are in a \"decisive decade\" for tackling climate change.\nThe US has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by the year 2030. \nThis new target, which was unveiled at a virtual summit of 40 global leaders, essentially doubles their previous promise.\nBut the leaders of India and China, two of the world's biggest emitters, made no new commitments.\n\"Scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade - this is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis,\" President Biden said at the summit's opening address.\n\"We must try to keep the Earth's temperature to an increase of 1.5C. The world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heatwaves and hurricanes - tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods.\"\nHe said there was a moral and economic imperative to immediately act on climate change.\nReferring to America's new carbon-cutting pledge, President Biden added: \"The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting.\n\"The US isn't waiting, we are resolving to take action.\"\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg, who was testifying before Congress on Thursday, challenged world leaders to do more on the climate crisis.\n\"Unlike you, my generation will not give up without a fight,\" she said. \"How long do you honestly believe that people in power will get away with it?\"\nThe UK is playing a critical role this year as president of the crucial COP26 later this year. The government is tasked with achieving agreement in Glasgow when world leaders meet there in November.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson was in ebullient form on his virtual conference address. He assured global leaders that tackling climate change was \"not bunny-hugging\".\nAt the summit, Mr Johnson called President Biden's announcement about cutting US greenhouse gas emissions \"game-changing\".\n\"We can do this together across the world. It's going to mean the richest nations coming together and exceeding the $100bn commitment they already made in 2009,\" he said.\nClimate has been the central focus of the Biden administration's first few months in office. \nAs well as re-joining the Paris climate pact and organising Thursday's summit, the Biden team has been working on a strong pledge to convince the world that they mean business.\nThe fact that President Biden is prepared to go beyond a 50% cut will be a welcome surprise to many scientists and campaigners. \n\"By announcing a bold target of cutting emissions 50-52% below 2005 by the end of the decade, President Biden has met the moment and the urgency that the climate crisis demands,\" said Nathaniel Keohane from the US Environmental Defense Fund.\n\"This target aligns with what the science says is necessary to put the world on the path to a safer climate, and vaults the US into the top tier of world leaders on climate ambition.\"\nBut the new pledge will mean major changes to the American way of life. Coal will have to disappear from the electricity mix, while gas guzzling cars and trucks will have to go electric.\nOthers stepping up with new promises included Canada, Japan and South Korea.\nBut Canada's promise to limit carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 came in for immediate criticism from campaigners.\n\"Canada's new 2030 emissions reduction target is stronger than its previous commitment, but it falls short of what is needed to avoid dangerous levels of warming,\" said Helen Mountford from the World Resources Institute.\n\"Canada's efforts to deliver real action on the ground are welcome, like placing a price on carbon pollution, but the country should aim for a much more ambitious goal than what it put forward today.\"\nMeanwhile, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshide Suga said the country was \"ready to demonstrate its leadership\" on the climate.\nMr Suga said that Japan would reduce emissions by 46% in 2030 compared to 2013 levels. Previously, the country had pledged only a 26% cut in emissions.\nSouth Korea also pledged a new target and said they would stop financing the building of coal-fired power stations overseas.\nBut China made no new pledges but hinted that coal, which is set to grow again as the economy recovers from Covid, will be tackled in the next few years.\n\"We will strictly control the coal-fired power generation projects,\" the country's President Xi Jinping told the gathering.\n\"We will strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th five-year plan period and phase it down in the 15th five-year plan period.\"\nHowever, that's likely to be after 2026.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China will be responsible for around half the growth in coal around the world this year, as economies recover from Covid.\nIndia's Prime Minister Modi stressed that his country's per capita emissions were 60% lower than the global average.\nHe said that lifestyle changes should play a bigger role in limiting climate change. However he made no new promises on curbing emissions.\nPresident Biden's team is also urging countries that have been slow to embrace action on climate change - such as Australia and Brazil - to raise their ambition.\nBrazil and Australia's sceptical approach to the issue had found favour in the Trump White House. But that's no longer the case.\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Climate change,European Union",
      "text": "The EU has adopted ambitious new targets to curb climate change, with a pledge to make them legally binding. \nUnder a new law agreed between member states and the EU Parliament, the bloc will cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels.\nThe EU parliament had pushed for a higher target of a 60% reduction.\n\"Our political commitment to becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050 is now also a legal one,\" said EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.\n\"The Climate Law sets the EU on a green path for a generation.\"\nThe deal comes ahead of a virtual summit of world leaders later this week, where the US is expected to announce its own climate targets for 2030.\nUS President Joe Biden, who will lead the meeting, rejoined the Paris climate agreement in his first day in office and has previously committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050.\nThe UK, meanwhile, announced radical plans to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035 earlier this week, although environmentalists warn that the government has consistently failed to achieve previous targets set by its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC).\nThe EU Climate Law was agreed in the early hours of Wednesday after months of talks.\nIt sets a limit on the levels of CO2 removal that can count towards the 2030 target, to ensure that states actively lower emissions rather than removing them from the atmosphere through forests, for example.\nA 15-member independent council will also be established to advise the EU on climate measures and targets.\nThe EU Commission will announce a package of climate laws in June to support the plans.\nThe target to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 was initially announced by EU leaders in December but there had been pressure from the EU Parliament and environmental groups for the law to go even further. Previous EU targets had called for a 40% cut.\nEU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmerman described the agreement as \"a landmark moment for the EU and a strong signal to the world\". \nHowever, Greens MEP Michael Bloss tweeted that the climate law was a \"big disappointment\", adding: \"We fought hard but achieved little\".\nIn September the EU Commission set out its blueprint for reaching the 55% target by 2030, and said at least 30% of the EU's \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.64tn; $2.2tn) long-term budget would be spent on climate-related measures.\nThe targets are part of a global effort to tackle climate change by cutting atmospheric pollution, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.\nThe Paris climate deal, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature rise well under 2C, and preferably within a maximum rise of 1.5C, to prevent the worst effects of climate change."

      "text": "For some learner drivers the wait for a test is over as they resume in parts of the UK - but many have spoken about the difficulties in securing a test date.\nTests have been suspended due to Covid restrictions since January, but restart in England and Wales on Thursday.\nMost centres are currently booked up until August, with a backlog of around 420,000 tests because of the pandemic.\nCharlotte Dalton, 24 - who has had a test cancelled during every lockdown - says test slots were \"like gold dust\".\nThe mother-of-two said she has spent the last few months \"logging on every day, every hour\" to try to secure one.\nThe Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) said it was doing \"all we can to provide as many tests as possible to help clear the backlog as quickly as we can\".\nCharlotte, from rural Buxton, decided to learn to drive in July 2019 after her boyfriend had a seizure behind the wheel and could no longer drive.\nHer test was originally scheduled for April last year - but the first lockdown meant it had to be rearranged multiple times, before she eventually had her first test in September.\n\"I was so stressed and anxious about the possibility of failing, I failed because I worked myself up so much about it,\" she said.\nAfter another cancellation in October - because the examiner had to self-isolate - her next two test dates were curtailed by England's second and third lockdowns.\n\"Whilst I respect why the decision was made to suspend tests, it's also infuriating - how many times do I have to have tests cancelled?\" she said. \nShe was then given an August date, but through persistence, she has gradually managed to secure earlier bookings, bringing it forward to 8 May.\n\"I'm relieved that it's so soon, but I'm panicking because if I fail again the next tests are September. It's a lot of pressure - I'd be absolutely devastated if I failed again.\"\nThose who fail their test in Britain face an average waiting time of 17 weeks to book a new slot. Before the pandemic, the average waiting time was seven weeks.\nCharlotte, who has an 11-week-old daughter, says she has spent thousands of pounds on lessons over the past two years and almost \u00a32,000 in car insurance for her own car.\n\"As a family, me getting my driving licence means we can finally have the freedom and the independence we desire - so to some people it might seem small - but to us my driving licence is essential to the future of our family.\"\nAnother driver to be affected by the pandemic was Jasmin Dhaliwal, from London, who saw her January test cancelled and rescheduled for 21 April - which turned out to be the day before tests were able to resume. \nShe was then automatically allocated a date in August - eight-and-a-half months after her original date.\nShe says she was \"lucky\" in that she was able to find a cancellation date sooner, with the help of an app, but says her local area is booked up until September now.\nDriving tests will also restart in Northern Ireland on Friday, while in Scotland it will be 6 May at the earliest.\nThe DVSA said it was offering an additional 2,500 car tests per month by using weekends and bank holidays.\nIt said it was regularly adding new appointments to the booking system and recruiting extra driving examiners across the country to deliver more tests over the coming months.\nDVSA chief driving examiner Mark Winn urged learners to only take their driving test \"if they are completely ready to pass\".\n\"We know many learners have waited a long time to take their driving test, so when tests restart in England and Wales on 22 April, we want them to be ready and to pass first time.\""

      "text": "The West is faced with a \"moment of reckoning\" when it comes to technology and security, the head of intelligence agency GCHQ has told the BBC.\nJeremy Fleming said there was a risk that key technologies on which we rely will no longer be shaped by the West. \n\"We have to keep evolving our approach if we're going to keep up,\" he said of the growing challenge from China.\nSo-called smart cities, which will collect large amounts of data, are just one example, he added.\n\"The risk is that the technology is implemented in a way in which we can't assure its security,\" he warned.\nThe UK is a \"big beast\" when it comes to technology but \"we can't take that for granted\", the GCHQ director warned, saying this was a moment when we had to decide if we were going to continue to evolve and compete with our adversaries.\nMr Fleming was speaking ahead of giving this year's Vincent Briscoe Annual Security Lecture at Imperial College, and in the wake of the Integrated Review, which placed science and technology at the centre of future security and defence policy.\nThe challenge from China is uppermost in the minds of intelligence chiefs across Western countries, particularly when it comes to technology. \n\"The risk, as I see it today, is that we lose control of the standards that shape our technology environment,\" he told the BBC.\n\"The things that make sure that our liberal Western democratic views are baked into our technology.\"\nMr Fleming said there were lessons to be learnt from the debate over the role of Chinese company Huawei in building a new 5G telecoms system. It was initially given a role in the UK, before being excluded following US sanctions.\nBut there were concerns that there were few other companies actually able to supply the latest technology.\n\"The conversation about 5G was really lost a decade ago, when Western nations decided that they weren't going to invest in the underpinning infrastructures... and the result was we just didn't have the choices,\" he said.\nThe imperative was to make sure in the future the UK took the kind of long-range decisions need to ensure it has choice - so there would not be the same concerns over dependency, he said.\nThat need to look forward prompted a focus on smart cities.\nThese involve a vast number of sensors and cameras built into a city's infrastructure - controlling everything from traffic to utilities such as water and power.\nBut it also means vast amounts of data will be collected about people's movement and activity. \nDone in the right way, the GCHQ chief argues this presents a \"fantastic opportunity\" to increase efficiency and improve services. \nBut he warned it also carries risks around privacy and anonymity. \n\"If we don't control the technology, if we don't understand the security required to implement those effectively, then we'll end up with an environment or technology ecosystem where the data is not only used to navigate, but it could be used to track us\".\nChina is a leading supplier of smart city technology, with councils in the UK already purchasing cameras from its companies. \nMr Fleming said it was vital to ensure all the technologies were not from one place and to understand how data was being processed.\nThere were only a relatively small number of areas where the UK would need to completely control a technology, he said, and more broadly working with allies would be essential to shape international standards and to defend itself in cyberspace. \nAt home, the UK has to invest in skills and innovation. \nThe UK should not be \"fatalistic\", he said, and had a \"very strong track record\" of meeting technology challenges."

      "text": "Mohammed Aisha joined his \"cursed\" ship, the MV Aman, on 5 May 2017.\nToday, after spending almost four years on board stranded off the Egyptian coast, he was freed and flown home to Syria. So how does he feel?\nHis text, from the aircraft on the tarmac at Cairo airport, was brief.\n\"Relief. Joy.\"\nAnd then came a voice message.\n\"How do I feel? Like I finally got out of prison. I'm finally going to be rejoined with my family. I'm going to see them again.\"\nIt marks the end of an ordeal which has taken its toll on Mohammed's physical and mental health. He was, after all, condemned to a life without power, sanitation or company. \nIt began in July 2017, when the MV Aman was detained at the Egyptian port of Adabiya. The cargo ship was held because it had expired safety equipment and classification certificates. \nIt should have been easy enough to resolve, but the ship's Lebanese contractors failed to pay for fuel and the MV Aman's owners in Bahrain were in financial difficulty. \nWith the ship's Egyptian captain ashore, a local court declared Mohammed, the ship's chief officer, the MV Aman's legal guardian.\nMohammed, who was born in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartus, says he wasn't told what the order meant and only found out months later, as the ship's other crew members started to leave.\nFor four years, life - and death - passed Mohammed by. He watched as ships sailed past, in and out of the nearby Suez Canal. \nDuring the recent blockage caused by the giant container ship Ever Given, he counted dozens of ships waiting for the traffic jam to ease. \nHe has even seen his brother, a fellow seafarer, sail past more than once. The brothers spoke on the phone but were too far apart even to wave.\nIn August 2018, he learned that his mother, a teacher responsible for his excellent English, had died. That was Mohammed's low point.\n\"I seriously considered ending my life,\" he told me.\nBy August 2019, Mohammed was alone but for the occasional guard and trapped on a vessel with no diesel and, consequently, no power. He was legally obliged to stay aboard and was unpaid, demoralised and feeling increasingly unwell. \nHe said the ship was like a grave at night.\n\"You can't see anything. You can't hear anything,\" he said. \"It's like you're in a coffin.\"\nIn March 2020, a storm blew the Aman off its anchorage. The ship drifted five miles (8km), eventually running aground a few hundred metres from the shoreline. \nIt was terrifying at the time, but Mohammed thought it was an act of God. Now he was able to swim ashore every few days, buy food and recharge his phone. \nAstonishing as Mohammed's story is, his experience is not unique. In fact, seafarer abandonment is on the rise. \nAccording to the International Labour Organization, there are more than 250 active cases around the world where crews are simply left to fend for themselves. It says 85 new cases were reported in 2020, which is twice as many as in the previous year. \nMeanwhile, at the Iranian port of Assaluyeh, 19 mostly Indian crew members of the bulk carrier Ula are on hunger strike after their vessel was abandoned by its owners in July 2019.\nA crew member recently told the shipping journal Lloyd's List that the situation on board was \"very critical\", with depression rife and seafarers' families running out of money. \n\"The first time I came across one of these cases, I was in total shock,\" said Andy Bowerman, Middle East and South Asia director for the Mission to Seafarers. \nFrom his base in Dubai, he has seen this happen time and again, usually for the same combination of reasons. \n\"We're currently working with a case here, where the company have a huge mortgage on the vessel, but their debts are way beyond that. So sometimes it is just easier to tell the crew to drop anchor and to almost literally walk away.\"\nThe Aman's owners, Tylos Shipping and Marine Services, told the BBC they had tried to help Mohammed but that their hands were tied. \n\"I can't force a judge to remove the legal guardianship,\" a representative told us. \"And I can't find a single person on this planet - and I've tried - to replace him.\"\nMohammed, they said, should never have signed the order in the first place. \nMohamed Arrachedi of the International Transport Workers Federation, who took up Mohammed's case in December, said this should be a moment for everyone in the shipping industry to reflect. \n\"The case of Mohammed has to serve to open a serious debate to prevent these abuses to seafarers on ships,\" he told me.\nThe debate, he said, had to involve ship owners, port and maritime authorities and flag states.\n\"This drama and suffering of Mohammed Aisha could have been avoided if the owners and the parties with responsibilities and obligations to the ship had assumed their responsibilities and arranged his repatriation earlier.\"\nFor his part, Mohammed said he felt trapped in a situation not of his making, cornered by Egyptian law and ignored by the ship's owners . He said months would go by without communication - leaving him feeling let down and isolated.\nIt's enough, you might imagine, to make him think twice about going back to sea. \nBut he is determined. He says he is good at his job and wants nothing more than to pick up where he left off. \nAfter he's caught up with his family, that is."

Alex Salmond - who is leading the new Alba Party - wants even more urgency. I wrote about it earlier this week.\nBut unionist parties - those who favour Scotland staying part of the UK - are going into this election trying to stop them holding the balance of power, and arguing a debate on Scotland's constitutional future would be a distraction when the country is trying to recover from coronavirus. \nSo what's their plan to convince voters?\nSCOTLAND ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nIf you look at most election campaigns, the main question is normally a simple one. Who do you want to run the country?\nThings are slightly different in Scotland just now. The main opposition parties don't really argue that they are going to form the next Scottish government. Instead, they are asking voters to back them to stop the SNP winning a majority - and to stop another independence referendum.\nThe Scottish Conservative pitch at this election relies heavily on their unionist credentials. In the last few years, opposition to independence has given the party a new lease of life in Scotland, leading them to leapfrog Scottish Labour into second place last time around. \nDouglas Ross, the party's new leader, told me for Radio 4's PM programme: \"If we can stop that SNP majority again we can stop another referendum and really get our parliament and Scottish politics focussed on recovery - and I think that's where the public want to see their politicians really focussing all their efforts.\"\nThere's a bit of an irony in that answer. While the Conservatives are opposed to a referendum - they are happy to talk about independence because it is one of their main selling points to the electorate. \nThere's also the fact that Boris Johnson has made clear that he will refuse to grant the Scottish Parliament the power to hold another referendum - even if there's a pro-independence majority.\nI asked Douglas Ross: doesn't the prime minister saying he'll block a referendum undermine the argument that you need to vote Conservative at Holyrood to stop one? \n\"The SNP have said they don't care what a Tory PM or a UK government says - they will go ahead regardless with a wildcat, illegal referendum,\" he said, referring to the SNP's suggestion it would pass a referendum bill and dare Westminster to challenge it in the courts.\nHe added: \"Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed she wants a referendum in the next couple of years. She has accepted that means campaigning to separate Scotland from the rest of the UK during our recovery phase from this pandemic - and I don't want to see that division and arguments breaking up families and workplaces and communities again\".\nOpposition to independence has reinvigorated the Tories in Scotland - they have in the past urged people to lend them their votes to stop another referendum and in the past it seems to have worked. \nThe opposite is true for Labour, the party who once dominated Scotland. \nTheir apparent lack of clarity on the constitution is seen as one of the main reasons their support has fallen. I've written before about the party's Scotland problem.\nBut there is some optimism under new leader Anas Sarwar. There are even some whispers about the party maybe retaking second place as an alternative to both the SNP and Conservatives (those whispers are played down by Labour strategists - and dismissed as fanciful by many Tories too).  \nMr Sarwar told me: \"The mistake that both Douglas Ross and Nicola Sturgeon make is they think they can only talk to the half of the country that agrees with them and not the other half. I'm not willing to do that.\"\nThe problem is - Labour has tried to move beyond the constitution before. It's position has, the argument goes, left it in a bit of a constitutional no man's land; nationalists disliked that it didn't support independence, unionists thought it was too soft. \nMr Sarwar added: \"People know my view. I don't support independence - I don't support a referendum. I think it would be wrong for us to come through this collective trauma of Covid and go back to those old arguments where we seek to divide people across the country. Instead I want to focus on rebuilding our NHS, restoring our economy, renewing our education system so that it works for everyone across the country.\"\nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers do they have? MSPs pass laws on aspects of life in Scotland such as health, education and transport - and have some powers over tax and welfare benefits.\nWho can vote? Anyone who lives in Scotland, is registered to vote and aged 16 or over on 6 May is eligible. You can register to vote online. \nI've been speaking to quite a few candidates in the last couple of weeks. On the unionist side - many would admit tactical voting is a big part of this election.  \nIf the Conservatives are the biggest pro-union party in an area, some Labour voters are considering lending them their vote or vice versa. Many candidates would argue it has worked in the past. \nBut there are some unionist strategists who are nervous. They believe the SNP have a decent chance of forming a majority on their own. Even if they don't there is likely to be a pro-referendum majority when you factor in the Scottish Greens (and maybe Alex Salmond's Alba).\nSo being the biggest unionist party in the next parliament really matters. The leader of that party will play a big part in framing the debate over another referendum. If one does happen they'll be a key voice in framing the arguments which could decide the future of the union \nThere is another unionist voice in this debate too. The Scottish Liberal Democrats. In the early years of devolution, they were in power with Labour as a coalition. In the last Holyrood parliament, they were the fifth party.\nTheir leader, Willie Rennie, told me: \"What we want to do is put the recovery first. We want to tackle the issues that we're really strong on in terms of investing in mental health services, education, climate, jobs. Those are the top priorities for the Liberal Democrats. You won't get that with the Conservatives - because they want to spend the next five years arguing with the SNP about independence.\"\nHe added: \"We need partnership and we need to make sure we put that dark division of the last five years certainly - the poisonous atmosphere that's developed - behind us and work together in partnership.\"\nYou'll notice the pitch is quite similar among the three major unionist parties: vote for us so we can focus on recovery from the pandemic instead of independence.\nThe SNP say the opposite - independence is crucial to controlling that recovery \nIn two weeks' time we'll find out which of those visions Scottish voters prefer.

      "text": "After weeks of tension over a build-up of Russian troops close to Ukraine's border, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has ordered a number of units in the area back to their bases.\nThe EU estimated that more than 100,000 Russian soldiers had amassed near the border as well as in Crimea, which was seized and annexed by Russia in 2014.\nSpeaking in Crimea, Mr Shoigu said units on exercise would return to base.\nThe aims of the \"snap checks\" had been achieved, he added.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who earlier challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet him in the conflict zone, welcomed the decision to \"de-escalate\" tensions at the border.\n\"The troops have demonstrated their ability to provide a credible defence for the country,\" the Russian defence minister said, adding that he had instructed the commanders of units from the 58th and 41st armies as well as several airborne divisions to start returning to their permanent bases on Friday and to complete the operation by 1 May. \nPresident Zelensky raised the troop build-up with European leaders last week. Ukraine's armed forces chief said Russian military units had been moving into the Rostov, Bryansk and Voronezh regions as well as Crimea, while battalion tactical groups were stationed on the border.\nFollowing Mr Shoigu's announcement, Nato said that any move towards reversing the escalation would be \"important and well overdue\". It added that the Western military alliance remained vigilant. \nNato leaders have called a summit in June when Russia will be high on the agenda. \nAlthough Russia has shrugged off the build-up as training exercises in response to \"threatening\" actions from Nato, it is also said to be planning to cordon off areas of the Black Sea to foreign shipping. Ukraine fears its ports could be affected.\nRussia said all along that these were nothing more than military exercises.\nBut Moscow knew very well that its troop movements close to Ukraine and in annexed Crimea were making a lot of people very nervous: in Ukraine, Europe and in America. \nAnd that was the point. \nMoscow may well have been using the build-up of troops to send a signal to Kyiv, Brussels and, especially, to Washington that Russia is a force to be reckoned with.\nUS President Joe Biden took notice. Last week, he telephoned President Putin and proposed a summit. True, he also imposed a new round of sanctions over Russia's \"malign activity\". But inside Russia these were perceived as not particularly tough. \nA reduction in tension, however, does not mean the end of tension. Russia's defence minister has made it clear that \"Russia is taking measures in response to threats from Nato\". \nFor example, Moscow is planning to block areas of the Black Sea to foreign shipping for six months. \nIn a state-of-the-nation address on Wednesday, President Putin warned the West against \"crossing a red line\". \nSpeaking to reporters after the order for troops to return to base, Mr Putin said as far as bilateral relations were concerned \"we are ready to welcome the president of Ukraine at any time that is convenient for him\", but in Moscow.\nHowever, he stressed if Mr Zelensky wanted to discuss eastern Ukraine, then he should first meet the leaders there.\nConflict in eastern Ukraine broke out in 2014, after the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine. Russian-backed troops captured large areas of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions and declared them both peoples' republics.\nThere have been a number of breaches of a ceasefire in the east in recent weeks. A Ukrainian soldier was fatally wounded in shelling on Thursday, in what Ukrainian forces said was a deliberate violation of the ceasefire. Some 14,000 people have died since the conflict began."

      "text": "An instrument on Nasa's Perseverance rover on Mars has made oxygen from the planet's carbon dioxide atmosphere.\nIt's the second successful technology demonstration on the mission, which flew a mini-helicopter on Monday.\nThe oxygen generation was performed by a toaster-sized unit in the rover called Moxie - the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment.\nIt made 5 grams of the gas - equivalent to what an astronaut at Mars would need to breathe for roughly 10 minutes.\nNasa's thinking is that future human missions would take scaled-up versions of Moxie with them to the Red Planet rather than try to carry from Earth all the oxygen needed to sustain them.\nOxygen (O\u2082) is also an integral part of the chemistry that propels a rocket. Thrust is achieved by burning a fuel in the presence of an oxidiser, which could be simple oxygen.\nMars' atmosphere is dominated by carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) at a concentration of 96%. Oxygen is only 0.13%, compared with 21% in Earth's atmosphere.\nMoxie is able to strip oxygen atoms from CO\u2082 molecules, which are made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. The waste product is carbon monoxide, which is vented to the Martian atmosphere. \nThe Nasa team behind Moxie is running the unit in different modes to discover how well it works. \nThe expectation is that it can produce up to 10 grams of O\u2082 per hour.\n\u201cMoxie isn\u2019t just the first instrument to produce oxygen on another world, it\u2019s the first technology of its kind that will help future missions 'live off the land', using elements of another world\u2019s environment, also known as in-situ resource utilisation,\u201d said Trudy Kortes, director of technology demonstrations within Nasa\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate.\n\"It\u2019s taking regolith, the substance you find on the ground, and putting it through a processing plant, making it into a large structure, or taking carbon dioxide \u2013 the bulk of the atmosphere \u2013 and converting it into oxygen. This process allows us to convert these abundant materials into useable things: propellant, breathable air, or, combined with hydrogen, water.\"\nNasa will attempt to fly its Ingenuity helicopter again on Thursday.\nThe mini-chopper made history this week by performing the first powered, controlled flight by an aircraft on another world.\nFor its second sortie, the drone will raise itself to 5m above the ground, move sideways by 2m, swivel and take some pictures, before reversing back to the take-off spot to land."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nLabour has called for a \"thorough investigation\" into Boris Johnson's contacts with inventor Sir James Dyson. In texts revealed on Wednesday Mr Johnson said he could \"fix\" tax issues relating to Dyson staff who came to the UK to make ventilators during the pandemic. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the messages between the pair opened up a \"new urgent corridor of inquiry\". While the prime minister \"makes no apology\" for trying to get ventilators for the NHS, Labour said this was part of a pattern of government \"sleaze\" and wants a cross-party investigation with senior MPs \"as soon as possible\". \nFor some learner drivers the wait for a test is over as they resume in parts of the UK - but many have spoken about the difficulties in securing a test date. Tests have been suspended due to Covid restrictions since January, but restart in England and Wales on Thursday. Most centres are currently booked up until August, with a backlog of around 420,000 tests because of the pandemic. We've spoken to Charlotte Dalton, 24, who says test slots were \"like gold dust\" and Jasmin Dhaliwal who saw her January test cancelled and rescheduled.\nIndia is being ravaged by a second wave of Covid, which is accelerating beyond anywhere else in the world.  In the past 24 hours alone, more than 2,000 people have died and nearly 300,000 new cases have been reported in the country. The BBC visited a hospital in Delhi and found people are dying without getting the treatment they need.\nThe Brit Awards will go ahead with a live audience next month, as part of the government's research into how live events might work after the pandemic. The ceremony will take place at London's O2 Arena on 11 May and will be fronted by comedian Jack Whitehall. The 4,000-strong audience won't need to wear masks or be socially distanced, but will need a negative Covid test.

      "text": "More details about a controversial \"VIP\" fast-track route for PPE firms with connections to government have emerged in the High Court. \nOne official complained the procurement team was \"drowning\" in high priority requests without the correct certification or due diligence. \nCampaigners are challenging the government over directly awarding contracts during the pandemic.\nThe government said it worked tirelessly on PPE to protect NHS staff. \nDuring the Covid crisis, the government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply personal protective equipment, which would usually be opened to competing bids.\nCampaign groups The Good Law Project and EveryDoctor have joined together to challenge the government in the courts over the decisions it made in signing several of these deals, which were handled as part of a so-called VIP lane, reserved for leads endorsed by Whitehall officials or politicians.\nDuring an urgent hearing before the High Court, the campaigners' lawyers presented an email from an official working in the PPE sourcing team, which reveal concerns about this \"high priority\" route.\n\"We are currently drowning in VIP requests and 'high priority' contacts that despite all of our work and best efforts do not either hold the correct certification or do not pass due diligence,\" the unnamed official wrote. \nThe email says that an offer that jumped \"to the front of the queue\" had a \"knock on effect to the remaining offers of help\".\nThe BBC has been investigating problems with PPE purchased for NHS staff since last summer. \nOne of the deals being challenged concerns 50 million FFP2 face masks supplied by the firm Ayanda Capital, which now cannot be used in the NHS because of concerns over their fit. \nThe court heard the company was routed through the VIP lane because its representative, Andrew Mills, who had been chasing senior officials for a decision, was an advisor to the government's Board of Trade.\nAyanda Capital told the BBC the firm was not aware of the high priority lane and the allegations of \"cronyism\" around Mr Mills were \"unsustainable\". \nThe BBC has been told that his position played no part in the award of the contract.\nThe Good Law Project and EveryDoctor are also challenging the government over its decision to award contracts to a small Sussex-based pest control firm, Pestfix. \nIn February, the BBC revealed that 17 million high grade FFP3 face masks the company had supplied would not be used as intended because they failed testing. \nLawyers for the campaigners argued that information about the company's links with government was being kept from them because important details in emails had been blacked out by officials.   \nThe government's spending watchdog has previously reported that the firm was put on the VIP lane by mistake. But emails disclosed in court show the company was \"known\" to a senior official in the Department of Health and Social Care via a relative. \nPestfix has previously told the BBC it is proud of its role sourcing PPE to meet the shortages in the NHS during the pandemic. \nA government spokesperson said: \"All PPE procurement went through the same eight-step assurance process and, in conjunction with those checks, due diligence is carried out on every contract and ministers have no involvement in deciding who is awarded them.\"\nUpdate 4 May 2021: Tim Horlick, chief executive of Ayanda Capital, insisted the masks were \"not unusable or unsafe\" and had met all required standards.

We'll have another update for you on Friday morning.\nThe world's highest one-day total of new Covid-19 cases has been recorded in India, amid a shortage of oxygen supplies in the country. Some 314,835 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,104 - an all-time high for the country, which is facing a second wave of the pandemic. Crowds have been forming outside hospitals in major cities, which are filled to capacity. A number of people have died while waiting for oxygen.\nVaccine uptake in over-50s in England has hit 95%, NHS data shows. Among those aged 45-49, take-up is now 59% after vaccinations started being offered to this age group earlier this month. But the percentage of care home workers to receive the jab is still around 80%, despite attempts to get more to come forward.\nAn inquiry into the leak of private messages between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and businessman Sir James Dyson has been announced by No 10. It comes after texts published by the BBC showed the prime minister promising Sir James he would \"fix\" an issue on the tax status of Dyson staff working in the UK during the pandemic. The texts were sent when the government was asking companies, including Dyson, to help supply ventilators at the beginning of the pandemic. Labour has said the messages are part of a pattern of government \"sleaze\", but the PM has said he makes \"no apology\" for trying to get the equipment for the NHS.\nMore than half a million people are now waiting for treatment on NHS waiting lists in Wales, figures suggest. Data published by Stats Wales found that in February waiting lists were at record levels, with 549,353 awaiting treatment or surgery - a 19% rise in a year. This is the equivalent of 17% of the Welsh population. It comes after most non-urgent treatment was postponed in March 2020 to prepare the NHS for an influx of Covid patients. \nThe first person in the UK to receive a coronavirus vaccine outside of clinical trials has called the rollout of the mass vaccination programme \"incredible\". Margaret Keenan, 91, was given the Pfizer-BioNTech jab in December. Speaking during an online chat with NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, she said having the jab was \"the best thing I ever did\". Latest figures show more than 33 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while more than 11 million people have received both doses. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhen can I have a drink or a meal inside a pub or restaurant?

      "tags": "World War One,British Empire,Racism",
      "text": "Boris Johnson said he is \"deeply troubled\" by failures to properly commemorate black and Asian troops who died fighting for the British Empire during World War One.\nSome troops were commemorated collectively or their names were recorded in registers, while their white counterparts had headstones. \nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace apologised in the Commons after a report blamed \"pervasive racism\".\nMr Wallace pledged to \"take action\".\nThe prime minister offered an \"unreserved apology\" over the findings of the review by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\"Our shared duty is to honour and remember all those, wherever they lived and whatever their background, who laid down their lives for our freedoms at the moment of greatest peril,\" he said. \nMr Wallace expressed \"deep regret\" in the House of Commons, as he told MPs there was \"no doubt\" prejudice had played a part in what happened after WWI.\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which is tasked with commemorating those who died in the two world wars, has also apologised over its findings.\nLabour MP David Lammy, who was critical to bringing the matter to light, called it a \"watershed moment\".\nMr Wallace said: \"On behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government both of the time and today, I want to apologise for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation.\n\"Whilst we can't change the past, we can make amends and take action,\" he said.\nHe said there were cases where the commission \"deliberately overlooked evidence\" that would have allowed it to find the names of the dead.\nAnd he said there were examples of officials employing an \"overarching imperial ideology connected to racial and religious differences\" in order to \"divide the dead and treat them unequally in ways that were impossible in Europe\".\nOutlining the next steps, Mr Wallace said the Commonwealth War Graves Commission will: \nMr Wallace also announced a public consultation over plans to waive the visa fee for service personnel from the Commonwealth and Nepal who choose to settle in the UK in order to honour their contribution.\nAn inquiry by the commission was set up following a 2019 Channel 4 documentary, called Unremembered, which was presented by Mr Lammy.\nThe report found that at least 116,000 casualties from WW1, most of whom were of African, Indian or Egyptian origin, \"were not commemorated by name or possibly not commemorated at all\". \nBut that figure could be as high as 350,000, it said.\nIt also cited racist comments such as the governor of a British colony saying in 1923 that: \"The average native... would not understand or appreciate a headstone.\"\nShadow justice secretary Mr Lammy told the BBC that while making the documentary in Kenya and Tanzania, he discovered mass graves in which Africans had been \"dumped with no commemoration whatsoever\".\nHe said it was a travesty that men who served the British Empire were not commemorated properly, but welcomed the report.\n\"I'm just really, really pleased that the dignity that these men deserved - who were dragged from their villages and commandeered to work for the British Empire - that dignity that they deserve in death can be granted to them,\" he said.\nMr Lammy added that work must be done to find their names in archives where that is possible, and to establish how local communities would like them to be commemorated.\nHe also said Commonwealth soldiers should not be \"whitewashed\" out of history books, while Mr Wallace said it was a \"deep regret\" that his own WW1 education had included \"very little about the contribution from the Commonwealth countries and the wider at the time British Empire\".\nHistorian Prof David Olusoga, whose TV company produced Unremembered, told BBC Breakfast that apologies were not enough and resources would need to be committed if the commission was serious about restorative justice.\n\"If the Commonwealth War Graves Commission had set up a committee and discovered that 100,000 white British soldiers lay in mass graves - unmarked, uncommemorated - and the documentation proved that that had been deliberate, what would they do?\" he said.\nSix million soldiers from the British Empire served in WW1.\nBetween 45,000 and 54,000 Asian and African personnel who died in the conflict were \"commemorated unequally\", the commission said.\nThe report concluded that the failure to properly commemorate the individuals was influenced by a scarcity of information, errors inherited from other organisations and the opinions of colonial administrators.\n\"Underpinning all these decisions, however, were the entrenched prejudices, preconceptions and pervasive racism of contemporary imperial attitudes,\" it added.\nThe report picked out an example from 1923 when the governor of the Gold Coast colony, now Ghana, argued for collective memorials rather than individual ones. \nAt a meeting in London, it was said that the governor, F G Guggisberg, said: \"The average native of the Gold Coast would not understand or appreciate a headstone.\"\nIn response, commission employee Arthur Browne said: \"In perhaps two or three hundred years' time, when the native population had reached a higher stage of civilisation, they might then be glad to see that headstones had been erected on the native graves and that the native soldiers had received precisely the same treatment as their white comrades.\"\nThe report said Mr Browne's response showed \"what he may have considered foresight, but one that was explicitly framed by contemporary racial prejudice\".\nThe commission, which was founded in 1917 as the Imperial War Graves Commission, said the events of a century ago were wrong then and were wrong now.\nIts director general, Claire Horton, said: \"We recognise the wrongs of the past and are deeply sorry and will be acting immediately to correct them.\"\nAs part of the commission's work to search for unnamed war dead and those who are potentially not commemorated, it will also look at those who died in World War Two, although it is not thought that inequalities seen in WW1 were as widespread then.\nMs Horton said the report was \"sober\" reading but gave the commission the ability - \"now that we know the numbers and the areas to look\" - to start the searches properly to \"right the wrongs of the past\".\nThe war graves commission was founded with a remit to remember every individual who had died in World War One, regardless of rank, class, religion or race.  \nThe idea of equal treatment was controversial, but it became a cornerstone of remembrance.  \nOutside Europe, however, the commission enacted a policy of extreme discrimination, categorising the fallen as \"white\", \"Indians\" or what it called \"natives\".   \nIn southern Kenya, white soldiers lie beneath named memorials in a well-tended cemetery.  Next door in a scruffy field is where their African comrades are buried - no names, just a general memorial.  \nThe consequence of the commission's failings is not only to do a great injustice to the black and Asian soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought alongside their white European comrades in two world wars, it is to misrepresent our history. \nDo you have a relative who was not properly commemorated?

      "tags": "Racism",
      "text": "All shortlists for senior Church of England posts must include at least one ethnic minority candidate, a report has said.\nIt is one of 47 recommendations made by the Archbishops' Anti-Racism Taskforce, which was established last year after the Black Lives Matter protests.\nIt said the Church has \"an alarmingly retrograde trend\" when it comes to ethnic minority senior bishops. \nFailing to act would have \"devastating effects\" on the future of the Church.\nThe archbishops of Canterbury and York welcomed the report but did not commit to enforcing the recommendation on shortlists.\nIt comes after the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, this week said the Church should not use non-disclosure agreements, following BBC Panorama revelations that they were being used to silence staff complaining of racism.\nThe taskforce examined 25 previous reports on racial justice over the past 36 years and said that despite hundreds of recommendations, the Church had overseen \"decades of inaction\" which \"carry consequences\".\nIt called for annual reporting on recruitment, mandatory training in all dioceses to embed anti-racism practice, and for full-time racial justice officers to be employed in every diocese for a five-year term.\nIt wants to see a plan drawn up to increase representation of minority ethnic people to at least 15% at all levels of governance by 2030, reflecting the proportion of minority ethnic worshippers.\nCurrently, there are just five minority ethnic bishops and nine deans, archdeacons, and senior staff.\nThe most recent figures reveal 93.7% of senior staff in the Church - including bishops, archdeacons and cathedral clergy - were white British. \nAll the proposals have a timetable for action and details of which part of the Church is responsible for delivery.\n\"A failure to act now will be seen as another indication, potentially a last straw for many, that the Church is not serious about racial sin,\" the report said.\nThe taskforce also said statues linked to slavery in churches should be given extra context. \n\"While history should not be hidden, we also do not want to unconditionally celebrate or commemorate people who contributed to or benefitted from the tragedy that was the slave trade,\" the report said.\nLast year, the archbishop of Canterbury said the Church was \"still deeply institutionally racist\".\nHe and the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, welcomed the taskforce's report and said they would implement five of the recommendations \"immediately\".\nThese include establishing a racial justice commission and a racial justice directorate to implement the taskforce's recommendations, and encouraging the General Synod to co-opt 10 ethnic minority candidates to serve as members between 2021-26.\nThey said: \"We hope we will be the generation to halt this cycle of inaction.\"\nIn an interview with Nick Robinson on the Political Thinking podcast, Mr Welby said he was \"committed to contextualisation\" for controversial statues in churches but said \"99.99% will stay\".\nRev Arun Arora, from Durham diocese and taskforce co-chair, said he hoped the report will \"be a watershed moment in the Church's journey towards racial justice\".\nCo-chair Rev Sonia Barron, from Lincoln diocese, said the current culture in the Church \"tolerates certain kinds of racism, and it's therefore essential that that culture changes\".\nShe added: \"There's now a genuine sense of urgency I think, and a need for action, and we cannot let this moment pass.\"\nBut Augustine Tanner-Ihm, who had accused the Church of racism, said he did not think the report would lead to real change.\n\"More reports isn't going to help anything,\" he told BBC News.\n\"Actually, this is a safeguarding issue, not just a 'woke' issue.\"\n\"In the Bible it says judge people by their fruits - what do they produce? \n\"And actually, for over 100 years, the Church hasn't produced any fruit when it comes to race relations, and I don't think it will.\""

      "tags": "Dinosaurs",
      "text": "Scientists have identified a new species of dinosaur from parts of a skeleton found in northern Chile.\nThe creature's remains were unearthed in the Atacama desert - the world's driest - near the city of Copiap\u00f3.\nExperts say the plant-eating titanosaur had a small head and long neck, and an unusually flat back.\nStudies suggest the creature lived in what would then have been a lush landscape of flowering plants, ferns and palm trees.\nA team led by Chilean geologist Carlos Ar\u00e9valo unearthed the remains in the 1990s and carried out research in the 2000s. The findings, published in the journal Cretaceous Research, were made public on Monday.\nThe remains, according to the team, included parts of a humerus, a femur and the ischium, and vertebral elements of the neck and back. They represent a small sub-adult individual, with an estimated length of 6.3m (20ft).\nThe creature was a sauropod, or a long-necked, long-tailed, plant-eating dinosaur. It was found in beds dating from the Late Cretaceous, the last epoch before dinosaurs were wiped out 66 million years ago.\nThe creature has been named Arackar licanantay, which means Atacama bones in the indigenous Kunza language.\nThe remains will eventually be exhibited in Chile's Museum of Natural History. The head of the museum's palaeontology area, David Rubilar, said: \"This represents a relevant milestone for the Chilean palaeontological heritage.\"\nThis is the third dinosaur named from Chile and the third titanosaur from the western side of the Andes in South America, the team said. In 2014, one of biggest dinosaurs ever discovered was unearthed in Argentina, also a titanosaur whose estimated length was more than 37m."

      "tags": "India coronavirus lockdown,India,New Delhi,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "At least two hospitals in the Indian capital of Delhi are running out of oxygen, amid a healthcare crisis gripping several states.\nA number of people have died while waiting for oxygen supplies, and the majority of intensive care beds in Delhi hospitals are full.\nIndia is in the grips of a second wave of Covid infections.\nIt has close to 16 million confirmed infections and registered a record number of cases on Thursday.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is due to hold meetings with the chief ministers of affected states and oxygen manufacturers on Friday.\nIn a tweet labelled \"SOS\" sent out on Friday morning, Max Healthcare said it had been waiting for expected fresh supplies for more than seven hours at two hospitals. It has 700 patients admitted at the two facilities.\nIn recent days, several other hospitals in Delhi had said they had either run out of oxygen or their supplies were dwindling rapidly.\nThree other states - Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana - are also facing a critical shortage of oxygen, while other states like Maharashtra are seeing depleting supplies.\nOn Thursday India recorded the highest one-day tally of new cases anywhere in the world.\nThere were 314,835 new coronavirus cases during the previous 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,104.\nThere have been reports of state authorities stopping oxygen tankers from travelling to other states, according to Delhi television station NDTV. Some facilities have been accused of hoarding their supplies. \nIndian politician, Saurabh Bharadwaj, who is being treated in a Delhi hospital for Covid, posted a plea for help in Hindi on Twitter, saying there were just three hours of oxygen left where he was.\n\"A lot of people are dependent on oxygen and without oxygen, these people will die just like fish die in the absence of water,\" he said. \"This is a time for all to come together to work.\" \nDelhi is known to have among the best healthcare facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the latest surge in cases, says BBC India correspondent Yogita Limaye.\nFamilies are also waiting hours to perform funeral rites, Reuters news agency reports, with at least one Delhi crematorium resorting to building pyres in its car park in order to cope with the numbers arriving. Crematoriums are holding mass cremations, and working day and night in several cities.\n\"During the first phase of coronavirus, the average here was eight to 10. One day it reached 18. But today the situation is very bad. Last night we cremated 78 bodies,\" Jitender Singh Shunty, who runs a crematorium in northeast Delhi, told Reuters.\n\"It is four times more frightful, this coronavirus... Many bodies are around, waiting. We have no place left in the crematorium to cremate them. Very bad times, very bad times,\" he added.\nA doctor working in a government hospital in the south of India, who wished to remain anonymous, said tensions were running high.\n\"Patients are trying to hit doctors,\" they told the BBC. \"They are blaming doctors for everything and even the [hospital] management is also blaming the doctors. It's a stressful environment.\"\n\"We have presently almost used 99% of oxygen ports - only 1% is left. It's a very pathetic situation.\"\nA travel ban has taken effect in the UK for visitors from India. British and Irish citizens will still be allowed to enter the UK but will have to stay in a government-appointed quarantine hotel for ten days.\nCanada and United Arab Emirates (UAE) have temporarily suspended passenger flights, while Singapore has tightened restrictions on travellers from India.  \nSukhbinder Singh, who lives in Leicester in the UK, told the BBC that his mother, 90-year-old Harbans Kaur, died on Wednesday in Delhi after she and seven members of his family tested positive for Covid-19.\nA nursing home refused to admit Ms Kaur without a family member to care for her, but no-one was well enough to do so and she had to stay at home.\n\"After several phone calls and pleading,  I managed to organised the cremation through a charity for my mother, which was carried out with some usual rituals,\" he added. \"But there were no final farewells by family and the memory of her death is very difficult to deal with mentally.\"\nMr Singh's brother and sister-in-law were admitted to hospital in Delhi, and using his contacts in India, he was finally able to secure the medicine and oxygen they needed - although he said he struggled in part because of rising medicine costs due to the black market.\n\"My lower-middle-class family is not rich to afford big private hospital fees and treatment costs. What about poor daily wagers who can't even afford paracetamol?\"\nIn January, the pandemic was comparatively controlled, but since then the situation has gone from bad to worse.\nIndia has seen a rapid rise in case numbers over the past month driven by lax safety protocols, a Hindu festival attended by millions and variants of the virus, including a \"double mutant\" strain.\nPolitical parties have come under criticism for holding huge state election rallies - including one by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - in West Bengal. The government has defended the decision to continue with polling, which is taking place in phases, but India's election body has now banned campaign rallies.\nPrime Minister Modi chaired a high-level meeting on Thursday to discuss the oxygen supply issue. According to a government statement, he was told that an \"elaborate exercise\" is under way, with state governments to identify their needs so they can be supplied with oxygen.\nTo transport oxygen around the country faster, the canisters are being airlifted and put on direct trains, the statement says.\nThere is no national lockdown currently in place, and regions are implementing their own rules.\nDelhi announced a week-long lockdown at the weekend, leaving just government offices and essential services like hospitals, pharmacies and grocers open. \nTougher restrictions have been announced in the worst affected state of Maharashtra, which is India's richest region and home to its financial hub, Mumbai. It has also been a Covid hotspot since the start of the pandemic, accounting for a quarter of India's cases.\nDespite a promising start in January, India's inoculation drive has been lagging.\nSome 130 million doses have so far been administered, but with a population of more than a billion people, it is a small percentage, and the drive has been restricted to health workers, frontline staff, those above the age of 45 and anyone with co-morbidities. \nExperts say India is unlikely to meet its target of covering 250 million people by July.\nFrom 1 May, people above 18 will also be eligible for the vaccine. But there is a shortage of doses, which could slow it down further.\n Are you affected by Covid-19 in India?

      "text": "Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is shutting its two main car factories temporarily due to a shortage of computer chips.\nThe difficulties at Britain's biggest carmaker echo similar problems at other manufacturers, including Ford, who have been hit by a global shortage of chips.\nJLR said there would be a \"limited period\" of closure at its Halewood and Castle Bromwich sites from Monday.\nA mixture of strong demand and Covid shutdowns at chipmakers has also hit phone, TV and video games companies.\nTata-owned JLR said in a statement: \"We have adjusted production schedules for certain vehicles which means that our Castle Bromwich and Halewood manufacturing plants will be operating a limited period of non-production from Monday 26th April.\n\"We are working closely with affected suppliers to resolve the issues and minimise the impact on customer orders wherever possible.\" Production at a third factory, at Solihull, will continue.\nThe Castle Bromwich factory makes the Jaguar XE, XF and F-Type models, and employs about 1,900 people. Halewood makes the Range Rover, Evoque and the Land Rover Discovery Sport, and has about 4,000 workers.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has driven up demand for semiconductor chips for use in electronics such as computers, as people worked from home, and suppliers are struggling to adjust.\nThere has also been a fire at a Japanese company, part of Renesas Electronics, one of the world's biggest makers of semiconductors for the car industry. \nAlso on Thursday, France's Renault warned that the chip shortage was worsening. On Wednesday, carmaker Stellantis, which owns the UK Vauxhall brand, said it would replace digital speedometers with more old-fashioned analogue ones in one of its Peugeot models, as the fallout continues.\nDaimler, General Motors and Volkswagen have all suspended production lines at various times in recent weeks. \nModern cars contain complex electronics and are heavily reliant on semiconductors, which are used in systems ranging from engine management to parking cameras. \nToday's cars are computers on wheels, festooned with electronics such as engine management systems, driver aids, cameras and entertainment gadgets.\nAll of these need semiconductors, and right now the entire industry is struggling to get enough of them. It's fighting the consumer electronics sector for the supplies that are available.\nWhat has made the auto industry particularly vulnerable is its reliance on just-in-time delivery, where parts are brought in when needed, rather than being stockpiled.\nNormally this is seen as the efficient way to do things - but the semiconductor shortage has shown just what can happen when normally well-oiled supply chains seize up.\nFurther disruption over the coming weeks and months is inevitable, because it takes time to ramp up chip production. The question now is what carmakers can do to ensure they aren't caught out by a similar supply squeeze in future."

      "tags": "Asia,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "In early March, India's health minister Harsh Vardhan declared the country was \"in the endgame\" of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMr Vardhan also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership as an \"example to the world in international co-operation\". From January onwards, India had begun shipping doses to foreign countries as part of its much-vaunted \"vaccine diplomacy\".\nMr Vardhan's unbridled optimism was based on a sharp drop in reported infections. Since a peak of more than 93,000 cases per day on average in mid-September, infections had steadily declined. By mid-February, India was counting an average of 11,000 cases a day. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from the disease had slid to below 100.  \nThe euphoria at beating the virus had been building since late last year. Politicians, policy makers and parts of the media believed that India was truly out of the woods. In December, central bank officials announced that India was \"bending the Covid infection curve\". There was evidence, they said, in poetic terms, that the economy was \"breaking out amidst winter's lengthening shadows towards a place in sunlight\". Mr Modi was called a \"vaccine guru\".\nAt the end of February, India's election authorities announced key elections in five states where 186 million people were eligible to vote for 824 seats. Beginning 27 March, the polls would stretch over a month, and in the case of the state of West Bengal, be held in eight phases. Campaigning had begun in full swing, with no safety protocols and social distancing. In mid-March, the cricket board allowed more than 130,000 fans, mostly unmasked, to watch two international cricket games between India and England at the Narendra Modi stadium in Gujarat.\nIn less than a month, things began to unravel. India was in the grips of a devastating second wave of the virus and cities were facing fresh lockdowns. By mid-April, the country was averaging more than 100,000 cases a day. On Sunday, India recorded more than 270,000 cases and over 1,600 deaths, both new single-day records. If the runway infection was not checked, India could be recording more than 2,300 deaths every day by first week of June, according to a report by The Lancet Covid-19 Commission. \nIndia is in now in the grips of a public health emergency. Social media feeds are full with videos of Covid funerals at crowded cemeteries, wailing relatives of the dead outside hospitals, long queues of ambulances carrying gasping patients, mortuaries overflowing with the dead, and patients, sometimes two to a bed, in corridors and lobbies of hospitals. There are frantic calls for help for beds, medicines, oxygen, essential drugs and tests. Drugs are being sold on the black market, and test results are taking days. \"They didn't tell me for three hours that my child is dead,\" a dazed mother says in one video, sitting outside an ICU. Wails of another person outside the intensive care punctuate the silences.  \nEven India's mammoth vaccination effort was now struggling. In the beginning, the rollout had been embroiled in a controversy over the efficacy over a home-grown candidate. Even as the country ramped up the drive and administered more than 100 million doses by last week, vaccine shortages were being reported. Serum Institute of India, the country's - and the world's - biggest vaccine maker said it would not be able to ramp up supplies before June because it didn't have enough money to expand capacity. India placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, because the doses were needed urgently at home, and allowed imports of foreign vaccines. Even oxygen was likely to be imported now to meet the surge in demand. \nMeanwhile, almost in a parallel universe, away from the death and despair, the world's richest cricket tournament was being played behind closed doors every evening, and tens of thousands of people were following their leaders to election rallies and attending the Hindu festival of Kumbh Mela. \"It is beyond surreal, what is happening,\" Shiv Visvanathan, a sociology professor, told me. \nExperts believe the government appears to have completely dropped the ball on the second wave of infections that was about to hit India. \nIn mid-February, Tabassum Barnagarwala, a journalist with the Indian Express newspaper, flagged a seven-fold rise in new cases in parts of Maharashtra and reported that samples from the infected had been sent for genome sequencing to look for imported variants.\nBy the end of the month, the BBC reported the surge and asked whether India was facing a new Covid wave. \"We really don't know what the cause of the surge is. What is worrying is that entire families are getting infected. This is a completely new trend,\" Dr Shyamsunder Nikam, civil surgeon of an affected district in Maharashtra, said at the time. \nExperts now say that crowing about India's exceptionalism in \"beating\" the epidemic - younger population, native immunity, a largely rural population - and declaring victory on the virus turned out to be cruelly premature. \"As is typical in India, official arrogance, hyper-nationalism, populism and an ample dose of bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis,\" said Mihir Sharma, a columnist for Bloomberg.\nIndia's second wave was fuelled by people letting their guard down, attending weddings and social gatherings, and by mixed messaging from the government, allowing political rallies and religious gatherings. With infections declining, fewer people were taking the jabs, slowing down the vaccination drive, which had aimed to inoculate 250 million people by the end of July. In mid-February, Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan, tweeted that India needed to \"accelerate the vaccination drive while the case counts are low\". Nobody quite took notice.\n\"There was a feeling of triumphalism,\" said K Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India. \"Some felt we had achieved herd immunity. Everyone wanted to get back to work. This narrative fell on many receptive ears, and the few voices of caution were not heeded to,\" he said.\nA second wave may have been inevitable, but India could have \"postponed or delayed it and lessened its impact,\" said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology. Like many other countries, India should have begun careful genomic surveillance in January to detect variants, Mr Menon said. Some of these variants could be driving the surge. \"We learnt of new variants in February from reports from Maharashtra. This was initially denied by authorities,\" Mr Menon added. \"This was a significant turning point.\"\nWhat are the lessons of this public health crisis? For one, India should learn not to declare victory over the virus prematurely, and it should put a lid on triumphalism. People should also learn to adapt to short, local lockdowns in the event of the inevitable future spikes of infection. Most epidemiologists predict more waves, given that India is evidently still far away from reaching herd immunity and its vaccination rate remains slow. \n\"We cant freeze human life,\" Professor Reddy said. \"If we can't physically distance in the crowded cities, we can at least make sure everyone wears a proper mask. And wear it properly. That's not a big ask.\""

      "text": "Sports Direct billionaire Mike Ashley has been told by council officials to reinstate the signs on the historic Jenners building in Edinburgh.\nMr Ashley, the current tenant, has three months from when an enforcement notice comes into effect on 14 May.\nA spokesman for Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, who owns the building, said the signs were removed without his authorisation last week.\nMike Ashley's spokeswoman has been asked for comment.\nAnders Krogh Vogdrup - the director of AAA United, that owns the listed Jenners building - told BBC Scotland that although it was technically liable, the removal of the signs had nothing to do with AAA United.\nHe said: \"We are very relieved that the signs will be reinstated.\"\nThere were three Jenners signs on each side of the Princes Street/South St David Street corner building until they were removed.\nBBC Scotland understands one sign might be as old as the building with the other two almost 20 years old.\nNicky Erskine, owner of Edinburgh Rope Access, said his team was asked to take down the gold-coloured lettering and worked for two days to remove it last week.\nHe said it was now being stored on the sixth floor of the department store.\nNeil Gardiner, City of Edinburgh Council's planning convener, said: \"We can confirm that a listed building enforcement notice has been sent to the owner and the tenant of the building.\n\"It requires the lettering to be reinstated in its original positions on the Jenners building.\"\nThe Jenners building has occupied a prime location on Princes Street for 183 years.\nIt was bought by Mr Povlsen - who is one of Scotland's biggest landowners - in 2017, reportedly for \u00a353m.\nThe store is currently operated by the Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, which owns the commercial rights to the Jenners trading name.\nFrasers Group includes Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Evans Cycles.\nIt said it would be quitting the site in May after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement.\nDespite that, the building owners said they would keep it as a department store as well as turning  unused parts of the six-storey building into a hotel.\nThe building owner is currently in advanced talks with a new tenant to move into the department store."

      "tags": "Xi Jinping,Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,COP26,Climate change,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has told a major summit that we are in a \"decisive decade\" for tackling climate change.\nThe US has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by the year 2030. \nThis new target, which was unveiled at a virtual summit of 40 global leaders, essentially doubles their previous promise.\nBut the leaders of India and China, two of the world's biggest emitters, made no new commitments.\n\"Scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade - this is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis,\" President Biden said at the summit's opening address.\n\"We must try to keep the Earth's temperature to an increase of 1.5C. The world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heatwaves and hurricanes - tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods.\"\nHe said there was a moral and economic imperative to immediately act on climate change.\nReferring to America's new carbon-cutting pledge, President Biden added: \"The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting.\n\"The US isn't waiting, we are resolving to take action.\"\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg, who was testifying before Congress on Thursday, challenged world leaders to do more on the climate crisis.\n\"Unlike you, my generation will not give up without a fight,\" she said. \"How long do you honestly believe that people in power will get away with it?\"\nThe UK is playing a critical role this year as president of the crucial COP26 later this year. The government is tasked with achieving agreement in Glasgow when world leaders meet there in November.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson was in ebullient form on his virtual conference address. He assured global leaders that tackling climate change was \"not bunny-hugging\".\nAt the summit, Mr Johnson called President Biden's announcement about cutting US greenhouse gas emissions \"game-changing\".\n\"We can do this together across the world. It's going to mean the richest nations coming together and exceeding the $100bn commitment they already made in 2009,\" he said.\nClimate has been the central focus of the Biden administration's first few months in office. \nAs well as re-joining the Paris climate pact and organising Thursday's summit, the Biden team has been working on a strong pledge to convince the world that they mean business.\nThe fact that President Biden is prepared to go beyond a 50% cut will be a welcome surprise to many scientists and campaigners. \n\"By announcing a bold target of cutting emissions 50-52% below 2005 by the end of the decade, President Biden has met the moment and the urgency that the climate crisis demands,\" said Nathaniel Keohane from the US Environmental Defense Fund.\n\"This target aligns with what the science says is necessary to put the world on the path to a safer climate, and vaults the US into the top tier of world leaders on climate ambition.\"\nBut the new pledge will mean major changes to the American way of life. Coal will have to disappear from the electricity mix, while gas guzzling cars and trucks will have to go electric.\nOthers stepping up with new promises included Canada, Japan and South Korea.\nBut Canada's promise to limit carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 came in for immediate criticism from campaigners.\n\"Canada's new 2030 emissions reduction target is stronger than its previous commitment, but it falls short of what is needed to avoid dangerous levels of warming,\" said Helen Mountford from the World Resources Institute.\n\"Canada's efforts to deliver real action on the ground are welcome, like placing a price on carbon pollution, but the country should aim for a much more ambitious goal than what it put forward today.\"\nMeanwhile, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshide Suga said the country was \"ready to demonstrate its leadership\" on the climate.\nMr Suga said that Japan would reduce emissions by 46% in 2030 compared to 2013 levels. Previously, the country had pledged only a 26% cut in emissions.\nSouth Korea also pledged a new target and said they would stop financing the building of coal-fired power stations overseas.\nBut China made no new pledges but hinted that coal, which is set to grow again as the economy recovers from Covid, will be tackled in the next few years.\n\"We will strictly control the coal-fired power generation projects,\" the country's President Xi Jinping told the gathering.\n\"We will strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th five-year plan period and phase it down in the 15th five-year plan period.\"\nHowever, that's likely to be after 2026.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China will be responsible for around half the growth in coal around the world this year, as economies recover from Covid.\nIndia's Prime Minister Modi stressed that his country's per capita emissions were 60% lower than the global average.\nHe said that lifestyle changes should play a bigger role in limiting climate change. However he made no new promises on curbing emissions.\nPresident Biden's team is also urging countries that have been slow to embrace action on climate change - such as Australia and Brazil - to raise their ambition.\nBrazil and Australia's sceptical approach to the issue had found favour in the Trump White House. But that's no longer the case.\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,US police killings,US race relations,George Floyd death",
      "text": "Hundreds of mourners, including family members and activists, have attended the funeral of a black man who was shot dead by police in Minneapolis.\nDaunte Wright, 20, was killed during a routine traffic stop in the Brooklyn Center suburb of the city on 11 April.\nThe city was already on edge amid the high-profile trial of a white ex-police officer for the death of George Floyd, a black man, last year.\nThat officer, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder on Tuesday.\nThe spate of incidents in Minneapolis has triggered national outrage and widespread protests. They also prompted the US justice department to launch an investigation into the practices and conduct of the city's police department.\nThe investigation will examine whether there has been a pattern \"of unconstitutional or unlawful policing\" in Minneapolis, Attorney General Merrick Garland said earlier this week.\nHundreds of mourners, many wearing facemasks due to the coronavirus pandemic, gathered at a historically black church in the north of the city on Thursday afternoon to remember Mr Wright.\nMourners included the Democratic governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, who issued a proclamation calling for a statewide moment of silence during the first two minutes of Mr Wright's funeral from noon. The edict linked Mr Wright's death to \"deep, systemic racism\".\nThe Reverend Al Sharpton, a veteran civil rights leader, delivered the eulogy at the Shiloh Temple International Ministries, just as he did at Mr Floyd's funeral last year.\nRev Sharpton spoke about the rallying cry \"no justice, no peace\" that has been chanted at civil rights protests for decades. \"It became the chant of our movement,\" he said. \"The absence of justice is the absence of peace.\"\n\"Peace is the presence of justice,\" he continued. \"You can't tell us to shut up and suffer. We must speak up when there is an injustice.\"\nMembers of an armed militia called the Minnesota Freedom Fighters surrounded Mr Wright's parents as they entered the church.\nKatie Wright, Mr Wright's mother, remembered her son as a loving father before she was overcome with emotion and had to cut her tribute short.\n\"My son had a smile that was worth a million dollars. When he walked in the room he lit up the room,\" she told mourners through tears.\n\"I remember when Daunte first became a father - his son was born at 28 weeks so he was premature. The joy that Junior brought to Daunte's life was truly amazing. \n\"He was so happy and so proud, and he always said he couldn't wait to make his son proud. Junior was the joy of his life, he lived for him every single day.\"\nThe Reverend Jesse Jackson, another civil rights leader, attended the funeral, as did Ben Crump, the lawyer representing the families of both Mr Wright and Mr Floyd.\nOn Wednesday hundreds of people attended a public viewing of Mr Wright's open casket, which was covered in red roses at the Shiloh Temple International Ministries.\nTwo prominent congresswomen, Democrats Ilhan Omar and Amy Klobuchar, addressed mourners, too.\nBBC North America correspondent Larry Madowo in Minneapolis\nEvery time I have seen Daunte Wright's mother, Katie, she has been in tears. At his funeral service today, she was overcome with emotion and cut short her tribute.\nAs the civil rights attorney Ben Crump told the church - this is a fraternity that no family wants to belong to. But he said the family of George Floyd had become \"comforters\" for the Wright family. \nThey are all here; united in their grief and outrage. Daunte Wright lies peacefully in his white casket surrounded by roses, a flower that was plucked from his family's garden.\nIn the funeral programme, the 20-year-old's life history is just four paragraphs long. But his elder brother said how proud he was of the man he was becoming. \nPolice said they stopped Mr Wright for having an expired tag on his car licence plate, but then tried to arrest him on an outstanding warrant. Family members say he was racially profiled. \nPolice then released body camera footage that showed Mr Wright fleeing from officers after they told him he was being arrested for an outstanding warrant. \nAs Mr Wright re-entered his car, Officer Potter can be heard shouting \"Taser\" several times before firing a shot.\nThe police claim the officer meant to shoot her Taser, not her gun.\nSince the shooting the officer who killed Mr Wright, Kim Potter, has resigned and been charged with second-degree manslaughter."

      "text": "A police commander who took control after the Manchester Arena attack has described his frustration at being unable to contact emergency services.\nBritish Transport Police (BTP) Insp Ben Dawson was based in a London control room on the night of the explosion. \nInsp Dawson said the control room could not contact other police and ambulance services and his team had to ring 999 and wait in a queue with the public.\nHe told an inquiry the first hour after the bombing was \"absolute chaos\".\nBTP officers were the first emergency responders at the scene after Salman Abedi detonated a device at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017.\nTwenty-two people died and hundreds more were injured.\nThe BTP control room was first made aware of the incident 68 seconds after the explosion.\nGiving evidence to the public inquiry into the atrocity, Insp Dawson said one of his urgent priorities was to speak to his equivalent at Greater Manchester Police (GMP) but he was unable to get through to him. \n\"I didn't manage to speak to him at all throughout the whole incident,\" he said. \n\"I was certainly frustrated. It would have helped a lot.\"\nThe police commander also said his colleagues, who were based in a separate control room in Birmingham, had no direct line for GMP and the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS).\nIn the minutes after the attack, he said his colleagues had to wait in a call queue with the public.\nInsp Dawson told the inquiry there was now a direct phone line set up between BTP and GMP. \nThe hearing was told there was no CCTV link to the control room so Insp Dawson said his main source of information was BTP officers on the ground. \nThe inquiry has previously heard how the GMP Force Duty Officer was overwhelmed during the aftermath of the bombing.\nInsp Dawson said the co-ordination of emergency services \"was not cohesive, in terms of working together\".\n\"We weren't working together as well as we could have done,\" he said.\nHowever, the commander said he believed BTP had done its best to work with other responders and said he felt sufficiently trained for his role. \nThe inquiry chair, Sir John Saunders, asked Insp Dawson whether responding to an attack such as the arena bombing would always be chaos because it was \"such an appalling incident\". \n\"It's the art of turning chaos into an organised response,\" Insp Dawson replied.\n\"That's what we're paid for, that's what were trained for, but it is very, very difficult.\"\nThe inquiry continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Sir James Dyson,Singapore,Dyson,Tax haven,Tax avoidance",
      "text": "High-profile businessman Sir James Dyson has moved his residency back to the UK from Singapore.\nHe now lives primarily in the UK according to filings for his companies, which include his family office.\nSir James had faced criticism after he announced that he would relocate his firm's global head office to Singapore in 2019.\nThis week he was also involved in a controversy over texting Prime Minister Boris Johnson about tax issues.\nA Dyson spokesman declined to comment on Sir James' residence and tax status but did say: \"The structure of the group and the business rationale underpinning it are unaltered.\"\n\"Singapore is, and remains, the global headquarters of Dyson, our leadership team is based here and it is the centre of our sales, engineering and manufacturing operations,\" he said. \nA prominent supporter of Brexit with an estimated fortune of more than $20bn, Sir James was criticised after the announcement in 2019 that Dyson was moving its headquarters to Singapore from Malmesbury in Wiltshire.\nAt the time, the company said just two senior executives would be relocated and no jobs would be lost in the UK as a result of the move.\nSir James has this week been at the centre of a political row in Britain after it was revealed that he texted Boris Johnson in March last year to get assurance that his staff would not face a change in their tax situation if they came to the UK to help make ventilators in response to Covid-19.\nThe texts - seen by the BBC - show Mr Johnson saying he could \"fix\" tax issues relating to Dyson staff who came to the UK to work on the pandemic.\nBut the prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson had abided by the ministerial code, governing conduct in office, and had \"informed officials in a timely manner\" after his contact with Sir James.\nLabour has called for a \"thorough investigation\" into Mr Johnson's contacts with Sir James.\nWhen Sir James announced Dyson would move its global headquarters, he was accused of hypocrisy, after arguing in the run-up to the Brexit referendum that the UK would gain more from leaving the EU than it would lose.\nHowever, in a recent interview with the BBC, he said: \"We're a British company - I've put a lot into this country.\n\"I can't make things here and bring over all the components from the Far East here, assemble them here and then send them back to the Far East. That just doesn't work.\"\nEarlier this month, Dyson announced plans to create 200 new jobs at its research facilities in Malmesbury and Hullavington, Wiltshire.\nThe plans are part of a \u00a32.75bn global investment plan into emerging technologies and products.\nSir James said the end of the UK's transition period with the EU had enabled Dyson to hire the engineering talent it was lacking in the UK.\nFreedom of movement between the UK and EU has ended and the government has introduced a points-based immigration system which it says \"treats all applicants equally, regardless of where they come from\".\nHowever, some argue that UK companies who want to hire from outside the EU are in no better position than before Brexit, while attempts to hire EU workers now face significant costs and administration that did not exist before.\nThe text messages between Sir James Dyson and the PM show his concern about the Statutory Residence Test for his company's ability to help make ventilators.\nThis test is designed to ensure that those working abroad and not paying UK income tax, really do work abroad and have few ties to the UK. \nThey are quite complex, but broadly speaking if total or consecutive days are spent in the UK above some threshold, or if they are spent working, than the worker no longer qualifies for non residence. In the case of a Singapore-resident Briton that would mean earnings incurring a tax rate of up to 45% in the UK rather than up to 22% there. \nSir James is lobbying the PM, that if, as requested by Mr Johnson in mid-March, help is needed making ventilators, then this barrier to spending more time in the UK needs to be set aside. The Dyson owner clearly felt it was a material barrier to his ability to help.\nIn the end, the project did not proceed. JCB did make housings for Dyson's prototypes. But it proved too challenging for a new design to get rigorous medical safety approvals. The project to supply the UK was paused on 24 April. Manufacturers turned to mass manufacture of an existing design.\nBut the government did change the law, with Section 190 of the Finance Bill disregarding working days between March and June 2020 from residence calculations, for those working on treatment, prevention and medical products to deal with the pandemic.\nIt is unclear how many workers benefitted from this provision, at Dyson or elsewhere. Indeed, it might not become clear, even to tax authorities, until that financial year's returns are filed next January."

      "tags": "Russia,Chemical weapons,Alexei Navalny,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "Thousands of people around Russia have joined unauthorised rallies to protest against the detention of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\nThey are calling for Navalny, who has been on hunger strike for weeks, to receive proper medical care. More than 1,000 people were reportedly arrested.\nNavalny,  44, was jailed in February and is demanding medical attention for acute back pain and leg numbness.\nThe largest protest was in Moscow, but others took place in major cities.\nThese included St Petersburg, Vladivostok in the Far East, a number of cities in Siberia, and the central city of Vladimir where Navalny is being held.\nThe opposition had hoped Wednesday's protests would be the largest in years, but reports suggest they have been smaller than those that took place shortly before Navalny was jailed.\nMore than 14,000 people protested in 29 cities, police said. This included 6,000 people who gathered in Moscow.\nBut estimates from monitoring groups tend to far exceed official police figures. One such group, OVD-Info, said more than 1,000 people had been detained nationwide.\n\"This is one of the last gasps of a free Russia,\" one protester told Reuters news agency. \"We came out for Alexei.\"\n\"This is a fight for the future,\" another demonstrator, Andrei Zamyatin, told AFP.\nOthers were less hopeful about the impact the mass action could have. \"I don't think this protest can save Navalny,\" Alexander Butuzov told AFP. \n\"There would need to be at least 200,000 to 300,000 people in the streets,\" he said.\nThe protesters defied stark warnings from the authorities and a heavy police presence in most major cities. \n\"Any aggressive actions by participants in unauthorised public meetings, especially attempts to provoke clashes with law enforcement officials, will be regarded as a threat to public safety and immediately suppressed,\" the interior ministry said earlier this week.\nIn Moscow, riot police urged people to leave the protest area and formed barricades to try and contain the demonstrators' route.\nThey earlier cordoned off the area around Manezh exhibition hall, where Mr Putin addressed both houses of parliament during his annual state of the nation speech.\nIt's hard to tell the size of a rally when crowds are banned from gathering in one place, and that's the point. In Moscow, protesters were constantly diverted by police, as roads were closed. \nFewer came out than in January when Alexei Navalny was arrested - but that's hardly surprising. The price of protesting is rising in Russia: you face a beating, losing your job - at worst, a prison sentence. \nMany of Navalny's supporters who did make it out on Wednesday said they were afraid, but they were passionate: in Moscow, they shouted for Navalny's freedom and they called Vladimir Putin a killer. \nFor once, the police stood back and let them march - no dragging screaming protesters into their vans. \nIn St Petersburg it was different: hundreds were arrested there, some stunned with electric shockers by police. \nTeam Navalny are claiming success. But their goal was to get him released, or at least get him a doctor, and the Kremlin is unlikely to be persuaded by Wednesday's crowds. \nOn Monday, Navalny was moved to a prison hospital where the authorities said his condition was \"satisfactory\". \nThe FSIN prison service added that he was being examined by a doctor daily and had agreed to take vitamins.\nBut Navalny's doctors warned he would \"die within the next few days\" if not given urgent medical attention for his back pain and leg numbness.\nHe started a hunger strike on 31 March in protest at not being able to see his own medical team. His doctors say recent blood test results indicate he could suffer kidney failure and go into cardiac arrest at any moment.\nWestern countries say Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent last August and only narrowly survived. After his transfer to intensive care in Berlin, toxicologists concluded that the poison was Russian weapons-grade Novichok.\nThe West blamed the Russian state for the attack, and Navalny accused President Vladimir Putin directly. The Kremlin denied any involvement and disputed the conclusion about Novichok.\nNavalny was jailed in February for violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for fraud. He says the case is politically motivated.\nThe European Court of Human Rights found violations of justice in the case against him."

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Post Office Ltd,Post offices",
      "text": "A group of 42 sub-postmasters and postmistresses will learn later whether convictions for stealing money will be quashed amid a Post Office IT scandal. \nThey were convicted, with some imprisoned, after the Post Office installed the Horizon computer system in branches.\nThe system was flawed and postmasters and postmistresses have spent years trying to clear their names.\nJudges at the Court of Appeal will deliver their ruling later.\nFollowing the convictions - including theft, fraud and false accounting - some former postmasters went to prison, were shunned by their communities and struggled to secure work.\nSome lost their homes, and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions. Some have since died.\nThey always said the fault was in the computer system, which had been used to manage post office finances since 1999.\nAmong them was Janet Skinner, who ran a post office in Hull. She was imprisoned in 2007 for nine months over a shortfall of \u00a359,000 - a case which she said \"destroyed everything\". Like others, she said she had no idea other sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were being prosecuted and convicted.\nShe was taken away from her two children to go to prison, and - after her release - had a job offer taken away owing to her criminal conviction.\nNow she is waiting for the Appeal Court's verdict. \"I'm so nervous, because I know my life is in the hands of three judges,\" she said.\nJulian Wilson owned and ran the Astwood Bank village post office branch in Worcestershire. He was convicted following a Post Office prosecution in 2008.\nHe died of cancer in 2016, but his widow Karen has been fighting to clear his name.\n\"He couldn't get a job, so I had three jobs. I sold everything he'd ever bought me - my engagement ring, all my jewellery. I didn't tell him,\" she said.\n\"He used to say: 'I feel I have a ball and chain with an anchor around my leg and I'm dragging it over a stormy sea, and I want somebody to cut it free because I am not a criminal.'\"\nIn an earlier ruling, a High Court judge found the Fujitsu-developed\u00a0Horizon\u00a0accounting system contained \"bugs, errors and defects\" and that there was a \"material risk\" shortfalls in branch accounts were caused by the system.\nIn December 2019, the Post Office agreed to pay almost \u00a358m to settle the long-running dispute with more than 500 sub-postmasters and postmistresses affected by the scandal.\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred 51 cases back to the courts. Six people's convictions were overturned last year. \nLater on Friday, following a hearing at the Court of Appeal in March, judges will give a ruling in 42 more cases.\nIn 39 cases, the Post Office did not contest that those involved \"did not or could not have a fair trial\", but in 35 of these cases it did challenge a second element that their convictions were \"an affront to the public conscience\".\nThe Horizon system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. \nBut from an early stage it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. \nHorizon-based evidence was used by the Post Office to successfully prosecute 736 people.\nBut campaigners fought a long and series of legal battles for compensation in the civil courts, which have been followed by referrals by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.\nOthers hoping to have their names cleared include Seema Misra, who was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010.\n\"Prison was my worst nightmare,\" she said.\nAlso waiting for the decision is Jo Hamilton, who was accused by the Post Office of taking \u00a336,000 from the village shop she ran in Hampshire. \nShe had to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. Declaring the criminal record also affected everyday life, such as failing to get car insurance.\nShe made ends meet by doing cleaning jobs for people in her village who did not believe she was guilty. Many of them, including the local vicar, came to support her at her sentencing hearing.\n\"It's just gone on for so long. It's been a massive part of my life,\" she said.\nA Post Office spokesman said: \"We sincerely apologise to the postmasters affected by our historical failures. \n\"Throughout this appeals process we have supported the quashing of the overwhelming majority of these convictions and the judgment will be an important milestone in addressing the past.\""

The explosion also forced the closure of the station as well as the busy Port Authority Bus Terminal.\nThe pipe bomb was made from materials obtained from a nearby construction site, where Ullah had been working as an electrician.\nDuring his trial, prosecutors said Ullah's \"lone wolf\" attack was inspired by IS propaganda, and that he was angry with then-President Donald Trump's foreign policy in the Middle East.\nUllah was convicted in November 2018.\nHis sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for April 2019. However it was delayed by two years, partly due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nUllah was from Bangladesh but moved to the US in 2011.

      "text": "A former veterans minister has hit out at the government as \"the most distrustful, awful environment I've ever worked in\". \nTory MP Johnny Mercer told Times Radio \"almost nobody tells the truth,\" and election pledges had not been delivered. \nIt follows his departure over legal protections for British troops who fought during the conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles.\nNo 10 has pledged action on the issue. \nSpeaking to BBC Newsnight in an interview that will air later on Wednesday, Mr Mercer said Boris Johnson had failed to deliver on promises to protect ex-soldiers who served in Northern Ireland from prosecution. \nHe told the programme he had been \"sacked by text\" after offering to resign at the end of Wednesday, but refusing to go earlier. \nOn Tuesday, a No 10 spokesperson said the PM had \"accepted\" Mr Mercer's resignation.\nLeo Docherty, who replaced Mr Mercer on Wednesday, promised legislation to offer \"protection\" to ex-soldiers who served during the Troubles.\nThey have been excluded from a bill making its way through Parliament which aims to prevent unfounded prosecutions over conflicts overseas. \nThe Overseas Operations Bill, which MPs debated on Wednesday, will only cover conflicts abroad such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nMr Mercer told BBC Newsnight legislation for troops who fought in Northern Ireland had been promised repeatedly but \"has never appeared\".\n\"The government's been promising for a long time this bill. If I thought there was any prospect of that bill coming, I clearly would have stayed,\" he added.\nThe Plymouth Moor View MP said he had asked officials before his departure whether a \"single word had been committed to paper\" and had been told \"no\".\nSpeaking to Times Radio, he said \"nothing has been done\" over the issue of Northern Ireland veterans, despite previous Conservative commitments. \n\"Politics is a question of integrity, this whole trust thing,\" he added. \n\"This is the most distrustful, awful environment I've ever worked in, in government. Almost nobody tells the truth is what I've worked out over the last 36 hours.\n\"I don't think anyone really can get on their high horse about trust and ethics and all the rest of it in politics, because as far as I'm concerned, most of it is a bit of a cesspit\".\nOn Wednesday, the PM's official spokesman said details new legislation for Northern Ireland would be announced \"in the coming weeks\".\n\"There is more to be done on the issue of the Northern Ireland legacy and we are committed to making progress on this as quickly as possible,\" he added.\n\"We are engaging with Northern Ireland parties and the community in Northern Ireland, including victims' groups as well as the Irish government, on the way forward.\""

      "tags": "UK air pollution,Lewisham,Air pollution",
      "text": "A coroner has called for a change in the law after air pollution led to the death of a nine-year-old girl.\nElla Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south-east London, died in 2013.\nAn inquest had found air pollution \"made a material contribution\" to her death. \nCoroner Phillip Barlow said there is \"no safe level of particulate matter\" in the air and called for national pollution limits to be reduced.\nElla was the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as the cause of death on their death certificate, following the inquest ruling by Mr Barlow last December.\nIn a report to prevent future deaths, he said the government should reduce existing legally binding targets for particulate matter pollution to bring them in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.\nResponding to the report, Ella's mother Rosamund Adoo- Kissi-Debrah, called on the government to act on the coroner's recommendations, warning \"children are dying unnecessarily because the government is not doing enough to combat air pollution\". \nIn his report, Mr Barlow called for more information about air pollution and its impact to be made available to the public.\n\"As the parent of a child suffering from severe asthma, I should have been given this information but this did not happen,\" Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said.\n\"Because of a lack of information I did not take the steps to reduce Ella's exposure to air pollution that might have saved her life. I will always live with this regret.\n\"But it is not too late for other children.\"\nProf Stephen Holgate, an expert who gave evidence at Ella's inquest, said the report had \"shone a brilliant white light on the importance\" of the issue of air pollution and called on the government to \"start to treat this with the seriousness that it deserves\". \nHe added: \"If this was happening to water and 40,000 deaths were being brought forward due to poisoning in water, we'd be outside Parliament shouting.\"\nParticulate matter consists of tiny particles known as PM2.5. These have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres across - that is one-four-hundredth of a millimetre, or about 3% of the diameter of a human hair.\nThese particles are so small they can lodge in the lungs and even pass into the bloodstream. There is evidence they can damage blood vessels and organs.\nThe WHO guidelines suggest keeping an average concentration of PM2.5 under 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air (\u00b5g/m3), to prevent increased deaths.\nThe UK limit, based on European Union (EU) recommendations, is a yearly average of 25 \u00b5g/m3.\nAn inquest into Ella's death also found levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) near her home exceeded WHO and EU guidelines.\nClaire Marshall, BBC Environment Correspondent\nThis report is looking at what the government can do to protect people. \nIt is not legally binding but the fact it is so clear in its recommendations will make it much harder for the government to ignore the issue of pollution. \nIt has been described by many experts to me as a \"public health emergency\". \nAs we emerge from lockdown and car use heads towards levels that were seen prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, toxic fumes are on the rise again \nAs Ella's mother Rosamund said to me, the coroner has made the issue \"simple.\" It's about the death of a nine-year-old girl.\nWhat will the government do to prevent this from happening again? \nThe Environment Bill, currently being debated in Parliament, calls for a new target on air pollution to be set before 2022.\nMs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said: \"I invite the government to act now to reduce air pollution. Immediately. Not in eighteen months, not in five years - that's not fast enough.\n\"People are dying from air pollution each year. Action needs to be taken now or more people will simply continue to die.\"\nSarah Woolnough, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said limiting air pollution to WHO guidelines would be \"a game-changer, potentially preventing thousands more families facing the death of a loved one because of air pollution.\"\nShe said children, older people and the 6.5 million people in the UK living with respiratory disease are all at risk from toxic air.\nA government spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts continue to be with Ella's family and friends. \n\"We will carefully consider the recommendations in the report and respond in due course.\n \"We are delivering a \u00a33.8bn plan to clean up transport and tackle NO2 pollution and going further in protecting communities from air pollution, particularly PM2.5 which is especially harmful to human health.\""

      "tags": "Greenhouse gas emissions,Our Planet Now,Carbon dioxide,Extinction,Effects of global warming,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.\nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. \nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nClimate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. \nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. \nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. \nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. \nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. \nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. \nClimate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. \nIf temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:\nCountries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. \nThe UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. \nMany countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nExperts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.\nMajor changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "The government has announced an internal inquiry into the leak of private messages between Boris Johnson and businessman Sir James Dyson.\nTexts published by the BBC showed the prime minister promising Sir James he would \"fix\" an issue on the tax status of Dyson staff working in the UK during the pandemic.\nLabour has said the messages are part of a pattern of government \"sleaze\".\nThe PM said he made \"no apology\" for trying to get ventilators for the NHS.\nAsked about the leaks, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: \"We have instructed the Cabinet Office to look into this.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the issue wasn't about getting hold of ventilators but \"whether those who are well known to the party, the Tory party, friends etc who've got the prime minister's number can access him and ask about tax breaks\".\nHe said people who could access the prime minister directly were in a \"magic circle,\" while others were left \"outside\".\nHe urged the prime minister to \"disclose all of the contacts that he's had\".\nAt the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the government asked companies, including Dyson, to help supply ventilators.\nSir James sought assurance from the Treasury that his workforce would not be hit with extra taxes if they came to the UK to help with the effort. \nHaving failed to get a response, he contacted the prime minister directly via text.\nIn the messages seen by the BBC, Mr Johnson told Sir James: \"[Chancellor] Rishi [Sunak] says it is fixed!! We need you here.\"\nIn a later text Mr Johnson said: \"I am First Lord of the Treasury and you can take it that we are backing you to do what you need.\"\nIn a statement, Sir James said he was \"hugely proud\" of  Dyson's actions in the pandemic.\nHe added that Dyson had not \"any benefit from the project\" and that the company had \"voluntarily covered the \u00a320m of development costs\". \n\"Not one penny was claimed from any government, in any jurisdiction, in relation to Covid-19.\" \nWhen challenged about the texts at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he made \"no apology for moving heaven and earth\" to improve supplies of equipment to treat coronavirus patients.\nMr Johnson said there was \"nothing to conceal about this\" and added that he would share details with MPs.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said No 10 was \"pulling together that information it will be published shortly\".\nThe spokesman did not deny reports that the government's top civil servant Simon Case advised Mr Johnson to change his phone number following concerns that it was too easy for lobbyists and business leaders to contact him\nMeanwhile, Sir Bernard Jenkin, chair of the Liaison Committee - made up of senior MPs - has said they will consider Labour's request to examine the PM's contacts with Dyson."

      "text": "The House of Commons has declared for the first time that genocide is taking place against Uyghurs and others in north-west China. \nMore than a million people are estimated to have been detained at camps in the region of Xinjiang.\nThe motion approved by MPs does not compel the UK to take action, but is a sign of growing discontent towards the Chinese government in Parliament.\nIn response, China said the UK should \"immediately right its wrong moves\".\nTory Sir Iain Duncan Smith heralded the vote as \"a historic moment\", bringing the UK Parliament in line with Holland, Canada and the United States.\nSir Iain was one of five UK parliamentarians sanctioned by China for spreading what it calls \"lies and disinformation\".\nSpeaking in the debate, Nus Ghani - another MP to be targeted by China - said genocide meant intent to \"destroy in whole or in part\" a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\n\"All five criteria of genocide are evidenced as taking place in Xinjiang,\" she said. \nMs Ghani said detainees were subject to \"brutal torture methods, including beatings with metal prods, electric shocks and whips\".\nShe also said women in the Uyghur region were being fitted with birth control devices, adding: \"The Handmaid's Tale is a fairy tale compared to the reproductive rights of Uighur women.\"\n\"This abuse is evidenced by the Chinese government's own data - 2014, over 200,000 birth control devices were inserted in women in Xinjiang. By 2018, this had increased by 60%,\" she said.\nIn a statement, the Chinese embassy to the UK said: \"The unwarranted accusation by a handful of British MPs that there is 'genocide' in Xinjiang is the most preposterous lie of the century, an outrageous insult and affront to the Chinese people, and a gross breach of international law and the basic norms governing international relations.\n\"China strongly opposes the UK's blatant interference in China's internal affairs.\"\nLabour's shadow Foreign Office minister Stephen Kinnock said the party supported the motion arguing that \"genocide can never be met with indifference or inaction\".\nThe government opposed the motion arguing that deeming an event to be a genocide was a matter for \"competent national and international courts after consideration of all the available evidence\".\nDespite government opposition, the motion passed because ministers did not vote against it.\nForeign Office Minister Nigel Adams insisted the UK was \"ramping up pressure\" on Beijing through the United Nations.\nEarlier this year, Canada, the European Union, the UK and the US imposed sanctions on Chinese officials in protest at rights abuses in the country.\nChina has denied allegations of abuse and argued that the camps are a tool to fight terrorism.

      "text": "The Archbishop of Canterbury has urged \"forgiveness and compassion\" for politicians, amid a row over lobbying. \nJustin Welby told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast that morality had more \"bite\" than it used to in politics. \nAnd he told host Nick Robinson \"no 19th Century politician\" would survive today's standards \"for one week\". \nIt comes amid controversy over contacts between senior political figures, including Boris Johnson and former PM David Cameron, and business.\nThe row has sparked a wider debate about standards in public life and the transparency rules followed by current and former politicians. \nDuring an interview to be broadcast on Friday, Archbishop Welby said it was important to hold politicians to moral standards.\nBut he added: \"If you're going to raise standards, you need to have a strong ethic of forgiveness and compassion and understanding,\n\"We have raised our standards and raised our standards and of course it's not right to help out your chums or lobby inappropriately or whatever it happens to be.\"\n\"But the standards now are at a level that no 19th Century politician would have survived for one week. \n\"So, it's not that morality has disappeared; it's that morality has got much more sting and bite than it ever used to.\"\nWarning against a \"golden age myth\" about the behaviour of politicians in the past, he added: \"Let's not pretend that politicians are worse; if anything they're better.\"\nElsewhere in the interview, he said the \"vast majority\" of politicians he speaks to privately are passionate about trying \"to make some good progress\".\n\"Politicians are human beings. If we want perfect politicians we won't have anyone sitting in the House of Commons,\" he added. \n\"We'll never have another prime minister. We can't have a royal family. There's nobody who can rule if we insist they're faultless and flawless. \n\"And when we do that, which we do too often, we lead to hypocrisy and all kinds of things.\"\nYou can download the full podcast on Friday 23 April.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Asia,Mumbai,Maharashtra,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "India has recorded the highest one-day tally of new Covid-19 cases anywhere in the world - and the country's highest number of deaths over 24 hours.  \nIt has close to 16 million confirmed cases, second only to the US.  \nThe country is struggling with a second wave, raising more fears about its overwhelmed health care system.\nCrowds have formed outside hospitals in major cities which are filled to capacity. A number of people have died while waiting for oxygen.\nFamilies are waiting hours to perform funeral rites, Reuters news agency reports, with at least one Delhi crematorium resorting to building pyres in its car park in order to cope with the numbers arriving.\nMeanwhile, some countries are bringing in stricter rules affecting travel to and from India amid fears over the rising cases.\nAustralia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the number of flights between the two countries would be cut, while the UK has added India to a red list, restricting travel and bringing in hotel quarantine for all arrivals from India from Friday morning.\nIndia is struggling to cope with the soaring numbers - it recorded some 314,835 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,104.\nOxygen supply has been a particular problem, with a number of hospitals in the capital Delhi running out entirely on Thursday, according to the city's Deputy Chief Minister, Manish Sisodia. \nNumerous other hospitals are understood to be running dangerously low on supplies, including one treating another Indian politician, Saurabh Bharadwaj.\nDelhi legislature member Mr Bharadwaj posted a plea for help in Hindi on Twitter from his hospital bed, saying there were just three hours of oxygen left.\n\"A lot of people are dependent on oxygen and without oxygen, these people will die just like fish die in the absence of water,\" he said, according to a translation by news channel NDTV. \"This is a time for all to come together to work.\" \nThe crisis worked its way to Delhi's highest court on Wednesday, where judges publicly criticised the central government for its handling of the oxygen crisis in the city.\n\"This is ridiculous. We want to know what the centre is doing with regard to oxygen supply across India,\" the judges said while reading out the verdict in a petition by the owner of six private hospitals.\nOn Thursday, as hospitals warned stocks were rapidly diminishing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting to attempt to end the crisis. He asked officials to find ways to produce more oxygen, while telling states to come down \"heavily\" on anyone hoarding supplies.\nBy Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi\nMy phone is constantly ringing with desperate friends and family asking for help to arrange beds and medicine.  Some I am able to help, and some I can't. \nI personally know of many cases where patients died because they couldn't get oxygen in time. It's heart-breaking for families to hear that the hospital where their loved ones are being treated may soon run out of oxygen. \nEmergency intervention from the government has stopped any big disaster from happening so far, but there is an urgent need to give hospitals enough oxygen so they can sustain the increasing caseload.  \nBut experts are asking why the government allowed the situation to become so dire. The pandemic was under control in January but the lean period was not used to augment healthcare facilities.\nAnd now people are paying a heavy price for it, and we are left with a sense of helplessness all around.\nUnlike last year, no national lockdown has been announced. Instead, regions are implementing their own rules.\nDelhi announced a week-long lockdown at the weekend, leaving just government offices and essential services like hospitals, pharmacies and grocers open.\nThe authorities in the worst affected state of Maharashtra - which was already under a partial lockdown - have announced a series of additional restrictions starting from Thursday evening.\nMaharashtra is India's richest state and home to its financial hub, Mumbai. It has also been a Covid hotspot since the start of the pandemic, accounting for a quarter of India's cases.\nMaharashtra has also reported more deaths from the virus than any other state, with 67,468. India has suffered nearly 185,000 deaths with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University. However, while deaths have been rising, the fatality rate remains relatively low. \nUttar Pradesh, which is also reporting a high caseload, has adopted a more conservative approach, with its high court on Monday ordering a lockdown in five badly affected districts. However, it was put on hold after the government appealed against the decision in the Supreme Court. \nIndia - which has a population of more than a billion people - has so far administered more than 130 million doses but the drive has been restricted to health workers, frontline staff, those above the age of 45 and anyone with co-morbidities. \nFrom 1 May, people above 18 will also be eligible for the vaccine. But a supply crunch, which is already affecting the drive, could slow it down further. \nThe crunch has impacted the Covax programme, which was heavily dependent in India's Serum Institute. It told the BBC it had suffered a shortfall of around 90 million doses after India prioritised its own needs, but says talks are now taking place to resume production.\nPharmaceutical company Pfizer announced it was in ongoing discussions with the Indian government to supply its Covid-19 vaccine to the country at a not-for-profit price, according to Reuters news agency.\nIndia has seen a rapid rise in case numbers over the past month driven by lax safety protocols, a Hindu festival attended by millions and variants of the virus, including a \"double mutant\" strain. It was detected in 61% of samples tested in Maharashtra, according to the National Institute of Virology. \nHuge election rallies - including by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - were also not halted in the state of West Bengal which has been holding elections in phases in recent weeks. The government has defended the decision to continue with the polling. "

      "tags": "Motherwell,Regeneration",
      "text": "Families living in new homes on the former Ravenscraig site in Motherwell have described plans for a major industrial site on their doorstep as a \"monstrosity\".\nAlmost 500 formal objections have been lodged against the proposals, which include a large rail complex for logistics firm Russell Group.\nThe company said the \u00a3200m development would generate hundreds of jobs.\nAnd they said they would take \"every step\" to minimise disruption. \nThe deadline for public responses is Friday. \nThe development would be built on derelict land which was once home to the largest hot strip steel mill in Western Europe.\nLocals have told BBC Scotland the proposed new industrial site would be seven times the size of the local sports complex with 50 lorries passing every hour, frequent freight trains and 12-storey warehouses engulfing the landscape.\nResidents claim they were mis-sold their properties as the original masterplan, approved by North Lanarkshire Council in 2019, promised regeneration to including schools, transport links and a new town centre. \nNetwork engineer Mohammed Zeeshan Siddique moved to the housing development in 2017.\nThe 40-year-old, who is part of the local action group against the plans, said: \"I have a young family with two kids. I decided to live in this area based on the fact we are remote and away from any industrial traffic. Never in a million years would I buy a house in an industrial zone. \n\"We totally object to the proposals. It is going to turn our neighbourhood in to an industrial hub. This will be a monstrosity next to our doors.\n\"I am furious and angry about the change of plans for this area,\" he said.\nRyan moved to the area in February 2017 to bring up his three-year-old son Caleb.\nThe 35-year-old told BBC Scotland: \"The idea that this site would become a large area for families with retail, schools, sports facilities and recreational areas. All of that sounded great and it was an easy decision to move here.\"\nHe continued: \"There have been various regeneration plans over the years but these new plans are a massive deviation. We are now talking about something that is bigger than the biggest warehouses you will find. \nHe said: \"The proposals will see up to 800 HGV movements every day. One every 100 seconds. We are talking about five, six, seven football parks in size. The trains which will enter and leave the site will be three quarters of a kilometre long.\n\"This is a negative move. They are proposing long term damage to the area.\"\nThe site's developer, Ravenscraig Ltd, has been in talks with Russell Group about the plans. \nRavenscraig Ltd is a joint venture comprising Scottish Enterprise, Wilson Bowden Developments and Tata Steel.\nNick Davies, director of Ravenscraig Limited, said: \"Ravenscraig represents one of Europe's largest brownfield sites and we are therefore supportive of proposals which contribute to its regeneration. The proposed scheme from Russell Group would drive real tangible benefits in terms of economic impact and job creation, as well as being a catalyst for other development. \n\"As such, it deserves to be considered on its merits. At the same time, the ongoing mixed use Ravenscraig redevelopment project is progressing, and we are bringing forward a range of further proposals, including employment opportunities, more affordable housing, small scale retail and community facilities.\" \nKenneth Russell, director at Russell Group, said the company remained committed to the proposed development.\nHe said: \"The \u00a3200m investment will create hundreds of high-quality jobs for those living locally at a time of serious economic uncertainty. \n\"In addition, our planned training academy will help ensure that future generations can build careers in logistics as technology changes how we operate.\"\nHe added: \"Of course, we recognise that there is some concern within the local community regarding disruption but can reassure the community that we will take every step to minimise this. For example, we will invest in further traffic signals around the site, while we are already moving towards quieter and more energy efficient operations.\"\nIf planning goes ahead, the project will be completed by early 2026. Construction work could begin later this year.\nA council spokesman said the complex application would take some time to fully assess. When the process is complete, a report will be presented to a meeting of the full council to make a final decision."

      "tags": "Poverty,Marcus Rashford,Tom Kerridge,Free school meals",
      "text": "Marcus Rashford might be a world-class athlete, but he can still see the value in a fish finger sandwich.\nThat's one of the cheap and simple recipe ideas in a project the footballer is launching to help families cook \"pocket friendly\" meals.\nWith chef Tom Kerridge, the England and Manchester United footballer and food poverty campaigner is going to share the basics of making meals.\nMr Rashford said he wanted to make sure no-one \"goes to bed hungry\".\nThe free recipes and online video lessons from this Full Time project will be available each week on Instagram and on recipe cards in supermarkets, schools and food banks.\nThey are aimed at families on a tight budget, but also who might have limited time and no expensive kitchen gadgets or little knowledge of cooking.\n\"This is like learning to ride a bike. This is right at the beginning with stabilisers, this is peeling carrots, peeling potatoes, dicing onions,\" said Mr Kerridge.\nThe celebrity chef, who runs a Michelin-starred restaurant, is ready to raise his game with a recipe for the \"ultimate fish finger sandwich\".\n\"It is one of the first things I learned to cook as a 14-year-old. My mum was at a second job and I would cook tea for my brother, who was 11 years old,\" said Mr Kerridge.\nThere will be a recipe for spaghetti bolognese - which Mr Rashford said was one of his favourite meals.\nThe other contender for top food experience, the footballer said, was his grandmother's cooking. \"It was the best Caribbean food ever - I've just never tasted it again. I've been to Caribbean shops, but it's just not the same.\"\nThere will be 52 budget recipes, with online tutorials, including chicken satay stir fry, chicken pie and broccoli and cauliflower cheese, with Mr Kerridge showing the Manchester United player how to cook. \nIt's about healthy eating, but in a non-preachy and unpretentious way.\n\"A lot of young people are afraid of mistakes,\" said Mr Rashford - who is volunteering his own lack of culinary skills to show it's fine to learn something completely from scratch.\nWhile the footballing world has been convulsed this week by accusations of greed, Mr Rashford is still pursuing his campaign against food poverty.\n\"Is it fair if people go hungry? No, it's not fair. Whether it's a child or an adult, it doesn't change the fact that it's unfair if somebody goes to sleep without eating a meal,\" he said, in a Zoom call.\nIf people are sceptical about whether families are really going hungry, he says they should \"go and do some research and even meet people that are struggling\".\nMr Rashford has been on his own journey with his food campaigns, which he says has shown him the pressures on families.\n\"There was a mother and two boys - and the mother was ill with Covid,\" he said of a family he had come across in London. \n\"And so the 12-year-old was going around his community and washing windows and washing cars for a few pounds, until he had enough to go to the shops and get a meal to put in the microwave, so that his mother and little brother could eat.\"\nMr Rashford said as a child he liked to spend time with his mother when she was cooking, sitting on a stool in the kitchen.\n\"Anything I learned in the house it was from my mum\u2026 I'd always watch her cooking. I'd sit there and just have a nosy basically.\"\nBut not being able to afford food was part of the hardship in his own family growing up.\n\"I remember sometimes at school I'd fall asleep. I just hadn't eaten food and I wasn't awake, so sometimes I'd literally just fall asleep. So I can see how it has an effect on the ability to learn and their ability to concentrate in class.\"\nFree school meals should be extended through the next summer holidays, he said - and he wanted to encourage the take-up of \"healthy start\" vouchers available to low-income families with young children.\nWhen he was young, Mr Rashford's own family used food banks and he was on free school meals - and he wanted to challenge any embarrassment.\n\"I wanted to get rid of that stigma, because it's the most silly thing I've ever heard,\" he said. \"If you're in need of something - the help is there is there to be used.\""

      "text": "Britain's jobs growth is being led by cities and towns in the North and Midlands, according to a report.\nHiring has gathered pace since lockdown started to ease, but the growth is unevenly spread, joint research by the Centre of Cities think-tank and jobs site Indeed found.\nBarnsley and Mansfield have seen the biggest rises in job vacancies, while Aberdeen and Belfast had the lowest.\nThe study analysed vacancies in 63 cities and large towns.\nIt found that in some parts of the country job postings now exceed their pre-pandemic level. Nine cities or towns now have more job vacancies than before the pandemic, led by Barnsley (+21%), Mansfield (20%) and Stoke (17%).\nOther places where postings have recovered least are led by Aberdeen (-53%), Belfast (-39%) and Crawley (-39%). Towns and cities in south east England figured heavily among places at the bottom of the recovery list.\nLondon is among the areas showing the slowest recovery, with job postings in the capital still 26% below their pre-pandemic level. \nElena Magrini, senior analyst at the Centre for Cities, said: \"Places reliant on tourism, aviation and office workers have been particularly hard hit and still have high shares of people who are unemployed or on furlough.\" \nCrawley, for example, is home to Gatwick Airport, which has been hard hit by job cuts due to the coronavirus collapse in air travel.\nMs Magrini added that despite the patchy recovery, there are reasons for optimism. \"Once we have reopened the economy, policy makers need to focus on building back better - growing the economy by creating better paid, higher skilled jobs for people right across the country,\" she said.\nThe improving picture in the North and Midlands was partly driven by the mix of available jobs.\nRecoveries have been strongest in areas with a greater pre-pandemic share of postings in occupations related to the production and distribution of goods, such as manufacturing, driving and stocking, as well as essential services like healthcare, social care and education. \nOn the other hand, places with a higher share of pre-pandemic job opportunities in food and beverage services and hospitality and tourism are lagging behind. \nPawel Adrjan, head of EMEA research at Indeed, said: \"Cities and towns in the North and Midlands have been buoyed by rising manufacturing, distribution, healthcare and education jobs. But at the same time areas reliant on hospitality, tourism and higher paying jobs that can be performed from home have seen only sluggish growth.\n\"We've seen how quickly the jobs market reacts to policy and public health announcements and policy makers will hope the eventual unwinding of Covid-19 restrictions will help level up the jobs recovery.\""

      "tags": "World War One,Tanzania,Malawi",
      "text": "More than one million people died in East Africa during World War One. Some soldiers were forced to fight members of their own families on the battlefield because of the way borders were drawn up by European colonial powers, writes Oswald Masebo. \nI was born and raised in a simple home in the rural district of Ileje about 1,000km from Dar es Salaam, in south-west Tanzania. The district is at the border with Malawi where the hilly plateaus of Ileje and Rungwe districts rise above the plains of Lake Nyasa and Kyela district. \nMy family has made a living from the land of Ileje for generations.  During World War One, Ileje and the surrounding environments became a battle ground between German forces and British allied forces from Malawi. \nAlthough the war began in 1914, it was the battles fought in 1915 and 1916 which were most intense and which had grave consequences to the generation of my great-grandparents. \nTen years ago, I asked my own grandfather Jotam Masebo what he knew about World War One. His recollections remind us of grinding hardship. I quote:\n\"Our parents narrated to us a lot about this war. The timing of the war was bad. It broke at the time when our parents were about to begin planting maize, beans, cassava, groundnut, and potatoes... The fighting created fear and insecurity that disrupted the agricultural production of our parents and led to the most acute famine that killed many people. The fighting killed innocent men, women, and children.\" \nThe fighting at the river Songwe border was particularly notorious because some of the soldiers and carrier corps involved in it were related to enemy soldiers. \nPeople living on both sides of the border lived together as a single community until the notorious Berlin Conference created a boundary to separate the German colony of Tanzania and the British colony of Malawi. The boundaries passed through the middle of these people and divided them. They would come to fight during World War One, representing the interests of their respective colonial masters.\nBBC: Slavery and the Scramble for Africa\nWhy was the first German defeat of WW1 in Africa?\nWas the Western Front the most multi-racial place on Earth?\nWorld War One: The global conflict that defined a century\nOn a recent visit back home and I asked the elders what they know of World War One. \nAn old man known as Ngubhombeleghe Swilla advised me to go to Ngana and  hills to witness look-out posts and machine-gun mounts that still exist today. \nI set out to see them - a day's journey. The leader of Kasumulu village walked with me to a high vantage point on the outskirts of the village where metal structures, now rust into the hillside.  I was astonished to find these remnants of World War One heritage in my region.  \nIt was from here in 1916 that German forces fled to Mozambique. \nAlthough Tanzania was a battleground for World War One, very little is known about the role, position and social identities of Tanzanians who directly participated in the war. \nExisting scholarly narratives focus on German and British military personnel. Yet, oral sources I have collected claim that African men and women played a key role in sustaining the war-related operations in south-west Tanzania.  Kaswashi Pwele of Kapelekesi and Labani Kibona of Isoko  - who I interviewed in 2008 - recounted that Africans were a majority in the German colonial army. They emphasised that the German colonial army was essentially an African army. But they could not tell the exact number of Africans in the army. \nJohn Iliffe's archival research suggests that Germany had about 15,000 soldiers in south-west Tanzania in 1916 out of whom about 3,000 were Germans and the remaining 12,000 were Tanzanians whose names are not recorded. \nThe Tanzanian carrier corps also played a central role in sustaining the war. Their story should be recovered. \nIt is estimated that during the peak of military operations in 1916 the German colonial state conscripted some 45,000 African members of carrier corps.   \nAnd let's not forget the general public of ordinary men and women who grew food such as maize, beans, and cassava. They also raised cattle, goat, sheep, pigs, and chicken. The colonial armies relied on this food to feed soldiers and carrier corps.  Oral recollections tell us Tanzanians did not give out this food willingly. Armies acquired it by force, by looting Tanzanian rural homes and communities. In 1996, Kileke Mwakibinga recalled:\n\"At the time of the war, of 1914, I was still a young boy. But I was watching the entire goings on when the soldiers were passing\u2026 elders were persecuted and persecuted. Others were captured here and there. I was watching all this\u2026 They came and looked for things\u2026 they would enter a house, if they found milk they would just take it. If they saw chicken, they just took them. That is when the Germans were fleeing.\" \nOswald Masebo is Professor of History at the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  \nDar es Salaam - Ubhuche, Invisible Histories of the First World War broadcasts on BBC Radio 3's The Essay: World War One Round the World on Friday 3 July at 22:45. It is part of a global year-long partnership between the British Council, BBC World Service and BBC Radio 3 called The War That Changed the World. You can catch up via iPlayer. \nBoth the German military forces in Tanzania and the invading British forces from Nyasaland and Rhodesia engaged in these barbaric acts of looting food reserves of the generation of my great-grandparents, creating a food shortage which my grandfather spoke about.  \nBut perhaps the most surprising element in this elusive story is a silence of the names and identities of African soldiers and carriers in the oral history itself. \nI find this to be surprising and unique because Tanzanian soldiers and leaders who participated in other military engagements are known and remembered. \nFor example, some of the names and identities of Tanzanians who fought in the Maji Maji wars of resistance in Southern Tanzania from 1905 to 1907 are known and remembered. \nMaji Maji wars were local protests against German colonial exploitation, oppression, and forced cultivation of cotton. The resistance was sparked by a charismatic spiritual leader Kinjekitile Ngwale who claimed to possess medicine which would protect warriors against German bullets, turning them to \"maji\".  Maji is the Kiswahili word for water. Many people died as bullets never changed into water. \nMaji Maji remains a heroic story in Tanzania, which is taught to every young Tanzanian in primary and secondary school. Kinjekitile Ngwale is celebrated and romanticised for his readiness to die in order to preserve the independence, autonomy, and respect of Africans.  The Maji Maji museum in Songea was built to celebrate the heroic lives of soldiers and leaders of the war - it contains narratives, sculptures, and even pictures of these heroes. Each year there is a month-long commemoration of the annual Maji Maji war in that district.\nSo why is the story so different for World War One?  Why are the names and identities of thousands of Tanzanians who served as soldiers and carrier corps unknown? \nPerhaps this is because they were not appreciated by Germany. \nIn some oral accounts Germany even held them responsible for Germany not winning the war. Kaswashi Pwele claimed that \"German military officials blamed Africans for not winning the war. They accused some Africans for lacking loyalty to Germany and for leaking security information to Britain.\" \nBut isn't the key reason for the invisibility of the names and identities of Tanzanian soldiers and carrier corps to be found in the attitude of the British colonial state which took over from the Germans?\nElders told me the British were very suspicious of Africans who had worked for the Germans. Soldiers and carrier corps who served in the German army were the least trusted. \nAccording to the elders, some of these soldiers and carrier corps were deported to Nyasaland.  Some were detained for some years. \nIt was risky to be labelled a pro-German royalist.  It was dangerous.\nAs a coping strategy, many men who had participated in the war on the German side made \"creative adaptations\" by concealing their identities and war experience. \n\"Creative adaptations\" - it's another way to say \"hiding the truth\", perhaps a polite expression for lying.  I have translated creative adaptations from the word ubhuche, in the Ndali language, my mother tongue and the language used by elders I spoke to. \nUbhuche helped people to avoid the dangers of a new colonial regime.  This helped them to live peacefully and to prosper under British colonialism. They also learned to speak negatively about German colonialism, even those who had individually benefited from it.  \nThe silences on the names and identities we see today are probably the result of this creative adaptation of African soldiers and carrier corps to the British colonial regime after the war.\nIt might be too late to interview the eye witnesses but listening closely, creatively, and critically to our elders, we can still hear echoes of the voices of African soldiers, carrier corps, and the larger public during World War One.  \nLet me conclude by reflecting on that visit I made to the south west.   I'm going to make Ubhuche - a Creative Adaptation of my own - I'm going to adapt what I've learnt from research to imagine the invisible stories of World War One.\nStanding in the World War One battlefields at Kasumulu, I could see the River Songwe that the British and German colonisers used to divide our great-grandparents as different people: as either Tanzanians or Malawians. \nI also saw a glimpse of a soldier from a century past, standing with his rifle. Next to him, a carrier with supplies for the colonial army on his head and back. I imagine them as proud men of values. They accepted the war, probably reluctantly, and went to fight against British Malawian soldiers, perhaps their cousins who lived on the other side of the River Songwe. \nThey have no military uniform. They fought in traditional dress.  I know some killed enemies, and some of them died.  And when I think of them, I don't think only of the conflict they fought in, but also the inner conflict that they combated at the end of the war. \nIt's important for me to remember the public too, the impact on my great-grandmother and her children during the war.  I imagine the ordinary men, women, and children in those hills, plains, and along the river. \nThey were full of fear and insecurity, they suffered from acute food shortage, had their houses burned by combatants, they were exhausted by war traumas. \nWomen and children were probably at the highest risk from this global crisis that unfolded in their villages. \nBut I know that just as my people suffered in this war, many also survived and overcame the challenges.  Their creative adaptations, the Ubhuche, helped them to endure and prosper.\nThey may be invisible in the mainstream history. \nLet us not forget them.\nA century after it was built as a German warship, Stephen Evans considered the future for the MV Liemba - now a passenger ferry on Lake Tanganyika.  \nHope yet for African Queen gunboat on Lake Tanganyika\nThis Essay will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on Friday 3 July at 22:45 BST.

      "text": "Senators have grilled Apple and Google in Washington over \"anti-competitive\" behaviour related to their app stores. \nRepresentatives from Tile, Spotify and Match also gave evidence, accusing the two tech firms of charging exorbitant fees and copying their ideas. \nBoth Apple and Google's app stores charge fees of up to 30% for in-app purchases.\nThe two companies said the fees were justified to provide security for users.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel focussed on claims that Apple's App Store and Google's Google Play are anti-competitive. \nSenator Amy Klobuchar said that Apple's App Store was a \"literal monopoly\". \nShe said both stores \"exclude or suppress apps that compete with their own products\" and \"charge excessive fees that affect competition in the app store economy\".\nGoogle Play and the App Store are where the vast majority of apps worldwide are downloaded. \nDevelopers claim that because of a lack of competition Apple and Google can charge extortionate rates. \nThere were also claims that Apple used its App Store to unfairly compete with rivals. \nThe hearing came a day after Apple launched its new product: AirTags. These can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them. \nThe product looks very similar to something already on the market - Tile. \nTile's General Counsel Kirsten Daru said \"We welcome competition but it has to be fair competition and Apple's idea of competing is patently unfair.\" \nShe also accused Apple of preventing Tile from using the technology behind Apple's Find My function, giving AirTags an unfair advantage.\nApple said the product was different. \"We didn't copy Tile's product... It's extremely different to anything else on the market,\" said Apple's Chief Compliance Officer, Kyle Andeer. \nSpotify also accused Apple of using its App Store to charge unfair rates - something Spotify's Head of Global Affairs, Horacio Gutierrez, described as an \"Apple Tax\".\nHe also said that Apple directly competed with Spotify with Apple Music, and the in-app charges had made Spotify less competitive. \n\"They are undercutting us on price,\" he said. \nHe also criticised Apple for having rules that meant they were unable to tell customers that the service was cheaper if it was bought away from the App Store. \nApple said that Spotify had \"been incredibly aggressive when it comes to dealing with artists and creators, and driving a hard bargain\". \nMr Andeer said that \"less than 1% of Spotify users pay a commission to Apple\".\nMatch, which owns Tinder, also criticised Apple and Google for the charges it had to pay. \n\"It is iron-fisted monopoly control,\" said Match General Counsel Jared Sine. \n\"When an industry player has the power to dictate how apps operate, how much they will be forced to pay, and in many cases, if they will even survive, it is a monopoly.\"\nBoth Apple and Google rejected the idea that their app stores were monopolies - and said the charges were fair. \nOn 3 May, Apple and Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, will begin a court case in their dispute over the App Store charges. \nJames Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

      "tags": "Committee on Climate Change,Boris Johnson,Climate change",
      "text": "Radical new climate change commitments will set the UK on course to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035, the UK government has announced.\nHitting the targets would require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy.\nFor the first time, climate law will be extended to cover international aviation and shipping.\nBut Labour said the government had to match \"rhetoric with reality\".\nIt urged Boris Johnson to treat \"the climate emergency as the emergency it is\" and show \"greater ambition\".\nThe prime minister's commitments, which are to become law, bring forward the current target for reducing carbon emissions by 15 years. This would be a world-leading position.\nHomes will need to be much better insulated, and people will be encouraged to drive less and walk and cycle more. Aviation is likely to become more expensive for frequent fliers.\nThe government has accepted the advice of its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) to adopt the emissions cut, which is based on 1990 levels.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic.\nThe UK's new commitments come as US President Joe Biden prepares to stage a climate summit from Washington DC.\nEnvironmentalists welcomed the government's move, but warned that ministers had consistently failed to achieve previous CCC-set targets.\nAnd they insisted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak must show clearly how the transition is to be funded. \nTom Burke, who chairs the environmental think tank E3G, explained what policy changes were needed to achieve the goal: \"The most important thing, I think, is for [the prime minister] to focus his policy around energy efficiency, around wind and solar, and around storage of electricity and the management of the grid,\" he said.\nHowever, he told the BBC's Today programme: \"At the moment, it's... a bit of a Boris blunderbuss and is a huge range of marginal things instead of a concentration of effort on those things that will deliver the most emissions reductions in the fastest time.\"\nLeo Murray of the climate charity Possible called the announcement \"fantastic\", but added: \"We're not on track to meet previous climate commitments and in many ways the government is still failing.\"\nMr Murray said ministers were \"facing both directions at the same time\", as they had scrapped the Green Homes Grant for insulating homes, had not stopped airport expansion and were \"still pushing a \u00a327bn roads budget\".\nThe CCC report accepted by the government says low-carbon investment must scale up to \u00a350bn a year in the UK. But it adds that in time fuel savings from more efficient equipment will cancel out investment costs.\nThe CCC believes around 1% of GDP - national wealth - would need to be spent on shifting away from fossil fuels over 30 years.\nIts chairman, Lord Deben, said previously: \"The implication of this path is clear: the utmost focus is required from government over the next 10 years. \n\"If policy is not scaled up across every sector, if business is not encouraged to invest, if the people of the UK are not engaged in this challenge - the UK will not deliver net zero by 2050. The 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action.\"\nEd Matthew, campaigns director of E3G, said: \"Setting an ambitious emission reduction target would boost the UK's diplomatic drive to persuade other countries to set out ambitious targets of their own.\"\nHe added: \"The UK now has the opportunity to spark a global green industrial revolution, but ultimately its credibility will rest on action.\"\nNet zero means cutting emissions as far as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, tree planting.\nThe government has adopted the new 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut because scientists say this is needed to keep the rise in global temperatures close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nFor Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: \"The character of this government on climate change is now clear: targets without delivery.\n\"So while any strengthening of our targets is the right thing to do, the government can't be trusted to match rhetoric with reality.\"\nHe added: \"We need a government that treats the climate emergency as the emergency it is. That means greater ambition than this government matched with much more decisive action.\"   \nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas commented: \"The most glaring problem [with the plan] is the government's failure to address what's driving the climate crisis: an outdated and exploitative economic system that treats our planet and natural world as peripheral to our lives and, worse, expendable.  \n\"The Prime Minister needs to accompany stronger climate targets with an economic reset to put the health and well-being of people and planet above short-term profit and growth.\"                \nFollow Roger on Twitter."

We need you here.\"\nWhen the businessman sought further reassurance for the tax status of the firm and \"senior individuals\", Mr Johnson replied: \"I am First Lord of the Treasury and you can take it that we are backing you to do what you need.\" \nTwo weeks later, Mr Sunak told a group of MPs that the tax status of people who came to the UK to provide specific help during the pandemic would not be affected.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he made \"no apology for moving heaven and earth\" to persuade businesses to help bolster supplies of equipment and ventilators to treat coronavirus patients. \nHe said he had done the \"right thing\" and that \"any prime minister\" would have done the same in the circumstances. \nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on Mr Johnson to reveal \"how many more Covid contracts he personally fixed\" and publish all personal exchanges on these contracts.\nBut Mr Johnson said there was \"nothing to conceal about this\" and he would share details with MPs.  \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson had abided by the ministerial code, governing conduct in office, and had \"informed officials in a timely manner\" after his contact with Sir James.\nHe added that he did not know when the prime minister would publish his exchanges with Sir James.\nSeparately, it is understood some in government have suggested the prime minister should be less willing to share his personal contact details - but officials have denied that he was told to change his mobile phone number.\nIt was also revealed recently that former Prime Minister David Cameron had contacted several ministers - including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, whom he texted - on behalf of the failed finance firm Greensill Capital.\nSeveral inquiries have been launched looking into the work of lobbyists, whose job it is to influence government policy.\nMr Cameron has denied that he broke any codes of conduct or any government rules on lobbying."

      "tags": "Policing,Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "A US federal investigation has been launched into policing practices in the city of Minneapolis, a day after one of its former officers was convicted of the murder of George Floyd.\nThe justice department will look at whether there has been a pattern \"of unconstitutional or unlawful policing\", Attorney General Merrick Garland said.\nIt follows national outrage over the killing of Mr Floyd by Derek Chauvin.\nThe former officer was convicted of all charges against him on Tuesday.\nChauvin was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest in May 2020. Mr Floyd, an unarmed African American, was pronounced dead an hour later.\nHis death sparked protests across the US and worldwide, and calls for police reform.\nTuesday's verdict has been widely welcomed in a country where police are rarely convicted - if they are charged at all - over deaths in custody.\nBut Mr Garland told reporters the verdict would not \"address potentially systemic policing issues in Minneapolis\".\nThe attorney general said the investigation would \"include a comprehensive review of the Minneapolis Police Department's policies, training, supervision and use-of-force investigations.\"\nIt will also examine \"whether its treatment of those with behavioural health disabilities is unlawful\", while looking at the \"effectiveness of current systems of accountability and whether other mechanisms are needed to ensure constitutional and lawful policing\".\nMr Garland said both the community and law enforcement would have to take part if the investigation were to be a success, and he had already started reaching out to both.\nIf unlawful patterns or practices were found, he promised to issue a public report and bring a civil lawsuit. \nBy Jessica Lussenhop, BBC News, New York\nThis process happened after high-profile deaths of black men at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, as well as in Chicago and Baltimore.  \nAt the end of its investigation, the Department of Justice (DoJ) issues a report that often contains details that the public would otherwise have no access to. They may look at arrest statistics for any evidence of racial bias, or for signs of racism in emails sent between officers. \nThe report leads to an agreement - a consent decree - between the DoJ and the department to fix specific, troublesome practices. \nThe city of Minneapolis could face real, legal consequences if benchmarks laid out in the agreement are not met. \nHowever, the process can be slow, bureaucratic and largely invisible to the community, and sometimes departments operate under federal monitoring for years. \nAnd past experiences show that these agreements do not lead to an end to controversial incidents.\nChauvin will face sentencing in about eight weeks for his conviction. \nHe was found guilty of three counts carrying a combined total of 75 years in prison but Minnesota guidelines recommend sentences be served concurrently, meaning Chauvin would face a maximum of 40 years in prison for the most serious charge, of second-degree murder.\nHowever, sentencing guidelines also recommend less time for offenders like Chauvin with no previous convictions.\nHe is being held in solitary confinement at a maximum-security prison near St Paul, Minnesota. A spokeswoman for the facility told the BBC's US partner CBS News that Chauvin was being kept in isolation for his own safety.\nHe is locked up 23 hours a day in a small cell that contains a bed, a combination toilet and sink, and a tiny shower, according to the New York Times.\nGuards are expected to look in on prisoners every 30 minutes in the cells, which are also monitored by cameras.\nThree other Minneapolis police officers who were involved in Floyd's arrest - Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane - will face trial together in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.\nThe conviction has been hailed as a watershed moment, and welcomed by thousands who took to the streets.\n\"Being able to know there is justice for African American people, just people of colour, period, in this world,\" Philonise Floyd, Mr Floyd's brother, said. \"This is monumental. This is historic. This is a pivotal moment in history.\"\nBut many point to the fact that this is just one case. The fatal shooting of Duante Wright - another unarmed African American man - during a traffic stop on 11 April has once again highlighted the fact that black people are more likely to be shot dead by police in the US than people of other races.\nThe video of Mr Floyd's killing last May prompted outrage around the world, setting off days of demonstrations which spread across the entire US, with reformation of police departments at the heart of protesters' demands.\nFormer President Donald Trump positioned himself as a defender of police, though he also signed an executive order asking law enforcement departments to improve officers' training and create a database to track misconduct.\nHis successor Joe Biden has struck a different tone, welcoming the conviction of Chauvin on Tuesday, saying it \"can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America\"."

      "text": "A prison chaplain has admitted he may have been \"conned\" by a convicted terrorist who seemingly showed remorse for his actions.\nUsman Khan was freed in December 2018 after serving a jail term for funding a training camp abroad.\nLess than a year later, he killed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, at Fishmongers' Hall near London Bridge.\nThe Rev Paul Foster has been giving evidence at the inquests into their deaths at London's Guildhall.\nMr Foster, who worked with prisoners of all faiths, said Khan had engaged positively with programmes looking at his offending and the impact of his crimes.\nHe added: \"[Khan] had conversations with me about wanting to change and make a fresh start - to pay more attention to the ripple effect of his actions.\"\nJonathan Hough QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked: \"Would it have surprised you that, around the time Usman Khan was... engaged in victim awareness, there was intelligence he was trying to radicalise other prisoners?\"\nMr Foster said it would.\nMr Hough also said that, at the time of his release, there was intelligence that Khan might commit an attack.\nMr Foster replied: \"That would be a surprise.\n\"If that intelligence is correct, he was obviously presenting himself in a way that was likely to deceive the likes of myself and others.\"\nHe added: \"I'm open to say I am wrong, and it is possible I have been conned.\"\nMr Foster also said Khan had spoken \"openly and emotionally\" during a discussion session with a victim of crime.\nHe added: \"We were being presented with a lot of positive things about his behaviour - even some of the prisoners were telling me... in one instance a chap lost his son to a murder and Usman was the person at his door offering his condolences and asking if he could help.\"\nThe chaplain described one session with Khan in which he professed \"some shame\" about the impact his crime had on the Muslim community.\n\"He appeared to show remorse for what he had done,\" Mr Foster said.\nNick Armstrong, representing the Merritt family, told the hearing that Khan had been one of about 70 prisoners in the UK categorised as \"high-risk Category A\" - out of a total prison population of 82,000.\nDr Amy Ludlow of Cambridge University, who co-founded the Learning Together programme that organised the November 2019 event, told jurors she had not conducted a risk assessment for the Fishmongers' Hall gathering.\nBut if she had, she would have assessed it as being \"low risk\", which would probably have only led to the same measures that were in place on the day, she said.\nMr Hough told the witness that prison intelligence in 2017 stated that Khan had been the main inmate for radicalising others and had been involved in \"forced conversations\".\nDr Ludlow told the inquests that \"people used to call him high-risk Khan\".\nThe jury also heard that Khan completed a Learning Together creative writing course in 2018 and later that year became a mentor to others.\nIn a research paper titled A Study Of Radicalisation In Modern Europe composed while behind bars, Khan said the root of radicalisation and extremism was down to \"personal injustices and grievances found by individuals on a daily basis\".\nIn the paper, Khan also expressed a \"desire to be part of work that moves people away from radicalisation and extremist behaviour\", Dr Ludlow told the hearing.\nAfter his release from prison, Dr Ludlow stayed in touch with Khan and invited him to the Fishmongers' Hall event.\nJurors saw a text from Khan after she had asked him to \"cheer on\" Learning Together.\n\"Don't worry you'll hear my cheering all the way from Stafford,\" he had replied, making reference to his hometown.\nEmails between Dr Ludlow and Khan's probation manager Kenneth Skelton were also read out.\nIn one, on 22 October 2019, Dr Ludlow wrote that Khan would feel more comfortable if someone travelled with him from Stafford to the Fishmongers' Hall event.\nBut a later email, from a Staffordshire police officer, said that sending two officers on the train with Khan could \"not be justified\".\nIn the end, he travelled down alone and was met when his train arrived in London by others attending the event.\nThe inquest hearing continues."

      "text": "Cuts to humanitarian aid by the UK are a \"tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people\", 200 charities said in a joint statement.\nOrganisations including Save the Children and Oxfam said humanitarian assistance was being reduced by more than \u00a3500m.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes reflected a \"strategic shift\" in UK aid spending.\nHe also said the \u00a318m aid budget given to China will be reduced to \u00a3900,000.\nFollowing the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis,  the chancellor cut the foreign aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of total national income - a reduction of around \u00a34bn.\nThe Foreign Office controls 80% of aid spending - \u00a38bn - and the priorities were set out by Mr Raab in a written statement.\nMore than \u00a31bn will be spent on Covid and global health, \u00a3500m towards tackling climate change and \u00a3400m on getting girls into education. \nMr Raab said it was a \"challenging financial climate\" due to Covid-19, but said the government had sought \"maximum strategic coherence, impact and value for taxpayers' money\".\nBut aid charities said even the priority areas were receiving less than before, and \u00a3500m less was being spent on humanitarian aid.\nThe 200 charities, which also include Christian Aid and Care International, said: \"Today's announcement is a tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people the UK once supported, and for the UK's reputation as a trusted development partner. \n\"The government has not even spared countries ravaged by humanitarian crisis, disease, war and poverty.\"\nKevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, accused the government of \"making cuts with no consideration for the human harm they will cause\" after reducing aid in Yemen, \"the world's biggest humanitarian crisis\".\nThe government announced it was cutting foreign aid last November but it has still to say precisely where the axe will fall. Charities are waiting anxiously to see which programmes will lose funding, and which will survive. \nBut we are getting some indications from government now about its priorities: climate change, Covid and global health, girls' education, supporting open societies, trade and economic development and so on. \nThe numbers announced by the Foreign Office allow charities to calculate how much less will be spent on each area than before. That will help them plan. What these numbers will not do is diminish the controversy. \nMinisters argue the decision to cut aid has been made, it is time to decide how best to make it happen. \nBut aid charities and many MPs - including a goodly number of Conservatives - still oppose the cuts and are working to stop them. Plans for a legal challenge are being considered. \nCritics say the government can't ignore a legally binding target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. \nThe FCDO reckons it can make the cuts without holding a vote to change the law. Campaigners might want a judge to decide who is right. \nFor now, the government is pressing ahead with cuts it says are needed to keep the Treasury in funds for other priorities. \nOf the \u00a38bn, the Foreign Office will give more than \u00a33bn to multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank.\nHalf of all UK bilateral aid will be spent in Africa, a third in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia.\nThe remaining humanitarian aid budget, focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan, is \u00a3906m.\nMr Raab also announced he would cut Foreign Office aid to China by 95%, to \u00a3900,000.\nBut other parts of government, such as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, give more aid to China and have yet to say if they will cut their payments too."

      "text": "People in Wales will be able to have a drink inside a pub or restaurant for the first time in more than than five months from 17 May.\nAll tourist accommodation, indoor entertainment and attractions in Wales are also set to reopen that day, in time for the Spring bank holiday.\nIndoor children's activities and groups of up to 15 adults, like gym classes, have been brought forward to 3 May.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford described it as a \"major reopening of Wales\".\nHe said the relaxation of a number of lockdown rules had been moved forward because of falling Covid rates.\nIt is the first time a proposed date has been given for the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors in Wales.\nIt comes after the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for the industry to be allowed to resume indoor trade on that date - the same as that proposed in England.\nOpposition parties accused Mr Drakeford, the leader of Welsh Labour, of electioneering by changing Covid rules during the Welsh Parliament election campaign.\nMr Drakeford disagreed, saying the move was only because Wales' Covid case rate had fallen to the UK's lowest.\n\"The virus doesn't know there is an election on, and I don't think it would have been right not to have given those indications,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\nThe latest restriction easing comes after previous announcements that any six people can meet outdoors in Wales from Saturday, and dates for gyms and swimming pools being moved forward by two weeks to 3 May.\nMr Drakeford has also confirmed outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants, will be allowed to reopen on Monday - alongside outdoor attractions, organised outdoor activities and wedding receptions or funeral services for up to 30 people outdoors. \nTwo people will also be allowed to visit their loved ones in care homes from Monday.\nGyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can also reopen from 3 May, while people can once again form extended households, allowing two households to bubble up and have contact indoors.\nBy the time indoor hospitality reopens on 17 May, Mr Drakeford anticipates being able to increase the number of people who can attend organised activities, such as wedding receptions, to 30 indoors and 50 outdoors, from the same date.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nPeople in Wales haven't been allowed to buy an alcoholic drink inside a pub or restaurant in Wales since 4 December.\nSo allowing people to do so from 17 May would be similar to the plan in England and Scotland - with up to four people from up to four different households in Wales allowed to meet.\nAlthough, Scotland will be the first in the UK to open its cafes, pubs and restaurants indoors from Monday - but no alcohol can be served. \nPeople in England can already visit the pub or have a meal in a restaurant outside - that could extend to inside from 17 May.\nPubs, bars, cafes and restaurants can welcome customers outdoors in Northern Ireland from 30 April, with restrictions, while people may be allowed to socialise inside from 24 May at the earliest, depending on Covid case rates.\nIt has been a long time coming for Treorchy cafe owner Sara Bailey.\nHot Gossip, like so many other catering businesses in Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been shut for four months.\n\"It seems that things are going well at the moment with Covid cases, so it is time to give us a date to reopen,\" she said. \nFor restaurateur Nataniel Martinez, who runs Le Monde in Cardiff and Penarth's Old Customs House, reopening is a large-scale operation.\n\"The opening of indoor hospitality for us means we can bring back about 120 staff into work,\" he said.\n\"The demand for indoor dining is massive, so we are really looking forward now to getting back to it and reopening all the restaurants.\"\nRhian Davies, owner of the Crown and Sceptre pub\u00a0in Cadoxton in Neath Port Talbot, said there was a \"lot of preparation to do\" before reopening - but added the industry was used to it after months of safety measures last year.\nShe said she accepted closures had been needed: \"I wanted to help the hard working staff of our hospitals and health service... and was happy to do my bit to stop Covid spreading.\"\nThe announcement has been warmly welcomed by UKHospitality, the trade body representing the hospitality sector in Wales.\n\"We have led the calls for earlier reopening and have been advising, consulting and negotiating on the need to help protect jobs and businesses - and the public,\" said Dave Chapman, its director for Wales.\nHe said the announcement \"offers clarity and commercial hope, and reflects positively the medical evidence\".\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK when the Welsh government banned sale of alcohol on the premises of pubs and restaurants on 4 December.\nThen came the pre-Christmas lockdown, shutting all restaurants, pubs and shops, as Wales reported more than 3,000 Covid cases in a day and that the Welsh NHS was struggling to cope. \nNow, Wales has the lowest Covid case rate in the UK - around 15 cases per 100,000 people - with, compared to other UK nations, the highest percentage of its population vaccinated. The number of Covid patients in hospitals in Wales has also dropped to its lowest level.\nWhile there now appears to be a broad consensus on hospitality restrictions, both the Tories and Plaid Cymru have said Mr Drakeford should not be using the televised address for announcements easing restrictions.\nThe Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh Labour leader of \"naked electioneering\" while Plaid Cymru said it was \"completely inappropriate\" for the press conference to be used like this. \nPlaid leader Adam Price, said: \"A Plaid Cymru government would plan for the reopening of indoor hospitality, tourist accommodation, cinemas and other entertainment venues on 17 May. \n\"To put businesses on the best possible footing our first steps in office include providing start up grants for hospitality businesses.\n\"Additional financial support would also be backdated to 26 April for those businesses that cannot viably trade on the basis of outdoor opening alone.\"\nWelcoming the announcement Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said it was \"great news\".\nShe said: \"As a nation we must all work together to ensure the vaccination programme continues and that the lockdowns and closures we've been through never need to return.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said:  \"Labour had ample opportunity to bring forward a roadmap out of lockdown, but refused to do so. \n\"Thanks to the UK's great vaccination story much more detail could have been announced prior to the election period... but Labour chose to play politics instead of adopting the Welsh Conservative roadmap.\"\nMark Reckless, from the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, said: \"This is getting to the point of testing election rules to breaking point. \n\"The Labour leader is using his platform as first minister to make political announcements during an election campaign.\"\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The NI Executive will \"keep looking\" to see if Covid restrictions can be eased faster, First Minister Arlene Foster has said. \nBut she added the effect of restrictions due to be eased will need to be monitored. \nFrom Friday, close contact services such as hairdressers are to reopen and driving tests will resume.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the issue will be kept under review.\nMrs Foster and Ms O'Neill were speaking together at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena in Cookstown on Thursday.\nCompetitive outdoor sport organised by a club or individuals can also resume without spectators and with no more than 100 people participating from Friday.\n\"Most people in Northern Ireland have been very careful,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"They recognise what has been happening throughout this pandemic and I think they know that we have to take things in stages, but they do need hope. And of course we'll keep looking to see if we can move faster.\"\nBut she added transmission rates across Northern Ireland had to be monitored. \nMs O'Neill said there needs to be a \"cautious, steady as you go\" approach. \n\"I think there are better days ahead but we just need people to be careful and cautious,\" she said. \n\"We've always said we'll keep things under review and as soon as we can lift things we will and that remains the case. \nA day before some sectors re-open and the weather is reflecting the public's mood. \nBut while we are upbeat, even excited, health officials are appealing for caution.  \nAs Arlene Foster advised this day last week - \"step out but step out carefully\". \nCoronavirus is still out there and wants to meddle.  The vaccine doesn't mean normality - just yet. \nIn fact two patients who have been vaccinated are in ICU with symptoms.  One has had one jab, the other their second dose. \nI understand that at least one of them has underlying health conditions and clinicians believe the vaccine has prevented their condition from deteriorating.  \nAnd it's worth noting, that that is just two patients out of the nearly 900,000 people who have had one dose of the vaccine and the more than 300,000 who have had both - so it is working.\nAs shutters are pulled up in communities, inside hospitals and heads are down preparing for a possible fourth wave in the autumn. \nLaboratories are at the ready, braced for screening a continuing increase in Covid cases - alarm bells will ring if the Indian or potentially other variants are detected.  \nBut on top of that hospitals are also preparing for a resurgence of flu. \nDoctors reckon we are in for a \"bad flu season.\"  A double whammy where flu and Covid patients could be sitting side by side.  \nCan we prevent flu and Covid-19 from taking hold? Probably not, but continuing to socially distance, wear masks and wash hands and getting vaccinated can determine just how severe outcomes might be. \n\nThe current Reproduction (R) number in Northern Ireland, which measures how quickly the virus is spreading, is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.05, down from 0.95-1.4 the previous week.\nBut the average daily number of new cases being confirmed has risen slightly.\nThe seven-day rolling average of new positive cases is 41 per 100,000 people, up from 38 the previous week.  \nThe report says the \"modest increase\" is particularly in the 0-11 age group, and appears to be stabilising.  \nIt adds that it may be partly due to the return of school and the rollout of testing for close contacts.  \nEarlier, Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said the easing of lockdown restrictions in NI and the Republic of Ireland will not be perfectly aligned. \nThe Irish government is not due to announce relaxations until next month.\nMr Martin told NI business leaders he was in regular contact with Stormont's first and deputy ministers about the pace of reopening.\n\"We keep each other informed,\" he said. \n\"But I don't see perfect alignment or anything in the next number of weeks. There will be some gaps.\"\nHe said this was primarily down to the differences in the speed of vaccination programmes in the two jurisdictions.\n\"We are moving at pace now, and hopefully both north and south can look forward to reopening in a cautious and phased way with restrictions, so long as numbers remain as they are now,\" he added. \nOutdoor visitor attractions in Northern Ireland will also be able to open their doors on Friday for the first time since lockdown was imposed after Christmas. \nStormont ministers agreed to the reopening dates earlier this month. \nOutdoor hospitality businesses and non-essential retail can open on 30 April. \nThe Northern Ireland Prison Service announced on Thursday that in-person visits will re-commence from 4 May. In-person visits have been suspended since just after Christmas. \n\"We will of course remain vigilant to the risk of the virus and this decision will be kept under review,\" said Northern Ireland Prison Service director general Ronnie Armour.\n\"However, I know this decision will be welcome news to the people in our care and their families.\"   \nMeanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann said there were still difficulties in getting information about flight passengers who are crossing the border into Northern Ireland.\nHe said he was still concerned that his department was not getting full data from Passenger Locator Forms completed in the Republic of Ireland.  \n\"Progress has been made, but there is still difficulties in regards to data sharing processes is what I think the minister of foreign affairs referred to recently in a joint meeting with the secretary of state,\" the minister told the health committee.  \n\"One of our protections actually is the small number of indirect or direct international flights that we're currently having to manage, so that is keeping us in a pretty secure place in regards to that.\"\nMrs Foster expressed frustration at the delay, and also revealed that Mr Swann only found out that the so-called Indian variant of the virus was in the Republic of Ireland from media reports.

      "text": "The act of Remembrance takes place every day of the year for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. \nIt works to maintain more than one million headstones and memorials in 154 countries around the world to mark those who died in World War One and World War Two. \nTyne Cot cemetery near the town of Ypres in Belgium is where almost 12,000 soldiers who fought in World War One are buried. \n\"We are probably the world's largest gardener,\" Peter Francis from the Commission says, with staff mowing the equivalent of 1,000 football pitches every week. \nThe headstones are the same size surrounded by uniform lawns and flowers.\nThe Commission says everyone who died is treated equally, adding it \"doesn't matter whether you were killed in battle and awarded a Victoria Cross or whether you died from influenza\". \nThe Commission employs 13,000 staff around the world - many of them locals. Four generations of the Jaradah family have been tending the Gaza cemetery that dates from WW1. \n\"I'm a son of the cemetery,\" Ibrahim, the youngest member of the family, says. \"I've grown up with these men.\"\nMeanwhile it's a husband and wife team, Shadrack Paull and Lusia Axalte, that look after the cemetery at Morogoro in Tanzania. \nBen More Assynt in north-west Scotland is the most remote war grave in the UK. In April 1941 an RAF Anson bomber crashed on the mountain killing all six crew on board. \nThe grave was originally marked with a cairn, a man-made stack of stones, which deteriorated over time. In 2012 they flew in a new granite marker by RAF helicopter to replace the original stones. \nContinuing conflict can make the job of maintaining war graves more difficult. \nHowever, the Commission has recently managed to restore hundreds of graves at Habbaniya war cemetery, west of Baghdad in Iraq. \nThere are 54,000 war dead remembered in Iraq alone. \nWar-torn Yemen is another challenging location. The CWGC was recently informed of vandalism at the Maala cemetery in the south of the country. \nIt says it has already made replacement grave markers, but is waiting for safe access to the site to carry out repairs. \nEncroachment is another problem. In Nairobi farmers have been using the Kariokor cemetery to dry cow hides for sale. \nThe CWGC says it is working with local authorities to find a long-term solution.\nThough each cemetery has familiar themes with gardens and flowers, no two sites are exactly the same. \nPortland stone is often used for the headstones at the large cemeteries in Belgium and France while in Scotland granite is often used. \nIn Turkey the graves are marked with plinths rather than headstones because of the harsher climate.\n\"Remembrance is still a living, breathing process,\" says the CWGC. \nIt recently completed a memorial in Abuja, Nigeria, commemorating more than 2,000 Nigerian nationals who lost their lives serving with Commonwealth forces.  \n All pictures copyright of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission."

      "text": "Researchers say Artificial Intelligence (AI) has for the first time shown that two scribes wrote part of the mysterious ancient Dead Sea Scrolls.\nTests were carried out on the longest text, known as the Great Isaiah Scroll.\nIt was found that probably two unknown individuals had copied down the words using near-identical handwriting.\nThe scrolls, which include the oldest known version of the Bible, have been a source of fascination since their discovery some 70 years ago.\nThe first sets were found by a Bedouin in a cave at Qumran near the Dead Sea in what is now the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nThey contain manuscripts, mostly written in Hebrew as well as Aramaic and Greek, and are believed to date from about the Third Century BC.\nThe Isaiah Scroll is one of some 950 different texts discovered in the 1940s and 50s. It is unique among the scrolls in that its 54 columns are divided into halves, written in an almost uniform style.\nResearchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands examined the Isaiah scroll using \"cutting edge\" pattern recognition and AI. They analysed a single Hebrew letter, aleph, which appears more than 5,000 times in the scroll.\nIn a paper published by scholars Mladen Popovic, Maruf Dhali and Lambert Schomaker, they said they had \"succeeded at extracting the ancient ink traces as they appear on digital images\".\n\"The ancient ink traces relate directly to a person's muscle movement and are person specific,\" they said, using a technique which helped produce evidence that more than one scribe was involved.\n\"[The] likely scenario is [one of] two different scribes working closely together and trying to keep the same style of writing yet revealing themselves, their individuality.\"\nThe researchers said the similarity in handwriting suggested the scribes could have undergone the same training in a school or family, such as \"a father having taught a son to write\".\nThey said the scribes' ability to \"mimic\" the other was so good that until now modern scholars had not been able to distinguish between them."

      "tags": "Personal finance,Personal debt,Klarna",
      "text": "A group of charities has sounded the alarm over the growing use of buy-now-pay-later to buy goods.\nCitizens Advice, a network of legal, money and consumer groups, said many users were getting into debt and struggling to pay for food and bills.\nBuy-now-pay-later (BNPL) is increasingly popular among young people buying online, and at some High Street outlets.\nHowever, Citizens Advice said many consumers regretted using it.\nThe charity network did not want to name BNPL firms, but called for tougher regulation.\nIt found that 45% of 18-to-34 year olds have used the payment option in the last 12 months.\nThe repayment option is often advertised at online checkouts as an easy way of splitting or delaying payments on items such as clothing or electronics, with incentives such as it being \"interest-free\". \nHowever, the charity network said it can be a \"slippery slope into debt\". \nThe charity network said that, overall, 27% of UK adults have used these firms in the last 12 months, rising to 37% of disabled people and 45% of people with a mental health problem. \nThe average person was repaying \u00a363 a month, but CA found almost two-in-five (5.7 million) who have used BNPL in the last year didn't think it was \"proper borrowing\" and six million didn't fully understand what they were signing up for. \nOne consumer who signed up for more than she expected is Sharonjit, whose story was cited  by Citizen's Advice as an example of the trouble people can get into.\nAged 32, she bought \u00a3600 worth of clothes and used a BNPL firm to pay in instalments. She didn't receive the goods and cancelled her payment to the firm while she waited for the issue to be resolved by the retailer. \nShe said: \"The whole thing has been so stressful. I'm constantly on edge. I've just been barraged with calls, emails and letters from a debt collector - all for buying some clothes online.\n\"The firm said they were referring me on to someone and I had no idea it was a debt collector. I had no idea buy-now-pay-later could [hit] my credit score.\n\"I've never had issues shopping this way before. But this time it's like as soon as something went wrong they've washed their hands of me.\"\nAnd the charity warned that four-in-10 of those who've used BNPL in the last 12 months are struggling to repay.\nIt found a quarter of consumers regretted paying using these platforms, with consumers frequently saying they cannot afford repayments or are spending more than they expected.\nCitizens Advice said firms must overhaul their checkout processes and improve affordability checks.\nBoth the Financial Ombudsman Service and Financial Conduct Authority had a greater role to play in the protection of consumers and regulation of the industry, it said.\nAlistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"Buy Now Pay Later borrowing can be like quicksand - easy to unwittingly slip into and much more difficult to get out of. \n\"It shouldn't be possible for people to sign up for credit without realising, and the fact this is happening so often signals that a drastic overhaul is needed. \n\"This industry more than trebled in 2020, and while these products work for many shoppers, the regulator has rightly recognised the potential for harm. It must ensure robust consumer protection keeps pace with changes in how we shop,\" Mr Cromwell said.\nSeveral big - and smaller - names now operate in the fast-growing BNPL market, including Klarna, Clearpay, and Laybuy. PayPal launched a BNPL service last year.\nHowever, firms stress that not all operate to the same standards.\nAlex Marsh, UK head of the one of the most popular BNPL firms, Klarna, said: \"There is now a variety of buy now pay later providers in the market and the findings in this report do not represent the experiences of the more than 12 million consumers who choose to use Klarna's interest free, fee-free services each year. \n\"We make it crystal clear for our consumers at check out that this is a credit product, we perform a credit check each time they use our service, and we are available 24/7 to support the small number of customers who unfortunately find themselves in difficulty.\" \nAnother firm, Openpay, said it had strict rules to protect consumers. Andy Harding, the firm's UK managing director of payments said: \"Openpay has never run a marketing campaign specifically targeting young people and Openpay is never the default payment option at checkout - a practice that can lead to people using BNPL services unwittingly.\"\nHe added that Openpay has a financial hardship policy in place for any customers experiencing financial difficulty, including as a result of the coronavirus pandemic."

      "title": "Deal struck to combat Crown Courts backlog",
      "tags": "Ministry of Justice,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A deal has been struck over emergency funding to combat the unprecedented backlog in criminal trials. \nThe Lord Chief Justice will be able to ask the government for unlimited funding to open up more courtrooms in England and Wales wherever judges are available. \nCurrently, there is a record backlog of almost 58,000 Crown Court cases.\nThis was caused by funding-related delays, which were then exacerbated by the pandemic. \nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \"There will be no limit on the number of days Crown Courts can sit for the next financial year.\n\"As we continue to boost recovery in the courts following the pandemic, this will help them maximise capacity across the justice system and safely hold as many hearings as possible over the coming year.\"\nThe backlog has been growing by about 1,000 cases a month - meaning some suspects and victims are waiting until 2023 for prosecutions to be heard. \nBarristers are now predicting some of these trials may not be heard until 2024 unless there is a massive increase in court availability.   \nSenior judges fear fewer cases will reach a conclusion - with either a conviction or an acquittal, as evidence is compromised by the passage of time or the loss of confidence from victims and witnesses. \nIf you want to know what it feels like to wait for justice for a serious crime, consider the limbo that \"Jenny\" finds herself in. \nFor legal reasons, the BBC is not revealing any details of the case but, put briefly, she quietly and secretly coped for years with having been the victim of serious sexual violence. When the #MeToo movement took hold, she decided that she too had to speak out. \nIn 2018 detectives video-recorded Jenny's allegations and, after a long and complex investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded last summer that her abuser should be charged with serious offences. \nJenny agreed not to begin deep trauma therapy because it may affect her evidence in court. \nLast autumn, she learned when her abuser would face trial - and she was devastated. \n\"The first court hearing and second court hearing were really close to each other. And so that gave me some faith, I thought it's taken this long to get to this point. But actually, maybe this next bit isn't going to be as long. \n\"I was asked... to provide dates of availability for court for the next nine months. So I thought, it's just another nine months. I can do this. And then I got the call - and they gave me the date. It was 2022.\" \nRead more on the long wait for justice.\nThe deal increases the number of \"sitting days\" that will be funded for the next financial year in England and Wales. \nSitting days are the number of occasions that each specific courtroom is open and fully-managed by staff and a judge, so that it can hear cases. \nIn 2010, there were 110,000 Crown Court sitting days. The courts budget was then cut, following decisions by the then coalition government. \nOn the eve of the pandemic, sitting days had reached a low of 86,000 meaning that only 45% of available space - about 200 courtrooms - was being used. \nIt's not clear in practice how many extra court sitting days will be achievable because of the challenges of social distancing - meaning the plan may initially struggle to make a dent in the massive backlog. \nThere are now 300 Covid-safe courtrooms open for jury trials, plus 120 extra spaces for hearings and an additional 60 temporary so-called \"Nightingale Courts\" to further ease the pressure. Thirty of those Nightingales can hold jury trials. \nBut tens of courtrooms across England and Wales remain locked and completely unusable because they are too small to accommodate all the people required for a prosecution to progress. \nSecondly, social distancing guidance restricts the number of defendants who can be safely held in each building. That problem has become so acute that two separate courtrooms in Manchester are being knocked into one to allow major gang trials to progress. \nThe plan is also dependent on the availability of part-time judges. \nThese are experienced lawyers who take time out from their work to sit as a judge instead. \nThese fee-paid judges are a critical part of the criminal justice system. \nFunding to pay for their work was halved in the two years to the eve of the pandemic - and with backlogs now so high, it is unclear how many eligible lawyers will be able to find the time to pick up the work. \nLabour has called for a guaranteed 120,000 sitting days - a third higher than at present. \nShadow Justice Secretary David Lammy said: \"The government turned its back on victims of crime by allowing the Crown Court backlog to reach more than 57,000 cases for the very first time. \n\"A decade of Conservative cuts to courts, sitting days and the whole justice system allowed the backlog to grow to a staggering 39,000 cases, even before the pandemic began.\"\nJames Mulholland QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association - the body that represents criminal barristers, said the statistics showed that only a doubling of the extra capacity would tackle the backlog. \n\"It is obvious that there should be no limit to Crown Court sitting days this year in order to maximise the volume of cases travelling through the courts. It would be far more reassuring if a firm commitment was made right into 2023. \n\"There will be concerns, once again, that Government takes, at best, half measures and refuses to address the problem by opening more courts rather than taking an axe to the fundamentals of the justice system there to protect the public.\""

      "title": "Ex-UVF man warns against joining paramilitary gangs",
      "text": "A former loyalist paramilitary has warned of the dangers of teenagers getting involved in violence and joining groups such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA).\nNow in his 20s, he said he was \"groomed\" with alcohol to help persuade him to join the youth wing of the UVF.\nIt happened during the flag protests in Belfast in 2013.\nMartin, not his real name, said he regretted becoming involved.\nAfter watching teenagers as young 13 become involved in recent rioting, he said he feared there was a danger of history repeating itself.\n\"Kids need to be aware the effect it has on their lives. It might seem fun, it might seem like you are doing a good thing. But it's not worth it. \n\"These men are getting you out on the street to fight for their cause, to do their dirty work, but there isn't a cause any more.\"\nMartin discovered the only way to escape the organisation was by leaving the country or going to prison.\nA recent leaked security assessment estimated that there were about 12,500 members of loyalist paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.\nAn assessment of paramilitary groups carried out for the Northern Ireland Office in 2015 made it clear that in spite of their ceasefires, the UVF and the UDA were still involved in recruitment. \nMartin said he decided to speak out after recently seeing a video posted on social media of loyalist rioting in north Belfast.\nIn the video an older man can be heard swearing at teenagers and ordering them not to run as the police arrive.\nHe said it reminded him of the grip the older men have on the young people.\n\"I got caught up in it and it ruined my life. I don't want it to happen to others.\"\nMartin was in his mid-teens when he joined the YCV (Young Citizen Volunteers), the youth wing of the UVF. \nIt was during the time of the flag protests almost a decade ago, when loyalists protested at Belfast City Council's decision to no longer fly the union flag every day.\nAlthough still at school, he said he spent the weekends drinking and mixing with the wrong crowd.\n\"One of the older boys said 'you probably know what I do, you probably know what I'm involved in',\" he recalled.\n\"He asked me if I would like to join.\"\nThe next day, he was taken to a house and sworn into the YCV.\n\"I got brought into a room with a pile of masked men. They were armed,\" he said.\n\"There was a union jack on the table. There was a fella sitting at the table and he said 'repeat after me' (an oath). That's what I did.\n\"I was then involved in the riots over the union flag. I was involved in putting paedophiles out of their house and beating them.\"\nMartin also says he was involved in intimidation, including throwing bricks through the windows of homes.\nHe said he felt like he was \"living a lie\" by hiding the reality from his family and friends.\n\"I regret it, big time. It's haunted me, affected my mental health, it's ruined my social life, put a strain on day-to-day life. \n\"I thought I could get out at 18 but that wasn't the case.  Once you turn 18 that's you\u2026 you automatically go into the UVF itself.\n\"I tried to leave but these people make up any excuse for you not to go - like 'you haven't been involved enough, you haven't done enough for us'. \nMartin said it was impossible to say no to the leaders because he knew what they were capable of.\nHis advice to teenagers in loyalist areas is: \"Stay away from these people. You are putting your livelihood and your career at risk. Being in these things, there is no way out.\"\nHe said young people from a Catholic background probably had a similar experience.\n\"Both communities and their kids are in danger of getting entangled in this mess,\" he said.\n\"I'm no longer that single-minded bigoted child that I once was. We all bleed the same.\"\nMartin says paramilitaries exploit weaknesses in communities.\nHis broken family life meant he was easily groomed by the paramilitaries and keen to \"feel part of something\".\nMartin said he was trying to turn his life around. His said he feared more young people were now making the mistakes which he made.\nFormer senior police officer, Jim Gamble, said Martin's experience was a form a \"radicalisation\", in which paramilitaries target people who they feel they can recruit.\n\"This could easily be someone being gang-affiliated in London, this could easily be someone who is so vulnerable that people are opening pathways to harm through radicalisation, capitalising on their isolation and the way they feel,\" he said.\nMr Gamble, who is also a former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, said the Stormont executive needs to do more to tackle the problem.\n\"We have got to look at how we spend our money,\" he said.\n\"We've got to make sure it gets to the front line. It's got to be real, it's got to reach children and young people.\n\"Give children a pathway to hope, where they can learn, live, grow and the community will then thrive.\""

      "tags": "GCSEs,NI education,A-levels",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's children's commissioner has said she is furious at the approach taken by some schools to assess grades for GCSE, AS and A-level students.\nKoulla Yiasouma said she was disappointed by \"the overuse of controlled assessments in test conditions\" reported to her office.\nSummer exams have been cancelled this year due to the Covid-19 crisis.\nBut many schools are using assessments to help determine final grades.\nThis follows advice from examination board CCEA.\nThe commissioner said the challenges faced by teenagers undergoing these assessments after a three-month lockdown should not be underestimated.\nSome schools are using three assessments per subject, which means GCSE students could have up to 30 controlled assessments, she added.\nThe commissioner had urged the education minister to cancel exams in November because of the continuous pressure of assessments on teenagers due to the uncertainty of the pandemic.\n\"For some young people these assessments began after Easter and many have come to us to say they are doing three controlled assessment resources per subject,\" she said.\n\"They have missed nine months of education. I don't question the motivation of schools that want to do what is best for their young people but some have not been as flexible as I would have expected.\n\"I am furious, but the resilience these young people have shown is extraordinary. I am in awe of these children.\"\nCCEA has provided schools with optional test papers, which include question papers and mark schemes, that may be used as evidence for grades.\nSchools have been advised, though, that at least one assessment resource should be used per qualification under \"high control conditions\" where possible.\nCCEA advises that these question papers should be stored securely but \"are not to be seen as high stakes assessments but rather viewed as materials which could form part of the evidence used to inform Centre Determined Grades\".\nThe assessment resources will be marked by teachers.\nOther evidence that may be submitted to determine grades includes coursework, previous class assessments and class work.\nPresident of the Secondary Students' Union of NI and A-level pupil Cormac Savage said GCSE and A-level students felt \"duped\" to learn work done during lockdown may not count towards their final results.\nHe said they had been \"failed\" once again after the controversy with the grades algorithm in 2020.\nCormac said controlled assessments were having an \"immense\" negative mental health impact on some pupils, some of whom, he said, were taking up to 30 assessment tests. \nHe added that students had been \"breaking their backs\" to achieve good grades while schools were closed, believing exams had been cancelled.\n\"We were told by the minister for education to work really hard over lockdown and were given the impression the work we were doing would be used to predict our grades,\" he said. \nBoth CCEA and the Department of Education have highlighted that the assessment resources are \"optional\" with flexibility in how evidence is gathered.\nCCEA said there was \"no pressure or requirement from CCEA to complete any particular form of assessment\".\n\"CCEA has provided resources to help teachers gather evidence to reach their centre determined grades,\" it said in a statement.\n\"However, schools have complete flexibility to use other evidence that they consider is most appropriate for their context.\"\nThe Department for Education said there was no requirement for all learners to take multiple assessments in every subject.\n\"Where a school chooses to use the assessment resources, these can be adapted to provide learners with an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding in relation to what they have been taught,\" said a spokesperson.\nAS-level student Niamh Carroll said she believed the disparity in approach between schools was \"deeply unfair\".\n\"I am doing far more exams that I had expected and my social media feed is full of young people upset about the stress they are under because of this,\" she said.\n\"Some students are being given much more time than others to prepare. Every school seems to be using different levels of examination. Is it equitable?\n\"I am afraid this is going to affect my chance of getting into university but the worst thing is there is nothing I can do about it.\"\nAS-level student Morgan Shuttleworth said he underwent a lengthy assessment within days of returning to school after months of home-schooling.\n\"Exam stress is normal but this uncertainty is causing students massive anxiety,\" he said, adding that students felt \"pushed to their limits\".\n\"It doesn't matter how many qualifications you have, if your mental health is poor that's a bigger issue\". \n\"Lockdown was hard enough, sitting exams in the first week back was insane.\"\nSeveral parents spoken to BBC News NI about their concerns over the current assessments.\nOne parent, who asked not to be named, said the GCSE assessments their teenager had to do were examinations in \"everything but name\".\n\"As if children haven't been put through enough, now schools are doing more tests than if they had been allowed to do GCSEs.\"\nAnother parent said their child, an A-level student, had been extremely stressed to be asked to sit six \"exams\" on the return to school following the three-month lockdown.\n\"Despite promises from our education minster of no exams, schools, fuelled by awarding boards like CCEA, are pushing our young people in what they are calling 'assessments' which are exams by another name. \n\"This needs to be taken more seriously.\n\"Why is the primary focus of our schools on assessment rather than teaching after more than three months of not being in school?\"\nNot all students are unhappy with the assessment process.\nGCSE student Enda Clarke said he was happy about the cancellation of exams despite the work put into preparation.\nHe said he felt like he had been \"on holiday\" for the past year.\n\"It felt pretty good, I think overall we're getting it quite easy.\""

      "tags": "Edinburgh,Music",
      "text": "Former Bay City Rollers frontman Les McKeown has died aged 65, his family has told the BBC.\nThe Scottish pop singer fronted the Edinburgh band during their most successful period in the 1970s.\nThey had hits with tracks like I Only Wanna Be With You, Bye Bye Baby, Shang-a-Lang and Give a Little Love.\nHis family announced online on Thursday that he had died suddenly at his home on Tuesday.\nBay City Rollers became tartan-clad sensations in the UK and US in the 1970s. They were hugely successful, selling more than 120 million records.\n\"They were adorable. Five cute guys at once. That's the story of rock n roll,\" US journalist Danny Fields told the BBC.\n\"The invention of boy bands became an industry thanks to the Bay City Rollers.\"\nThe group got together in the early 70s and found their name by throwing a dart at a map - it landed on Bay City near Michigan, according to the Official Charts Company.\nTheir first single was Keep On Dancing in 1971, and they had two number one hits in 1975 with Bye Bye Baby and Give A Little Love, plus chart-topping albums with Rollin' in 1974 and 1975's Once Upon A Star.\nMcKeown said the band's first pair of tartan trousers were inspired by a picture on a birthday card and were made by his father, who was a tailor.\nThe vocalist, who left school aged 15 and joined a band called Threshold, went on to join the Bay City Rollers aged 18 in 1973.\nHe left in 1978, as the band decided to go in a more new-wave direction under the new name The Rollers, but he later rejoined for several comeback tours and live recordings.\nRecalling the 1975 tour 40 years later, McKeown said it was \"crazy\".\n\"We would go on and the police would make us stop because they just could not control the crowd,\" he said.\nWhen he was on a rare visit home to Edinburgh, McKeown - just 20 at the time - ran over and killed a 76-year-old woman.\nThe day after the accident McKeown rejoined the tour.\nHe said: \"I can remember just being in complete shock. I don't know how long it took me to come out of that shock.\n\"In retrospect I should have dealt with the issue in a much more comprehensive way.\"\nDespite some witnesses claiming McKeown was driving too fast, a court cleared him of the more serious charge and instead found him of guilty of reckless driving. He was fined \u00a3100 and banned from driving for a year.\nMcKeown claimed in numerous interviews that the guilt over the incident never left him, and was a big part of his alcoholism, as the Rollers' popularity waned dramatically in the late 1970s. He was also open in interviews about his trips to rehab. \nLes McKeown and the Bay City Rollers provided part of the soundtrack to a particular chapter in Scotland's modern history.\nAt the height of their success in the mid 1970s, the Bay City Rollers were the biggest pop sensation Scotland had ever seen.\nTheir brand of bubblegum pop won fans across the world and they were unashamedly Scottish. \nThis was a time when few Scottish musicians became international stars other than traditional favourites like Andy Stewart or the Alexander Brothers.\nThe pop music Scottish children and teenagers loved was often from England or America. Outside Scotland, the Rollers were what we would now call brand ambassadors for their country.\nIt can seem preposterous to draw parallels between bubblegum pop, national identity or politics but perhaps there are some.\nThe Rollers loved their tartan at a time when many younger Scots associated it with an older generation or the sentimental, \"kailyard\" image of the country.\nThe peak of their success in the mid 70s coincided with a time when there was intense debate over Scotland's political future - a debate, at times, emboldened by a new self-confidence. Many assumed devolution in the form of a Scottish Assembly in Edinburgh was inevitable.\nBut like so many teen sensations, their success did not last.\nThe decline of the Rollers came around the same time as Scotland's humiliation in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. A year later the plan for a Scottish Assembly failed to win sufficient support in a referendum.\nMusic can be the soundtrack to history. The Bay City Rollers unintentionally provided part of the playlist.\nAfter he left the band, McKeown formed the pop group Egotrip, and released a solo album All Washed Up in 1979.\nHe toured more recently under the name Les McKeown's Bay City Rollers. They had been mid-way through a tour in Toronto as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, and had to return home quickly. The tour had been rebooked for November 2021.\nMcKeown told the Edinburgh Evening News last August that during lockdown he had \"never had so much time off\", and was usually always on the road for half of the year.\nCelebrities shared their shock at the news and their own memories of the frontman on social media. \nJudy Murray, mother of tennis champtions Andy and Jamie Murray, posted two pictures: one of her hugging Les McKeown at a concert, and one of her holding a tartan scarf. She captioned them with \"Bye bye baby\".\nGuitarist Andy Scott from fellow seventies band The Sweet posted: \"Over the years I got to know Les quite well. We both lived in Central London in the 80s and I would see him sunbathing and Roller Skating in Hyde Park close to our Mayfair office. Les my friend only 65,  far too young.\"\nEighties pop singer Kim Wilde wrote: \"I remember line dancing in the school assembly hall to Bay City Roller hits, Les was my schoolgirl crush.\"\nAnd Midge Ure acknowledged the Rollers' eventful career. He said; \"Dreadful news. A band thoroughly ripped off by everything bad about the music industry. The biggest band in the world for a time and nothing to show for it.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "title": "Covid-19 in India: Why second coronavirus wave is devastating",
      "tags": "Asia,Mumbai,India coronavirus lockdown,Delhi,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Rajeshwari Devi, 58, died on Sunday after waiting for two days to get uninterrupted oxygen, an ambulance and a bed in a Covid-19 hospital.\nShe kept waiting and gasping but it was too late by the time help arrived. She was taken to a hospital emergency room on 16 April after her oxygen saturation level dropped. Her CT scan showed that she had developed severe pneumonia.\nBut without her Covid report the hospital refused to admit her. She spent around 36 hours in the emergency room on oxygen support in the northern Indian district of Robertsganj. The staff there told her family they were running out of oxygen and she needed to be moved to a bigger hospital but there was no ambulance or any promise of a bed. \nThe desperate family took her in their car to a hospital where a bed had become available after the intervention of a politician. She had no oxygen support in the car - she died minutes before she could be admitted to hospital. \nAshish Agrahari, her son, says his mother \"would have had a chance at survival if treatment was given in time\".\nHeartbreaking stories such as this are coming in from across India as a second Covid wave wreaks havoc. Data suggests that this wave is proving to be more infectious and deadlier in some states, although India's death rate from the virus is still relatively low. \nBut the county's healthcare system is crumbling amid the surge in cases - doctors say it's hard for them to \"see the light at the end of the tunnel this time\".  \nThe rise in case numbers has been exponential in the second wave. \nOn 18 June last year, India recorded 11,000 cases and in the next 60 days, it added 35,000 new cases on average every day. \nOn 10 February, at the start of the second wave, India confirmed 11,000 cases - and in the next 50 days, the daily average was around 22,000 cases. But in the following 10 days, cases rose sharply with the daily average reaching 89,800.\nExperts say this rapid increase shows that the second wave is spreading much faster across the country. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of Kerala state's Covid taskforce, said the rise was not entirely unexpected given that India let its guard down when daily infections in January fell to fewer than 20,000 from a peak of over 90,000 in September.\nBig religious gatherings, the reopening of most public places and crowded election rallies are being blamed for the uptick. Dr Fathahudeen said there were warning signs in February but \"we did not get our act together\".\n\"I said in February that Covid had not gone anywhere and a tsunami would hit us if urgent actions were not taken. Sadly, a tsunami has indeed hit us now,\" he added.\n\"A false sense of normalcy crept in and everybody, including people and officials, did not take measures to stop the second wave.\"\nMany Indian cities are reporting a chronic shortage of hospital beds. It's also evident in the desperate cries for help on social media platforms. Disturbing reports of people dying without getting timely treatment are coming from all over the country.\nSeveral state governments say they are creating new facilities but experts say it's going to be hard to keep up with the pace of the rising number of infections.\nIndia has been consistently reporting more than 150,000 cases for days now. It reported 273,810 cases on Monday - the biggest daily spike since the pandemic began.\nBadly-affected cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad have almost run out of hospital beds. \nThe situation is not very different in other cities, such as Lucknow, Bhopal, Kolkata, Allahabad and Surat. Public health expert Anant Bhan says officials did not use the lean period to boost facilities.\n\"We didn't learn any lesson from the first wave. We had reports of some cities running out of beds even in the first wave and that should have been a good enough reason to be prepared for the second wave,\" he said.\nHe adds that there appears to be a lack of co-ordination between states and the federal government over the supply of oxygen and essential drugs. \"We need a consolidated response and resources should be shared between states.\" \nThe situation is much more dire when it comes to ICU beds. Several cities have just a few dozen ICU beds left and they are now frantically trying to build extra capacity in hotels and stadiums.\nBut getting ICU beds up and running quickly is not easy. Dr Fathahudeen says adding beds alone is not enough. \"We need to ensure that most of these beds have oxygen facility. We need more doctors and nurses to manage extra ICU beds,\" he adds.\nHe says it's going to be a \"daunting task\" for the government to get such facilities up and running and ensure good quality of care in a short span of time.\nThe number of daily deaths has risen sharply in the second wave. India reported 1,761 deaths on Monday, taking the toll to over 180,000 since the pandemic began.\nCrematoriums have been running day and night in several cities, and people have to wait for hours to get the deceased cremated or buried.\nExperts say this shows that the actual number of deaths could be much higher. \nSanjeev Gupta, a photojournalist based in the central Indian city of Bhopal, reached one of the city's crematoriums for what he thought was a usual assignment last week. \nBhopal had reported only four Covid-related deaths on that day. But Mr Gupta was surprised to see dozens of funeral pyres burning. Additionally, several bodies were lined up to be cremated in the electric furnace. \nMr Gupta says he was moved when a young man asked him to photograph the smoke coming out from the chimney of the electric crematorium. \n\"He said the smoke represented his mother. It's the most heartbreaking thing I have ever heard.\"\nAnother photojournalist in Lucknow, which is the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, told the BBC that he counted nearly 100 funeral pyres burning at one of the city's crematoriums in the city on 14 April. The official death data for the whole state on that day was 85.\n\"The sky had turned orange near the crematorium. I still get chills thinking about it. We are definitely not getting the right death data from the government,\" he said.\nAnother photojournalist the BBC spoke to in Varanasi city in Uttar Pradesh state also talked about similar discrepancies in how deaths were being reported. \nExperts say there are several reasons for this. One of them is that many people are dying at home because they are not getting hospital beds or they are not being able to get tested for Covid. So, they don't find a place as a Covid patient in the database managed by different states. \nMr Bhan says testing facilities are still poor in smaller towns and even in some cities and \"it's possible we are missing many Covid-related deaths in these areas\".\nHe adds that there seems to be an issue with recording Covid deaths in some states. There have been reports about administrative oversight as well but officials deny the allegation. \n\"We need more transparency in numbers as it helps in managing the situation and also clearly tells you how severe the situation is,\" Mr Bhan adds. \nIndia on 25 March announced that a new variant of the coronavirus had been detected from samples collected from different states.\nVirologist Shahid Jameel explained that a \"double mutation in key areas of the virus's spike protein may make the virus more infectious and allow it to escape the immune system\".\nHe says the change in the virus is the only \"logical explanation\" behind the surge. Health officials in the UK are now investigating whether a double mutant spreads more easily and evades vaccines. \nAs things stand there is still not enough evidence to determine any causal relationship with India's deadly second wave, and the variant is not currently listed by Public Health England as a \"variant of concern\" - a term used to describe the UK, Brazilian and South African variants.\nDr Jameel adds that India started looking at mutations \"fairly late\". \"By December, India had done genome sequencing of only 5,000 samples. It wasn't a concentrated effort.\"\nIn January, India put together a group of labs to speed up sequencing and these labs started functioning in February. \"But unfortunately, the second wave started and the vision of sequencing roughly 5% of the total samples did not come through.\"\nSequencing becomes important in a pandemic as it allows scientists to monitor changes in the virus. \"If you can catch a more infectious variant early on in a region, you can quickly put in public health measures to stop it from spreading wider in the community,\" he explains.\nBut it's \"never too late\" to take measures. \"We need to strengthen safety protocols and rapidly vaccinate people, and also keep an eye on mutations. If we do all this, we could reduce numbers significantly.\""
