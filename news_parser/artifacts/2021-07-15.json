      "tags": "Brandon Lewis,The Troubles",
      "text": "The government has confirmed it intends to bring forward legislation to ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles.\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the legacy proposals would allow Northern Ireland to \"draw a line under the Troubles\".\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told Parliament it was a decision not taken lightly.\nSome victims' groups and Stormont's executive parties have expressed opposition to the proposals.\nHowever, Mr Lewis said it was \"the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation\".\nIn his Commons statement, he outlined a \"statute of limitations, to apply equally to all Troubles-related incidents\". \nIt is understood it would apply to former members of the security forces as well as ex-paramilitaries.\nA statute of limitations is a law which prevents legal proceedings being taken after a certain period of time. \nThe plans also include an end to all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict.\nThe government's paper makes no mention of what might happen to cases currently before the courts.\nMr Lewis said: \"We know that the prospect of the end of criminal prosecutions will be difficult for some to accept, and this is not a position that we take lightly.\n\"But we have arrived at the view that this would be the best way to facilitate an effective information retrieval and provision process, and the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation. \n\"It is a painful recognition of the reality of where we are.\"\nMr Lewis said that the proposals also include a body to help families recover information on Troubles incidents and an oral history initiative.\n\"Ongoing litigation processes often fail to deliver for families and victims, and their continued presence in a society which is trying to heal from the wounds of its past risks preventing it being able to move forward,\" he said.\nIn terms of \"drawing a line\", this is incredibly far-reaching.\nIt goes beyond a ban on Troubles-era prosecutions, of which there have been just nine in the past six years.\nEnding legacy inquests and civil actions is arguably of greater impact when you consider the figures.\nCurrently, there around 36 inquests relating to the Troubles due to be heard.\nMany of these relate to killings by the Army and police.\nAlongside this, there are more than 1,000 civil claims lodged against the Ministry of Defence and other state agencies.\nThe government is proposing all this is closed down in a new approach which is sweeping in scope.\nHowever, the opposition is loud.\nThe Irish government says it is not a fait accompli or a done deal.\nBut with a big majority at Westminster, the government has set off in a direction of travel which few predict will be reversed. \nNorthern Ireland's five main political parties, the Irish government and several victims' groups have been highly critical of any suggested blanket ban on prosecutions for Troubles-era offences. \nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said a meeting of the Stormont Party Leaders Forum is expected to take place with Mr Lewis on Friday. \nHe said he hoped the parties would use it to express their joint opposition to the proposals.\nEarlier, the prime minister defended the government's plans as \"measured and balanced\".\nBoris Johnson told MPs: \"The sad fact remains that there are many members of the armed services who continue to face the threat of vexatious prosecutions well into their 70s and 80s.\n\"We are finally bringing forward a solution to this problem, to enable the people of Northern Ireland to draw a line under the Troubles and to enable the people of Northern Ireland to move forward.\"\nPrior to the announcement, Northern Ireland's largest cross-community victims' group, Wave, said \"victims and survivors should not be treated this way\". \nIt added that if Mr Lewis \"is serious about effectively dealing with legacy he must talk to those most impacted by pain and trauma\".\nReports that the secretary of state was to announce a plan to end Troubles prosecutions also angered relatives of the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings.\nJulie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine, was among 21 people killed in the IRA bomb attacks, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to protest against the reported proposal.\n\"At what point did your government lose all sight of its moral, ethical and judicial backbone?\u202f,\" Ms Hambleton's letter asks. \nJohn Teggart, whose father Danny was one of the victims of the Ballymurphy shootings in 1971, said the proposals were a \"slap in the face\" for victims.\n\"It dances on the graves of all our loved ones and all those who affected in the conflict,\" he told BBC News NI's Evening Extra.\nSerena Hamilton, whose father Cpl David Graham was an Ulster Defence Regiment soldier killed by the IRA in Coalisland, County Tyrone, in 1977, said she was \"absolutely disgusted\".\n\"How can you move forward when you haven't got justice in the first place for such heinous crimes that happened to the likes of my father?,\" she asked on Evening Extra.\nLord Dannatt, a former Army chief, who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, said the proposals represented the \"least worst option\" and offered families a way to get answers about what happened.\n\"There is now a mechanism where questions can be asked, facts can be ascertained and they will be able to get some degree of closure in knowing what happened because the people answering those questions, whether they're paramilitaries or retired soldiers, will be able to answer those questions truthfully and honestly without the fear of being prosecuted and dragged through the courts.\"\nAmnesty International rejected the proposals as showing an \"appalling and offensive disregard for victims\".\nIts Northern Ireland campaign manager, Grainne Teggart, said: \"Many victims are having their worst fears realised in these proposals, the government is closing down paths to justice.\"\nIan Simpson, from the Northern Ireland Veterans' Association, said \"today is a shameful day\". \nHe continued: \"Today, the veterans and innocent victims have been betrayed to the uttermost by Boris Johnson and the British government.\n\"People who held the line in Northern Ireland, who gave us peace in Northern Ireland, have been put on a pedestal with terrorists, people who went out on a daily basis to murder and to maim.\"\nThe government statement followed significant recent developments in a number of high-profile Troubles prosecution cases.\nIn May, two former paratroopers were acquitted of the 1972 murder of Official IRA man Joe McCann after their trial collapsed due to the inadmissibility of prosecution evidence. \nBoth soldiers had been interviewed by a police legacy unit, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), in 2010 and it was that evidence which formed a substantial part of the prosecution's case.\nBut the judge ruled that evidence inadmissible and as the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) did not appeal against that decision, the case could not proceed.\nThen, earlier this month, the McCann murder trial collapse had implications for two other high-profile cases - the Bloody Sunday trial and the prosecution for the murder of 15-year-old Daniel Hegarty.\nThe PPS met the families of Daniel Hegarty and two men killed on Bloody Sunday to explain that given \"related evidential features\" to the McCann case, prosecutors no longer believed there was a reasonable prospect that key evidence against the soldiers accused of their loved one's murders would be ruled admissible.\nThe Bloody Sunday case was due to be formally dismissed in court last week, but instead it was adjourned following a legal challenge by a brother of one of the men shot dead on Bloody Sunday.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThere has been a sharp rise in the number of people in England and Wales being told to self isolate by the NHS Test and Trace app. Some 530,126 alerts telling individuals they had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for coronavirus were sent in the week to 7 July - an increase of 46% compared with the previous week. Car firms Nissan and Rolls-Royce have warned production could be affected due to high numbers of staff being told to isolate.\nThe UK's two largest supermarkets, Sainsbury's and Tesco, will continue to ask shoppers to wear masks even after the legal requirement to do so in England is dropped on Monday. Asda, Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl have followed their lead. Meanwhile, people travelling into Wales from England will be told to wear face masks by rail companies, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Face coverings will continue to be mandatory on public transport and in shops in Wales, while in England people will just be advised to wear them. Find out more about the new guidance on face masks here.\nThe number of job vacancies in the UK surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the three months to June, according to new data, driven by vacancies in hospitality and retailing. The Office for National Statistics said there were 862,000 jobs on offer between April and June, 77,500 more than in the first three months of 2020. The number of people on payrolls also grew by 356,000 in June, showing the biggest rise since the start of the pandemic.\nA man whose wife died after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine has said a vaccine damages scheme needs to be made easier for families to access. Kurt Weideling lost his wife Nicola, 45, in May. He told the BBC she developed a sore neck then a \"really, really bad\" headache before being diagnosed with vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. People like Nicola \"have effectively died as heroes\" as they had made the sacrifice for the vaccine programme, he said. So far, the government has received 145 claims but no payments have been made. Ministers say vaccination has prevented 30,000 Covid deaths in England. Here's what you need to know about vaccines and rare clots.\nA new bride has surprised her grandmother by recreating her wedding in her care home. Val Peddle, 81, who has dementia, had been unable to attend because of Covid restrictions - so her granddaughter Kirsty Thomas arrived at Ty Ynysawdre care home in Bridgend in her wedding dress.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWhat are the rules on self-isolation and are they changing as restrictions are relaxed?

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has set out the \"skeleton\" of a plan to \"level up\" the country, by spreading power and opportunity more evenly.\nIn a speech in Coventry, the PM insisted his flagship policy will not make the \"rich parts\" of the UK poorer but would be a \"win win\" for everyone.\nHe also pledged to hand more power to local leaders, with the possibility of elected mayors for counties.\nLabour described Mr Johnson's speech as \"gibberish nonsense\".\nThe party's deputy leader Angela Rayner dismissed the PM's promises as a \"PR exercise\", adding that Mr Johnson \"does not do detail, he does soundbites\". \n\"It is all jam tomorrow and a load of baloney. What he pretends and what he says he is going to do, is not what happens in reality.\"\nIn a wide-ranging speech, Mr Johnson said the government wanted to \"rewrite the rulebook\" on local devolution and offer county areas in England \"new deals\" to give them the same powers as those currently given to major cities.\nAnd he promised a flexible approach to those deals, including the option for directly elected mayors, but said there was no \"one-size-fits-all\" template.\nThe former London mayor urged local leaders with ideas for how to improve their communities to come forward, promising to give them \"the tools to make things happen for their communities\"..\nHe said he did not want to see the return of what he called \"loony-left\" councils, but added: \"We will deal with anybody.\" \nThe Conservatives first promised to \"level up\" the country in their manifesto for the 2019 general election, in which they targeted - and won - so-called \"red wall\" parliamentary seats in the Midlands and northern England previously dominated by Labour.\nThe plan, some of which has already been outlined, involves investing in transport, skills and businesses to address regional disparities.\nThe government is expected to publish more details in September.\nAsked what his clear strategy was for \"levelling up\", he said: \"I am respectfully going to urge you to just go back over some of what I said because I do think that in all fairness there was at least the skeleton of what to do.\"\nBoris Johnson again tried to explain the purpose of the \"levelling up\" agenda and talked about the UK's huge regional imbalances, entrenched inequalities and squandered opportunities.\nIn well-trailed remarks he also said that the aim of getting more government spending and private investment into poorer parts of the UK would not come at the detriment of London and the south east - an attempt to reassure traditional Tory voters who might be feeling left out themselves.\nIn terms of policy prescription the speech was fairly thin. \nA White Paper is promised in the autumn and today Mr Johnson clattered through a list of things - from tackling crime, building football pitches, laying railway lines - that he seemed to say all fell under the umbrella of levelling up. \nBut he also proposed greater regional devolution and suggested county leaders could get new powers. \nHe said if anyone could think of a better title than county mayors they should email him, which rather summed up the speech.\nIn his speech, the prime minister said the government will have \"made progress in levelling up when we have begun to raise living standards, spread opportunity, improved our public services and restored people's sense of pride in their community\".\nInvesting in more deprived areas will relieve pressure on parts of the UK that are \"over-heating\" and that previous governments focused too much on \"areas where house prices are already high and where transport is already congested\", he added.\nBut he insisted that there will not be \"levelling down\" in prosperous places, adding: \"We don't want to decapitate the tall poppies.\n\"We don't think you can make the poor parts of the country richer by making the rich parts poorer.\"\nHe said that \"levelling up is not a jam-spreading operation. It's not robbing Peter to pay Paul. It's not zero-sum. It's win-win\".\nThe PM's speech was welcomed by county councils.\nCounty Councils Network spokesman Martin Hill said: \"Local areas should be able to decide the most appropriate devolution arrangements for counties\".\nHe added: \"We are pleased that this looks firmly on the table.\""

      "text": "Car firms Nissan and Rolls-Royce have warned production could be affected due to high numbers of staff being told to isolate by the NHS Test and Trace app.\nIt is understood that up to 900 workers at Nissan's Sunderland car plant have been sent home from the plant, more than 10% of the total workforce. \nLocal case numbers have been rising sharply, making it difficult to avoid disruption, say sources.\nRolls-Royce said it may have to halve production at its Goodwood factory.\nA spokesman for luxury car-maker said that the number of employees at its West Sussex plant forced to self-isolate after being notified by the Test and Trace app has been rising, and it is watching the situation carefully. \nHe said that while the situation is not yet critical, Rolls Royce would have to cut one of the two shifts at the factory if the numbers continued to rise. \nIn Sunderland, where Nissan's factory is based,955 Covid cases per 100,000 people were recorded in the week to 10 July.\nIn contrast, the average area in England had 287.\nThe problems at the Japanese carmaker come amid increasing evidence of widespread absenteeism at firms because of workers who have been \"pinged\" by the NHS app.\nAnyone alerted who has come into contact with an infected person has to self-isolate for 10 days.\nEarlier this week, lengthy queues built up at security in Heathrow airport because of the absence of more than 100 staff instructed to self-isolate by the app.\nThe problem is especially acute in restaurants and pubs, with UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls saying that in some cases, up to one-third of staff have been forced to stay at home.\nMs Nicholls has said testing could replace isolation for people who have been in contact with a Covid patient.\nNissan said: \"Production in certain areas of the plant has been adjusted as we manage a number of staff being required to self-isolate following close contact with Covid-19. \n\"The well-being of our team is our number one priority and we remain confident in the rigorous safety controls we have on site.\"\nMake UK, which represents manufacturers, said an increasing number of companies had reported that self-isolation was impacting on production.\n\"For some companies up to 20% of the workforce is now isolating,\" said boss Stephen Phipson. \"Government must re-visit the August date as an immediate priority as the situation is likely to get far worse with the lifting of restrictions next week.\" \nUnite the union said management at the plant had \"done brilliantly\" so far in preventing production lines shutting by moving staff around, but things were on the limit now.\nMore widely, the union said that it had been told of many cases across industry where a big increase in the number of staff being advised to self-isolate by the NHS app was affecting production lines.\n\"The reports Unite is receiving from our members and their employers are extremely worrying. It is not an exaggeration to say factories are on the verge of shutting and that at some sites hundreds of staff are off work,\" said Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner.\n\"One major engine supplier has said that so many people are absent and orders so far behind that work may be permanently relocated to China.\n\"The government absolutely must not wait until August 16 to come up with a solution to significantly reduce the amount of people self-isolating unnecessarily.\"\nCurrently, if you are required to self-isolate, your employer cannot force you to come into work, says Emma Bartlett, an employment lawyer at CM Murray.  \nDoing so would not only breach your rights but those of your fellow workers in terms of health and safety.\nAs you isolate you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay, which is worth \u00a396.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme. \nA \u00a3500 grant is also available in England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate."

      "tags": "Respiratory diseases,NHS,Viruses,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A surge in flu and other respiratory viruses could put pressure on people's health and the NHS this winter, warns a report by leading medics.\nThey say testing for flu, Covid and a respiratory virus common in children and the elderly - called RSV - may help doctors treat cases more quickly.\nThe Academy of Medical Sciences report calls for people with any symptoms to isolate and stay at home.\nThis will help protect against all respiratory viruses this winter.\nThe report, by 29 leading experts and requested by the government, says there is great uncertainty about what the next few months will hold across the UK, but it urges policymakers to prepare for a challenging winter.\nDuring lockdown last winter, the UK population was hardly exposed to the viruses which normally circulate. But they are now set to make a comeback as restrictions lift and society opens up.\nAlready this summer, there has been a rise in winter viruses in children coming to A&E.\nReport author Prof Azra Ghani, from Imperial College London, says their modelling suggests a summer peak of Covid-19 infections \"with subsequent local outbreaks over winter\".\nBut \"we can't completely rule out another winter wave\", she said.\n\"Whilst we expect the peak in deaths to be considerably lower than last winter, under some scenarios we could see hospital admissions rise to similar levels.\"\nIn a worst-case scenario this could mean around twice the levels of flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a normal autumn and winter, the report says.\nThere are between 10,000 and 30,000 deaths from flu in a normal winter, and about 20,000 children under five are admitted to hospital each year with RSV, which can cause a lung infection called bronchiolitis.\nThe authors say these viruses often produce similar symptoms, so testing for all three at once would help distinguish between them.\nThis could be done through Test and Trace or in GP practices, but the turnaround would need to be very fast so that anti-virals could be used to treat flu in the most vulnerable.\nDr Alexander Edwards, from the University of Reading, said the \"triple tests\" had \"great appeal\", but the logistics could be a challenge.\n\"Whether there will be enough instruments and testing capacity available for this to be available widely in primary care remains to be seen,\" he said.\nThe report also recommends booster Covid vaccines alongside flu vaccines this autumn to reduce the spread of the virus, which is already being planned by the NHS for the over-50s, and improving infection control in hospitals.\nIt says all adults need to be vaccinated against Covid by September. Currently, two-thirds of UK adults have received two doses and 87% have had one dose.\nBut the number one way to reduce transmission is for people to have a test when they have symptoms and stay at home if they are ill, says Prof Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\"We are calling on the government to urgently strengthen the financial and practical support that will allow all people to self-isolate if they need to, whatever their circumstances,\" she said.\nThe medics also emphasise the importance of face coverings, social distancing and meeting friends outdoors - to protect against Covid as well as other respiratory viruses, as society opens up."

      "text": "Staff absences could see shortages of meat products, the industry has warned.\nMeat processors are seeing up to one in 10 of their workforce told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app. \nSome companies could be forced \u201cto start shutting down production lines all together,\u201d warned Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA).\nAs Covid cases exceed 250,000 a week, a growing number of businesses are reporting disruption due to absence.\nThe UK meat processing industry employs about 97,000 workers in the UK, but it was suffering from shortages before the pandemic began. \nMany firms were operating with 10% fewer staff than they needed. The latest increase in absences has added to the problem.\n\u201cAs a result, companies are having to simplify down their range of products to compensate for key skills being removed from their production lines,\u201d says Mr Allen.\n\u201cIf the UK workforce situation deteriorates further, companies will be forced to start shutting down production lines all together.\u201d\nThe BMPA represents about 90% of the industry by value of production.\nThe first products to be hit could be the cuts which require more work from skilled butchers, such as French-trimmed lamb chops with the fat removed, according to Mr Allen.\nThese are also among the most profitable lines for processors, so the financial impact could be significant.\nMr Allen called for greater clarity about how long to isolate for when pinged by the app and continued access for business to free Covid testing kits, which is due to end on 19 July.\nBusinesses are warning of increasing levels of Covid absence, as the current wave of infections grows. The number of people notified by the app in England and Wales recently passed half a million in a single week. \nLord Bilimoria, president of the CBI - which represents 190,000 businesses - said that number came as a \"genuine shock.\"\n\"Staff shortages are being felt acutely across all sectors and in all areas of business particularly, hospitality and leisure,\" he said.\nLord Bilimoria believes the NHS Test and Trace system needs an \"overhaul\" and is calling on the government to \"urgently\" bring forward its plans to allow double-jabbed individuals not to self-isolate if they have been informed by the app that they have come into contact with a Covid positive individual. \nEarlier this month, Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned that the number of cases could hit 100,000 a day - more than double the current level.\nCar-makers Nissan and Rolls-Royce have warned that production could be affected by large numbers of staff being told to isolate and UK Hospitality, the trade body for bars and restaurants, said it was causing \u201ccarnage\u201d among its members.\nFrom 16 August, the rules in England will change so that anyone who has had two vaccinations will not be required to self-isolate if the app says they have been in close contact with an infected person. \nPost-Brexit recruitment difficulties have made staffing problems worse in the meat processing industry, with some firms drawing 80% of their staff from the European Union, according to Mr Allen.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been calling on the government for months to add butchers to the Shortage Occupation List, which would allow the industry to temporarily fill these growing vacancies with overseas workers until the current crisis has passed,\u201d he said."

But the legal requirement to cover your face in enclosed spaces will end. Different rules apply in the devolved nations.\nThe new guidance leaves firms to decide their own safety policies after 19 July when Covid rules are lifted. \nAlong with Tesco, Sainsbury's and Waterstones, several other businesses and organisations have said they will ask customers to keep their masks. They include:\nThe decision poses a dilemma for businesses, however, since it is not clear whether encouraging mask-wearing will put off or attract shoppers.\nPrimark has said it won't have signage requesting customers to wear masks but hopes they will continue to do so. John Timpson, founder of the keycutting and shoe repair chain, said the decision would be left to customers.\nSainsbury's said its strategy reflected feedback from customers and colleagues, with the majority of those surveyed in favour of keeping the mask policy in place.\nThe chain said some Covid measures, such as screens between self-service checkouts and checkout queues, would be gradually removed. However screens between checkout staff and customers will remain in place.\nThe recommendation to wear a mask is based on scientists' advice that it will help prevent the wearer from infecting others through the wider dispersal of airborne particles.\nCritics of the government's new strategy say, given the current rapid spread of the virus, rules on mask-wearing should be retained after other social restrictions are eased in England on 19 July. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are maintaining stricter rules on face-coverings.\nThe trades union body, the TUC, called the government's strategy in England \"a recipe for rising infections\".\nThe shop workers' union, Usdaw, said the policy would create confusion and put shop workers at risk.\nIn its advice, the government says: \"Face coverings are no longer required by law. However, the government expects and recommends that people continue to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces.\" \nIt said this would apply to offices, factories, shops, construction sites, and close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians. \nThe government said it expected any return to work to be \"gradual\" and asked employers to continue to use measures to reduce potential Covid spread, such as risk assessments, thorough cleaning and ensuring adequate ventilation.\nHowever, much of the language in the guidance involves \"encouraging\" employers, staff and customers to \"consider\" measures which are already widespread, such as hand-washing, sanitiser use and contactless payments.  \nThe TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said the guidelines \"have been published without proper consultation with unions or employers, just two full working days before restrictions end on Monday\".\n\"Instead of providing clear and consistent guidance on how to keep staff safe at work, the government is abandoning workers and employers,\" she said.\nEmployers body the Institute of Directors said the guidance \"fails to inspire confidence in the return to work\".\nDr Roger Barker, policy director at the Institute of Directors, said: \"Like everybody else, businesses across the country having been awaiting 'freedom day' with bated breath.\n\"But instead we have had a series of mixed messages and patchwork requirements from government that have dampened that enthusiasm.\"\nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents big chains, said violence and abuse against shop workers had been on the rise during the pandemic, adding that \"colleagues cannot be put in the firing line because of this change in policy\". \nChief executive of the trade body Helen Dickinson said retailers will be asking customers to be \"considerate to those around them\" when choosing whether to wear a face covering. \nThe beauty industry trade body Babtac said that they will be working with members to provide more clarity. \nHead of Babtac, Lesley Blair, told the BBC that while it may no longer be law, the group \"would certainly encourage\" their members to continue to wear masks for the time being, especially when working in close proximity to customers.

      "tags": "WhatsApp,Apps,Facebook,Mobile phones",
      "text": "WhatsApp is testing a new feature that will let people message without using their phone for the first time. \nAt present, WhatsApp is linked to a user's phone. Its desktop and web apps need that device to be connected and receiving messages. \nBut the new feature will let users send and receive messages \"even if your phone battery is dead\". \nUp to four other devices - like PCs and tablets - can be used together, WhatsApp said. \nTo begin with, the new feature will be rolled out as a beta test for a \"small group of users\", and the team plans to improve performance and add features before enabling it for everyone.  \nEnd-to-end encryption - a key selling point for WhatsApp - will still work under this new system, it said. \nSeveral other messaging apps already have such a feature, including rival encrypted app Signal, which requires a phone for sign-up, but not to exchange messages. \nBut the feature has long been requested by WhatsApp users - of which there are a reported two billion. \nIn a blog post announcing the move, Facebook engineers said the change needed a \"rethink\" of WhatsApp's software design.  \nThat is because the current version \"uses a smartphone app as the primary device, making the phone the source of truth for all user data and the only device capable of end-to-end encrypting messages for another user [or] initiating calls\", the company said. \nWhatsApp Web and other non-smartphone apps are essentially a \"mirror\" of what happens on the phone.  \nBut that system has significant drawbacks familiar to many regular users, as the web app is known to frequently disconnect. \nIt also means that only one so-called \"companion app\" can be active at a time - so loading WhatsApp on another device will disconnect a WhatsApp web window.  \n\"The new WhatsApp multi-device architecture removes these hurdles, no longer requiring a smartphone to be the source of truth, while still keeping user data seamlessly and securely synchronised and private,\" the company said. \nOn a technical level, the solution was giving every device its own \"identity key\", and WhatsApp keeps a record of which keys belong to the same user account. That means it does not need to store messages on its own server, which could lead to privacy concerns.  \nBut Jake Moore, a security specialist at anti-virus-company Eset, said that no matter how robust the security is, having messages on more devices could still be a concern. \n\"There will always be a malicious actor looking to create a workaround,\" he said. \n\"Domestic abusers and stalkers could now have the potential of using this new feature to their advantage, by creating additional endpoints in order to capture any synchronised private communications.\"  \nHe also said that social engineering is an \"ever-increasing\" threat, and the responsibility lies with the user to keep an eye out for potential misuse. \n\"It is therefore vital that people are aware of all the devices that are connected to their account,\" he warned.

      "tags": "Cuba,Havana,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Cuba says it will allow travellers arriving in the country to bring in food, medicine and other essentials without paying import duties.\nThe announcement was made following the biggest anti-government protests on the Communist-run island in decades. \nThousands took to the streets on Sunday to protest over food and medicine shortages, price increases and the government's handling of Covid-19.\nThere will be no limit on such goods brought in by travellers from Monday.\nHowever, the measure is only temporary and has been derided as \"too little, too late\" by critics of the government.\nPrime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz announced the change on Wednesday at a meeting broadcast on state television.\nHis tone was much more conciliatory than that of President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, who, as the protests spread, had called on government supporters to take to the streets to \"defend the revolution\".\nIn contrast, Mr Marrero Cruz said the lifting of the import duties \"was a demand made by many travellers and it was necessary to take this decision\".\nHe added that the government would \"assess things\" after 31 December.\nTravellers to Cuba can currently bring up to 10kg of medicine into the country tax-free. However, they must pay customs duties on the limited amount of food and personal hygiene supplies they are allowed to bring in.\nScrapping the import duties had been suggested by some Cubans as a way to ease the shortages of medicines and food on the island.\nThe government had introduced the taxes to cut down on \"mulas\" (Spanish for mules), the name given to couriers who travel to Cuba from abroad heavily laden with foreign goods and currency.\nBut the measure not only hit Cubans who turned to the \"mulas\" to bring them items they could not get hold of in state-run shops, but also those who relied on relatives abroad to provide them with badly needed food and hygiene products.\nWhile the scrapping of the import tax is seen as a rare concession by the government, its temporary nature has been a source of derision.\nWith the Covid pandemic leading to a restriction in the number of flights arriving on the island, the effect the lifting of the restrictions will have is thought to be limited.\nBut many of those who commented on social media also thought it was little more than a sticking plaster. Some wrote that they had taken the risk of protesting - in a country where unauthorised public gatherings are illegal - to achieve much more more than this limited concession. \n\"No, we don't want crumbs. We want freedom,\" government critic and journalist Yoani S\u00e1nchez tweeted shortly after the announcement. \n\"Blood wasn't spilled on Cuban streets in order to import a few extra suitcases.\"\nThe protests, which started on Sunday, were not only the biggest but also the most widespread to be held in Cuba in decades.\nDozens have been arrested nationwide since the unrest began. Authorities confirmed on Tuesday that one man had died.\nNews of the protests spread on social media, where demonstrators posted live footage of gatherings across the country.\nMobile internet access was introduced in Cuba in the last few years but is provided by a state-run company.\nIn the wake of the protests, there was an internet blackout which many blamed on the government trying to block communications. \nAFP news agency journalists reported that Cuban authorities had restored access to the internet on Wednesday. However, some messaging and social media platforms reportedly remained blocked on 3G and 4G, including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter.\nStreets in Havana were calmer on Wednesday, although there was a heavy security presence.\nArrests seem to have continued in the country in recent days. Cuban YouTuber Dina Stars was conducting an interview for a Spanish broadcaster on Tuesday when she told the channel that security forces had come to take her away. She later posted about it on Instagram.\nAnd Reuters obtained footage from Tuesday which it said was of a young man in the south-eastern town of Gibara being arrested.\nThe protests come amid a severe economic crisis. Tourism, one of the most important sectors, has been devastated by the restrictions on travel during the Covid pandemic.\nSugar, which is mostly exported, is another key earner for Cuba. But this year's harvest has been much worse than expected.\nAs a result, the government's reserves of foreign currency are depleted, meaning it cannot buy in imported goods to supplement shortages, as it would normally do.\nCuba has blamed the US and its economic sanctions for the protests and Cuba's wider problems. On Wednesday, the US called for the release of all peaceful protesters detained in Cuba during recent unrest."

      "text": "People yet to take up a Covid vaccine are being told international travel will be difficult without it.\nThe Balearics have been added to the amber list from Monday, meaning only the fully vaccinated and children will be able to return to the UK without going into quarantine.\nScotland's vaccine rates have slowed since focus moved to 18-29s.\nNational clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said travel was another incentive for the cohort to get jabbed.\nIt was announced on Wednesday that Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca and Formentera were being moved onto the amber travel list for England. The Scottish and Welsh governments followed suit and Northern Ireland is expected to join them.\nThe rules take effect from 04:00 BST on Monday - 15 days after they were moved to the green watchlist.\nThe addition of popular holiday destinations to the amber list makes the requirement to have both Covid jabs more pressing for those who do not want to have to self-isolate.\nProf Leitch told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We can't promise people that when they travel the rates won't change. But we have to be able to stop the importation of cases and this is a consequence of that public health advice.\n\"It is a complex decision and not one we like to take. I love to travel. I would love to be going overseas this summer, and for business in the autumn, but I think that is getting unlikely.\"\nHe said the situation should encourage the uptake of vaccines in the lower age groups, which has so far been slow.\n\"My advice to everybody over 18 is, if travel is an incentive for you, then here is another reason - if you needed another reason other than the illness - to get yourself vaccinated,\" he said.\nLisa Rickard is due to be going to Majorca in three weeks' time.\n\"It was supposed to be an impromptu family holiday but it has grown arms and legs and turned into an absolute nightmare,\" she said.\n\"I booked for myself and my four children to go to Majorca on 4 August just for one week. \n\"But now plans are up in the air because I am not fully vaccinated and neither are my children. I have to ask work for extra time off to quarantine. It could mean me having to take three weeks off work. \n\"The guidelines are not clear if my children will have to isolate off school when we come home. Up until yesterday it wasn't clear if children under 11 would need to take PCR tests.\"\nThe overall cost of the holiday has gone up - with an extra \u00a3325 each for Lisa and her two teenage sons just for tests. And the move to the amber list has meant an extra \u00a3170 each for the day two and day eight tests.\nShe said: \"I booked it last week and the flights were so cheap. I thought I had grabbed a bargain but now it is out of control.\" \nProf Leitch also admitted that uptake was not high in the 18-29 age group and, as a result, the national vaccination figures were not increasing as rapidly as previously.\nOn Tuesday, just 6,875 first doses were given compared to 10,688 the Tuesday before.In total, 72.3% of the entire Scottish population has had their first dose, and 53.4% have had both doses. \nProf Leitch said: \"I would agree things have slowed down a bit. It is unavoidable. You can only do second doses if you have done first doses. That's fixed and going well and people are coming for those.\n\"The tricky part which is harder to control is 18 to 29-year-olds getting first doses. We expected it to be slower, that's why we are making it as open as we possibly can. The first dose number is slowing a bit and we expected it to at this age.\"\nHe added: \"To get out the end of the pandemic globally and in Scotland, we need big population immunity numbers. We have tried to do lots of communication with young people, we have met with Young Scot, we have mobile open access clinics, fixed open access clinics across the country, third sector organisations and further colleges doing outreach. I think we have done well.\"\nHealth secretary Humza Yousaf said that by Sunday, every single adult over 18 will have been offered a first dose of a vaccine.\nHe said that more than 65% of the population had now received both doses, but that the younger population was proving difficult to reach.\n\"We are clearly facing a challenge: the younger cohorts we go to, the higher the do not attend rates are,\" he added.\n\"If I can encourage everybody to get vaccinated, make sure you attend your appointment, or go to one of the drop-in clinics. They will take you at any time at the drop-in clinics, for your first, or if it has been eight weeks, for your second.\"\nHe said it was the government's plan to have the entire eligible population fully vaccinated by mid September."

      "text": "Most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - are set to be scrapped from 7 August.\nThe Welsh government said all laws on the number of people who can meet will end but First Minister Mark Drakeford warned against \"a free for all.\"\nNightclubs would be able to reopen, but face masks will still be required in most indoor public places except in pubs, restaurants and schools.\nSome rules will change on Saturday, meaning six people can to meet in private homes and holiday homes.\nDespite the plan to ease many rules, people will be asked to continue working from home wherever possible.\nMeanwhile, specific social distancing in workplace laws are expected to end from 7 August, with businesses left to decide if they still need to keep customers and workers apart through risk assessments.\nMr Drakeford warned the Senedd that the Delta variant is in every part of Wales and was \"spreading quickly\", with \"real dangers\" that could not be ignored.\nHe told a press conference: \"This is not a free-for-all.\"\n\"There will continue to be some important protections to help keep us all safe, especially those who are clinically vulnerable and who are perhaps the most anxious about an easing of restrictions.\"\nThe Welsh plan to move to its current lowest level of Covid restrictions - known as alert level 0 - on Saturday, 7 August, depends on the country's public health situation. \nIt means there will be more rules in Wales than in England.\nMr Drakeford said while he was \"reasonably confident\" vaccinations had weakened the link between infections and serious illness, with the number of Covid patients in hospital relatively low, there was still \"a risk that this third wave of the pandemic could cause real harm\".\nAlthough the case rate is rising Wales, the country has the lowest infection rate of the UK nations and has one of the world's highest vaccination rates.\nWales will move into the alert level one set of restrictions on Saturday - allowing for six people to meet in private homes and holiday accommodation.\nIce rinks will be able to reopen, and the limits on numbers that can meet in public places or at events outdoors will be removed.\nOutdoor indoor events can take place for up to 1,000 seated and up to 200 standing from the same day.\nFully vaccinated people will also no longer need to self-isolate if they are returning from an amber list country from Monday, following decisions taken in England and Scotland.\nBut people returning from an amber list country will need to have a PCR test on day two of their arrival - and cannot visit a hospital or care home within 10 days of returning from abroad.\nMr Drakeford criticised the UK government for having originally introduced the move, only putting it in place in Wales because it would have been \"untenable\" not to.\n\"The risk of re-importation of coronavirus from other parts of the world, and especially further new variants, has not gone away,\" he said.\n\"The removal of a defence against that risk, and especially at a time when the virus is in such rapid circulation, is hard to understand.\"\nUnder plans for alert level zero, ministers have proposed:\nThe face mask rules will remain in place despite the UK government's decision to scrap them in England.\nMinisters are also planning, during August, to allow people who are fully vaccinated not to self-isolate if they are a close contact of someone who has tested positive.\nWhile the specific laws requiring social distancing in workplaces and hospitality are expected to go, the issue will be left for organisations to work out.\nSpecific social distancing laws are expected to be scrapped outdoors this Saturday, and indoors on 7 August.\nThe Welsh government's coronavirus control plan states it will be for organisations to assess the risks, \"depending on the nature of the premises and the risks of exposure\".\nWelsh Conservatives Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"Whilst we regret the Welsh Labour government has been the last government in Britain to publish a plan, it is a case of better late than never, and the lifting of restrictions will ensure we can get our economy and public services on the road to recovery.\"\nRhun ap Iorwerth, deputy leader of Plaid Cymru in the Senedd, added: \"The important thing is that Welsh government doesn't follow the ill-judged timetable being set by UK Government in lifting all restrictions during a period of increasing cases.\"\nAccording to the control plan, moving to 7 August will be \"subject to no new variants of concern being identified in Wales, hospital admissions and deaths from Covid-19 remaining at relatively low and manageable levels and if the vaccination programme continues as expected\".\nHospital admissions have risen in the past month but remain significantly lower than earlier in the pandemic.\nCovid rates in Wales stood at 145.3 per 100,000 people on Wednesday, compared to 138.2 the day before.\nThere are 69 patients with confirmed cases of Covid in hospital, compared to 39 a week before. That number is at its highest since mid-April.\n\"The balance of harm is changing,\" says the Welsh government's new Coronavirus control plan, meaning the harms of restrictions are beginning to outweigh the harms of Covid.\nNevertheless, the tone remains laden with caution and an emphasis on collective, as well as personal responsibility.\nWhile Mark Drakeford has rejected the idea of a \"spurious freedom day\", he has also acknowledged that all the home nations are heading broadly in the same direction.\nBut the first minister continues to stress the differences - keeping the requirement for face masks in most indoor settings and obligations on employers to undertake Covid risk assessments.\nThroughout the pandemic, ministers in Cardiff Bay have been convinced that voters want to see a cautious approach and even as we head into what everyone hopes might be the end game, that continues to be the note they want to strike.\n\"It feels like a long time coming,\" said Georgina Heffernan, from Cardiff restaurant The Potted Pig which had to halve its capacity to comply with social distancing.\nHowever, she said some customers may feel \"vulnerable\" if all social distancing measures were eased at once.\n\"We're lucky as a business that we can still implement certain social distancing standards,\" she said.\n\"I think for us that will stay. \n\"Obviously, we do want more customers but we also want the customers we do have to feel as safe as possible.\n\"We do not want to alienate customers who do still feel vulnerable and that don't want to come out into a really busy setting,\" she said.\n\"It has been a struggle. It has been hard on us as a business,\" she said\n\"A lot of people don't see what goes on behind the scenes.\n\"We have gone above and beyond to try and deal with the pandemic and live the pandemic.\"\nIndustry body UK Hospitality Cymru said lifting restrictions in August was \"brilliant\", but warned a more cautious approach in Wales at the height of the holiday season could lead to \"difficulties for customers and staff alike\".\nSara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium warned that caution on returning to offices would likely \"further push back the recovery for city centres and high streets where footfall remains over a quarter lower than pre-pandemic levels\".\n\"Ministers needs to be prepared to consider how best to support struggling retailers if the return back to normal trading continues to take longer than anticipated,\" she said.\nCBI Wales called for the Welsh Government \"to provide clear and consistent guidance on safety proposals as soon as possible to give firms time to plan ahead\".\nThe Federation of Small Businesses said that from 7 August, \"almost all businesses in Wales will be able to trade at capacity due to the easing of social distancing requirements\"."

Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "text": "Some of Britain's biggest high street banks are refusing to give mortgages to self-employed people who received government grants during the pandemic.\nMortgage brokers say those working in sectors like entertainment, hospitality and travel are the worst affected.\nMany lenders spoken to by the BBC are not accepting mortgage applications from people on furlough.\nBrokers said that banks often see people who have received Covid-related grants as high risk.\n\"I almost feel like I am being treated like a bankrupt, in some way, that I am being penalised for something that wasn't my fault,\" said hospitality worker Lisa Harding. \nMs Harding, 49, is a first time buyer with a 10% deposit. She said she is unable to get a mortgage because she was previously furloughed from her job in the hospitality industry. \nShe has now returned to her permanent, full-time job, but has still been turned down by lenders.\n\"I feel unfairly penalised. Furlough has been brilliant in that it has protected my job. But I didn't expect to come out of the other side - with a deposit, no debt, a perfect credit rating, all of the things that should make me an ideal first time buyer - only to find out that banks just will not lend to me at all,\" Ms Harding told the BBC.\nTwo of the UK's biggest high street lenders, NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland, are refusing mortgage applications from people who took the government's self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) grant.\n\"As it stands we aren't accepting applications from customers who have applied for a SEISS grant on or after 14 July 2020,\" a spokesperson told the BBC. \n\"As a responsible lender this is part of the bank's affordability criteria,\" they said. \nYorkshire Building Society and TSB said they would need to see evidence of the businesses having recovered from the pandemic, such as a good turnover. \nLenders traditionally look at the last two years of accounts to work out how much was earned. This means the Covid pandemic could still be impacting self-employed peoples' mortgage applications until 2023.\nSelf-employed people are also being asked to stump up larger deposits. Metro Bank, for example, said any customers who have taken out an SEISS grant will need a deposit of 20% or more. At Santander a deposit of 25% is the minimum for those who are self-employed.\nMost of the lenders the BBC contacted, including Lloyds, Yorkshire Building Society, TSB and Virgin Money, said they will not accept mortgage applications from people currently on furlough. They also do not include furloughed income as part of their affordability assessment.\nAndrew Montlake, a broker at Coreco, said those working in hospitality, tourism and events will face these challenges for \"some time\" and that lenders need to be more \"proactive.\" \n\"We are calling on lenders to look at how businesses were performing before the pandemic, as a more likely guide for how they will perform afterwards.\"\nSome of these policies go against assurances from the Financial Conduct Authority, the banking watchdog. \nAn FCA spokesperson said the SEISS grant or support of this kind \"should not, of themselves, prevent people from being able to access credit.\"\n\"Lenders are required to treat customers fairly when they apply for a mortgage,\" the spokesperson added. \nThere are concerns that millions of people who took advantage of the Covid support schemes did not fully understood the long-term impact.\nFreelance theatre designer Daniel Ellis was also shocked to find he was not eligible for a mortgage because he'd taken out an SEISS grant.  \nThe 28-year-old has been saving to buy his first home with his wife Emily in Derby. The couple's prospective monthly mortgage payments would be a third less than what they are currently paying each month in rent. \nBut his bank, NatWest, told him he wasn't eligible for a mortgage because he'd taken out the grant when theatres were forced to close. \n\"The mortgage system needs to change to reflect evidence of successful recurring rent payments, and we also feel it's wrong that the self-employed are scrutinised more than the employed,\" Mr Ellis explained. \nThe couple say they have, with difficulty, managed to secure a mortgage in principle with another lender.\nConsumer groups, including Fairer Finance, are now calling on the financial regulator to urgently investigate which lenders are penalising borrowers in this way and to take action.\nAccording to data from the Office for National Statistics, there are currently just over five million self-employed workers in the UK. \nAlmost 60% of self-employed borrowers said they felt penalised by lenders because they worked for themselves when applying for a mortgage, according to a survey carried out by the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-employed (IPSE). \nMore than two-thirds of freelancers (70%) who had got a mortgage said some lenders would not consider them at all because they are self-employed.\nUK Finance, which represents the industry, said lenders must carry out a thorough income check to ensure mortgages are affordable in the long term.\n\"Each lender will consider a range of factors such as the type of borrower, their employment status, income history, the sector they work in and the type of property they are looking to purchase when deciding how much to lend,\" a UK Finance spokesperson said.\nThe Treasury told the BBC that its \u00a3350bn financial package had supported jobs and livelihoods throughout this crisis. \n\"It's important that lenders are able to carry out proper checks to ensure people are not offered unaffordable loans,\" a Treasury spokesperson said."

      "text": "More of Wales' Covid-19 rules could change over the next few weeks from being legal requirements to government advice, according to a Welsh minister.\nMick Antoniw said Wales was \"moving to a stage where we are having increasing normality\" but that ministers and officials would evaluate data ahead of the next review on 15 July.\nAll legal restrictions are expected to be lifted in England on 19 July.\nAnd the SNP government is aiming to do the same in Scotland on 9 August.\nWith no date set in Wales, the Conservatives have accused the Welsh government of being \"stuck in lockdown mode\".\nResponding to reports on Sunday that England will move into a period without legal restrictions, where the public will have to exercise \"personal responsibility\", Andrew RT Davies MS, the leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, tweeted: \"It's time for Welsh government to provide clarity on Wales' route to normality.\"\nA further 535 people have tested positive for coronavirus, according to latest data published by Public Health Wales.\nCounsel General Mr Antoniw told the BBC's Politics Wales programme the Welsh government's \"current thinking is that we have obviously an increase in the level of infections, but we have less hospitalisation out of that\". \n\"We want to maximise the vaccination rates still further, and then around the 15th or 16th of July, we'll have a review, and we'll consider what further easings can be taken within the data that we actually have,\" he said.\n\"Setting a date has its own problems because, if you're saying you want to achieve these certain things on this particular date... it is still always dependent on what the latest information is in respect of the infection rates.\n\"We are certainly moving in the direction of a much greater normality.\n\"But the pandemic is going to be with us for some time,\" he added.\nThere have only been minor changes to the rules in Wales since 7 June after the first minister announced a pause in a bid to reduce daily hospital admissions and allow time to vaccinate more people.\nMinisters had considered permitting more indoor mixing, allowing more people to attend indoor events and reopening ice skating rinks, before deciding to hold off.\nIn Wales, people are currently able to meet in private homes if they are in an extended household with a fixed set of other homes, unlike in England where six people from any household can meet.\nNightclubs remain closed, as they do across the UK, while limits on social distancing and how many people can meet outside remain.\nThe restrictions will be reviewed the week starting 12 July, with any further lifting due to be announced by the first minister towards the end of the week.\nAsked on Politics Wales if he foresaw big changes to the rules in Wales during that review, Mr Antoniw said: \"I certainly would envisage a shift in the way in which we assess risks, that we look at things differently. \n\"We look at how much more can be done on the ground by way of guidelines and advice because, clearly, we're moving to a stage where we are having increasing normality.\n\"But it's got to be something that's based on the reality of the fact there are still risks out there.\n\"So, over the next week or so, all that data's going to be evaluated.\n\"We'll take advice from the medical officers and from the scientists, and then we'll work out basically what is the best next step forward in terms of moving towards that greater normality.\n\"But also in a way that doesn't put people at risk,\" he added."

      "text": "A man whose wife's death is being investigated over possible links to the AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab is calling for people to have their choice of vaccine.\nA coroner is considering if the vaccine contributed to the death of BBC radio presenter Lisa Shaw, 44, in May.\nHer husband Gareth Eve said the jab had been \"outstanding\" but its \"risks\" should be \"recognised\".\nThe government said 81 million vaccines had been administered, with benefits outweighing risks for most people.\nMr Eve said he and his wife, who was a presenter on BBC Radio Newcastle, had both been \"excited\" about being vaccinated so she could \"give her mam a hug\" having been a \"stickler\" for following lockdown rules.\nA week after getting her first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, she started getting headaches and ended up being taken to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) for treatment for blood clots.\nHe said the treatments initially seemed to work well, but when he went to visit her on a Sunday afternoon she seemed confused and was suffering further headaches.\nDoctors diagnosed a bleed on the brain and she was transferred to the hospital's high dependency unit.\n\"I went to see her and she told me to go home and see our son because it was late,\" Mr Eve told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. \n\"She said 'I'm tired'. I gave her a kiss. And I never spoke to her again.\"\nThere is a known side-effect to the AstraZeneca vaccine that is very rare, known as vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (VITT). That's a condition where clots form in combination with low platelet levels, and that is something that doesn't happen naturally. Therefore, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) thinks there is a strong likelihood that it is the vaccine causing this. \nThere have been almost 400 cases - most after the first dose - with 71 deaths, so it's about one death per 650,000 doses. \nThere is some suggestion there's a slightly higher risk in women than men but it's not absolutely clear, and slightly higher incidence in young people. That is why initially the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said initially people under 30 should not have the AstraZeneca vaccine, which they changed to under 40 in May.\nAll medicines including vaccines have risks as well as benefits. For individuals and society, you have to set that against the risks you are trying to prevent, which is Covid. \nWith Covid there have been something like 1,900 deaths per one million people in the UK and Covid itself is known to be a serious cause of clots. \nSomething like one in five people hospitalised with Covid will end up with clots.\nMr Eve said he was \"absolutely not an anti-vaxxer\" but while \"we don't know this information, maybe the answer is to give people the alternative\".\n\"It's not as if we don't have other vaccines available to us, so while there is this cloud over AstraZeneca, maybe put it on ice and say we are going to look into giving people the other jab,\" he said.\nMr Eve added: \"What the vaccine has done is unbelievable. The work these people have done to get the country back on its feet is outstanding. \n\"But we need to recognise there are families who have been affected by this jab.\"\nHe said he realised the number of fatalities linked to the vaccine was a \"drop in the ocean\" but said: \"It hasn't been a drop in the ocean for our family, it has hit our family like a tidal wave.\"\nThe BBC asked the Department of Health if people should be given a choice of vaccine and a government spokesperson said: \"We are deeply saddened to hear about the death of Ms Shaw and our thoughts are with the family. \n\"As the UK's independent medicines regulator, the MHRA, and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation have said, for the vast majority of people, the benefits of preventing serious illness and death outweigh any risks and the vaccines have saved thousands of lives. \n\"People will be offered a vaccine that is most suitable for them. For example, everyone under the age of 40 will be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, as advised by the JCVI.\n\"Those who have already had a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should receive a second dose of the same brand, irrespective of age, except for the very small number of people who experienced blood clots with low platelet counts from their first vaccination.\"\nMHRA chief executive Dr June Raine said: \"It is still vitally important that people come forward for their vaccination and for their second dose when invited to do so.\" \nShe said suspected side-effects linked to vaccines can be reported to the MHRA's yellow card scheme. \nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Sainsbury's,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's two largest supermarkets will continue to ask shoppers to wear masks, even after the legal requirement to do so in England is dropped on Monday.\nSainsbury's and Tesco have joined the bookseller, Waterstones, which has said customers should wear masks to protect staff and other shoppers.\nSainsbury's said signs and tannoy announcements would remind shoppers to cover their faces.\nTesco said it wanted to \"be on the safe side\".\nThe chain will also continue to limit the number of shoppers in store at any one time.\nThe government has said it \"expects and recommends\" shoppers in England to wear face masks from Monday. But the legal requirement to cover your face in enclosed spaces will end. Different rules apply in the devolved nations.\nThe new guidance leaves firms to decide their own safety policies after 19 July when Covid rules are lifted. \nAlong with Tesco, Sainsbury's and Waterstones, several other businesses and organisations have said they will ask customers to keep their masks. They include:\nThe decision poses a dilemma for businesses, however, since it is not clear whether encouraging mask-wearing will put off or attract shoppers.\nPrimark has said it won't have signage requesting customers to wear masks but hopes they will continue to do so. John Timpson, founder of the keycutting and shoe repair chain, said the decision would be left to customers.\nSainsbury's said its strategy reflected feedback from customers and colleagues, with the majority of those surveyed in favour of keeping the mask policy in place.\nThe chain said some Covid measures, such as screens between self-service checkouts and checkout queues, would be gradually removed. However screens between checkout staff and customers will remain in place.\nThe recommendation to wear a mask is based on scientists' advice that it will help prevent the wearer from infecting others through the wider dispersal of airborne particles.\nCritics of the government's new strategy say, given the current rapid spread of the virus, rules on mask-wearing should be retained after other social restrictions are eased in England on 19 July. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are maintaining stricter rules on face-coverings.\nThe trades union body, the TUC, called the government's strategy in England \"a recipe for rising infections\".\nThe shop workers' union, Usdaw, said the policy would create confusion and put shop workers at risk.\nIn its advice, the government says: \"Face coverings are no longer required by law. However, the government expects and recommends that people continue to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces.\" \nIt said this would apply to offices, factories, shops, construction sites, and close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians. \nThe government said it expected any return to work to be \"gradual\" and asked employers to continue to use measures to reduce potential Covid spread, such as risk assessments, thorough cleaning and ensuring adequate ventilation.\nHowever, much of the language in the guidance involves \"encouraging\" employers, staff and customers to \"consider\" measures which are already widespread, such as hand-washing, sanitiser use and contactless payments.  \nThe TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said the guidelines \"have been published without proper consultation with unions or employers, just two full working days before restrictions end on Monday\".\n\"Instead of providing clear and consistent guidance on how to keep staff safe at work, the government is abandoning workers and employers,\" she said.\nEmployers body the Institute of Directors said the guidance \"fails to inspire confidence in the return to work\".\nDr Roger Barker, policy director at the Institute of Directors, said: \"Like everybody else, businesses across the country having been awaiting 'freedom day' with bated breath.\n\"But instead we have had a series of mixed messages and patchwork requirements from government that have dampened that enthusiasm.\"\nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents big chains, said violence and abuse against shop workers had been on the rise during the pandemic, adding that \"colleagues cannot be put in the firing line because of this change in policy\". \nChief executive of the trade body Helen Dickinson said retailers will be asking customers to be \"considerate to those around them\" when choosing whether to wear a face covering. \nThe beauty industry trade body Babtac said that they will be working with members to provide more clarity. \nHead of Babtac, Lesley Blair, told the BBC that while it may no longer be law, the group \"would certainly encourage\" their members to continue to wear masks for the time being, especially when working in close proximity to customers.

      "text": "Actress Ruth Madeley has told of how a taxi driver took her wheelchair away following an argument outside London's Euston station last month.\nThe Bafta nominee said the driver told her it was \"too difficult\" to drop her at an accessible entrance and it wasn't his problem if she couldn't use stairs.\nAfter a dispute over payment, she said he then took her wheelchair, put it in his boot and refused to give it back.\nTransport for London has apologised for the \"utterly appalling\" incident.\nGraham Robinson, TfL's general manager for taxi and private hire, said: \"We have contacted Ruth for more details so we can carry out a full and urgent investigation.\"\nThe actress, from Bolton, was nominated for a Bafta for her breakthrough role in the BBC's Don't Take My Baby before starring in 2019's Years and Years.\nShe wrote on Instagram that the driver of the private hire taxi told her it was \"too difficult\" to drop her at the station's accessible entrance because of heavy traffic, and that he \"had seen me stand & so 'knew I could walk'\".\n\"When I told [the driver] that I can't manage stairs, he proceeded to tell me that it was MY problem not his,\" she explained.\n\"As if this wasn't traumatic enough, he demanded his fare even though the journey had been prepaid.\n\"When I tried explaining this on the street, he became very agitated &, in sheer frustration, HE TOOK MY WHEELCHAIR from behind me without warning & carried it away to put in the boot of his taxi, leaving me on the side of the road.\"\nThe actress's mother managed to grab the wheelchair, although the driver \"tried his best to stop her\", Madeley said.\nTaxis and designated wheelchair-accessible private hire vehicles have a legal duty to carry wheelchair users in accordance with the Equality Act 2010. This includes a duty to provide mobility assistance without additional charge.\nMadeley said that when she tried to report the incident to the Metropolitan Police, she was told it was not a hate crime and that no criminal act had taken place.\nShe added: \"I was shut down and made to feel as though I was making a fuss over nothing. \n\"After more fighting & asking for support, the police told me that nothing can be done. No warning to the taxi driver or the firm, no accountability, no consequences\u2026\"\nA Met spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that, while appreciating the upset caused, the force would not investigate because the incident is \"not a criminal matter\".\nDisability charity Sense called for the force to investigate the \"shocking\" incident. \"Sadly, we hear far too often from disabled people that have experienced discrimination,\" its chief executive Richard Kramer said.\n\"We must commit as a society to tackling inequality and create a more inclusive society, removing the barriers that disabled people face.\"\nThe incident took place at the end of June on the day that it was announced Madeley is to star in BBC Two's forthcoming factual drama Independence Day? How Disabled Rights Were Won.\nMarking the passing of the Disability Discrimination Act, the film is based on the true story of the people behind a campaign of direct action that lead to significant steps forward in the battle for disabled civil rights in Britain.\nMadeley said her experience reflected the discrimination experienced by disabled people \"every single day\" and was \"clear proof that the fight for disability rights is far from over\".\nFor more disability news, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter and Facebook, and subscribe to the weekly podcast on BBC Sounds."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe coronavirus pandemic has been a \"painful reality check\" about the scale of food-related ill-health, says an independent review of food policy in England. \"Our high obesity rate has been a major factor in the UK's tragically high death rate,\" according to Henry Dimbleby, who led the National Food Strategy report. This comment and description came as part of the National Food Strategy's report, which has suggested sugar and salt should be taxed and vegetables prescribed by the NHS. It was commissioned by the government in 2019 and says poor diet contributes to 64,000 deaths a year in England. Meanwhile separate research has suggested being obese doubles the risk of hospital treatment from Covid-19 and countries with higher rates of obesity were seeing more deaths. The government has promised to respond to the National Food Strategy with a White Paper within six months.\nPeople with symptoms of flu, Covid or any other viruses should isolate and stay at home, according to leading medics who warn a surge in these illnesses could put pressure on people's health and the NHS this winter. As uncertainty remains about what the next few months hold, as Covid restrictions ease and the winter viruses return, the Academy of Medical Sciences report says taking this action would help protect people. It also suggests testing may help doctors treat cases more quickly. \"Whilst we expect the peak in deaths to be considerably lower than last winter, under some scenarios we could see hospital admissions rise to similar levels,\" says report author Prof Azra Ghani, from Imperial College London.\nDoctors and midwives fear next week's relaxation of Covid restrictions will lead to a big increase in infections among pregnant women, who are at greater risk of getting severely ill. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the Royal College of Midwives say the easing, combined with rising infection rates and vaccine hesitancy, poses a serious risk. Data from the RCOG shows 58% of women have declined a vaccine despite the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation now advising that pregnant women should be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna jabs, at the same time as the rest of the population.\nMost of us have been wearing face coverings to help stop the spread of the coronavirus and it's been a booming business for mask makers. Face coverings will still be used in Scotland and Wales for now but changes in England mean they'll be used much less. So what will mask makers do next?

      "text": "Insurers could replace written-off or stolen petrol cars with electric vehicles as part of a wide-ranging plan to improve sustainability.\nThe Association of British Insurers (ABI) said the plans could \"herald a new approach\" to the many thousands of claims settled each year.\nDamaged gas boilers could also be replaced with more sustainable models.\nConsumers would also be encouraged to accept recycled parts as part of a roadmap to tackle climate change.\nMembers of the ABI settled 2.6 million motor insurance claims last year, and 737,000 property claims.\nThe sector has been widely criticised for its approach on pricing, particularly rising premiums for loyal customers.\nHowever, it believes it can have a significant impact on improving transport emissions and other environmental issues. \nOn Wednesday, the government unveiled its own green transport policy, although it was ridiculed by environmentalists.\nThe ABI's Climate Change Roadmap is a plan to get insurers moving towards a net-zero target. It reflects the huge range of sectors in which insurers operate.\nIt includes educating pension savers about their choices of investment, and the resulting environmental impact.\nHowever. the most eye-catching aspect of the plan is the proposal that insurers should consider replacing written-off or stolen petrol cars with electric vehicles. Road transport is one of the heaviest polluting areas of society.\nInsurers are also hoping to encourage the development of a sustainable secondary market for electric vehicles, and work on consistent policies for re-using and recycling charging equipment.\nCustomers may also be encouraged to accept repaired or recycled items as part of a settlement for damaged or stolen property, rather than brand new items. \nThey will also investigate how items damaged during a flood or storm could be sent for re-use or repair.\nHuw Evans, director general of the ABI, said: \"We all know the environmental crisis is the greatest threat facing our planet and all sectors need to challenge themselves like never before. \n\"We accept that our sector's emission are amongst the most of any industry in the economy but, conversely, this means we are uniquely placed to drive the transition including through huge investment potential in the green economy and our reach to millions of customers.\""

      "text": "A man who lost his wife to Covid just weeks after catching it himself is warning restrictions are being lifted too quickly across the UK.\nGwyn Tovey, 72, from Carmarthenshire, is caring for his 94-year-old mother Betty, who also caught the virus, while dealing with long Covid himself.\nHe said there would not be \"freedom\" for any families who have endured similar trauma.\nHis wife Rita died just weeks after Gwyn picked up the virus in December.\nMost Covid rules will be scrapped in Wales from 7 August, when legal limits on the number of people who can meet others will end. \nFace masks will still be required in most indoor settings, except in places such as pubs, restaurants and cafes.\nIn England, almost all legal restrictions on social contact will be removed on 19 July, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson warning the pandemic was \"not over\" and telling people to proceed with caution.\nWhen Gwyn and Rita moved into their new property in the village of Penygroes a decade ago, they referred to it as their \"forever home\".\nThen last year, Gwyn, a retired lecturer, took on part-time warehouse work to save up to buy Rita, who was 74, a mobility scooter for Christmas.\nBut he caught Covid.\n\"I simply phoned into work to say 'I've been diagnosed, I will have to self-isolate for 10 days' and the extent I thought that would go to was that I would lose my part-time job,\" he said. \nBut he lost so much more.  \nFour days later, Rita collapsed at home with the effects of Covid and, after three weeks, died in hospital on New Year's Day.\nGwyn's mother, Betty, was also admitted with the virus and, at one point, all three were being treated at Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli.\nBetty was later transferred to the town's field hospital for recuperating Covid patients.\nIt's where the BBC first met her in February, on the day she was discharged to return to live with her grieving son.\nY Cwtch, a cafe in Penygroes, now delivers some of Betty's meals, while Gwyn prepares the rest and generally cares for her, although has his own problems with complications from thrombosis.\nHe said he struggled to secure more appropriate residential care for his mother.\nBetty has recovered from the virus, despite other medical concerns.\n\"Thank God, I'm feeling better,\" she said. \"I was sorry to lose Rita. She was my best friend.\"\nAs for Gwyn: \"He's good as gold. He's a good boy, a good son,\" she laughed, adding: \"The way I brought him up.\"\nWith restrictions being lifted around the UK, Gwyn has particular worries.\n\"I really think it's too soon. People should take great care when you're talking about dispensing with face masks in school, do we really know what we're doing?\n\"It's one heck of a rush. Do we really need to push so hard to perhaps dispense with many of the benefits that have already accrued?\n\"Where is freedom coming from or those who go on to follow myself, my family, and catch the same virus and perhaps also have a death in the family?\"\nWhile he does his best to shape out a new life, Gwyn has a cherished memory. Across the garden from the shed he refers to as the \"man cave\" is what Rita called her \"she shed\", which has her initials on the outside.\nA treasured photo captures a special moment.\n\"She's standing there at the door, queen of her domain, looking really,\" he took a long pause, \"really happy. My abiding memory\"."

      "tags": "Metropolitan Police Service,Birmingham,Wembley Stadium",
      "text": "The Met Police has denied its policing operation at the Euro 2020 final failed, claiming it had warned Wembley that many ticketless fans were on the way.\nFans fought with stewards and police as they attempted to break through gates for Sunday's England v Italy match at the stadium.\nThe force said police action may have prevented the match being called off.\nPolice and the Football Association are reviewing how the match was handled.\nOne football supporter who got in without a ticket told the BBC that stewards were accepting bribes as fans broke in through a disabled entrance.\nThe man, from Birmingham, said he had joined a social media chat group called \"Wembley Jib\" where between 3,000 and 4,000 people exchanged tactics for breaking into the stadium. \n\"Jibbing\" is football slang for getting in without paying.\nHe said: \"When we got there at 13:00 we were hanging around and a Wembley steward came up asking if we'd got tickets. We said no and he said 'do you want to give me money to get in?'\"\n\"He said it would be \u00a3500 each. I had only taken out \u00a3250 for a bribe.\"\nThe fan claimed that even when people were thrown out of the stadium they were not escorted away and simply tried to get back in.\n\"There were police officers there about 50 in groups of 10. They were standing too far back though, weren't getting involved or were too late if something happened.\"\nThe FA said the majority of the trouble happened in areas that were the responsibility of police.\nThe Met's statement appeared to be aimed at defending itself against suggestions poor policing was to blame for an incident which may threaten Britain's chances of bidding for the 2030 World Cup.\nSources say it is unusual for officers in riot gear to be sent from the start in such large numbers to police a football match.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors said the operation at Wembley was \"one of the most significant and comprehensive policing plans the Met has ever committed to a football match of this scale\".\nShe said: \"Police commanders recognised this could result in ticketless fans attempting to get into the stadium; they updated security officials at Wembley of this risk.\"\nShe added that stewards at the stadium became \"overwhelmed\" soon after the gates opened. \n\"I do not accept that the policing operation failed and I stand by the difficult decisions made by police officers and the Met's public order commanders,\" she said.\n\"Without their immediate intervention, it is possible that this game could have been abandoned.\"\nIn a BBC interview on Tuesday the FA claimed the majority of the trouble was in Wembley Way, outside the stadium, in an area which was the responsibility of the police.\nTwenty-six people have been arrested following events at Wembley and another 25 in central London.\nThe anonymous fan who spoke to the BBC said people were chanting \"jib, jib, jib\" and people were discussing whether to attempt it on Twitter for days before the match.\nHe and friends showed a video on their phones of an e-ticket being verified to stewards to gain access to the outer perimeter.\nThey abandoned an attempt to \"tailgate\" legitimate ticket-holders before pushing their way into the main stadium through a disabled entrance.\n\"The ticketed fans attacked those with no tickets and although once inside it wasn't crowded, there was pushing and squeezing to get in,\" the man added.\n\"If England were in a final and I didn't have a ticket I'd do it again.\"\nIt is likely many of those trying to get access did so because they knew there would be a large number of empty seats due to Covid restrictions."

      "tags": "Stockton-on-Tees,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "\"We are planning for war and praying for peace.\"\nDr Catherine Monaghan, a consultant in respiratory medicine at the University Hospital of North Tees, has worked all through the pandemic's first and second waves and now is facing up to the bleak reality of a third Covid surge.\n\"We are absolutely gutted - it's really hard - I know the whole country wants this to be over - but the reality is that's not what is happening in the hospital,\" she said.\n\"People are still critically unwell with it - I cannot quite believe we're back at this stage again - it's really worrying.\"\nStaff, already exhausted, she said, were demoralised at having to reopen a Covid ward which required full protective equipment.\n\"Nurses understandably are really distressed at having to go through this again - having to put on the full PPE - it's very stressful.\"\nThe hospital, in Stockton-on-Tees, currently has 22 Covid patients, five of whom are in intensive care. That is a lot less than the peak in January - but the number has increased sharply from just six in a single week.\nThe average ages are lower than during the first two waves, and at least two of the seriously ill patients are in their 30s and unvaccinated.\nThe north-east of England has seen a surge in cases with eight out of the current top 10 hotspots in the UK.  \nAlmost all the cases nationally involve the Delta variant which first started surging in the north-west of England and Glasgow, so its spread through the North East is unsurprising. The demographics in urban areas are similar, with health inequalities and social deprivation and underlying health conditions leaving some patients vulnerable.\nThe number of hospital patients with Covid is above where it was in early April, a trend already seen in the north-west of England. Services are being stretched because of high demand and staff needing to isolate.\nHealth leaders in South Tyneside and Sunderland have made an appeal to the public to stick carefully to social distancing guidelines, to wear face masks in all health settings and to get the vaccine as soon as possible. Visits to adult wards have been suspended at three sites.\nOn Teesside there has been a plea to people to act with caution, and to continue with face coverings when recommended even after legal restrictions in England are lifted on 19 July.\nAndy Preston, the elected mayor of Middlesbrough, told the BBC: \"We are putting a message out in Middlesbrough that rates are ballooning. This thing is spreading like wildfire across the whole region. \n\"We are not saying to panic, we are not saying for people to be terrified. We are saying to people just be really careful. \n\"This is now about schools, it's about businesses, it's about jobs and it's about mental wellbeing. People are getting pinged on apps left right and centre. They are being frightened, confused, don't know what to do.\"\nLocal resident Sandra Forsyth told us that she regretted not getting vaccinated when she contracted Covid: \"It's a nightmare. Out of breath. Just awful. I was hospitalised for a day and we've had the ambulance out to me as well because it's all on the chest.\" \nShe said she would get a jab as soon as possible and she urged others who hadn't done so to think again.\nAt the University Hospital of North Tees, they are continuing to provide normal cancer services and non-urgent care.  \nBut Chris Tulloch, deputy medical director of North Tees and Hartlepool Foundation Trust, says with case numbers predicted to continue rising into August, the situation could become more challenging.\n\"We are coping, but I would say we are just coping. And if things get more serious I think it will be more difficult to deal with, and we may have to make difficult decisions about what we are treating. \n\"We did have to stop our elective surgery programme last year because we needed the staff from theatre, who have the expertise in ventilation and looking after the critically ill, to look after patients with Covid.\"\nHospital staff say they understand the desire of people to regain some of the freedoms lost during lockdown, but they are worried about the implications if all social distancing is immediately abandoned.  \nDr Monaghan says the NHS will cope but the behaviour of local communities from 19 July will determine how serious the challenge will be.\n\"We are praying that the public do maintain some sense of perspective on this - somewhere between everybody being locked down and getting what they want.\" "

      "text": "Investigators have seized computers after searches at two homes over the leaking of CCTV footage of Matt Hancock kissing an aide in his office.\nThe images, published by the Sun last month, led to Mr Hancock resigning as health secretary after he admitted breaking social distancing rules.\nThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said raids were carried out as it investigates an alleged data breach.\nThe Sun says an \"angry whistleblower\" first alerted it to the images.\nBut the newspaper's editor, Victoria Newton, has stated she would rather go to prison than reveal the leaker's identity.\nMr Hancock, who is married with three children, resigned on 27 June after the images of him kissing his long-time friend and former aide Gina Coladangelo were published two days earlier.\nHis relationship with the married mother-of-three is understood to be serious, with Mr Hancock having ended his own 15-year marriage.\nThe ICO announced on Thursday that it had set up an inquiry into the images leak.\nIt said the Department of Health and Social Care and the security and property management firm Emcor had submitted a complaint, alleging the CCTV stills had been taken without permission.\nOfficers searched two homes in southern England on Thursday, seizing personal computer equipment and electronic devices.\nSteve Eckersley, the ICO's director of investigations, said: \"It's vital that all people, which includes the employees of government departments and members of the public who interact with them, have trust and confidence in the protection of their personal data. \n\"In these circumstances, the ICO aims to react swiftly and effectively to investigate where there is a risk that other people may have unlawfully obtained personal data. We have an ongoing investigation and will not be commenting further until it is concluded.\"\nAfter the pictures were published, concerns were raised over security within government buildings.\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said he had asked for his own office to be swept for \"unauthorised devices\", telling Sky News this was to prevent any chance of a \"national security breach\".\nBut Ms Newton wrote in the New Statesman magazine last month that the use of the pictures had been \"a serious piece of responsible journalism\" about a cabinet minister \"behaving with extraordinary hypocrisy\".\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We take the security of our personnel, systems and estates extremely seriously and the department will continue to engage and cooperate with the Information Commissioner's Office while they assess the information provided.\""

      "tags": "Ministry of Justice,High Court ,Legal profession,BAME communities,Representation",
      "text": "Lawyers from most minority backgrounds are now more likely than their white counterparts to want to become judges - but less likely to succeed. \nLatest statistics reveal that while the proportion of black, Asian or minority ethnic solicitors and barristers wanting to oversee justice has significantly increased, the body that recommends who is appointed is generally less likely to put their names forward.\nA breakdown of the figures for three years shows the chances of black candidates being recommended are lower than those for any other minority group. \nThe proportion of judges from Asian and other ethnic backgrounds has been increasing since 2014, but the proportion who are black has remained the same.\nOf the 5,000 judges in post in courts and tribunals across England and Wales, 5% are Asian or Asian British, and 1% are black.\nIn the most senior and important roles, such as the High Court, the proportion of people belonging to ethnic minorities presiding over cases remains far lower than in other areas of justice. \nThe data revealing the continuing disparities covers 93 selection and recommendation exercises carried out over three years by the Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC). \nThe JAC reviews applications from qualified and experienced lawyers who want to switch into judicial roles in England and Wales. It recommends candidates to the prime minister, for the Queen to confirm. \nDiversity targets for judges the 'wrong way'\nEthnic minority offenders 'face bias'\nThe annual report on judicial diversity published by the Ministry of Justice said that while change in the system was slow, due to the long careers many judges serve, data over three years had revealed \"varying disparities\" that needed to be more closely examined.\nIt found that while almost a quarter of applications for judicial positions were now coming from black, Asian and other minority groups, only 12% of those candidates made it through. \n\"The recommendation rates from the eligible pool for Asian candidates were an estimated 36% lower than for white candidates,\" said the report.\n\"Rates for black candidates were an estimated 73% lower than for white candidates. In contrast, recommendation rates from the eligible pool for mixed ethnicity candidates were an estimated 82% higher than for white candidates. \n\"All of these rate differences are statistically significant, meaning that we can be confident that there are real differences between ethnicity groups in terms of rates of progression through to the judiciary.\"\nI. Stephanie Boyce, president of the Law Society, the professional body for solicitors, said: \"When the intersection of gender, ethnicity and professional background is considered, these disparities are brought into sharper relief.\n\"While we are encouraged by the slight increase in the percentage of women in the judiciary, we remain very concerned as to lower success rates in the judicial applications process and the slower progression through the judiciary for black, Asian and minority ethnic groups and for solicitors.\"\nAnd Derek Sweeting QC, chairman of the Bar Council, the body for barristers, said the profession didn't know why the disparities were still continuing, despite efforts to improve diversity. \n\"Until we understand whether there is a problem in the appointment process, or whether the issue is experience - or both - we are operating in the dark,\" said Mr Sweeting. \nThe Judicial Appointments Commission has been contacted for comment.

He died on 9 March 2021, aged 67. \nHis colleagues thought highly of him, saying: \"We have many happy memories of shifts together, laughs, nights out, and listening to all his stories of his many holidays abroad. We will miss him.\"\nBernadette White, his sister, said he was a caring, gentle and loving man with a wicked sense of humour. \nShe added: \"The last seven years, I would say, is when David started to live his life, doing the things that made him happy without having to worry about anyone else.\"\nStephen Stewart met his future wife, Heather, at a youth club when he was just 14. They got engaged on his 17th birthday and he had just turned 20 when they married. \nThe couple, who lived in Motherwell, came from \"very different\" backgrounds but they grew up together during their 25-year marriage while raising their only child. \nStephen took pride in his work for concrete manufacturer FP McCann, latterly as a lab technician working out what strength the concrete needed to be for certain projects. \nOutside work, he loved fishing, computer games, gadgets and during the first lockdown he managed to build a hot tub shelter with the help of a series of YouTube videos. \nHe died of Covid pneumonia at University Hospital Wishaw on 19 February 2021, aged 45.\nFamily of 45-year-old Covid victim warn of dangers\nNan Douglas worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. \nShe was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. \nAfter losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. \nFollowing a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a \"living wake\" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. \nShe lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she picked up Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. \nGraeme McGrath's greatest passions were rowing and the River Clyde. \nOn the day of his funeral, fellow rowers held oars in a guard of honour at Glasgow Green in a tribute appreciated by his wife Anne and their three sons.\nFor 40 years Graeme volunteered with the Glasgow Humane Society and was often called on to row rescue boats on the Clyde, or to help evacuate families during floods. \nAfter undergoing a kidney transplant in his 50s, he was unable to get out on the river as much. He retired from his job as a Thomas Cook travel agent and moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire. \nBut he still felt the pull of the Clyde and regularly returned to the city to meet friends and row safety boats at regattas. \nHe died with Covid on 15 February 2021 at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, aged 66, after being admitted for an infection affecting his heart. \nTommy Morrow spent most of his life in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, where he met his partner Jackie and raised their children, Demi and Mark. \nHis family described him as a character and not a day went by without them laughing at his jokes. \nHe loved camping and fishing in places like Stornoway with his friends but the most important people in his life were his family, including grandchildren, Lacey and Louden. \nDuring his career he worked in various well-known hotels and restaurants in Glasgow but he had not worked for some years due to poor health, including COPD. \nHe died with Covid on 15 February 2021, aged 53. \"It was so cruel - he was so close to getting the vaccine,\" his family said. \nTommy Rooney was a bus driver for 36 years and hugely popular with colleagues at First Bus in Larbert. \nOn the day of his funeral they were among dozens of people who lined the streets and applauded as his cortege passed the depot. \nFirst Bus operations manager Jason Hackett told the Falkirk Herald that Tommy was the \"heart and soul\" of the Larbert station. \nMarried to Margaret, the Bonnybridge man had two daughters and a granddaughter who described him as a \"humble but proud family man who put everyone else's needs before his own\". \nAn avid Celtic fan, he spent much of the pandemic driving key workers to their essential duties. He died on 12 February 2021, aged 57. \nDavid Gray's first grandchild - a girl called Islay - was born in July 2020. The proud \"papa\" used to say that she was the love of his life and she gave him a reason to wake up in the morning. \nTragically, the 62-year-old only got to spend five months with her before falling ill with Covid. He died on 3 February 2021. \nDavid lived in Erskine and worked for BAE Systems for 20 years, first as a mechanical fitter then as records manager dealing with secret files for the Ministry of Defence. \nHis family describe him as \"music daft\" - he played guitar and he was performing a gig with his band in Glasgow when he met his wife, Joyce, 40 years ago. \nThey went on to have two children - Darren and Danielle - as well as his beloved Cocker Spaniels, Buster and Shimmer, who he described as his \"bairns\". \nHarry Osborne was a Dunkirk veteran whose life was full of adventures - his daughter said he was still able to recall stories until just a few days before he died. \nMr Osborne was deployed to France months after joining the Territorial Army in Glasgow, served with the 77th Highland Field Regiment of the Royal Artillery and later became a surveyor.\nFriends recall how upon joining, he promised his mother he would not swear and instead would say \"cricky jings\", which became his nickname in the forces.\nHe was also known as a keen golfer with a \"wicked sense of humour\".\nMr Osborne died from Covid-19 on 25 January, nine months after celebrating his 100th birthday. \nConnie Simpson's grandchildren say she was more like a pal than a granny - she was full of fun and laughter, and was always the first up to dance at a party. \nBorn in Kinning Park, Glasgow, she moved to the east end after marrying John who she met at the Barrowlands when they were teenagers. \nWhile John was away with the Merchant Navy, she brought up their four children in a house \"surrounded by love\", before taking work as a curtain consultant. \nShe was fabulous even in her 80s - she loved getting her hair, eyebrows and manicure done, meeting friends at Mecca Bingo in Parkhead and at a local pensioners' club. \nConnie died on 23 January 2021 at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow, aged 82. \nSheila Gartly was as \"bright as a button\" and the \"heart of our family\", her loved ones said. \nShe was born and brought up in Deskford, Moray, before marrying and moving to Keith in 1954. Widowed in 1975, she remarried but lost her second husband in 2005. \nDuring her working life she had jobs in a florist and in a fish shop - both of which she thoroughly enjoyed. \nShe loved to watch the birds in her garden, read her daily newspaper, listen to traditional Scottish music, and the spring and summer when the nights were lighter and flowers bloomed.\nIn 2019 she had surgery on a broken leg but she was recovering well.  She died with Covid on 19 January 2021, aged 86. \nAlex Goldie was an electrical engineer who latterly worked as a lecturer at Stow College in Glasgow before his retirement. \nHis family said he was a gregarious man, always interested in other people, who took great delight and pride in the antics and education of his two great-grandsons, Charlie and Joe. \nDuring his long life he enjoyed skiing, tennis, pottery, sailing, golf, holidays in Europe, Australia and North America, single malts and red wine. \nHe had been well cared for by Randolph Hill nursing home in Dunblane for 19 months after developing dementia. Covid restrictions meant he had not seen his family, other than by Skype, for a year. \nHe is thought to have contracted the virus on a trip to A&E after a fall. He died on 14 January, aged 100. \nVincent Logan became one of the youngest bishops in the world when he was ordained Bishop of Dunkeld in 1981, aged 39. \nHe served the Roman Catholic diocese for almost 32 years before his retirement in 2012. \nThe Scottish Catholic Church said he was \"dedicated and energetic\" and had \"an energy and zeal in all he did\".\nBorn in Bathgate in 1941, he was ordained a priest in Edinburgh in 1964. He died on 14 January, aged 79, the day after his friend the Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia. \n\"Both bishops succumbed to the lethal effects of the coronavirus,\" the current Bishop of Dunkeld, Stephen Robson, added. \nThe Archbishop of Glasgow, the Most Reverend Philip Tartaglia, died suddenly at his home in the city on 13 January - the Feast of St Mungo, the Patron Saint of Glasgow. \nHe had been self-isolating after testing positive for Covid shortly after Christmas. \nBorn in Glasgow in 1951, he was ordained a priest in 1975 and had served as leader of Scotland's largest Catholic community since 2012.\nScotland's Catholic bishops described Archbishop Tartaglia as a \"gentle, caring and warm-hearted pastor who combined compassion with a piercing intellect\".\nAmong those who paid tribute were First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken, who described the archbishop as \"a true Glaswegian\". \nArchbishop of Glasgow dies after contracting Covid\nLiz Shingleston was a well-known figure in the village of Dunragit and her death on 13 January had a big impact on the small community near Stranraer. \n\"Her hearse passed the bottom of the village and the amount of people who turned out to pay their respects was overwhelming,\" said her daughter, Lisa. \nLiz spent her early childhood in New Luce but moved to the railway station cottage in Dunragit where her father worked as a signalman. \nDuring a varied working life, Liz left school to work in the laboratory of the nearby Nestle factory and later replaced her own mother as the local school's dinner lady. \nThe 73-year-old was devoted to her grandchildren and great-grandson but she also liked to treat herself to afternoon tea (with Prosecco) at Trump Turnberry. \nHugh Polland, who was known as Shug to his friends and family, was born and raised in Glasgow's Easterhouse. \nHe was well known in the area where he ran the Casbah Pub for many years during the 1980s and early 90s. \nA huge Celtic fan, he loved to play golf and took up photography later in life - becoming \"unofficial photographer\" at many friends' weddings, christening and parties. \n\"Everyone wanted him at their party not just to take photos but because of his personality,\" said his son, Tony McAllister. \"Everyone loved him because what you seen is what you got.\"\nShug died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 5 January, aged 70. His sudden death has left his family heartbroken. \nFor more than 75 years George Wight lived on his dairy farm in the village of Drumoak in Aberdeenshire. \nBut he had more than one string to his bow - as well as being a dairy farmer, for 25 years he was also the publican of his local, the Irvine Arms. \nA loyal Aberdeen FC fan, he was one of the lucky ones - he was in Gothenburg in 1983 to see the his beloved Dons lift the European Cup Winners Cup. \nHe was devoted to his family, including wife Claire and their four children, and despite suffering a series of bereavements and health setbacks, he always bounced back. \n\"He was an inspiration and a hardy soul who kept going no matter what life threw at him,\" they said. George died at a nursing home on 4 January 2021, aged 85.\nHugh Bell loved to dance. As a young man, when he doing his national service with the RAF, he was a regular at the dancing at the YMCA in Paisley. \nIt was there he met the love of his life, Margaret. They were married for 63 years and had two children Alan and Stuart.

      "text": "A Welsh woman has arrived back in the UK after being cleared of drug offences in Kuwait. \nSara Assayed, 35, had been held in a prison in Kuwait despite being cleared of drugs charges more than a month ago. \nShe had been sentenced to 10 years in prison last March after police claimed to find drugs in a car she was using.\nMs Assayed, who had lived in Kuwait City since she was 17 and worked as a primary school teacher, arrived at Heathrow Airport at about 13:20 BST.\nHer conviction had been overturned on 15 June after an appeal court judge in Kuwait ruled there was insufficient evidence in her case. \nNivin Marafi, her lawyer in Kuwait, said she was delighted her client was finally on her way back home. \nShe said: \"I was really happy when I heard she was flying.\n\"She was really happy to go home. Everyone was helping me in the courts and the department and we feel we did something very good for this lady.\"\nShe said Ms Assayed's story was well known in Kuwait and said the delay in her deportation following the conviction being overturned had been made more difficult because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMs Marafi, a women's rights lawyer, said securing Ms Assayed's exit from Kuwait following her arrest in March 2019 was an emotional moment.\nShe said: \"I was really crying because I was really happy to give freedom for a human, as lawyers are always asking for freedom.\n\"I feel really happy that a human and a lady got her rights.\"\nMs Assayed's parents, Helen Conibear and Ziad Assayed, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, previously said conditions in the Kuwaiti prison were \"overcrowded and inhumane\".

      "text": "North America experienced its warmest June on record, according to the EU's Earth observation programme.\nThat will come as no surprise given the unprecedentedly high temperatures recently recorded during the heatwave that hit Canada and parts of the US.\nBut UK residents may be startled to learn that despite the rain and cloud they experienced, it was the second warmest June on record for Europe.\nIt was also the fourth warmest June ever recorded worldwide.\nCopernicus, the EU's Earth observation programme, produces its figures for world temperatures from computer-generated analyses using billions of measurements from satellites, aircraft and weather stations around the world.  \nClimate experts say the findings point to a frightening escalation in temperature extremes.  \n\"We are getting used to record high temperatures being recorded somewhere around the world every year now,\" says Prof Peter Stott of the UK Met Office.  \nHe says what meteorologists like him find shocking is not that the world is experiencing more heatwaves but that temperature records are increasingly being broken by such large margins.\nIn Canada and the north-western US, several cities recorded temperatures a full 5 degrees Celsius above previous records. \nA Siberian heatwave last year saw temperatures more than 5C above the previous record between January and June.\nA study by the Met Office on the extreme heat in the Russian region found that reaching such temperatures was almost impossible without human-caused climate change.\nIt anticipates similar results from studies of the Canadian heatwave.  \nIts initial calculations suggest the odds of the sort of temperatures experienced in Canada occurring without climate change are very low indeed, says Professor Stott.\n\"It is telling us that changes in average climate are leading to rapid escalation not just of extreme temperatures, but of extraordinarily extreme temperatures,\" he adds. \nThat is exactly what the science says we should expect, Prof Friederike Otto of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University told the BBC.\n\"Every decade the world has increased the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and that has increased the rate of warming. So, of course, heat records are being broken more frequently,\" she maintains.\nProf Otto believes the risks from the increasing number of heatwaves the world now experiences is not taken seriously enough.\nStorms and flood provide dramatic before-and-after images and cause widespread damage to property.\nHeatwaves, by contrast, do not leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Prof Otto describes them as \"silent killers\".\n\"People rarely drop dead on the street, but die quietly in their poorly insulated and un-air-conditioned homes.\"\nIndeed, how many victims these events claim is often only apparent months after the event when statisticians can calculate excess mortality.  \nProf Otto says even if we do manage to achieve the dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that many countries around the world are now committed to, we will still see more frequent and more intense heatwaves than we have today.\nShe advises that, alongside cutting carbon emissions, we should be investing in adaption and resilience to ensure our communities can withstand the higher temperatures we can expect in the future.

      "tags": "Spotify,Streaming,Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport,Apple,Music",
      "text": "The music industry is weighted against artists, with even successful pop stars seeing \"pitiful returns\" from streaming, a committee of MPs has said.\nThey are calling for a \"complete reset\" of the market, with musicians given a \"fair share\" of the \u00a3736.5 million that UK record labels earn from streaming.\nIn a report, they said royalties should be split 50/50, instead of the current rate, where artists receive about 16%.\nThe findings came after a six-month inquiry into music streaming.\n\"While streaming has brought significant profits to the recorded music industry, the talent behind it - performers, songwriters and composers - are losing out,\" said Julian Knight, MP, who chairs parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee.\n\"Only a complete reset of streaming that enshrines in law their rights to a fair share of the earnings will do.\" \nThe findings will be seen as a victory by pop stars like Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Melanie C, Wolf Alice and Jessie Ware, who recently called on the Prime Minister to reform the way musicians get paid when their songs are streamed.\nMusician Tom Gray, whose #BrokenRecord campaign prompted the inquiry, said he was \"overjoyed\" by the findings.\n\"It feels like a massive vindication,\" he said. \"They've really come to the same conclusions that we've been saying for a very long time.\"\nThe BPI, which represents the UK recorded music industry, was more cautious. \nIt said streaming was \"enabling more artists than ever\" to earn a \"long-term, sustainable income\" and that new policies should be properly examined to ensure against \"unintended consequences for investment into new talent\".\nAt present, Spotify is believed to pay between \u00a30.002 and \u00a30.0038 per stream, while Apple Music pays about \u00a30.0059. YouTube pays the least - about \u00a30.00052 (or 0.05 pence) per stream.\nAll that money goes to rights-holders, a blanket term that covers everything from massive record companies to artists who release their own music. That money is then divided up between everyone involved in making the record.\nOften, the recording artist will only receive about 13% of the revenue, with labels and publishers keeping the rest.\nArtists who release their own music, or who work with independent labels and distribution companies, tend to get a higher share.\nA survey by the Ivors Academy and Musicians' Union found that in 2019, 82% of professional musicians made less than \u00a3200 from streaming, whilst only 7% made more than \u00a31,000.\nThe hearings were full of testy exchanges. Some witnesses said they were scared to speak out for fear of reprisals; and the head of one record label was described as \"living in cloud cuckoo land\" after he claimed artists were happy with the music streaming model.\nMercury Prize nominee Nadine Shah made headlines after telling the committee she had been forced to move back in with her parents because \"earnings from my streaming are not significant enough to keep the wolf away from the door\".\nPop songwriter Fiona Bevan revealed she'd earned just \u00a3100 for a track on Kylie Minogue's number one album, Disco. \"Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,\" she told MPs. \"It's quite shameful.\"\nChic's Nile Rodgers said that the finances of streaming are shrouded in secrecy, adding: \"We don't even know what a stream is worth and there's no way you could even find out what a stream is worth, and that's not a good relationship.\"\nThe three major labels - Sony, Universal and Warner Music - faced some of the toughest questioning of the inquiry, and were accused of a \"lack of clarity\" by MPs.\nThey largely argued to maintain the status quo, saying any disruption could damage investment in new music, and resisted the idea that streaming was comparable to radio - where artists receive a 50/50 royalty split.\n\"Streaming is 24-7 in every country in the world, you can listen to the greatest record store ever - it's clearly a sale, it's not radio, it's on-demand,\" said David Joseph, CEO of Universal Music UK.\nRepresentatives from the streaming companies suggested they were \"open-minded\" about changing the royalty system, but noted that 70% of their income already goes to labels, publishers and artists.\n\"It is a narrow-margin business, so it wouldn't actually take that much to upset the so-called apple cart,\" said Apple Music's Elena Segal.\nThe committee's report said streaming had \"undoubtedly helped save the music industry\" after decades of piracy, \"but it is clear that what has been saved does not work for everyone\".\nThey recommended that the government pass legislation to give performers the right to \"equitable remuneration\", whereby labels and artists receive an equal share of streaming royalties.\nThe report called it a \"simple yet effective solution\", as the right already exists in UK law when songs are played on radio and TV. \nMPs also raised \"deep concerns\" about the dominance of the major music companies, and urged the government to refer the case to the Competition and Markets Authority.\nOther recommendations included:\nThe committee also expressed concerns that \"the economics of streaming entrench historically successful artists and create barriers for new performers\", with perennial hits by Abba, Queen and Fleetwood Mac starving up-and-coming musicians of opportunities.\nFigures released yesterday showed that new music accounted for just 33% of the music streamed in the US this year, with older songs dominating people's listening choices.\nThe streaming services themselves largely escaped criticism, but MPs said YouTube's dominance was a cause for concern - citing figures that it accounts for 51% of music streaming while contributing 7% of music industry revenue.\nThey warned that users' ability to upload music to YouTube without licensing it from record labels gave it an \"unfair advantage\"; and urged the government to introduce \"legally enforceable obligations to normalise licensing arrangements\" on sites that host user-generated videos, such as YouTube, TikTok and Facebook.\nTom Gray said the report confirmed what his #BrokenRecord campaign had been telling record labels all along: \"That their business model needs to change and that they need to face the reality of that and get on with it\".\nHe said he hoped the government would enact the recommendations quickly, potentially by acting on a private member's bill by Labour MP Kevin Brennan that seeks to change copyright laws around streaming.\n\"This is something that they can do for the British cultural sector, where they don't have to go and negotiate with Brussels,\" he told the BBC. \"If they want to help British creators, inventors and performers, this is something they can just do.\"\nThe Association of Independent Music (AIM) welcomed the report's praise for independent record labels, who traditionally pay higher royalty rates to their artists.\n\"However, our view is that equitable remuneration will not deliver the outcome they are hoping for,\" said CEO Paul Pacifico. \"It is a 20th Century solution not fit for the 21st Century digital market and will leave the next generation of artists worse off.\"\nThe BPI argued that streaming worked in artists' favour - with 2,000 artists set to achieve 10 million streams this year, the equivalent of selling 10,000 CDs, or making about \u00a329,000. It warned unpicking the current system could damage investment in new music.\n\"When considering this report, the Government also needs to consider the vital role that labels play as the leading investors into artists' careers, with investment in artists by record labels growing year-on-year,\" said CEO Geoff Taylor.\n\"We will carefully examine the findings of this report, but it is essential that any policy proposals avoid unintended consequences for investment into new talent, and do not imperil this country's extraordinary global success in music.\"\nMeanwhile, the Musicians Union called the report \"revolutionary\". \n\"It grasps the issue, identifies the problems and recommends achievable and practical solutions, which won't cost the taxpayer a penny,\" said general secretary Horace Trubridge.\nIn a joint statement, the Featured Artists Coalition and Music Managers Forum said the \"landmark\" report could \"fundamentally improve\" the economic situation for thousands of musicians.\n\"This is a once in a lifetime moment to reset our business along fairer and more equitable lines, it is not an opportunity to be wasted.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Google has been criticised for suggesting routes up Ben Nevis and other Munros which are \"potentially fatal\" and direct people off a cliff. \nScottish mountaineering charities have urged hill-walkers not to use Google Maps to guide them up the mountains. \nThey said there have been a number of recent incidents involving routes downloaded off the internet which have resulted in \"injury or worse\". \nGoogle told BBC Scotland it was investigating the issue. \nEarlier the John Muir Trust, which looks after the summit of Ben Nevis, said it has attempted to raise the issue with the internet giant but its approaches have been \"met with silence\". \nThe charities said certain searches for the route up Ben Nevis on Google Maps direct people to the car park nearest the summit as the crow flies. \nHowever they describe the route from that point as \"highly dangerous, even for experienced climbers\".\nNathan Berrie, the trust's Nevis conservation officer, said they often come across groups of inexperienced walkers heading towards Steall Falls or up the south slopes of Ben Nevis. \nHeather Morning, Mountaineering Scotland's mountain safety adviser, said: \"For those new to hill walking, it would seem perfectly logical to check out Google Maps for information on how to get to your chosen mountain. \n\"But when you input Ben Nevis and click on the 'car' icon, up pops a map of your route, taking you to the car park at the head of Glen Nevis, followed by a dotted line appearing to show a route to the summit.\" \nShe added: \"Even the most experienced mountaineer would have difficulty following this route.  \n\"The line goes through very steep, rocky, and pathless terrain where even in good visibility it would be challenging to find a safe line.  \n\"Add in low cloud and rain and the suggested Google line is potentially fatal.\"\nOther popular Munros have also fallen foul of the app. \nThe charity said for An Teallach in the north-west, a \"walking\" route suggested by search engine would take people over a cliff.\nMs Morning said: \"It's all too easy to assume that information on the internet is all good stuff, correct, up to date and safe.  \n\"Sadly, experience shows this is not the case and there have been a number of incidents recently where following routes downloaded off the internet have resulted in injury or worse.\"\nShe added: \"Walkers and climbers with even a little experience will know to read information from a map, whether digital or paper, and if they are looking for downloadable routes know to use reputable sources and check several sources to ensure the information they are accessing is the right route for their level of experience and ability.\"\nMountaineering Scotland and John Muir Trust recommended climbers cross-check information on a map or consult a local guide. \nA spokesperson for Google said: \"We built Google Maps with safety and reliability in mind, and are working quickly to investigate the routing issue on Ben Nevis. \n\"In addition to using authoritative data and high definition imagery to update the map, we encourage local organisations to provide geographic information about roads and routes through our Geo Data Upload tool.\""

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has set out the \"skeleton\" of a plan to \"level up\" the country, by spreading power and opportunity more evenly.\nIn a speech in Coventry, the PM insisted his flagship policy will not make the \"rich parts\" of the UK poorer but would be a \"win win\" for everyone.\nHe also pledged to hand more power to local leaders, with the possibility of elected mayors for counties.\nLabour described Mr Johnson's speech as \"gibberish nonsense\".\nThe party's deputy leader Angela Rayner dismissed the PM's promises as a \"PR exercise\", adding that Mr Johnson \"does not do detail, he does soundbites\". \n\"It is all jam tomorrow and a load of baloney. What he pretends and what he says he is going to do, is not what happens in reality.\"\nIn a wide-ranging speech, Mr Johnson said the government wanted to \"rewrite the rulebook\" on local devolution and offer county areas in England \"new deals\" to give them the same powers as those currently given to major cities.\nAnd he promised a flexible approach to those deals, including the option for directly elected mayors, but said there was no \"one-size-fits-all\" template.\nThe former London mayor urged local leaders with ideas for how to improve their communities to come forward, promising to give them \"the tools to make things happen for their communities\"..\nHe said he did not want to see the return of what he called \"loony-left\" councils, but added: \"We will deal with anybody.\" \nThe Conservatives first promised to \"level up\" the country in their manifesto for the 2019 general election, in which they targeted - and won - so-called \"red wall\" parliamentary seats in the Midlands and northern England previously dominated by Labour.\nThe plan, some of which has already been outlined, involves investing in transport, skills and businesses to address regional disparities.\nThe government is expected to publish more details in September.\nAsked what his clear strategy was for \"levelling up\", he said: \"I am respectfully going to urge you to just go back over some of what I said because I do think that in all fairness there was at least the skeleton of what to do.\"\nBoris Johnson again tried to explain the purpose of the \"levelling up\" agenda and talked about the UK's huge regional imbalances, entrenched inequalities and squandered opportunities.\nIn well-trailed remarks he also said that the aim of getting more government spending and private investment into poorer parts of the UK would not come at the detriment of London and the south east - an attempt to reassure traditional Tory voters who might be feeling left out themselves.\nIn terms of policy prescription the speech was fairly thin. \nA White Paper is promised in the autumn and today Mr Johnson clattered through a list of things - from tackling crime, building football pitches, laying railway lines - that he seemed to say all fell under the umbrella of levelling up. \nBut he also proposed greater regional devolution and suggested county leaders could get new powers. \nHe said if anyone could think of a better title than county mayors they should email him, which rather summed up the speech.\nIn his speech, the prime minister said the government will have \"made progress in levelling up when we have begun to raise living standards, spread opportunity, improved our public services and restored people's sense of pride in their community\".\nInvesting in more deprived areas will relieve pressure on parts of the UK that are \"over-heating\" and that previous governments focused too much on \"areas where house prices are already high and where transport is already congested\", he added.\nBut he insisted that there will not be \"levelling down\" in prosperous places, adding: \"We don't want to decapitate the tall poppies.\n\"We don't think you can make the poor parts of the country richer by making the rich parts poorer.\"\nHe said that \"levelling up is not a jam-spreading operation. It's not robbing Peter to pay Paul. It's not zero-sum. It's win-win\".\nThe PM's speech was welcomed by county councils.\nCounty Councils Network spokesman Martin Hill said: \"Local areas should be able to decide the most appropriate devolution arrangements for counties\".\nHe added: \"We are pleased that this looks firmly on the table.\""

Two suspects were arrested.\nMr de Vries had won critical acclaim for his reporting on the Dutch underworld - including the 1983 kidnapping of the beer millionaire Freddy Heineken.\nThe statement released by his relatives on Thursday said he died \"surrounded by the people who love him\". \n\"Peter has lived by his conviction: 'On bended knee is no way to be free',\" the statement added. \nThe family asked for space to process his death in peace.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the veteran journalist was \"afraid of nothing and no-one\". \n\"We owe it to Peter R de Vries to ensure that justice takes its course,\" he tweeted.\nMr de Vries was attacked on the evening of 6 July while walking away from a television studio following a chat show on the Lange Leidsedwarsstraat in central Amsterdam.\nFive shots were fired at close range and he was hit in the head.\nHis son, Royce de Vries, said at the time that the family's \"worst nightmare came true\".\nWell known for his coverage of the criminal underworld, Mr de Vries covered many high-profile crimes, including the Heineken abduction.\nIn 2013, Mr Heineken's kidnapper, Willem Holleeder, was convicted of making threats against the journalist.\nOne of the Netherlands' most notorious gangsters, Holleeder was given a life sentence in 2019 for his involvement in five murders.\nA novel Mr de Vries wrote about the case was later adapted into the movie Kidnapping Freddy Heineken, starring Anthony Hopkins.\nThe journalist also won an Emmy Award for a television show he made about Natalee Holloway, a US teenager who disappeared on the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2005.\nHe frequently acted as a spokesman for witnesses in police or court cases, and had been acting as an adviser to Nabil B, a former gang member testifying in the case against alleged drug lord Ridouan Taghi.\nMr de Vries had previously faced danger because of his work and needed police protection after receiving threats in connection with his coverage of criminal cases. \nIn 2019, police told him he was on the hit list of the Netherlands' most wanted criminal.\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted her condolences, with the message: \"Investigative journalists are vital to our democracies. We must do everything we can to protect them.\"\nThe two men held on suspicion of the murder are a 21-year-old from Rotterdam and a 35-year-old Pole. Police have not described them in any detail."

We have recently set out further details of the Sustainable Farming Incentive, which will eventually be open to every farmer in England.\""

The latest figures on hospitalisations, emerging variants and trials will also be taken into account at that point, and could change their advice.\nIn the meantime, the JCVI's advice is to offer a third Covid jab (and a flu jab) to the following people from September 2021:\nAfter those groups, it will be:\nProf Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 chair for JCVI, said all these groups would also be eligible for the annual flu vaccine and were strongly advised to have it.\nYounger adults will be not be given a third dose, because they will only have had their second dose in the summer, although this decision will be revisited at a later time, the JCVI said."

      "text": "Sugar and salt should be taxed and vegetables prescribed by the NHS, an independent review of the food we eat has suggested.\nThe report, led by businessman Henry Dimbleby, said taxes raised could extend free school meal provision and support better diets among the poorest.\nEngland's National Food Strategy also wants GPs to try prescribing fruit and vegetables to encourage healthy eating.\nBoris Johnson said he was not attracted to extra taxes on hard-working people.\nThe prime minister added he would study the report, and promised the government would respond with proposals for future laws within six months.\nMeanwhile, the food industry warned new taxes on wholesale sugar and salt could lead to higher food prices in shops.\nIan Wright, of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said: \"Obesity and food is very much about poverty, and we need measures to tackle poverty and to help people to make choices they need to make.\"\nThe review, commissioned by the government in 2019, said historic reforms of the food system are needed to protect the NHS, improve the health of the nation and save the environment.\nThe new taxes would be applied to wholesale sugar and salt purchased by manufacturers, which could in turn raise some prices on shelves.\nBut Mr Dimbleby said: \"We do not actually believe that for most things it will hike the price - what it will do is it will reformulate, it will make people take sugar and salt out.\"\nThe review described the Covid-19 pandemic as a \"painful reality check\" that has revealed the scale of food-related ill-health. \n\"Our high obesity rate has been a major factor in the UK's tragically high death rate,\" said Mr Dimbleby, who co-founded the fast food chain Leon.  \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the focus should turn to preventing people getting to the NHS.\nHe said his proposals - if implemented in full - could save 38 calories per person per day, helping the average person lose 2kg (4.4lb) in weight a year.\nAsked if this was an example of the nanny state where the posh tell the poor what is good for them, Mr Dimbleby said \"it's only posh people who ever say that to me... if you go to communities, they really want to change our food system\".\nPsychologist David Halpern, who advises the government, told Today taxing sugar and salt could act as a \"double nudge\" on behaviour.\nHe compared the concept to the sugar levy on soft drinks, introduced in April 2018 and which drove manufacturers to remove sugar from products through reformulation.\nHe added that levy led to a reduction of sugar added into soft drinks of about a third, while sales also rose at the same time.\nPoor diet contributes to 64,000 deaths a year in England alone and costs the economy \u00a374bn, the review said.\nIt claims more than half of over-45s now live with diet-related health conditions.\nAnd our eating habits are not just damaging our health, they are also destroying the environment, the review warned.  \nThe food we eat accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the review.  \nThe global food system is the single biggest contributor to biodiversity loss, deforestation, drought, freshwater pollution and the collapse of aquatic wildlife, said the review. \nIt is also the second-biggest contributor to climate change, after the energy industry. \nCalorie for calorie, highly processed foods are three times cheaper than healthy food, the report found.  \nThe review recommended the new tax be set at \u00a33/kg for sugar and \u00a36/kg for salt sold wholesale for use in processed foods, or in restaurants and catering businesses.\nThis would represent a very dramatic increase in the cost of these two important ingredients.\nThe tax could raise as much as \u00a33.4bn a year, the review team calculated.\nBut the previous sugar levy on soft drinks brought in less tax revenue than expected because manufacturers voluntarily reduced the amount of sugar to avoid it.\nThe National Food Strategy recognised that by raising prices of some products the sugar and salt tax would be likely to put extra financial strain on the poorest families.\nIn a series of recommendations designed to get fresh food and ingredients to low-income households with children, it recommended:\nIt encouraged the government to set a target to reduce the nation's meat consumption by 30% over 10 years.\nOther recommendations included helping farmers transition to more sustainable farming methods and dividing land equally between high intensity farming, environment-friendly low-intensity agriculture and nature reserves.\nThe first part of the two-part review was published last summer and looked at food as part of trade deals and farming payments.\nRestaurateur and Great British Bake-Off judge Prue Leith called it \"a compelling and overdue plan of action\" which, if adopted, would put \"our food system on the right path to health and prosperity\".\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas said she wanted to see government policies designed to meet Mr Dimbleby's recommendations but feared it could end up being ignored. \nAdditional reporting by Marie Jackson and George Bowden."

I'm disgusted there are individuals out there who think it's acceptable to direct such abhorrent abuse at them, or at anybody else.\"\nHe said the investigation would continue to try to find those responsible and officers were working closely with social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate has said the racist abuse aimed at Rashford, Sancho and Saka was \"unforgivable\".\nAnd Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to ban people guilty of sending racist abuse to footballers from attending matches.\nHe said he would ensure the \"football banning order regime is changed\" to crack down on racism.\nThe UK Football Policing Unit said, as of 13 July, 897 football-related incidents and 264 arrests had been recorded across the country in the 24-hour period surrounding the final.

      "tags": "Palm oil,Indonesia,Forest",
      "text": "A Korean palm oil giant has been rejected from the world's leading green certification body in the wake of a BBC investigation. \nThe BBC had earlier found evidence  that the Korindo group had been buying up swathes of Asia's largest remaining rainforests in the remote Indonesian province of Papua. \nA visual analysis suggested that fires had then been deliberately set to these forests, a clear violation of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).\nThe regulator's tree logo - found on paper products throughout the UK and Europe - is meant to tell consumers the product is sourced from ethical and sustainable companies. \nAt the time of the BBC's investigation late last year, the FSC said they would not expel Korindo but were working with the Korean company to address social and environmental problems. \nBut now the green body says the relationship has \"become untenable\" and Korindo's trademark licenses with FSC will be terminated from October.  \n\"We were not able to verify improvements in Korindo's social and environmental performance,\" Kim Carstensen, FSC international director general said.\nHe said the decision would \"give us clarity and a breath of fresh air while Korindo continues its efforts to improve.\" \nKorindo groups chief sustainability officer Kwangyul Peck said in a statement that the company was \"very shocked by the FSC decision.\" \nHe insists they were following all the steps of \"an agreed roadmap of improvements\" and said despite their expulsion from the FSC \"they remain committed to sustainability and human rights.\"\nKorindo controls more land in Papua than any other conglomerate.  The company has cleared nearly 60,000 hectares of forests inside its government-granted concessions - an area the size of Chicago or Seoul.\nA 2018 report by the FSC into the allegations against Korindo was never published, after legal threats from the company, but the BBC obtained a copy.\nThe report found \"evidence beyond reasonable doubt\" that Korindo's palm oil operation destroyed 30,000 hectares of high conservation forest in breach of FSC regulations and that the company was, \"on the balance of probability \u2026 supporting the violation of traditional and human rights for its own benefit.\"\nA visual investigation by the Forensic Architecture group at Goldsmiths University in London and Greenpeace International, published in conjunction with the BBC, also found evidence that indicated deliberate burning.\nKiki Taufik, head of the Greenpeace Southeast Asia forest campaign said the FSC decision was \"better late than never\" saying they had \"finally come to their senses\".\nBut he said the Indonesian government continues to \"grant companies like Korindo forest concessions, allowing them to violate the rights of indigenous people.\"\n\"It is crucial that buyers and certification bodies don't keep helping them create a facade of sustainability and transparency,\" he said. \nAfter the BBC's investigation last year, the Indonesian parliament had launched an inquiry into Korindo's conduct - though the findings have not been made public.\nThe Korindo group strongly denies starting any fires or involvement in any human rights violations, saying it follows the law.  They also insisted they paid fair compensation to tribes. \nIndonesia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil -  found in everything from shampoo to biscuits - and Papua is its newest frontier. \nThe rich forests in the remote province of Papua had until recently escaped relatively untouched, but the government has rapidly opened the area up to investors, vowing to bring prosperity to one of the poorest regions in the country. \nVast areas of forest have been cleared to make way for row upon row of oil palm trees. \nIndonesia's palm oil exports were worth about $19bn (\u00a314bn) last year, according to data from Gapki, the nation's palm oil association."

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "text": "The number of job vacancies in the UK surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the three months to June, according to new data.\nThe Office for National Statistics said there were 862,000 jobs on offer between April and June, 77,500 higher than the first three months of 2020.\nThe rise was driven by vacancies in hospitality and retailing.\nThe number of people on payrolls also grew in June, showing the biggest rise since the start of the pandemic.\nIt increased by 356,000 in June to 28.9 million.\nThere was a sharp increase in payrolls in both the food and accommodation sectors as more people returned to work, following a further easing of Covid restrictions in England during May that allowed the hospitality industry to reopen. \nSome regions of the UK saw payroll numbers rise past levels seen before Covid forced the country into lockdown, including the North East, the North West, the East Midlands and Northern Ireland.\nHowever, the ONS said the number of payroll workers remained 206,000 below pre-pandemic levels.\n\"The labour market is continuing to recover, with the number of employees on payroll up again strongly in June,\" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. \n\"However, it is still over 200,000 down on pre-pandemic levels, while a large number of workers remain on furlough.\" \nThe ONS also said that the unemployment rate was 4.8% between March and May, representing a fall from 5% between December and February. \nCommenting on the sharp rise in vacancies, Chris Gray, director at recruitment firm Manpower UK, said: \"I think what we're seeing is that we're already in a tight labour market. Employers are already having to be very creative. \n\"But some are also a little bit anxious, maybe desperate, and advertising the same job more than once, so we've got to be mindful of some of those inflated numbers.\"\nThe ONS said arts, entertainment and recreation recorded the sharpest rise in vacancies. It added that in the accommodation and food services sectors, vacancies increased by 73,400 to 102,000.\n\"In this sector, there is evidence of a shortage of skilled staff and of employees finding alternative areas of employment prior to the sector reopening,\" it said.\nThe rise in vacancies above pre-pandemic levels may sound like good news but to businesses it points to a problem: skills shortages.\n\"The recruitment difficulties faced by firms go well beyond temporary bottlenecks and with many facing an increasing skills gap, staff shortages may drag on any recovery,\" according to the British Chambers of Commerce.  \nIt combines unpleasantly with other labour market figures released today, showing that the number of UK-born workers in the workforce has dropped by more than a million from the end of 2019 to the first quarter of this year to 26.12 million. \nMeanwhile, the number of non-UK-born workers has only risen by about 200,000, according to the ONS, to 6.06 million. And the number of EU-born workers is down from 2.43 million to 2.3 million, although that fall is much smaller than many had predicted last year.\nSeeing the number of UK-born workers drop by a million is probably not what most Brexit supporters were hoping for. But, of course, it is almost certainly an effect not so much of Brexit but of the pandemic and successive lockdowns. \nSome of those UK-born workers will have re-joined the workforce since March and the reliability of the figures is questioned by some. \nBut it underlines what businesses say the labour market needs right now: retraining on a big scale to upskill those UK-born workers who've left the workforce and meet some of those skills shortages that could hold the recovery back. \nCompanies have recently told the BBC they are having difficulties recruiting staff. \nMark Lee, who runs the Red Lion Country Inn, a B&B in Yorkshire, said before the pandemic he would receive about 50 applications if he advertised a job. However, he is now struggling to fill a number of roles.\nA survey of recruitment firms by accountancy firm KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation found a number of factors contributing to problems in hiring workers, including Brexit, pandemic-related uncertainty and the furlough scheme.\nHowever, Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"While there is growing evidence that firms are finding it more difficult to hire workers, we suspect that most of these labour shortages will prove temporary and that they will be confined to a few sectors.\" \nAre you an employer struggling to recruit?\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

      "text": "People yet to take up a Covid vaccine are being told international travel will be difficult without it.\nThe Balearics have been added to the amber list from Monday, meaning only the fully vaccinated and children will be able to return to the UK without going into quarantine.\nScotland's vaccine rates have slowed since focus moved to 18-29s.\nNational clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said travel was another incentive for the cohort to get jabbed.\nIt was announced on Wednesday that Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca and Formentera were being moved onto the amber travel list for England. The Scottish and Welsh governments followed suit and Northern Ireland is expected to join them.\nThe rules take effect from 04:00 BST on Monday - 15 days after they were moved to the green watchlist.\nThe addition of popular holiday destinations to the amber list makes the requirement to have both Covid jabs more pressing for those who do not want to have to self-isolate.\nProf Leitch told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We can't promise people that when they travel the rates won't change. But we have to be able to stop the importation of cases and this is a consequence of that public health advice.\n\"It is a complex decision and not one we like to take. I love to travel. I would love to be going overseas this summer, and for business in the autumn, but I think that is getting unlikely.\"\nHe said the situation should encourage the uptake of vaccines in the lower age groups, which has so far been slow.\n\"My advice to everybody over 18 is, if travel is an incentive for you, then here is another reason - if you needed another reason other than the illness - to get yourself vaccinated,\" he said.\nLisa Rickard is due to be going to Majorca in three weeks' time.\n\"It was supposed to be an impromptu family holiday but it has grown arms and legs and turned into an absolute nightmare,\" she said.\n\"I booked for myself and my four children to go to Majorca on 4 August just for one week. \n\"But now plans are up in the air because I am not fully vaccinated and neither are my children. I have to ask work for extra time off to quarantine. It could mean me having to take three weeks off work. \n\"The guidelines are not clear if my children will have to isolate off school when we come home. Up until yesterday it wasn't clear if children under 11 would need to take PCR tests.\"\nThe overall cost of the holiday has gone up - with an extra \u00a3325 each for Lisa and her two teenage sons just for tests. And the move to the amber list has meant an extra \u00a3170 each for the day two and day eight tests.\nShe said: \"I booked it last week and the flights were so cheap. I thought I had grabbed a bargain but now it is out of control.\" \nProf Leitch also admitted that uptake was not high in the 18-29 age group and, as a result, the national vaccination figures were not increasing as rapidly as previously.\nOn Tuesday, just 6,875 first doses were given compared to 10,688 the Tuesday before.In total, 72.3% of the entire Scottish population has had their first dose, and 53.4% have had both doses. \nProf Leitch said: \"I would agree things have slowed down a bit. It is unavoidable. You can only do second doses if you have done first doses. That's fixed and going well and people are coming for those.\n\"The tricky part which is harder to control is 18 to 29-year-olds getting first doses. We expected it to be slower, that's why we are making it as open as we possibly can. The first dose number is slowing a bit and we expected it to at this age.\"\nHe added: \"To get out the end of the pandemic globally and in Scotland, we need big population immunity numbers. We have tried to do lots of communication with young people, we have met with Young Scot, we have mobile open access clinics, fixed open access clinics across the country, third sector organisations and further colleges doing outreach. I think we have done well.\"\nHealth secretary Humza Yousaf said that by Sunday, every single adult over 18 will have been offered a first dose of a vaccine.\nHe said that more than 65% of the population had now received both doses, but that the younger population was proving difficult to reach.\n\"We are clearly facing a challenge: the younger cohorts we go to, the higher the do not attend rates are,\" he added.\n\"If I can encourage everybody to get vaccinated, make sure you attend your appointment, or go to one of the drop-in clinics. They will take you at any time at the drop-in clinics, for your first, or if it has been eight weeks, for your second.\"\nHe said it was the government's plan to have the entire eligible population fully vaccinated by mid September."

The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately. They don't need to take a PCR test, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so.\nYou can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier than day six. If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

      "text": "The UK's small shopkeepers are struggling under a \u00a31.7bn mountain of debt, a former retail chief has warned.\nIndependent High Street businesses now owe four times as much as they did a year ago, said Bill Grimsey, ex-boss of Wickes, Iceland and Focus DIY.\nThe warning comes in his latest report into the future of town centres and High Streets.\nUnless the government steps in, the UK could face a \"tsunami\" of shop closures this autumn, he said.\nAccording to Mr Grimsey, small shops have survived the pandemic by borrowing, but are now faced with the task of paying it back.\n\"Our High Street independents have experienced a new-found appreciation during lockdown,\" he said.  \n\"But they've also been forced to take on government-backed loans, which they would not have normally been able to get because their balance sheets wouldn't allow it. Now they are struggling to manage a mountain of debt and need help.\"\nThe review is calling for a government \"forgiveness\" scheme to write off such loans for viable small businesses. \nA Treasury spokesperson said: \"Our unprecedented \u00a3350bn Covid support package has provided a lifeline to hundreds of thousands of businesses across the UK - through loans, grants, tax cuts, business rates holidays and the furlough scheme.\n\"The government has always been clear that Bounce Back Loans are loans to be repaid and that they may not be the right answer for all businesses.\n\"We've provided further support and flexibility to businesses that took out Bounce Back Loans by introducing the Pay as You Grow options, so that loan terms can be extended, monthly repayments reduced and a repayment holiday taken for up to six months.\"\n\"The French government is already working on a policy to save small businesses from being crushed by debt and we need to do the same to save thousands,\" said Mr Grimsey.\nOtherwise, he added, a \"tsunami\" of small independent shop closures could follow in the wake of the 17,500 chain stores that shut down in 2020.\nOne bright spot has been the rise of the fast-growing hair and beauty sector. But here, too, there were challenges, Mr Grimsey said, pointing out that the sector is largely unregulated compared with other European countries.\nWorking conditions had also become more insecure, with 63% of people working in beauty salons now self-employed, he added.\n\"Britain is at a crossroads and the pandemic has brought about sweeping changes that will make a decisive break with a traditional High Street model,\" he warned. \n\"But we can't build our way out of trouble. To unlock the potential of our High Streets, we need to focus on people, partnerships and communities as well. \n\"Britain needs a social recovery to lock in an economic one and our High Streets should lead by example.\"  "

      "text": "The UK is \"not out of the woods yet\" and people should act with caution as Covid restrictions in England end on Monday, Prof Chris Whitty has said.\nEngland's chief medical officer warned that Covid hospitalisations were doubling every three weeks and could hit \"scary numbers\" in future.\nProf Whitty said the pandemic still had a \"long way to run in the UK\".\nSolicitor General Lucy Frazer said while cases will rise, there were \"consequences for not opening up\".\nBut she warned: \"Of course, if we get into a situation where it is unacceptable and we do need to put back further restrictions, then that of course is something the government will look at.\"\nIt comes as:\nThe ONS figures for England represent a rise on the previous week, when one in 160 people were estimated to have the virus.\nProf Whitty told an online seminar hosted by the Science Museum on Thursday evening that the situation in the UK could become very dangerous for individual hospitals.\nHe said: \"I don't think we should underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast. \n\"I think saying the numbers in hospital are low now, that does not mean the numbers will be low in hospital in five, six, seven, eight weeks' time. \n\"They could actually be really quite serious.\"\nHe added: \"We've still got 2,000 people in hospital and that number is increasing. If we double from 2,000 to 4,000 from 4,000 to 8,000, 8,000 and so on it doesn't take many doubling times until you're in very, very large numbers indeed.\"\nWhile Prof Whitty cautioned \"we are not by any means out of the woods yet\", he added that \"we are in much better shape due to the vaccine programme, and drugs, and a variety of other things\".\n\"But this has got a long way to run in the UK, and it's got even further to run globally,\" he said.\nBut Prof Whitty said it was crucial that from 19 July in England, people \"take things incredibly slowly\" - adding that he anticipated most people would still take precautions.\n\"If you look over what people have done, and in fact if you look at what people intend to do now, people have been incredibly good at saying, 'I may be a relatively low risk, but people around me are at high risk, and I'm going to modify my behaviours, I'm going to reduce my contacts, I'm going to improve ventilation...',\" he said.\nFrom 19 July, almost all legal restrictions on social contact will be removed in England, but some guidance will remain. Different rules apply in the the rest of the UK.\nNightclubs will be allowed to reopen for the first time since March last year and capacity limits will be removed for all venues and events.\nThere will no longer be any limits on how many people can meet and the 1m-plus distancing rule will also end.\nThe legal requirement to wear face coverings in some enclosed public places will expire, but Health Secretary Sajid Javid has previously said masks would still be \"expected and recommended\" in crowded indoor areas.\nBut the UK's two largest supermarkets - Tesco and Sainsbury's - have said they will continue to ask shoppers to wear masks from Monday to protect staff and shoppers.\nProf Whitty predicted that in the medium term, coronavirus could mutate into a \"vaccine escape variant\" that could take the UK \"some of the way backwards\" into the worst days of the pandemic.\n\"The further out in time we go, the more tools we have at our disposal from science, the less likely that is but you can never take that possibility completely off the table,\" he said.\n\"But you know, science has done a phenomenal job so far and it will continue to do so.\"\nProf Whitty's comments echo his statements at Monday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing where Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the final stage of unlocking in England would take place on 19 July.\nThe chief medical officer said the \"overwhelming view\" of the scientific community was that moving \"slowly\" through the next step of easing restrictions was \"essential\".\nHe added that while the numbers of people being admitted to hospital with Covid were \"not trivial\", they were rising at a much lower rate than previous waves.\nExplaining the government's approach, Ms Frazer told Sky News: \"It is really important that we get the balance right between ensuring that we keep this virus under control and we take the necessary clinical measures to do that, but that we also recognise that there are consequences of not opening up and not allowing people to go about their daily lives.\"\nShe added that \"a large number of people have been vaccinated, we've had a really tough time, we're still asking people to take responsibility and we do need to ask ourselves, if we don't open up now, when will we be able to open up?\"\nOn Thursday, the UK recorded new 48,553 new infections and a further 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nDelta virus variant cases rose by 17% in the latest week, with a further 36,800 recorded, Public Health England (PHE) said.\nThe variant continues to account for approximately 99% of confirmed cases of coronavirus across the UK.\nThe ONS estimated one in 90 people in Scotland had the virus in the week to 10 July, one in 360 in Wales, and one in 290 in Northern Ireland."

It has always been that we should have had local contact tracing through public health and that now needs to be properly resourced.\"\nDespite the rise in the number of people getting \"pinged\" - data from the most recent week showed the most downloads of the app (342,483) since the seven days to 6 June (393,842).\nIt has already been announced that from 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated in England will no longer have to self-isolate after close contact with someone who tests positive.\nThe BBC has been told the team behind the app has been asked to adjust the measurements that trigger the alerts so that fewer are sent out - although the time frame for the change is not yet known.\nHowever, the Department of Health and Social Care said that while the sensitivity of the app was kept under constant review there were no plans to change its sensitivity at this time.\nOther reasons people have to self-isolate include if they test positive, live with someone who tests positive, or are told to do so by contact tracers.\nPeople in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own).\nIf you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a \"ping\" alert if they later test positive for Covid and share the information with the app. The app uses Bluetooth readings to infer if you had recently been within 2m of them for at least 15 minutes.\nIf you are \"pinged\" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nMeanwhile, the UK's two largest supermarkets - Tesco and Sainsbury's - have said they will continue to ask shoppers to wear masks when the legal requirement to do so in England is dropped on Monday.\nThe government has said it \"expects and recommends\" shoppers in England to wear face masks from Monday.\nBut the legal requirement to cover your face in enclosed spaces will end. Different rules apply in the devolved nations.\nAnd the government has been criticised over its decision to add Bulgaria and Croatia to its green travel list from Monday - but not give Foreign Office approval for travel to the countries. \nThe decision to allow people to travel there without isolating on return was announced on Wednesday, but the government's travel advice pages for both countries currently states that it  \"advises against all but essential travel\".\nGovernment travel advice affects operators' and passengers' insurance. \nAirlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said not aligning Foreign Office travel advice with government travel policies was causing \"huge confusion for passengers and carriers\"."

But it's also been devastating and and damaging.\n\"We've come to the realisation that in the world of social media you're better off hidden.\"\nThe London Fire Brigade said crews attended reports of a car alight and fire investigation dogs were used to \"help identify any ignitable substances present\".\nThe Met Police confirmed they are treating the cause of the fire as suspected arson. \nMr Smith said whoever did this \"may have not had any reaction at all and there might have been seven dead people\". \nHe said: \"For those 15 seconds of fun in your eyes, it could have taken away many years from my family.\"\nMr Smith believes the incident was motivated by jealousy.\nHe added: \"I love seeing people do well. We want to see other people prosper and do well and I know that there's some people in life that are struggling and they don't like it when other people are prospering or doing well.\"\nHe vowed this would not stop him from sharing videos with fans.\nHe said: \"I just want to be with my family, and I want to be safe, and I want to protect them, and we need to step back, to readjust, reassess and find out what the best way to move forward is.\n\"At the end of the day, I'm not going to give up what's making us happy.\""

      "text": "Car firms Nissan and Rolls-Royce have warned production could be affected due to high numbers of staff being told to isolate by the NHS Test and Trace app.\nIt is understood that up to 900 workers at Nissan's Sunderland car plant have been sent home from the plant, more than 10% of the total workforce. \nLocal case numbers have been rising sharply, making it difficult to avoid disruption, say sources.\nRolls-Royce said it may have to halve production at its Goodwood factory.\nA spokesman for luxury car-maker said that the number of employees at its West Sussex plant forced to self-isolate after being notified by the Test and Trace app has been rising, and it is watching the situation carefully. \nHe said that while the situation is not yet critical, Rolls Royce would have to cut one of the two shifts at the factory if the numbers continued to rise. \nIn Sunderland, where Nissan's factory is based,955 Covid cases per 100,000 people were recorded in the week to 10 July.\nIn contrast, the average area in England had 287.\nThe problems at the Japanese carmaker come amid increasing evidence of widespread absenteeism at firms because of workers who have been \"pinged\" by the NHS app.\nAnyone alerted who has come into contact with an infected person has to self-isolate for 10 days.\nEarlier this week, lengthy queues built up at security in Heathrow airport because of the absence of more than 100 staff instructed to self-isolate by the app.\nThe problem is especially acute in restaurants and pubs, with UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls saying that in some cases, up to one-third of staff have been forced to stay at home.\nMs Nicholls has said testing could replace isolation for people who have been in contact with a Covid patient.\nNissan said: \"Production in certain areas of the plant has been adjusted as we manage a number of staff being required to self-isolate following close contact with Covid-19. \n\"The well-being of our team is our number one priority and we remain confident in the rigorous safety controls we have on site.\"\nMake UK, which represents manufacturers, said an increasing number of companies had reported that self-isolation was impacting on production.\n\"For some companies up to 20% of the workforce is now isolating,\" said boss Stephen Phipson. \"Government must re-visit the August date as an immediate priority as the situation is likely to get far worse with the lifting of restrictions next week.\" \nUnite the union said management at the plant had \"done brilliantly\" so far in preventing production lines shutting by moving staff around, but things were on the limit now.\nMore widely, the union said that it had been told of many cases across industry where a big increase in the number of staff being advised to self-isolate by the NHS app was affecting production lines.\n\"The reports Unite is receiving from our members and their employers are extremely worrying. It is not an exaggeration to say factories are on the verge of shutting and that at some sites hundreds of staff are off work,\" said Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner.\n\"One major engine supplier has said that so many people are absent and orders so far behind that work may be permanently relocated to China.\n\"The government absolutely must not wait until August 16 to come up with a solution to significantly reduce the amount of people self-isolating unnecessarily.\"\nCurrently, if you are required to self-isolate, your employer cannot force you to come into work, says Emma Bartlett, an employment lawyer at CM Murray.  \nDoing so would not only breach your rights but those of your fellow workers in terms of health and safety.\nAs you isolate you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay, which is worth \u00a396.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme. \nA \u00a3500 grant is also available in England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate."

      "text": "Bankers returning on Monday to Goldman Sachs' \u00a31bn London head office will be required to wear masks in the building despite the easing of government rules. \nHowever, unlike some competitors, Goldman will not require staff to be vaccinated to come into work. \nIt hopes 70% of UK staff will return to the office in the coming weeks. \nThe boss of Goldman Sachs International Richard Gnodde said the company remained as committed to its London head office as ever. \nMr Gnodde told the BBC: \"The centre of gravity for our workforce is going to be in our buildings and it will be in this building.\n\"Our focus is very much on securing a safe workplace. People will still be wearing masks in the building.\"\nHe said the bank would not insist on people being vaccinated in order to come in, nor would they force people to return if they felt uncomfortable doing so: \"[We will] continue to manage our exit from this in a cautious and appropriate way to make sure that our people feel comfortable.\"\nFinancial services is a crown jewel in the UK economy and contributes 12% of all taxes paid in the UK. \nSince the Brexit vote, more than \u00a31tn of customer and company money, trillions more in transaction volumes and an estimated 8,000 jobs have left the capital. This has left some questioning whether that crown was in danger of slipping. \nOn the day real royalty in the shape of Prince Charles visited Goldman's offices, Mr Gnodde told the BBC that the future for London remains bright.   \n\"We put this building in place through the Brexit period and it really underscores our confidence that London will remain one of the world's leading financial centres,\" Mr Gnodde said.  \n\"There has been some movement of assets. So you know, that has gone. And our access to the European market is not as free as it used to be. We have to build and create new opportunities.\"\nBut there was also a thinly disguised warning. Creating those opportunities will need the help of the government and regulators to keep London competitive with other international centres.\nMr Gnodde thinks that lessons can be learnt from the big bank deregulation of financial services in 1985. \n\"The UK was unambiguously supportive of financial services - it was crystal clear. I really want to stress this point - certainty -  in terms of support for business is absolutely key. \n\"And it has to be consistent. You can't support business on Monday and Tuesday, and then criticise it on a Wednesday and Thursday\u2026 that sends a confusing message. Certainty is critical.\"\nWhen City bosses talk about competitiveness, it's often code for lighter regulation. Outside the EU, many have called for a bonfire of regulation. If Mr Gnodde had the match which bits would he burn? \n\"Eliminate duplication and unnecessary excessive reporting. Let's do what we have to do to have effective regulation. But let's cut out some of the bureaucratic elements to enable firms to use their capital resources efficiently.\"\nDoing more business with the fastest growing parts of the globe means grappling with the economic might of China. How complicated could that be when Chinese firms are being booted out of telecoms infrastructure, democracy in Hong Kong is under assault and China is facing allegations of using forced labour of the Uyghur population?\n\"I think this this is a multifaceted relationship,\" he answered.\n\"I think our relationship with China, in many ways will be as a partner. If we're going to tackle climate change, we're going to have to do this together. We live on the same planet. They will be a customer and a client of many of our businesses. And then absolutely, we should have the right appropriate conversations on the political arena in the areas where we compete.\" \nIt's a big world out there with plenty of opportunity - and while Mr Gnodde accepts the UK outside the EU is arguably a smaller fish, that's not necessarily an bad thing.\n\"Sometimes being a smaller fish is an advantage. Your level of paranoia goes up - you need to move to innovate, to create. Look over the last century and the issues that this country has been through and we're absolutely confident that the people of Britain will take it forward again.\" \nStatements like that will be sure to help mend a sometime fractious relationship between the City and the government over the past few years.

      "text": "Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca and Formentera are being moved onto the government's amber travel list for England.\nThe Balearic Islands will join the list from 04:00 BST on Monday, 15 days after they were moved to the green watchlist.\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments said they will do the same, and Northern Ireland is expected to follow suit.\nFrom Monday, only people aged over 18 who are not fully vaccinated will still have to quarantine on returning from an amber list country.\nThe requirement to self-isolate is being scrapped for the fully vaccinated and under-18s from Monday in England, Scotland and Wales but travellers in Northern Ireland will have to wait another week before the rule change.\nThe British Virgin Islands are also moving to the amber list, while Cuba, Indonesia, Myanmar and Sierra Leone will be moved to the strictest red list. \nBulgaria and Hong Kong will move to the green list, while Croatia and Taiwan join the green watchlist, which means they are at risk of being moved to amber.  \nIt is understood that data indicates a big rise in cases in the Balearic Islands following end-of-term parties.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said case rates had doubled since the islands were added to the green watchlist, which meant the government needed to \"move quickly\". \nHe also warned that people travelling abroad this summer will need to make sure they can get their money back or rebook their accommodation, adding that \"no-one can be out there thinking we can travel and just rely on things not changing\".\nBut package holiday firm Tui said the \"continued lack of transparency\" about the methodology and data behind the changes was making it \"incredibly difficult for customers to book far in advance with confidence\".\nEasyJet said it could not understand why people were going to be allowed to attend nightclubs from Monday without a mask or social distancing but the government was \"not comfortable with people going to the beaches of Europe where the infection rates are lower than in the UK\".\nVirgin Atlantic called for the government to \"act decisively\" and add nations with high vaccination rates, such as the US, to the green list at the next review. \nLabour criticised the government for not publishing the country-by-country data that informs its traffic light system. \nShadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: \"People are booking holidays in good faith and now face the prospect of losing out because ministers refuse to be straight with the public.\" \nMedi Jones Williams, from Bristol, booked a holiday to Majorca on Friday and said she still planned to fly there on Saturday for her seven-day trip.\nThe 25-year-old had her first vaccine three weeks ago, and is now looking to get a second dose as soon as possible.\nShe told the BBC: \"I'm still going to go because I'm sick of everything. I feel like if I don't it will never happen because things keep changing. \n\"I do understand why they have to vaccinate older people first but when they got to 40 they should have vaccinated everyone.\n\"It doesn't make sense to open on Monday when not everyone is vaccinated.\"  \nMr Shapps defended the government's traffic light system, saying that the categories mean \"people can see, broadly-speaking, where these countries are classified\".\nHe added: \"We're not in control of this virus, particularly in how it affects other counties, their levels of vaccinations, their level of genomic sequencing, their testing regimes.\"\nTravelling to green list destinations was likely to be a \"better bet\" than those on the green watchlist, he said, but cautioned \"there are no guarantees\".\nHe urged people to come forward and get both vaccine doses to give them \"one more piece of security when you do go off to travel\".\nThe changes will come as bad news for travellers who are over 18 and not yet double vaccinated.\nThe government says they can still pay for additional tests on day five as part of test-to-release and are advising everyone to get their jabs as quickly as possible. \nUnder the change to amber list travel rules, announced last week, fully-jabbed people will still be required to take a test three days before they return and on the second day after they are back - but they will now be exempted from a day eight test.\nFrom Monday - when most Covid rules in England end - the guidance that people should not travel to amber list countries will be removed.\nFewer than 30 destinations are on the green list, which do not require people to quarantine on their return. \nMore than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel.\nBut most places - including holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. \nGreen watchlist countries do not require arrivals to quarantine but are at risk of being moved to amber. \nMeanwhile, more than two thirds of adults in the UK - some 35 million people - have now received both vaccine doses, the government announced on Wednesday. \nThe government said it meant it had hit its target of vaccinating two thirds of adults by 19 July early. \nSome 46,037,090 people have received a first dose while 35,155,767 have had both doses - the equivalent of  87.4% and 66.7% of the adult population respectively.  \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described the milestone as \"another extraordinary achievement\", adding that it was enabling the UK to \"cautiously ease restrictions next week and return closer towards normal life\".  \nOn Wednesday, the UK recorded another 42,302 cases and 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the daily government figures. \nAre you a holidaymaker or a travel agent?

      "text": "Sugar and salt should be taxed and vegetables prescribed by the NHS, an independent review of the food we eat has suggested.\nThe report, led by businessman Henry Dimbleby, said taxes raised could extend free school meal provision and support better diets among the poorest.\nEngland's National Food Strategy also wants GPs to try prescribing fruit and vegetables to encourage healthy eating.\nBoris Johnson said he was not attracted to extra taxes on hard-working people.\nThe prime minister added he would study the report, and promised the government would respond with proposals for future laws within six months.\nMeanwhile, the food industry warned new taxes on wholesale sugar and salt could lead to higher food prices in shops.\nIan Wright, of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said: \"Obesity and food is very much about poverty, and we need measures to tackle poverty and to help people to make choices they need to make.\"\nThe review, commissioned by the government in 2019, said historic reforms of the food system are needed to protect the NHS, improve the health of the nation and save the environment.\nThe new taxes would be applied to wholesale sugar and salt purchased by manufacturers, which could in turn raise some prices on shelves.\nBut Mr Dimbleby said: \"We do not actually believe that for most things it will hike the price - what it will do is it will reformulate, it will make people take sugar and salt out.\"\nThe review described the Covid-19 pandemic as a \"painful reality check\" that has revealed the scale of food-related ill-health. \n\"Our high obesity rate has been a major factor in the UK's tragically high death rate,\" said Mr Dimbleby, who co-founded the fast food chain Leon.  \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the focus should turn to preventing people getting to the NHS.\nHe said his proposals - if implemented in full - could save 38 calories per person per day, helping the average person lose 2kg (4.4lb) in weight a year.\nAsked if this was an example of the nanny state where the posh tell the poor what is good for them, Mr Dimbleby said \"it's only posh people who ever say that to me... if you go to communities, they really want to change our food system\".\nPsychologist David Halpern, who advises the government, told Today taxing sugar and salt could act as a \"double nudge\" on behaviour.\nHe compared the concept to the sugar levy on soft drinks, introduced in April 2018 and which drove manufacturers to remove sugar from products through reformulation.\nHe added that levy led to a reduction of sugar added into soft drinks of about a third, while sales also rose at the same time.\nPoor diet contributes to 64,000 deaths a year in England alone and costs the economy \u00a374bn, the review said.\nIt claims more than half of over-45s now live with diet-related health conditions.\nAnd our eating habits are not just damaging our health, they are also destroying the environment, the review warned.  \nThe food we eat accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the review.  \nThe global food system is the single biggest contributor to biodiversity loss, deforestation, drought, freshwater pollution and the collapse of aquatic wildlife, said the review. \nIt is also the second-biggest contributor to climate change, after the energy industry. \nCalorie for calorie, highly processed foods are three times cheaper than healthy food, the report found.  \nThe review recommended the new tax be set at \u00a33/kg for sugar and \u00a36/kg for salt sold wholesale for use in processed foods, or in restaurants and catering businesses.\nThis would represent a very dramatic increase in the cost of these two important ingredients.\nThe tax could raise as much as \u00a33.4bn a year, the review team calculated.\nBut the previous sugar levy on soft drinks brought in less tax revenue than expected because manufacturers voluntarily reduced the amount of sugar to avoid it.\nThe National Food Strategy recognised that by raising prices of some products the sugar and salt tax would be likely to put extra financial strain on the poorest families.\nIn a series of recommendations designed to get fresh food and ingredients to low-income households with children, it recommended:\nIt encouraged the government to set a target to reduce the nation's meat consumption by 30% over 10 years.\nOther recommendations included helping farmers transition to more sustainable farming methods and dividing land equally between high intensity farming, environment-friendly low-intensity agriculture and nature reserves.\nThe first part of the two-part review was published last summer and looked at food as part of trade deals and farming payments.\nRestaurateur and Great British Bake-Off judge Prue Leith called it \"a compelling and overdue plan of action\" which, if adopted, would put \"our food system on the right path to health and prosperity\".\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas said she wanted to see government policies designed to meet Mr Dimbleby's recommendations but feared it could end up being ignored. \nAdditional reporting by Marie Jackson and George Bowden."

      "text": "Doctors and midwives fear next week's relaxation of Covid restrictions will lead to an increase in infections among pregnant women.\nThe warning comes from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM).\nPregnant women can be at greater risk of getting severely ill with Covid.\nSo the experts are urging women to get the Covid vaccine \"to protect yourself, your baby and your family\".\nEvidence shows having the Covid jab is safe during pregnancy.\nThe risk of being very ill with Covid is increaed in the late stage of pregnancy, in part due to the pressure exerted on the lungs by the growing foetus.\nMothers who give birth while infected are more likely to need an emergency Caesarean and had higher rates of stillbirth, although the actual increases remain low.\nThe RCOG told the BBC its data suggests 58% of pregnant women have declined a Covid vaccine.\nIt acknowledged \"mixed messages\" about the safety of the vaccine at the start of the programme had caused confusion - but said it was disappointed there had not been more direct campaigns targeted at pregnant women by the government and NHS England, since vaccination was approved for the group in April.\nThe RCOG says pregnant women were the only clinically vulnerable group not prioritised for vaccination. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) now advises that pregnant women should all be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines where available, at the same time as the rest of the population.\nResearch from the US, involving more than 90,000 pregnant people found no risk, and experts say there is no reason to think there is any increased risk of miscarriage - as the vaccine does not appear to cross from the mother to child via the placenta.\nBoth colleges are urging those who are pregnant or considering pregnancy who have not yet been vaccinated to consider getting a jab as soon as possible and book their second doses as soon as they are eligible.\nUnvaccinated or partially vaccinated pregnant women should take steps to avoid infection by continuing to practice social distancing, particularly in their third trimester, they say.\nDr Edward Morris, RCOG president, said: \"We are concerned that increasing rates of Covid infection will adversely impact pregnant women.\n\"We know that those who are pregnant with Covid are at an increased risk of becoming severely ill, and the vaccine is the safest and most effective way of protecting women and their babies.\" \nGill Walton, RCM chief executive, said: \"Along with mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing, vaccination is a vital tool in the fight to protect yourself against this virus.\n\"If you are unsure or worried about this, do speak to your midwife or doctor to get the facts so that you can make an informed decision. \n\"All the evidence is showing that having the Covid jab is safe during pregnancy, and I do urge you to have the vaccine to protect yourself, your baby and your family.\""

      "tags": "Respiratory diseases,NHS,Viruses,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A surge in flu and other respiratory viruses could put pressure on people's health and the NHS this winter, warns a report by leading medics.\nThey say testing for flu, Covid and a respiratory virus common in children and the elderly - called RSV - may help doctors treat cases more quickly.\nThe Academy of Medical Sciences report calls for people with any symptoms to isolate and stay at home.\nThis will help protect against all respiratory viruses this winter.\nThe report, by 29 leading experts and requested by the government, says there is great uncertainty about what the next few months will hold across the UK, but it urges policymakers to prepare for a challenging winter.\nDuring lockdown last winter, the UK population was hardly exposed to the viruses which normally circulate. But they are now set to make a comeback as restrictions lift and society opens up.\nAlready this summer, there has been a rise in winter viruses in children coming to A&E.\nReport author Prof Azra Ghani, from Imperial College London, says their modelling suggests a summer peak of Covid-19 infections \"with subsequent local outbreaks over winter\".\nBut \"we can't completely rule out another winter wave\", she said.\n\"Whilst we expect the peak in deaths to be considerably lower than last winter, under some scenarios we could see hospital admissions rise to similar levels.\"\nIn a worst-case scenario this could mean around twice the levels of flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a normal autumn and winter, the report says.\nThere are between 10,000 and 30,000 deaths from flu in a normal winter, and about 20,000 children under five are admitted to hospital each year with RSV, which can cause a lung infection called bronchiolitis.\nThe authors say these viruses often produce similar symptoms, so testing for all three at once would help distinguish between them.\nThis could be done through Test and Trace or in GP practices, but the turnaround would need to be very fast so that anti-virals could be used to treat flu in the most vulnerable.\nDr Alexander Edwards, from the University of Reading, said the \"triple tests\" had \"great appeal\", but the logistics could be a challenge.\n\"Whether there will be enough instruments and testing capacity available for this to be available widely in primary care remains to be seen,\" he said.\nThe report also recommends booster Covid vaccines alongside flu vaccines this autumn to reduce the spread of the virus, which is already being planned by the NHS for the over-50s, and improving infection control in hospitals.\nIt says all adults need to be vaccinated against Covid by September. Currently, two-thirds of UK adults have received two doses and 87% have had one dose.\nBut the number one way to reduce transmission is for people to have a test when they have symptoms and stay at home if they are ill, says Prof Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\"We are calling on the government to urgently strengthen the financial and practical support that will allow all people to self-isolate if they need to, whatever their circumstances,\" she said.\nThe medics also emphasise the importance of face coverings, social distancing and meeting friends outdoors - to protect against Covid as well as other respiratory viruses, as society opens up."

      "title": "Covid: Younger adults still at risk of serious organ damage - study",
      "tags": "Long Covid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Younger adults admitted to hospital with Covid are almost as likely to suffer from complications as those over 50 years old, a study has found.\nFour in 10 of those between 19 and 49 developed problems with their kidneys, lungs or other organs while treated.\nThe research looked at 73,197 adults of all ages across 302 UK hospitals in the first wave of Covid in 2020.\n\"The message is that this is not just a disease of the elderly and frail,\" said Prof Calum Semple, who led the work.\n\"The data reinforces the fact that Covid is not flu and we are seeing even young adults coming into hospital suffering significant complications, some of which will require furthering monitoring and potentially further treatment in the future.\"\nThe study, conducted by researchers at seven UK universities, the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England, looked at the number of \"complications\" in those needing hospital treatment for Covid-19, defined as an organ-specific medical diagnosis.\nOverall, around half of all adult patients suffered a least one complication during their hospital stay. The most common was a kidney injury, followed by lung and heart damage.\nThe highest rates were in those over 50 years old, with 51% reporting at least one problem. But they were also \"very common\" in younger age groups. Some 37% of 30 to 39 year olds and 44% of 40 to 49 year olds had at least one complication recorded by nurses and medical students involved in the study.\nDoctors are not yet certain how a severe Covid illness can cause organ damage, but it is thought in some cases the body's own immune system can spark an inflammatory response and injure healthy tissue.\nPaul Godfrey, from Frinton in Essex, developed Covid in March 2020 after suffering what he thought was a chest infection.\nPaul, who was 31 at the time of diagnosis and has the lung condition bronchiectasis, said: \"There's no doubt about it - the NHS staff who cared for me saved my life. I would not be here today if it wasn't for them.\"\nThe study, published in the medical journal the Lancet, found that those with pre-existing conditions were more likely to report complications but the risk was high even in young, previously healthy individuals.\nPaul was diagnosed with pneumonia in Colchester hospital and was told the bottom half of both his lungs had collapsed. He narrowly avoided being placed in an induced coma and spent two weeks on a Covid ward before he was allowed home in a wheelchair.\nThe research showed that 13% of 19 to 29 year olds and 17% of 30 to 39 year olds hospitalised with Covid were unable to look after themselves at discharge and had to rely on friends and family.\n\"It was the worst experience of my life and I am still dealing with it 18 months later,\" said Paul, who continues to suffer from extreme fatigue and breathlessness caused by his illness. \n\"I don't really know what the damage is to my body so I am just praying I get back to what I was.\"\nAge is the single largest factor in determining a severe Covid infection. \nOf the 406,687 people taken to hospital with the disease in England since the start of the pandemic, 62% were over the age of 65. \nThat leaves another 155,866 under the age of 65 who have needed hospital treatment since February 2020.\nHigher vaccination rates in the elderly and vulnerable population mean that the average age of those hospitalised with the disease has been falling. \nIn the week ending 4 July, there were just 17 people over 85 years old admitted to hospital with Covid in England, compared with 478 aged between 25 and 44.\nThe research was conducted in the first wave of the pandemic between 17 January and 4 August 2020 - before vaccines were available and new variants of the virus had been detected.\nThe authors said the data suggested those with more severe Covid symptoms at admission to hospital were more likely to suffer serious health problems, showing the importance of vaccines in reducing the severity of the disease in this latest wave.\nThe study was only designed to look at short-term complications during a hospital stay but there is evidence some organ damage can persist, becoming a form of what is known as long Covid. \n\"We do know from other infectious diseases that these sorts of problems with your kidneys or heart can develop into longer-term complications,\" said Dr Annemarie Docherty, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and a consultant in intensive care medicine.\n\"I think it's reasonable to expect that this may be the same with Covid-19.\" "

      "tags": "Tourism,Travel,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "With the vaccination programme racing against the spread of new variants, rules around international travel are rapidly changing.\nAlthough different countries have their own entry rules, a digital \"passport\" which provides evidence of a person's vaccination status has been rolled out across Europe.\nSimilar apps have been rolled out in the UK and while Scots have had to request theirs by post, Nicola Sturgeon has announced a QR system will be launched on Friday.\nPeople in Scotland have been able to access their certificate since 19 May - which shows both the dates of Covid vaccination and the type of drug administered.\nThe Scottish government said the service was intended to allow people access to a certificate without asking their GP, thereby \"easing the burden\" on the NHS.\nWhile no countries required vaccination status to travel when the service launched, some countries now do - and destinations have different entry rules which can change at short notice.\nThe government has information which you can check before travelling.\nMore than 30 countries, including Greece and Spain, now accept the pass.\nOriginally people could download the document online, but on 22 May the site suffered a security glitch which enabled people to alter details on the document using popular software programmes.\nBBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters.\nA fix was implemented on 25 May, which meant people in Scotland could only request the document be sent to them by post.\nPeople can view their vaccine status through the NHS Inform patient portal. Users have to log in using a unique username printed on their Covid vaccination appointment letter.\nThose who are not online can request the certificate to be posted by phoning a freephone Covid status helpline on 0808 196 8565.\nScotland's reliance on a paper system was previously criticised by travel agents, who said travellers were being \"blindsided\". \nConcerns emerged that the paper system was causing airport queues and more interactions with staff and passengers.\nBy the end of July, the Scottish government had awarded a Danish firm a \u00a3600,000 contract to develop a vaccine passport similar to those already in use elsewhere in the UK and Europe.\nOn Tuesday during a Covid update to Parliament, Ms Sturgeon confirmed people could download their certificate in the form of a QR code from Friday.\nPaper copies will continue but will include a QR code on them.\nFurthermore, vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month.\nMs Sturgeon said the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme - although that decision would be kept under review.\nAnd there are no plans to include key services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services.\nAn EU vaccine \"passport\" has been introduced across all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.\nBecause the UK is no longer in the EU, the certificate is not available to most Britons, which has led to a number of problems.\nThe European system often requires people to present a QR code, however people in Scotland have been denied entry to certain places when they presented their paper certificate.\nFrance insists UK visitors are fully vaccinated before entry for non-essential travel. The country has also tightened its rules for any UK travellers who are not fully vaccinated, requiring them to have a negative test in the 24 hours before arrival, rather than the 48 hours allowed previously.\nThe country has also rolled out a new health pass which means people need proof of vaccination to enter places such as museums and cinemas.\nMeanwhile Norway initially only accepted Norwegian, Danish, Swedish or EU digital Covid certificates as proof of vaccination or previous illness.\nFrom 12 August it began to accept certificates from England and Wales as it was able to verify QR codes at the border.\nAgain this has caused problems for people in Scotland - including one man whose yacht has been stranded in Norway since last August.\nPeople in England can use the NHS app to either download their certificate or have it emailed to them. \nSimilar systems are in place in Wales and Northern Ireland, and while the NI system went offline following a data breach in early August, it is now up and running again.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced plans \"to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather\" by the end of September.\nUnder these new measures, people would show proof of vaccination by using the NHS Covid Pass app in England."

      "tags": "Unemployment,Employment,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The number of job vacancies in the UK surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the three months to June, according to new data.\nThe Office for National Statistics said there were 862,000 jobs on offer between April and June, 77,500 higher than the first three months of 2020.\nThe rise was driven by vacancies in hospitality and retailing.\nThe number of people on payrolls also grew in June, showing the biggest rise since the start of the pandemic.\nIt increased by 356,000 in June to 28.9 million.\nThere was a sharp increase in payrolls in both the food and accommodation sectors as more people returned to work, following a further easing of Covid restrictions in England during May that allowed the hospitality industry to reopen. \nSome regions of the UK saw payroll numbers rise past levels seen before Covid forced the country into lockdown, including the North East, the North West, the East Midlands and Northern Ireland.\nHowever, the ONS said the number of payroll workers remained 206,000 below pre-pandemic levels.\n\"The labour market is continuing to recover, with the number of employees on payroll up again strongly in June,\" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. \n\"However, it is still over 200,000 down on pre-pandemic levels, while a large number of workers remain on furlough.\" \nThe ONS also said that the unemployment rate was 4.8% between March and May, representing a fall from 5% between December and February. \nCommenting on the sharp rise in vacancies, Chris Gray, director at recruitment firm Manpower UK, said: \"I think what we're seeing is that we're already in a tight labour market. Employers are already having to be very creative. \n\"But some are also a little bit anxious, maybe desperate, and advertising the same job more than once, so we've got to be mindful of some of those inflated numbers.\"\nThe ONS said arts, entertainment and recreation recorded the sharpest rise in vacancies. It added that in the accommodation and food services sectors, vacancies increased by 73,400 to 102,000.\n\"In this sector, there is evidence of a shortage of skilled staff and of employees finding alternative areas of employment prior to the sector reopening,\" it said.\nThe rise in vacancies above pre-pandemic levels may sound like good news but to businesses it points to a problem: skills shortages.\n\"The recruitment difficulties faced by firms go well beyond temporary bottlenecks and with many facing an increasing skills gap, staff shortages may drag on any recovery,\" according to the British Chambers of Commerce.  \nIt combines unpleasantly with other labour market figures released today, showing that the number of UK-born workers in the workforce has dropped by more than a million from the end of 2019 to the first quarter of this year to 26.12 million. \nMeanwhile, the number of non-UK-born workers has only risen by about 200,000, according to the ONS, to 6.06 million. And the number of EU-born workers is down from 2.43 million to 2.3 million, although that fall is much smaller than many had predicted last year.\nSeeing the number of UK-born workers drop by a million is probably not what most Brexit supporters were hoping for. But, of course, it is almost certainly an effect not so much of Brexit but of the pandemic and successive lockdowns. \nSome of those UK-born workers will have re-joined the workforce since March and the reliability of the figures is questioned by some. \nBut it underlines what businesses say the labour market needs right now: retraining on a big scale to upskill those UK-born workers who've left the workforce and meet some of those skills shortages that could hold the recovery back. \nCompanies have recently told the BBC they are having difficulties recruiting staff. \nMark Lee, who runs the Red Lion Country Inn, a B&B in Yorkshire, said before the pandemic he would receive about 50 applications if he advertised a job. However, he is now struggling to fill a number of roles.\nA survey of recruitment firms by accountancy firm KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation found a number of factors contributing to problems in hiring workers, including Brexit, pandemic-related uncertainty and the furlough scheme.\nHowever, Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"While there is growing evidence that firms are finding it more difficult to hire workers, we suspect that most of these labour shortages will prove temporary and that they will be confined to a few sectors.\" \nAre you an employer struggling to recruit?\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

I don't want any child or adult to have to receive the hateful and hurtful messages that me, Marcus and Jadon have received this week,\" he wrote.\n\"I knew instantly the kind of hate that I was about to receive and that is a sad reality that your powerful platforms are not doing enough to stop these messages.\"\nFollowing Mr Mosseri\u2019s comments, on Wednesday night, several more racist comments and emojis were reported - but no notification of the results of any review was received.\nA quick scroll on Saka's account reveals plenty more racist comments yet to be reported and removed.\n\u201cIt is absolutely not OK to send racist emojis, or any kind of hate speech, on Instagram,\u201d Mr Mosseri added in a series of tweets.\n\"To imply otherwise is to be deliberately misleading and sensational.\n\u201cEmojis are difficult, as are words whose meaning changes based on context. \n\"Slurs evolve as well, so the work is never done.\u201d\nRacism on Instagram has been a long-standing issue, with a vast amount of content to moderate.\nIn April, Liverpool Football Club criticised the platform after some of its players were sent racist monkey emojis.\nInstagram has previously consulted with anti-discrimination and anti-bullying groups to curate a list of offensive terms, phrases and emojis.\nUsers can also filter out specific words or emojis on their accounts, by changing the Hidden Words tool in settings.\nBut Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Hate (CCDH) said it was \"beyond belief\" that racist abuse continued to bypass Instagram's filters.\n\"Of the 105 accounts we identified as having racially abused England footballers, 88 are still up,\" he said, adding it was \"a far cry\" from the social network's promised solution.\n\"From its failure to identify monkey emojis as racist, to its flat-out refusal to issue lifetime bans to racists, Instagram - and its parent company Facebook - have failed to act,\" he said.\n\"We have heard enough talk. It's time for the UK Government to follow Germany's lead in passing laws and impose serious financial penalties on firms that give a megaphone to racism and extremism.\""

      "text": "The FBI disregarded allegations about a prolific USA Gymnastics child abuser and later made serious errors in the investigation, a watchdog has found. \nThe long-awaited report gave a scathing assessment of the FBI's investigation into former team doctor Larry Nassar. \nNassar was sentenced to over 300 years in jail in 2018 for molesting gymnasts.\nNumerous missteps and cover-ups by FBI agents allowed his abuse to continue for months after the case was first opened, the report found.\nRachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of abuse, said that while the US justice department's internal review exposed serious failings, there was a lack of accountability. \n\"This report lays bare the corruption, but its conclusion says 'doesn't matter'. Because nothing happens now,\" she wrote in a series of tweets. \"These agents retire on government pensions while survivors fight to stay alive.\"\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the FBI acknowledged the findings of the report, calling the handling of the Nassar file \"inexcusable and a discredit to this organisation\". \n\"We will take all necessary steps to ensure that the failures of the employees outlined in the report do not happen again,\" the agency said.\nThe 119-page report by the Department of Justice Inspector General found that despite the seriousness of the allegations against Nassar, the FBI field office in Indianapolis dragged its feet in responding. \nIn July 2015, following an internal review into Nassar, USA Gymnastics reported a number of allegations to the FBI in Indianapolis. After some \"limited follow-up\" that summer, the agency \"did not undertake any investigative activity\" on the case for more than eight months.\nDuring that time, the report said, Nassar's sexual assaults continued. \nConfronted by their mistakes, two FBI officials lied during interviews to cover up their errors, the report said. \nAt the time the allegations surfaced, one of the FBI agents, Jay Abbott, had been in discussions with USA Gymnastics officials about a job with the Olympic Committee. Mr Abbott retired from the agency in 2018. \nThe other, an unnamed employee, \"is no longer a supervisor\", the FBI said on Wednesday, and will not work on FBI matters until an internal investigation is complete. \nMr Abbott's lawyer, Josh Minkler, said in a statement to Reuters news agency that his client \"thanks the law enforcement officers and prosecutors who brought Larry Nassar to justice\".\nThe internal review into the FBI's handling of the Nassar case was launched in 2018 when the disgraced doctor was sentenced to decades behind bars. \nHe has been accused of sexual abuse by more than 330 women and girls from USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, including Olympic stars Simone Biles and Aly Raisman."

      "title": "MPs call for complete reset of music streaming to ensure fair pay for artists",
      "tags": "Spotify,Streaming,Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport,Apple,Music",
      "text": "The music industry is weighted against artists, with even successful pop stars seeing \"pitiful returns\" from streaming, a committee of MPs has said.\nThey are calling for a \"complete reset\" of the market, with musicians given a \"fair share\" of the \u00a3736.5 million that UK record labels earn from streaming.\nIn a report, they said royalties should be split 50/50, instead of the current rate, where artists receive about 16%.\nThe findings came after a six-month inquiry into music streaming.\n\"While streaming has brought significant profits to the recorded music industry, the talent behind it - performers, songwriters and composers - are losing out,\" said Julian Knight, MP, who chairs parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee.\n\"Only a complete reset of streaming that enshrines in law their rights to a fair share of the earnings will do.\" \nThe findings will be seen as a victory by pop stars like Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Melanie C, Wolf Alice and Jessie Ware, who recently called on the Prime Minister to reform the way musicians get paid when their songs are streamed.\nMusician Tom Gray, whose #BrokenRecord campaign prompted the inquiry, said he was \"overjoyed\" by the findings.\n\"It feels like a massive vindication,\" he said. \"They've really come to the same conclusions that we've been saying for a very long time.\"\nThe BPI, which represents the UK recorded music industry, was more cautious. \nIt said streaming was \"enabling more artists than ever\" to earn a \"long-term, sustainable income\" and that new policies should be properly examined to ensure against \"unintended consequences for investment into new talent\".\nAt present, Spotify is believed to pay between \u00a30.002 and \u00a30.0038 per stream, while Apple Music pays about \u00a30.0059. YouTube pays the least - about \u00a30.00052 (or 0.05 pence) per stream.\nAll that money goes to rights-holders, a blanket term that covers everything from massive record companies to artists who release their own music. That money is then divided up between everyone involved in making the record.\nOften, the recording artist will only receive about 13% of the revenue, with labels and publishers keeping the rest.\nArtists who release their own music, or who work with independent labels and distribution companies, tend to get a higher share.\nA survey by the Ivors Academy and Musicians' Union found that in 2019, 82% of professional musicians made less than \u00a3200 from streaming, whilst only 7% made more than \u00a31,000.\nThe hearings were full of testy exchanges. Some witnesses said they were scared to speak out for fear of reprisals; and the head of one record label was described as \"living in cloud cuckoo land\" after he claimed artists were happy with the music streaming model.\nMercury Prize nominee Nadine Shah made headlines after telling the committee she had been forced to move back in with her parents because \"earnings from my streaming are not significant enough to keep the wolf away from the door\".\nPop songwriter Fiona Bevan revealed she'd earned just \u00a3100 for a track on Kylie Minogue's number one album, Disco. \"Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,\" she told MPs. \"It's quite shameful.\"\nChic's Nile Rodgers said that the finances of streaming are shrouded in secrecy, adding: \"We don't even know what a stream is worth and there's no way you could even find out what a stream is worth, and that's not a good relationship.\"\nThe three major labels - Sony, Universal and Warner Music - faced some of the toughest questioning of the inquiry, and were accused of a \"lack of clarity\" by MPs.\nThey largely argued to maintain the status quo, saying any disruption could damage investment in new music, and resisted the idea that streaming was comparable to radio - where artists receive a 50/50 royalty split.\n\"Streaming is 24-7 in every country in the world, you can listen to the greatest record store ever - it's clearly a sale, it's not radio, it's on-demand,\" said David Joseph, CEO of Universal Music UK.\nRepresentatives from the streaming companies suggested they were \"open-minded\" about changing the royalty system, but noted that 70% of their income already goes to labels, publishers and artists.\n\"It is a narrow-margin business, so it wouldn't actually take that much to upset the so-called apple cart,\" said Apple Music's Elena Segal.\nThe committee's report said streaming had \"undoubtedly helped save the music industry\" after decades of piracy, \"but it is clear that what has been saved does not work for everyone\".\nThey recommended that the government pass legislation to give performers the right to \"equitable remuneration\", whereby labels and artists receive an equal share of streaming royalties.\nThe report called it a \"simple yet effective solution\", as the right already exists in UK law when songs are played on radio and TV. \nMPs also raised \"deep concerns\" about the dominance of the major music companies, and urged the government to refer the case to the Competition and Markets Authority.\nOther recommendations included:\nThe committee also expressed concerns that \"the economics of streaming entrench historically successful artists and create barriers for new performers\", with perennial hits by Abba, Queen and Fleetwood Mac starving up-and-coming musicians of opportunities.\nFigures released yesterday showed that new music accounted for just 33% of the music streamed in the US this year, with older songs dominating people's listening choices.\nThe streaming services themselves largely escaped criticism, but MPs said YouTube's dominance was a cause for concern - citing figures that it accounts for 51% of music streaming while contributing 7% of music industry revenue.\nThey warned that users' ability to upload music to YouTube without licensing it from record labels gave it an \"unfair advantage\"; and urged the government to introduce \"legally enforceable obligations to normalise licensing arrangements\" on sites that host user-generated videos, such as YouTube, TikTok and Facebook.\nTom Gray said the report confirmed what his #BrokenRecord campaign had been telling record labels all along: \"That their business model needs to change and that they need to face the reality of that and get on with it\".\nHe said he hoped the government would enact the recommendations quickly, potentially by acting on a private member's bill by Labour MP Kevin Brennan that seeks to change copyright laws around streaming.\n\"This is something that they can do for the British cultural sector, where they don't have to go and negotiate with Brussels,\" he told the BBC. \"If they want to help British creators, inventors and performers, this is something they can just do.\"\nThe Association of Independent Music (AIM) welcomed the report's praise for independent record labels, who traditionally pay higher royalty rates to their artists.\n\"However, our view is that equitable remuneration will not deliver the outcome they are hoping for,\" said CEO Paul Pacifico. \"It is a 20th Century solution not fit for the 21st Century digital market and will leave the next generation of artists worse off.\"\nThe BPI argued that streaming worked in artists' favour - with 2,000 artists set to achieve 10 million streams this year, the equivalent of selling 10,000 CDs, or making about \u00a329,000. It warned unpicking the current system could damage investment in new music.\n\"When considering this report, the Government also needs to consider the vital role that labels play as the leading investors into artists' careers, with investment in artists by record labels growing year-on-year,\" said CEO Geoff Taylor.\n\"We will carefully examine the findings of this report, but it is essential that any policy proposals avoid unintended consequences for investment into new talent, and do not imperil this country's extraordinary global success in music.\"\nMeanwhile, the Musicians Union called the report \"revolutionary\". \n\"It grasps the issue, identifies the problems and recommends achievable and practical solutions, which won't cost the taxpayer a penny,\" said general secretary Horace Trubridge.\nIn a joint statement, the Featured Artists Coalition and Music Managers Forum said the \"landmark\" report could \"fundamentally improve\" the economic situation for thousands of musicians.\n\"This is a once in a lifetime moment to reset our business along fairer and more equitable lines, it is not an opportunity to be wasted.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Hospitality industry,Restaurants,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pavement dining and outdoor pint licences will continue for another year in England as part of a government plan to get hospitality back on its feet. \nHospitality has been one of the hardest-hit sectors during Covid but rebounded strongly in recent months.\nBut the industry is still facing challenges with a sustained staff shortage and the permanent closure of nearly 10,000 licensed premises. \nUK Hospitality said pavement licensing was \"a real boost\" for businesses.\nAs part of its new strategy for hospitality, the government will also work to highlight vacancies in the industry to jobseekers. \nMinister for small business Paul Scully said the government strategy would \"explore new options for vocational training and help further boost the creativity and environmental friendliness of the sector\".\nKate Nicholls, boss of industry group UK Hospitality, told the BBC the strategy would \"help our sector to drive\" wider economic recovery. \n\"The extension - and potential permanent retention - of streamlined pavement licensing is a real boost for pubs, cafes and restaurants, who will be delighted that they can continue to make use of outdoor areas, helping them to navigate their way more speedily back to profitability,\" she added.\nThe UK economy expanded by 0.8% in May, in part due to the reopening of indoor hospitality, which meant the service sector grew 0.9%. But Ms Nicholls recently told a group of MPs that the industry had amassed \u00a32.5bn of rent debt. \n\"Building and training our workforce is a top priority if hospitality is to quickly revive and drive a national recovery, so it's incredibly positive that a key part of this strategy is focused on addressing the current recruitment challenges and raising the profile of long-term sector careers,\" she added. \nThe government's plan will also focus on carbon reduction and working with businesses to reduce waste and plastic consumption.\nEllie Gill, landlady at The Grapes in Bath explained that without takeaway pints and outside space her business would not have been able to open last April. \nThe pub has capacity for 35 socially-distanced customers inside and the pavement licenses meant she could double the capacity and sit an extra 40 outside. \n\"With the amount of cases going on sitting outside is what people most want to do,\" she said. \nThe pub is piloting so-called 'parklets' where unused parking spaces are turned into extra space for outdoor dining, as agreed with the council. \n\"It has enlivened Bath,\" she told the BBC. \n\"If we're looking at a future of pandemics, allowing seating outside, reducing city traffic and pollution is what we need to do so businesses survive.\" \nBut outdoor hospitality has also created accessibility issues for many people. Some disabled people, especially wheelchair users, have seen reduced access to certain streets and city centres.\nAccessibility campaigner Katie Pennick told the BBC she felt the initial pavement licenses were \"vague\" in ensuring that clear routes of access are maintained. Though her wheelchair is only 23 inches wide, she said really struggled to get through a street on a Friday night. \nDavid Taylor, who owns London-based Balans restaurants, says that the pavement licence has been a \"life-saver\" for his business. \nHis two restaurants on London's Old Compton Street have been able to add 30 extra customers for each premises. But Mr Taylor told the BBC there are bigger problems businesses like his are facing. \n\"The government need to sort out the very high business rates and VAT if they really want to get restaurants back on their feet - that should be their top priority.\"  \nMr Taylor told the BBC that from Monday, Westminster Council have told him they will not allow gazebos and heaters for his pavement dining table and he thinks there could be caveats to the new government strategy. \n\"Unlike the start of the crisis, we're on the government's radar- now they've realised how many people work in the sector, so let's see if they follow through with proper help,\" he said.  \nMark Laurie from the National Caterer's Association (NCASS), said local authorities \"will need to show flexibility and understanding towards businesses, not just in the pavement licences but opening up high streets and other spaces to the public and for commerce\".\nMr Laurie added the pavement licences have been a \"lifeline to many of the independent hospitality businesses we represent\". \n\"Al fresco is safer, its fun and it will help businesses, at least while the weather holds. It's no silver bullet but it's part of a vital mix,\" he said.\nRoss Bailey, founder of the UK-wide campaign group Save The Street agreed and said it was the \"right decision\" to extend the licence.\n\"The extension will allow businesses to capitalise on the massive demand we are seeing post lockdown. The street feels alive again and it is beautiful to see,\" he said."

      "tags": "Britney Spears",
      "text": "Britney Spears has told a US court she wants to charge her father Jamie for his alleged \"conservatorship abuse\".\n\"I'm here to press charges. I'm angry and I will go there,\" the singer said over a lawyer's phone on Wednesday.\nHer emotional statement came as a Los Angeles judge ruled Spears can choose her own lawyer in her fight to end the controversial legal arrangement.\nA conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions.\nConservatorship abuse can involve financially exploiting or imposing excessive personal restrictions on someone in your care.\nIf a court rules that abuse has taken place, the appointed conservator could be removed/suspended and may face financial penalties such as reimbursement payments and legal costs.\nFollowing the ruling, the singer posted an Instagram video of herself doing cartwheels in celebration with a caption thanking her fans and adding \"#FreeBritney\".\nIt is the first time she has used the hashtag, which has been used by her supporters to campaign against the conservatorship she has been subject to since 2008.\nThis week's hearing saw Spears address a court for the second time in less than a month.\nIn court last month, she made a dramatic plea to demanded that her father be removed from the legal agreement that has controlled her affairs for years.\n\"You're allowing my dad to ruin my life,\" she reiterated on Wednesday. \"I have to get rid of my dad and charge him with conservatorship abuse.\"\nThe conservatorship was put in place in 2008, when concerns over Spears' mental health prompted her father to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter's life.\nSpears' supporters rallied outside the court, and also gathered on the other side of the country in central Washington DC as the hearing was being held.\nLast month a judge denied the pop star's request to remove her father from his role overseeing her conservatorship. Judge Brenda Penny said she could not make a ruling until the singer files a formal petition to terminate the arrangement.\nWednesday's court ruling paves the way for Spears' lawyer of choice, former federal prosecutor Mathew Rosengart, to take charge of the complex legal battle.\nHe will replace Samuel Ingham, the court-appointed lawyer who had been representing Spears since 2008 before stepping down last week.\nDuring the hearing, Mr Ingham interrupted the court to say Spears was texting him. The singer wanted to address the court again, he said.\nThe judge officially accepted Mr Ingham's resignation before inviting Spears to speak.\nMr Rosengart, the high-powered Hollywood lawyer who has previously represented Steven Spielberg and Sean Penn, was also in court.\nA tearful Spears told the court that under the conservatorship, her hair vitamins and coffee had been confiscated.\n\"Ma'am, that's not abuse, that's just [expletive] cruelty,\" she told Judge Penny. \"Excuse my language, but it's the truth.\"\nThe singer said her top priority was removing her father from his role in the legal arrangement that governs her personal and financial affairs.\nShe said she did not wish to submit to a \"stupid\" medical assessment and would be \"happy\" for co-conservator Jodi Montgomery to remain.\nSpears continued: \"I just want you to understand how much of my time they have taken by forcing me to do these psyche tests and nothing comes of it.\"\nShe said she has \"extreme abandonment issues\" because of her father.\nThe singer also told the court she was \"extremely scared of my dad\", who is a recovering alcoholic, and feared he was always going to \"show up drunk somewhere and embarrass me\".\nJamie Spears is currently the sole person in charge of his daughter' $60m (\u00a343m) estate.\nBut his lawyers have previously denied he was responsible for the restrictions apparently placed on his daughter's private life.\nThe singer, a mother of two, said at last month's hearing that she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to do so. \nShe claimed she was prevented from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed, to make sure that she didn't get pregnant.\nWhile her father has overseen her estate for 13 years, his legal team say he has not been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019, when he stepped down from that role due to ill health.\nHe was replaced on a temporary basis by Ms Montgomery, the co-conservator and care-giver of the singer.\nHis lawyers have requested an inquiry to establish the accuracy of his daughter's testimony.\nThe lawyers said the father was \"concerned \" about his daughter's well-being.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

I can't thank them enough for their kindness.\"\nDue to the backlog there are about 7,000 people waiting for a transplant in the UK - the highest number since 2012/2013.\nJohn Forsythe, NHS Blood and Transplant medical director, said team efforts had been \"phenomenal\", but added: \"Organ donation and transplantation will take some time to recover completely.\"\nIn May 2020 organ donation law changed in England and Scotland to an opt-out system; meaning it is now assumed people want to donate after death unless they register otherwise.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.
