      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "YouTube has reinstated TalkRadio's channel on its platform hours after saying it had been \"terminated\" for breaking the tech firm's rules.\nIt said the broadcaster had posted material that contradicted expert advice about the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut it explained its U-turn saying it sometimes made exceptions to guidelines that state repeat offenders face a permanent ban.\nTalkRadio said it had yet to be given a full explanation for the affair.\nThe decision to ban TalkRadio had appalled digital rights campaigners, with one group - Big Brother Watch - claiming it was evidence that \"big tech censorship is spiralling out of control\".\nThe Google-owned service has issued a brief statement explaining its actions.\n\"TalkRadio's YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated,\" it said.\n\"We quickly remove flagged content that violate our community guidelines, including Covid-19 content that explicitly contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization. We make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case.\"\nYouTube has not published details of the offending posts.\nBut independent fact-checkers have repeatedly challenged some of the claims made by interviewees featured by the London-based radio station.\nYouTube operates a \"three strikes\" policy, whereby channels that break its community guidelines three times within a 90-day period can be permanently banned, but other infractions lead to temporary restrictions.\nProhibited content includes \"medically unsubstantiated claims\" relating to Covid-19, and videos that contradict expert consensus from local health authorities such as the NHS.\n\"YouTube is making decisions about which opinions the public are allowed to hear, even when they are sourced to responsible and regulated new providers,\" TalkRadio said in a statement this evening.\n\"This sets a dangerous precedent and is censorship of free speech and legitimate national debate.\"\nThe broadcaster tweeted the statement minutes after YouTube's change of heart. It did not appear to be aware that its channel had been reinstated at the time, but has since acknowledged the move.\nTalkRadio has about 424,000 listeners, according to the latest figures from market research provider Rajar.\nIt uses YouTube as a means to livestream shows from its studios and to provide an archive of past broadcasts. \nIts channel on the platform has 242,000 subscribers.\nYouTube's action had meant that TalkRadio's website had featured articles featuring broken embedded clips for most of the day, and that users who had shared its clips would have been unable to view them.\nThe US firm has previously imposed a permanent ban against conspiracy theorist David Icke, and a one-week video suspension of right-wing outlet One America News Network's ability to publish new clips - in both cases for breaches of its Covid rules.\n\nIt's pretty clear something has gone wrong at YouTube in the last 24 hours. \nIt appeared as though TalkRadio had been banned for good on YouTube - or \"terminated\" as the company put it. \nYouTube is now saying it was a short suspension, which certainly seems like a backtrack.\nEven now, it's not obvious what the offending material was that caused this action. The whole process reinforces the idea that YouTube's moderation policies - where it draws the line between freedom of expression and clamping down on misinformation - can be messy and inconsistent.\nAnd when YouTube takes such an action without giving full details, it rains controversy down on its own head.\nThis plays to a broader movement by YouTube and other social media companies to take a harder line on disinformation.\nJoe Biden is about to become US President - and he wants social media companies to do more to remove fake news. \nBut as they are increasingly finding out, refereeing their own platforms can be hugely difficult, and this highlights the need for greater transparency about moderation decisions.\n"

      "tags": "Kansas,US election 2020,Donald Trump,US politics",
      "text": "Weeks after President-elect Joe Biden was declared winner of November's election, there remains a deep mistrust of the electoral process among many ardent supporters of Donald Trump. It reflects a broader sentiment among conservatives, one that has profound implications for the nation and its institutions.\nStanding on Main Street, Dillard Ungeheuer, 73, was scraping cow manure off his shoes, left over from a visit to a feed lot, and seemed testy. When it came to the ballots, he was emphatic - many were fake. \n\"I'm not going to argue with nobody about it,\" he says, voice rising. \"I believe what I'm saying is factual.\"\nHis indignation over the presidential election, and the government writ large, was palpable, and his feelings were shared by many in town. \n\"No, I don't have much faith in government at all,\" he says.\nUS President Donald Trump lost the election to his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, and his efforts to have that result overturned in the courts have failed. On 6 January, the electoral votes from each state will be counted by Congress. \nAlthough some Republicans have said they would challenge this final step in the process of certifying the winner of the election, it will only delay, rather than change, the outcome.  \nInterviews with some two dozen Republican voters in the Midwestern state of Kansas reveal a picture of how they see the world. Most felt they had been cheated out of a victory, and that democratic institutions, particularly the electoral process, were broken.\nMost Republican voters, in Kansas and elsewhere, either believe Trump won the election or they are not certain of the victor, polls like this one from Northeastern University suggest.\nJackie Taylor, 59, publisher of the Linn County News in Pleasanton, says the election was stolen: \"The whole thing is dirty. You've got a guy who got elected under dirty circumstances, and now he's president.\"\nWhen asked why they thought the election was rigged, many said they got their news from Newsmax, One America News and other outlets that have broadcast stories about alleged voter fraud. These media companies were relatively obscure until Trump took office.\nHe frequently mentions them and has raised their profile.\nOthers say they did not know anyone who supported Biden, and have seen only Trump yard signs. \nFor them, it was inconceivable that Biden could win. They hold an unshakeable belief, despite the lack of any evidence, that liberals stole the election. Their views are reflected in the programmes they watch, and are discussed in coffeehouses, at gas stations and other places in town.\nThey called for an overhaul of the system, saying stricter controls should be imposed on voters. They said they were afraid that Biden would demolish what remained of American democracy, turning the country into a socialist state.\nTyler Johnson, 35, spoke about election fraud while standing next to his Chevy, one outfitted with a feed box. \nEarlier, outside town, a pickup truck had kicked up dust plumes, rising as high as a barn, and a sign, just off route 69, said: \"Vote - remove every Democrat.\"\nJohnson does not think Democrats should be in charge: \"With there being questions in the election, it makes me question everything they stand for.\"\nHe raises calves like his father did - and the way he hopes his two-year-old son, Monroe, will someday - and fears Democrats will sabotage the cattle industry.\n\"With all the rules that the Biden presidency wants to enforce on us, it makes me wonder - is my lifestyle going to be a viable one for my son, as it was for my dad, and to me?\" he says. \nTheir wariness of the electoral process could lead to a deeper divide in the US, with some believing in the Biden White House and others rejecting it.\n\"America is in a very fragile position,\" says Edward Foley, an election law scholar at Ohio State University in Columbus. He describes mistrust of the electoral process as \"a real challenge to the very premise of the system\".\nFoley recalls another moment in history when a battle broke out over an election.  In 2000, the Republican candidate, George W Bush, won Florida, and its electoral votes, by a narrow 537 votes, clinching the election. Supporters of his Democratic rival, Al Gore, were distraught.\n\"There was this fear that officials would use political power to manipulate the ballots,\" he says, although there was no serious effort to undermine the process. The Democrats brought the matter before the Supreme Court, but the justices halted their efforts. It fizzled out.\nToday, however, Trump and his allies have cast serious doubt on Biden's victory. \nRoger Marshall, a newly elected US Senator from Kansas, is planning to raise objections about Biden's victory on Wednesday as members of Congress meet for a joint session to certify the election results. Marshall and about a dozen other conservative senators will challenge votes in some states - a doomed, last-ditch effort to stop Biden.\nWhen asked whether contesting the election erodes confidence in the process, Marshall says he is pressing the issue because \"I want to give people confidence in future elections, so I couldn't possibly undermine people's confidence any more than it is right now\".\nHis concerns are shared by many in the area, a deeply conservative region. Here, fears of socialism and dread about a Biden presidency are intense. \n\"I feel that we're going to see the first signs of socialism,\" says Mike Avery, 53, the owner of a lumberyard on Main Street, located in Linn County, where 80% of eligible voters cast ballots for Trump.\nUngeheuer, who makes corral fences, says of Biden's policies: \"You can't start giving everybody something, and have me work my butt off and run a business, and expect me to give it away. Venezuela didn't do very good, following a socialistic agenda.\"\nThere are now also calls in Kansas and elsewhere to tighten restrictions on voting. \n\"I think the election was rigged, with the mail-in ballots. I think there were just people who are no longer with us that voted,\" says Julia Smith, 65, who is retired. \n\"I think we're going to have to go back to voting in person, with ID.\" \nFor her, Trump's defeat was proof the Democrats had pulled a fast one, and she says their efforts should be stopped. Then she pulled her coat tight against an icy wind and headed up the road."

      "tags": "Literature,Books,Black interest",
      "text": "Author Eric Jerome Dickey, whose novels of romance, mystery and adventure were best-selling page-turners over more than 20 years, has died aged 59.\nThe US writer wrote 30 novels about breathless relationships and thrilling adventures involving young African American characters.\nThey included Friends & Lovers, Milk In My Coffee, Cheaters and Finding Gideon.\nHe also wrote a series of Marvel comics about a love story between Storm from the X-Men and the Black Panther.\n\"His work has become a cultural touchstone over the course of his multi-decade writing career, earning him millions of dedicated readers around the world,\" his publicist Becky Odell told USA Today in a statement. \nWriter Roxane Gay was among those paying tribute, describing him as \"a great storyteller\".\nOther authors to add their voices included Luvvie Ajayi, who described him as \"a literary legend\", and ReShonda Tate Billingsley, who said he was \"an amazing author and an even better friend\".\nBorn in Memphis, Tennessee, Dickey started out as a software developer in the aerospace industry. Being laid off from that job gave him a chance to take writing classes and see whether he could make it as an author.\nHe emerged during a boom for African-American literature in the 1990s, and his 1996 debut Sister, Sister - about the lives and loves of three siblings - was recently named one of the 50 Most Impactful Black Books of the Last 50 Years by Essence magazine.\nHe was particularly praised for his ability to write \"believable\" female characters, and many of his readers were women.\nWhen the New York Times profiled him in 2004, it billed him as the \"chick lit king\". Patrik Henry Bass, Essence's books editor, told the paper: \"He is singular in the way he is tapping into the African-American female psyche.\"\nAnd Calvin Reid, an editor at trade magazine Publishers Weekly, said: \"He captures black language and black middle-class characters with more depth than you often see in commercial fiction.\"\nBy that time, he was selling 500,000 books a year. He was nominated four times for the NAACP Image Award for best work of fiction, winning in 2015 for A Wanted Woman.\nBy then, he had branched out into stories of crime, suspense, thrills and spills as well as the steamy and tangled relationships with which he made his name.\nHe had four daughters, but said he never based his plots on his own life. \"I avoid my life,\" he once said. \"It bores me. Trust me. A book about me would be a snoozefest.\"\nHis final novel, The Son of Mr Suleman, will be published in April."

      "tags": "Computer hacking,Spying,Russia,United States,Cyber-security",
      "text": "US intelligence agencies have said they believe Russia was behind the \"serious\" cyber compromise revealed in December.\nPresident Trump had previously suggested China might have been behind the hack, although other members of his administration had pointed the finger at Moscow.\nIn a joint statement, the intelligence bodies say they currently believe fewer than 10 US government agencies saw their data compromised, although other organisations outside of government were also affected.\nThey say work is still going on to understand the scope of the incident, which appears to have been aimed at gathering intelligence and which they say is \"ongoing\" a month after details first emerged.\nThe update on the investigation came in a statement from a task force called the Cyber Unified Coordination Group which was set up to deal with the incident. It comprises intelligence and law enforcement agencies including the FBI and NSA. \nThe group said it was still working to understand the scope of what had taken place.\nEighteen thousand customers who used Orion product from the company Solar Winds were exposed but US intelligence says it believes a much smaller number saw follow-on activity from the hackers in which they stole data. The US Treasury was among those which previously acknowledged being targeted.\n\"This is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate,\" the statement said. Many organisations are having to scour their systems for signs that they may have been compromised.\nThe incident sent shockwaves across the US partly because the breach was undiscovered for many months and was potentially far-reaching in terms of who it might have affected. It also suggested a degree of sophistication and stealth which was widely seen as a trademark of hackers from the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence agency. \nSoon after the incident was revealed, President Trump raised the possibility that China might be responsible, but members of his own administration including the secretary of state and attorney general pointed the finger at Moscow. The latest statement shows the assessment of US intelligence agencies is that Russia was behind it, although it does not go so far as accusing the Russian state itself, saying only that the actor was \"likely Russian in origin\". Moscow has denied playing any part.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has previously said it was important to take \"meaningful steps\" to hold those responsible to account. It is not yet clear, though, what that might involve. While some US politicians suggested the breach might even be compared to an \"act of war\", most cyber-experts disputed this and the US intelligence community has now played down suggestions that it could have had destructive impact. \n\"At this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence-gathering effort,\" the latest statement says. This is significant since it suggests no evidence has been found that this was preparatory activity for a more destructive cyber-attack which might switch off systems. This may limit the US response since espionage operations do not breach the cyber norms the US itself promotes (largely because it too carries out such intelligence-gathering operations against other nations). \nIn December UK officials say they believed a small number of UK organisations were affected but said they did not believe they were in the public sector."

      "text": "Doctors in Scotland have raised concerns about plans to delay the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. \nAll four UK nations will now leave up to 12 weeks between the first and second doses of the jab rather than giving both within 21 days. \nDr Lewis Morrison, head of the BMA in Scotland, said members had concerns about the potential impact of leaving such a big gap between the two doses. \nBut the UK's chief medical officers have defended the move.\nThey said that the first dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines - the only two so far approved for use in the UK - will give people substantial protection against the virus within two to three weeks of being administered.\nAnd they said that the second dose was \"likely to be very important for duration of protection, and at an appropriate dose interval may further increase vaccine efficacy\".\nThe Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments and recommended the new strategy, said data showed that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine would be \"90% effective\".\nBut the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it would not recommend following the UK's decision to delay giving the second Pfizer dose, saying there was no evidence to support the decision. \nPfizer has said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart.\nThe Pfizer vaccine was the first to be approved for use in the UK, with more than a million people having already been given the first dose.\nThe change to the vaccination strategy has meant health boards have had to change plans and cancel people booked in for their second doses of the Pfizer jabs.\nThis includes medics who are among the priority groups for Covid vaccinations. \nDr Morrison told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that some doctors had told him they would have waited for the AstraZeneca jab, which has been proven to work in the longer timetable, if they had known the second Pfizer dose was going to be delayed. \nHe said: \"We are concerned because there's clearly disagreement about the effectiveness of the second dose of Pfizer after that period of time.\n\"Furthermore I think if you give more people the first dose when you don't know what vaccine supplies are going to be within that 12-week window, that's a worry that has been expressed to me by a lot of doctors.\n\"If we give more people the first dose, do we definitely know that the second one is coming?\n\"The announcement about this before a four-day NHS holiday weekend left many places with great difficulty in reorganising vaccinations, with a real risk that vaccination numbers might perversely drop because of the organisational issues.\"\nIt comes as NHS staff were left queueing for hours outside Glasgow Royal Infirmary on Tuesday after an \"scheduling error\" meant vaccination staff did not turn up.  \nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has apologised to those affected and said it was rearranging the appointments.\nThe Scottish government has said it aims to have given at least one vaccine dose to everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the timetable could be accelerated if there were sufficient supplies of the jab. \nThe Scottish government is being pressured to provide daily figures on the number of people being vaccinated, as the UK government has already pledged to do.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"There are now no excuses left for the SNP government to dodge publishing daily vaccination rates alongside the daily infection numbers as soon as possible.\n\"The SNP's evasion to try and avoid scrutiny is nothing new but on something so important, the Scottish public must have the same information as will be provided across the UK.\"\nHis call was echoed by Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon, who added: \"It is simply unacceptable that scores of NHS staff were left queueing outside in the cold for hours, and well into the evening.\n\"It's time for Health Secretary Jeane Freeman to get to grips with the vaccination programme, publish daily figures on the number of vaccinations available and administered, and ensure that our NHS staff do not pay the price of a bungled rollout.\""

      "text": "The US is facing another huge election - one that could define how much new president Joe Biden can get done in his first term.\nMore than 100 people are gathered in the grey and damp cold in Stone Mountain. \nIt's a miserable start to the New Year but this city near Georgia's capital, Atlanta, feels anything but sleepy or hung over.\nVoter Jonathan Gardner has turned up early.\n\"The energy we get here in Georgia is something I've never seen before,\" says Mr Gardner, who was born and raised in local DeKalb County.\n\"We've had other Senate races and I'm just excited.\"\nHe is joined by fellow Democratic supporters who are singing and dancing outside a house-turned-campaign centre. \nIt's to rally support for the two men who are probably President-elect Joe Biden's most important friends right now: Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. \nThis traditionally Republican state was won by Mr Biden in November's election - but there were no clear winners for the state's two Senate seats. Now there is a run-off between the top candidates in each race.\nIf the two Democrats, Mr Ossoff and Rev Warnock, beat incumbent Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Mr Biden's party effectively controls the Senate.\nShirley Shepphard is handing out stickers, with a smile and confidence. \n\"The Democrats can win! Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can!\" she says. \nThere's a huge cheer as Mr Ossoff's large blue bus makes its way down the road and pulls up opposite the house.\nHe is only 33 years old and, in case his youth wasn't clear enough, he makes a point of jogging on to the small stage. \nDuring a polished speech he exclaims: \"The place we demand better is at the ballot box.\"\nIf Mr Ossoff wins, he'd be the youngest member of the Senate - a title once held by Joe Biden himself. \nNo pressure, but I put to him that the fate of Mr Biden's presidency is in his hands.  \nIf he loses, is Mr Biden a weakened president before he's even begun? \nWithout missing a beat, Mr Ossoff says: \"We will win.\" \nFellow Democrat and Senate candidate Mr Warnock could make history alongside him.\nHe could become Georgia's first black senator, in a state that has a higher proportion of black people than any other in the US. \nGeorgia has also found itself becoming the final battleground for an aggrieved President Donald Trump. \nThe Republican Senate candidates here - Mr Perdue and Ms Loeffler - are his last foot soldiers. \nBoth appeared at his rally the previous night, where he focused on repeating his unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.\n\"There's no way we lost Georgia, that was a rigged election,\" were the first words out of his mouth. \n\"We run all over the world telling people how to run their elections and we don't even know how to run ours.\" \nMr Trump has also gone after Georgia's Republican governor and begged another official here, in an astonishing phone call, to find votes to overturn Mr Biden's victory. \nThe president has also called the Georgia Senate races \"invalid and illegal\" without any evidence.\nThere are concerns from some Republicans he's putting people off voting on Tuesday.\nI asked supporters at Trump's rally why they would take part in an election process if they didn't believe it was fair. Some hesitated and suggested it was their civic duty.\nFor those who won't vote, it's an advantage that may work for the Democrats.\nWhen I ask two Ossoff and Warnock supporters about the claims of election fraud, both women throw their heads back, burst into a long laugh in perfect unison and shake their heads bemused: \"Yeah, that's a good one.\" \nThere's another factor in this runoff - teenagers. \nSince the 3 November presidential election, more than 23,000 people will have turned 18 in the state and can now vote in this Senate race. \nMany young voters have been holding live-streaming events in counties across Georgia.\nValerie Ponomarev just turned 18 and is very excited at getting to vote. She was upset she couldn't cast a ballot in the recent presidential election. \n\"I did the math in my head and was short by a month as I was born in December,\" she says. \n\"I was mad at my mum that I hadn't been born sooner!\"\nShe said at first, she didn't even realise the Senate runoff was so crucial in Georgia.\nShe's voting for the Democrats, Ms Ponomarev says, adding that a lot of younger people have shown support for Mr Ossoff. \n\"I think the youth finally want representation in government because we're so often underrepresented and now that we have Jon Ossoff who is closer to our age,\" she says. \nMichael Guisto found himself in the same situation as Ms Ponomarev - too young to cast a ballot in November - and says missing out on that vote was painful.\n\"It feels like a redemption,\" he says of this Senate race.\nThe polls are suggesting it's a very tight race. But this state knows that whatever it decides, it will have an impact on the country as a whole. \nMr Guisto says even though he missed out on the November election, this vote matters. \n\"I get to in some ways influence the country but this time it's a bit closer to home.\""

      "text": "Netflix is raising the cost of some of its UK subscriptions from next month, its customers have been told.\nThe streaming service said the price rises reflected money spent on content.\nIts standard monthly package will go up from \u00a38.99 to \u00a39.99 and its premium one will rise from \u00a311.99 to \u00a313.99, but its basic plan remains at \u00a35.99.\nHowever, comparison site Uswitch said the timing of the price rises was unfortunate with UK citizens living under new national lockdowns.\nThe streaming service's subscriber numbers have jumped during the pandemic, with almost 16 million new customers added worldwide in the first three months of 2020 alone.\nIn the UK, during the first national lockdown which started in March 2020, the amount of streaming content watched by consumers rose by a third compared with the previous year.\nBut Netflix faces tough competition from rivals, such as Disney+, which has also announced price rises of \u00a32 per month up to \u00a37.99 or \u00a379.90 for a full year.\nNetflix said: \"This year we're spending over $1bn [\u00a3736m] in the UK on new, locally-made films, series and documentaries, helping to create thousands of jobs and showcasing British storytelling at its best - with everything from The Crown, to Sex Education and Top Boy, plus many, many more.\n\"Our price change reflects the significant investments we've made in new TV shows and films, as well as  improvements to our product.\"\nA standard Netflix subscription gives users HD streaming on two devices at the same time with the ability to download to two phones or tablets. The premium service allows streaming on up to four screens at once, as well as offering 4K streaming and downloading to four phones or tablets.\nSubscribers who do not want to pay the extra can cancel their plan at any time without penalty or simply shift to the basic package, which allows users to watch movies and TV shows in standard definition on one device only and download to one mobile or tablet.\nNick Baker, streaming and TV expert at Uswitch.com, said: \"Netflix has been a lifeline for many people during lockdown, so this price rise is an unwanted extra expense for households feeling the financial pressure. \n\"It's unfortunate timing that this price hike coincides with another national lockdown, when all of us will be streaming more television and films than ever.\""

      "text": "Nursery staff say they are being \"treated like the bottom of the rung\" after schools in England were told to shut to reduce the virus transmission.  \nPaul Trauberman, of Rainbow Smiles in Weston-super-Mare, said despite his staff being \"scared\" about the new Covid-19 variant they had come to work. \nThe government announced a strict lockdown across the country on Monday.\nIt was after the UK moved to Covid-19 threat level five, meaning there is a risk the NHS could be overwhelmed.\nMr Trauberman, who took over Rainbow Smiles nursery in 2016, said he felt conflicted. \n\"I've come in this morning and I've got staff crying and saying they are scared of this new variant.\"\n\"We don't have PPE, we can't social distance, on the other hand we still have a business that is operational and we are not going bankrupt.\" \nHe said prolonged closure also carried the risk of going out of business but it was difficult to reassure staff when \"you don't have any of the facts\".\n\"One minute it is fine and the schools are going back, and two days later they are sending everyone home.\n\"It makes the staff feel insecure and... they just feel like they are being treated like the bottom of the rung.\n\"With this new variant ... they are having to deal with very close contact with children, with a virus around, which they are saying is very, very bad, but with no more information than that.\"\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Early years settings remain low risk environments for children and staff and there is no evidence that the new variant of coronavirus disproportionately affects young children.\" \nIt said keeping nurseries open supported parents and delivered crucial education for children as Bristol mother-of-three Eleni Franklin has found.\nShe said she \"really valued\" Acorns Nursery in Henbury Hill, being open as she and her husband are both key workers - so their children, Allegra, five, Aria, two and Rafe nine-months-old, will attend school and nursery throughout the lockdown. \n\"I can see that nurseries are different to schools. There has been one case at Aria's nursery during this whole period, whereas in school there has been quite a few,\" she said. \n\"The nursery have been pretty good and although I understand there is a risk to staff, they have put a lot of measures in place to keep people safe.\"\nOne of the biggest challenges for nurseries - with some staff now unable to work because of their own childcare responsibilities - is maintaining child-to-staff ratios. \nMr Trauberman said they worked on a basis of one-to-three for babies, one-to-four for under-three's and one-to-eight with under five-year-olds.\n\"We are trying to maintain these bubbles, but normally we would move staff around to accommodate highs and lows of staff and children, to balance it out, but we are unable to do that to enable these bubbles,\" he said.\nHis nursery is now identifying families that could potentially keep their children at home if they were unable to meet those ratios.\nMr Trauberman, who is a member of an online group for nursery owners, said some people were calling for nurseries to shut, but said if that happened they risked \"not having a business to come back to\". \n\"Small businesses are the backbone of the country and if a lot of those go under, the financial implications for the whole country are going to be catastrophic.\" \nMother-of-two Kara Willetts, from Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, said she felt it was important her daughter Isobel continued going to nursery as she noticed her behaviour had changed when she had to stop going during the first lockdown in March.\n\"Isobel is a really sociable, outgoing child and she really suffered with not going in and seeing her friends during the first lockdown. Her mental health suffered and she displayed behaviour I had never seen from her before,\" she said.\nMrs Willetts said she had full confidence in the measures introduced at the nursery three-and-a-half-year-old Isobel attends in Cheltenham. \nShe said that with her husband working from home and a seven-month-old son also at home, the option of Isobel going to nursery was \"beneficial to the whole family\".\n\"It is quite difficult for my husband to concentrate on work with two kids at home. Transmission rates in young children are very low and if I had any safety concerns I wouldn't send Isobel there,\" she added.  \nTom Shea, a former advisor to the Early Year's minister, said: \"The biggest issue is that as a society we regard childcare as something like babysitting, rather than the start of the early year's development of learning. \n\"Sadly it seems the main reason for keeping us open is for protecting employment rather than protecting children.\"\nMr Shea owns Child First Nursery in Worksop and said he thought there was a \"hierarchy\" among key workers in terms of vaccination priorities. He said \"sensibly\" the first priority was NHS staff, followed by social carers for the elderly. He said teachers ranked a \"reasonable\" third, but that Early Years workers did not feature at all.\n\"They are expected just to work, and I am not sure if the government thinks that we are invisible,\" he said.\nHe called for early vaccination of Early Years workers to allow them to stay open and be protected.\n\"The irony now is that we are being told to keep open even though we are private businesses, we are dictated to about the funding we can receive and how we receive it\u2026 and if parents are frightened of their children going into the childcare setting then suddenly we don't get paid for that, so you find nurseries half empty being forced to open and it is not economical to do that.\"\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"We are funding nurseries as usual and all children are able to attend their early years setting in all parts of England. \n\"Working parents on coronavirus support schemes will still remain eligible for childcare support even if their income levels fall below the minimum requirement.\""

      "tags": "Alaska,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "The Trump administration is pushing ahead with the first sale of oil leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\nThe giant Alaskan wilderness is home to many important species, including polar bears, caribou and wolves. \nNow, after decades of dispute, the rights to drill for oil on about 5% of the refuge will go ahead. \nOpponents have criticised the rushed nature of the sale, coming just days before President Trump's term ends.\nCovering some 19 million acres (78,000 sq km) the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is often described as America's last great wilderness.\nIt is a critically important location for many species, including polar bears. \nIn the winter months, pregnant bears build dens in which to give birth.\nAs temperatures have risen and sea ice has become thinner, these bears have started building their dens on land. \nThe coastal plain of the ANWR now has the highest concentration of these dens in the state. \nThe refuge is also home to Porcupine caribou, one of the largest herds in the world, numbering around 200,000 animals. \nIn the spring, the herd moves to the coastal plain region of the ANWR as it is their preferred calving ground. \nThe same coastal plain is now the subject of the first ever oil lease sale in the refuge. \nThe push for exploration in the park has been a decades long battle between oil companies supported by the state government and environmental and indigenous opponents. \nMany of Alaska's political representatives believe that drilling in the refuge could lead to another major oil find, like the one in Prudhoe Bay, just west of the ANWR.\nPrudhoe Bay is the largest oil field in North America and supporters believe the ANWR shares the same geology, and potential reserves of crude oil. \nOil revenues are critical for Alaska, with every resident getting a cheque for around $1,600 every year from the state's permanent fund.\nIn 2017, the Trump administration's tax cutting bill contained a provision to open up the ANWR coastal plain for drilling. It was seen as a way of offsetting the costs of the tax cuts.\nThe US Bureau of Land Management is now selling the drilling rights to 22 tracts of land covering about one million acres. These oil and gas leases last for 10 years. \nA last-minute attempt to stop the sale in the courts failed but opponents say it will not be the end of their efforts to protect the refuge from drilling. \n\"The Trump administration is barrelling forward without doing the careful, legally required analyses of the impacts such activity will have on the environment or the Gwich'in people who have relied on this land for millennia,\" said Kristen Monsell, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, which is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, who had sought an injunction against the sale. \n\"That's why we've taken them to court. We can't let Trump turn this amazing landscape into an oil field.\"\nReports indicate that interest in the lease sales has been low. \nWhile estimates suggest around 11 billion barrels of oil lie under the refuge, it has no roads or other infrastructure, making it a very expensive place to drill for oil.\nSeveral large US banks have said they will not fund oil and gas exploration in the area.\nThere is also the matter of a change of leadership in the White House. The Biden team have nominated Deb Haaland as Secretary of the Interior. She is on record as being strongly opposed to drilling in the ANWR.\nWith climate change set to be a central focus for the Biden administration, it's likely that efforts to extract new fossil fuels in Alaska will be subject to review and delay. \nThis could ultimately limit the interest and opportunity for oil exploration in the refuge. \nFollow Matt on Twitter.\nYou might also be interested in:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,NHS,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus, the highest daily death toll since April.\nIt came as 62,322 new cases were recorded, the highest daily rise since mass testing began, and as MPs supported England's lockdown.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said doctors could be forced to ration treatment without the new curbs. \nThere are 30,074 Covid patients in UK hospitals, he said, as an ambulance trust told of severe pressure.\nCurrent patient numbers are 39% higher than the previous peak on 12 April last year, when 21,684 were in hospital.\nThe number of those who died within 28 days of a positive test in the past week is 37% higher than the previous seven days.\nAndrew Hayward, a professor of infectious diseases, said the number of deaths could continue to increase for the next few weeks.\nHe explained deaths \"lag two or three weeks behind the number of cases in the community, and those have been increasing\". \nProf Hayward, who is also a government science adviser, added: \"I think the lockdown measures will turn that number of deaths around but it is going to take a little while.\"\nMr Hancock told MPs the consequences of inaction could be similar to scenes elsewhere in the world - of overrun hospitals and doctors choosing \"who to treat and who to turn away\".\n\"If we don't act now, we know that eventually the NHS would not be able to cope,\" he said.\nWest Midlands Ambulance Service experienced its busiest-ever day on Monday, handling 5,383 emergency calls due to a combination of Covid-19 pressures and winter weather.\nSussex and Surrey have rolled out \"major incident\" plans, allowing the two counties to seek more central government support as pressure mounts on health services.\nAnd hospitals in Greater Manchester are in danger of \"falling over\" as cancer operations risk being cancelled, Manchester City Council's leader Sir Richard Leese said.\nAll of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown.\nWhile England's lockdown became law at midnight, MPs voted overwhelmingly - by 524 to 16 - in support of the tougher measures on Wednesday evening.\nLabour backed the restrictions but 12 Conservative MPs rebelled to vote against. \nSpeaking during the Commons debate, Health Minister Helen Whately said although the regulations allowed the lockdown to be in place until the end of March, the government did not expect it to continue until then. \nInstead, the plan was for a \"steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a local basis\" to exit lockdown. \nFew MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions.\nMost agree they are needed now, even if they do not like them.\nThe start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too.\nThis vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March.\nThe questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan.\nMPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention.\nMeanwhile, GCSEs, A-level and AS-level exams will be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.\nAll national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are also cancelled, he confirmed.\nHe said that during this lockdown, every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week.\nThe figures are stark. But sadly they were to be expected. Infection rates were climbing throughout December - they are now more than four times higher than they were at the start of last month.\nMore infections, mean more hospital admissions and more deaths.\nThe fact deaths have gone over 1,000 for the first time since April is alarming.\nBut one caveat to that is that the figures over the past week have been jumping around because of delays reporting deaths over the Christmas period.\nA better way to measure deaths is to look at the average number of deaths over the course of the week. This metric shows we are seeing just below 700 a day - although that is still up by 40% compared to the figure before Christmas.\nAnd these numbers are only going to continue rising. That's because this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions and some of those being admitted then will die maybe a week or so later.\nLockdown is expected to have an impact, but it will take some time - and even then it may have less affect than previous ones because of the more transmissible variant. \nThe rollout of the vaccines cannot come soon enough.\nAs MPs debated the new lockdown, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for the government to ramp-up its vaccination programme to six million doses a week.\nIt came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs England's new lockdown would not end with a \"big bang\" but a \"gradual unwrapping\".\nHe said that, unlike during the first lockdown from March 2020, vaccines now offered \"the means of our escape\". \nBut he said there was a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. \nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi earlier said he was \"confident\" the \"ambitious\" target would be met, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. \nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK had been vaccinated so far.\nThe locations for seven mass vaccination centres in England have been announced by the government.\nSites in Stevenage, London, Newcastle, Manchester, Surrey, Bristol and Birmingham will be staffed by NHS workers and volunteers from next week.\nHow have you been affected by Covid?

Mr Blake is shown walking around the front of the SUV. The two officers closest to Mr Blake at this point on the video are white males.\nAs he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream.\nMr White told AP he had heard police officers shout \"Drop the knife!\" before gunfire erupted but said he had not seen a knife in Mr Blake's hands.\nHe is accused of shooting dead Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, and wounding a third man, during street unrest - in incidents also partially captured on video. \nMr Rittenhouse says the three men attacked him and he fired in self-defence.\nJury selection for his trial starts in late March.

      "text": "Clap for Carers is to return under a new name of Clap for Heroes, the initiative's founder has said. \nThe weekly applause for front-line NHS staff and other key workers ran for 10 weeks during the UK's first coronavirus lockdown last spring. \nFounder Annemarie Plas tweeted that it would return at 20:00 GMT on Thursday. \nMs Plas said she hoped the initiative would \"lift the spirit of all of us\" including \"all who are pushing through this difficult time\".\nThe idea of clapping and banging pots from doorsteps originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown for the first time.\nAfter proving popular it was expanded to cover all key workers and continued every Thursday for 10 weeks, with millions of people across the UK taking part.\nMembers of the Royal Family and politicians including Prime Minister Boris Johnson also joined in with the show of support.\nHowever, the event later faced criticism for becoming politicised, with some suggesting the NHS would benefit more from extra funding than applause. \nLast May, Ms Plas, a Dutch national living in south London, said the weekly applause should end after its 10th week and instead become an annual event. \nAt the time, she said the public had \"shown our appreciation\" and it was now up to ministers to \"reward\" key workers.\n\"Without getting too political, I share some of the opinions that some people have about it becoming politicised,\" she told the PA news agency ahead of the final clap in May. \n\"I think the narrative is starting to change and I don't want the clap to be negative.\""

      "text": "Julian Assange will remain in jail as he continues to fight against extradition to the United States.\nDistrict Judge Vanessa Baraitser said there were substantial grounds to believe he would abscond. \nOn Monday, she ruled the Wikileaks founder cannot be extradited to the US because he might kill himself. \nThe US is now appealing that decision - and had opposed releasing the 49-year-old from a maximum security prison before the case is heard. \nMr Assange, who was wearing a dark suit and face mask, was not seen to react to the decision at Westminster Magistrates Court. \nHe's been held in prison since 2019, after hiding for seven years inside the Ecuadorian Embassy to avoid extradition. \nUS prosecutors want to put him on trial for hacking and disclosing classified information - including the identities of informants who were helping intelligence agencies in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. \nIn her ruling, DJ Baraitser said Mr Assange still had the incentive to abscond.\n\"He is willing to flout the order of this court,\" she said. \"As a matter of fairness, the US must be allowed to challenge my decision and if Mr Assange absconds during this process they will lose the opportunity to do so.\"\nDuring the bail application, Mr Assange's barrister Ed Fitzgerald QC said his client had been offered a London home by a supporter, where he could be with his partner and their two young children - but also compelled to remain under the strictest bail conditions. \n\"Your decision [on Monday] changes everything and it certainly changes any motive to abscond,\" said Mr Fitzgerald.\n\"On any view... [Mr Assange] would be safer isolating with his family in the community, subject to severe restrictions, than if he were in Belmarsh which has, very recently, had a severe outbreak...(of coronavirus). He wishes to live a sheltered life with his family.\"\nBut Clair Dobbin, for the USA, told the court Mr Assange had the \"resources, abilities and the sheer wherewithal\" to secretly arrange a flight to another country. \n\"[Mr Assange] regards himself as above the law and no cost is too great, whether that cost be to himself or others,\" said the barrister.\nJulian Assange's partner, Stella Moris, was among a large group of his supporters who had gathered at court. \n\"This a huge disappointment,\" she said. \"Julian should not be in Belmarsh prison in the first place. I urge the [US] Department of Justice to drop the charges and the President of the United States to pardon Julian.\"\nDistrict Judge Baraitser blocked Julian Assange's extradition on Monday, ruling that that while he had a case to answer, he was so mentally unwell that the US authorities could not guarantee he would not kill himself once inside a maximum security prison in the country. \nThe USA's appeal against that ruling - which will go to more senior judges later this year - will challenge that finding.

      "text": "All eyes are on the southern state of Georgia, where the future of the US Senate will be decided this week. Here's all you need to know.\nThere are two races and voting has been going on since mid-December.\nThe outcome will be crucial to how much the incoming Democratic president, Joe Biden, will be able to achieve in his first term.\nWait, another US election?  Wasn't all this done in November? \nOK, rewind.\nAccording to the state rules, a winning candidate needs 50% of the votes and in November no-one achieved that.\nSo the top two go through to a 5 January replay - a so-called run-off.\nIn both races, we have a Republican incumbent up against a Democratic newcomer. \nSenator David Perdue, 70, v Jon Ossoff, 33\nMr Perdue has served as a Georgia senator since 2015. The former Reebok CEO was an early supporter of Donald Trump, and has remained an ally to the president. He is now facing scrutiny over multimillion dollar stock trades in companies whose business falls under his purview on Senate committees. He has denied wrongdoing.\nMr Ossoff launched his campaign with an endorsement from civil rights champion John Lewis, who died this summer. Before taking the reins of a documentary film company, Insight TWI, he spent five years working for Congressman Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat. He has employed his filmmaking skills on the trail, launching campaign accounts on both Snapchat and TikTok.\nSenator Kelly Loeffler, 50, v Reverend Raphael Warnock, 51\nMs Loeffler, the junior Georgia senator, is still a political novice. She was named to the US Senate in December 2019 by Governor Brian Kemp after the sitting senator resigned. One of the wealthiest members of the Senate, Ms Loeffler is co-owner of the women's NBA team the Atlanta Dream. The ownership has caused a stir after the league's players called for Ms Loeffler to sell her stake over her vocal opposition to Black Lives Matter.\nRev Warnock is a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr once preached. Along with Democratic rising star Stacey Abrams, he started the New Georgia Project, a voting rights organisation. The group is now under investigation by Georgia's Republican secretary of state for allegedly sending ballot applications to non-residents.\nThe upper chamber of US Congress, the Senate, has been controlled by the Republican Party since 2014.\nIt's very important in getting laws passed, Cabinet appointments confirmed and Supreme Court Justices on to the bench of the highest court.\nIf Democrats win in Georgia, the extra two seats would give them effective control.\nEach party would have 50 senators and it's become increasingly rare for senators to vote against their party. \nTechnically, there are currently 46 Democrats and two independent Senators - Bernie Sanders and Angus King - but they typically vote with Democrats.\nSo in a 50-50 tie, Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris would have the deciding vote in her role as Senate president.\nIf Democrats pick up the two seats and forge a 50-50 tie in the upper chamber, it's far from certain that Biden will be able to enact the kind of sweeping legislation on the environment, healthcare and the economy that he proposed during his successful presidential campaign. \nThe narrowness of the margin will ensure that any laws will have to be supported by centrists like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona's two senators.\nIt will, however, give the new president a fighting chance at legislative accomplishments - and make it significantly easier for him to appoint the administration officials and federal judges of his choice.\nIf the Republicans hold on, then that would mean two more years of divided government and, probably, legislative gridlock. Democratic hopes will rest on the whims of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a handful of Republican moderates.\nA huge amount of money has poured in for all four candidates, but record-breaking numbers for the Democrats.\nThe Loeffler-Warnock race has received more media attention, partly because it's been more feisty and vocal.\nShe accuses him of being a \"radical liberal\" who courts Marxism and wants to defund the police.\nHe sticks to a pretty centrist Democratic message of pandemic relief and healthcare.\nWith his MLK Jr links, Rev Warnock is well known among African Americans and the state has a higher proportion of black voters than the average US state.\nThe state is around 52% non-Latino white and 33% black, according to 2019 census data.\nBlack residents made up nearly half of the 1.9 million increase in Georgia's voting population since 2000, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2019, 2.5 million black voters made up a third of the total Georgia electorate. \nThe Biden-Harris win in the state was the first time in 30 years Georgia went to a Democratic presidential candidate.\nOn election-eve, President Donald Trump held a rally to support the two Republicans, urging them to turn out. Mr Perdue, however, participated virtually after coming into contact with a Covid-positive individual. He and his wife have tested negative, but have remained in quarantine.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden campaigned on behalf of the two Democrats on 4 January as well, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris travelling to the state a day earlier.\nA Democrat has not won in a Senate race in Georgia for decades so it will be an uphill struggle for them.\nThe Republican candidates also won more votes in both races when it was a larger field in November.\nBut Mr Biden narrowly won there in the presidential contest by tapping into an effective get-out-to-vote campaign among African Americans.\nVoting began weeks ago and early indications suggest a high turnout, possibly a record for a run-off in the state.\nBallot counting will begin at 19:00 local time on Tuesday, once polls close, though there could be a wait for results.\nPolling shows a very tight contest in both races even with less than a day left, though many are looking at polls with scepticism, as they missed the mark during the presidential election. \nA number of big pollsters have also opted not to cover the run-off races."

We apologise to everyone who has experienced a long wait for their vaccine.\n\"New vaccinators arrived at the site today to support the scaling up of our programme, and these individuals needed to be trained before they were able to begin vaccinating.\"\nMs Jones also said that a number of people had arrived for their appointments early, which resulted in people having to wait longer.\n\"We would like to remind everyone who has received an invite for the vaccination to arrive at the time that has been allocated to them, not any earlier,\" she said.\n\"We are doing all we can to ensure everyone is seen in a timely manner.\"\nOne person tweeted on Wednesday that the queue was two hours long, but later updated it to say it was three.\nOne of those who had been queueing for three hours told BBC Wales there were a \"good few hundred\" in the queue and said they were not told how long the delay would be.\n\"The information they gave you told you not to arrive early and not to arrive late and to wear appropriate clothing so you can lift your sleeve up and be jabbed. I went in t-shirt, jeans and a hoody and I was frozen. \n\"We walked round the building and there's a big car park at the back and it was just a big snake of people, a good few hundred. \n\"There were elderly people there, there were clearly vulnerable people, a couple of people had to have wheelchairs brought out to them because it was so cold. They weren't dressed for it, it was 2 degrees. \n\"There were people turning away, leaving the queue.\"\nMonday was described as a \"momentous day\" in the fight against Covid-19 as the rollout of the second Covid vaccine - Oxford-AstraZeneca - began in Wales.\nMore than 35,000 people in Wales have had a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - the first to be approved in the UK.\nBoth vaccines will be available in Wales and the Welsh Government said 40,000 doses of the Oxford jab would be available within the first two weeks - with 22,000 jabs this week."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 BST.\nThe measures announced on Monday have now become law, but MPs will actually vote retrospectively to approve them later today. They're expected to pass with ease - Labour has pledged its support, but said ministers must deliver a round-the-clock vaccination programme. The regulations allow restrictions to potentially be in place until mid-March. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all imposed lockdowns too, but will they be enough? An estimated one in 50 people in private households in England had coronavirus last week - one in 30 in London, while the number of daily confirmed cases topped 60,000 for the first time. Our health correspondent has more - as we've come to understand, the R number is everything. This graph shows how the R number could drop this time (in red), compared with how it fell during the first lockdown - the slower decline is down to the new, more transmissible variant.\nStudents have been anxiously waiting for news after the cancellation of A-Level and GCSE exams in England - not least because of the chaos that surrounded last year's results. Exams had already been cancelled elsewhere in the UK. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will reveal more in a statement to MPs later. He'll also give more details of support for pupils following the switch by schools and colleges to remote learning. There are fears a digital divide will mean some children are excluded. We've got some advice for parents on virtual learning, and BBC Bitesize will be broadcasting lessons on BBC Two, CBBC and online from Monday. \nPeople arriving in the UK from abroad could soon be required to prove they've had a negative coronavirus test before setting off. The Department for Transport says it's one of several measures being considered to prevent new cases arriving from abroad. Full details are still to be agreed, but it's thought hauliers coming through ports would be exempt. Currently, arrivals from countries not exempt under the travel corridor programme have to isolate for 10 days. See more on the existing rules. Travel firms have been cancelling trips since the latest lockdowns were imposed.\n2020 was a dreadful year for the UK car industry and preliminary figures from the industry's trade body show just how bad it was. New car registrations dropped to levels not seen since 1992, and saw the biggest one-year fall since World War Two when factories were turned over to military production. Showrooms and even factories were forced to close in the spring, and the switch to working from home means fewer of us need a vehicle on a daily basis. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said firms were desperately trying to minimise redundancies.\u00a0\nUnable to leave Taiwan due to the pandemic, Peter Lowe decided to get a boat to pass the time. A leisurely hobby soon turned into a quest to clear the country's waterways, river banks and mangrove forests of plastic. His efforts have inspired local volunteers to join in the clean-up, and even prompted the government to take notice.

But that did not begin to justify your participation in these murders.\"\nBen's mother Suzanne Gillham said she had felt \"physically sick\" being so close to her son's killers during the court case.\nShe called the use of knives \"cowardly\" and added that she \"was hoping to see some remorse on the faces of the juveniles and there was none\".\n\"They just smirked and walked out with a smile,\" she said\nTracey Ansah, Dom's mother, added: \"Every day we had to put on a mask and a brave face to look at them.\"\nTracey Ansah said that every day she relived the night her son did not come home, and recalled getting the first phone call from one of his friends after the attack at the party.\n\"He was frantic, saying Dom and Ben had been stabbed and we needed to get there quickly because he thought they were going to die,\" she said.\nShe said she went to the house with her son's twin sister Holly.\n\"I just needed Dom to know I was there,\" she said.\nAt that point she rang Ben Gillham-Rice's mother Suzanne.\nMs Gillham said: \"It was 12 o'clock and I was watching Kinky Boots.\n\"She [Tracey Ansah] was hysterical and said Ben had been stabbed.\n\"Tracey rang again and said they were on their way to the hospital.\n\"Dominic came in an ambulance, but Ben just wasn't coming.\"\nTracey Ansah said: \"We were taken to the hospital where we were so fortunate to get three hours with him before he died.\n\"He had time with his sister and then he left.\"\nMeanwhile, the moment Suzanne Gillham had been dreading arrived - a police woman told her Ben had died at the scene.\n\"I don't think we could understand,\" she said.\n\"That wasn't ever going to happen to our Ben.

      "text": "World leaders have condemned violent scenes in Washington after supporters of US President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday.\nThe riot forced the suspension of a joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden's electoral victory.\nMany leaders called for peace and an orderly transition of power, describing what happened as \"horrifying\" and an \"attack on democracy\".\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the \"disgraceful scenes\".\n\"The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nOther UK politicians joined him in criticising the violence, with opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer calling it a \"direct attack on democracy\".\nHome Secretary Priti Patel told the BBC that Mr Trump's comments \"directly led\" to his supporters storming Congress and clashing with police. \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the scenes from the US Capitol were \"utterly horrifying\".\nIn Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said those who stormed the US legislature were \"attackers and rioters\" and that she felt \"angry and also sad\" after seeing pictures from the scene.\nShe told a meeting of German conservatives: \"I regret very much that President Trump has still not admitted defeat, but has kept raising doubts about the elections.\"\nChina meanwhile attempted to draw comparisons between the rioters who entered Congress to try and subvert the US election result and pro-democracy protesters who stormed Hong Kong's Legislative Council last year.\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying claimed events in Hong Kong were more \"severe\" than those in Washington but \"not one demonstrator died\". \nThe comparisons between the two incidents has caused outrage among Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists and their supporters. \nRussia blamed the \"archaic\" US electoral system and the politicisation of the media for Wednesday's unrest in Washington. \n\"The electoral system in the United States is archaic, it does not meet modern democratic standards, creating opportunities for numerous violations, and the American media have become an instrument of political struggle,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. \nElsewhere in Europe, a chorus of leaders condemned the scenes in Washington as an attack on democracy.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said: \"I have trust in the strength of US democracy. The new presidency of Joe Biden will overcome this tense stage, uniting the American people.\"\nIn a video on Twitter, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"When, in one of the world's oldest democracies, supporters of an outgoing president take up arms to challenge the legitimate results of an election, a universal idea - that of 'one person, one vote' - is undermined.\n\"What happened today in Washington DC is not American, definitely. We believe in the strength of our democracies. We believe in the strength of American democracy\" he added.  \nSwedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven described the incident as \"worrying\" and said it was \"an assault on democracy\". \nTop EU leaders have also made their views known. European Council President Charles Michel said he trusted the US \"to ensure a peaceful transfer of power\" to Mr Biden, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she looked forward to working with the Democrat, who \"won the election\".\nLike many other global figures, the Secretary-General of the Nato military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said that the outcome of the election \"must be respected\".\nFor his part, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres was \"saddened\" by the events at the US Capitol, his spokesman said. \nThe events also shocked America's close ally and neighbour to its north. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians were \"deeply disturbed and saddened by the attack on democracy\".\n\"Violence will never succeed in overruling the will of the people. Democracy in the US must be upheld - and it will be,\" he wrote on Twitter. \nFrom New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, tweeted that \"democracy - the right of people to exercise a vote, have their voice heard and then have that decision upheld peacefully - should never be undone by a mob\".\nMeanwhile Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia - another close US ally - condemned the \"distressing scenes\" and said he looked forward to a peaceful transfer of power.\nIn India, the world's largest democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who has enjoyed a good relationship with President Trump - said he was \"distressed to see news about rioting and violence\" in Washington.\n \"Orderly and peaceful transfer of power must continue,\" he tweeted.\nTurkey, an ally through Nato, said it invited \"all parties\" to show \"restraint and common sense\".\nThe Venezuelan government, which the US does not recognise as legitimate, said \"with this regrettable episode, the United States suffers the same thing that it has generated in other countries with its policies of aggression\".\nIn statements on Twitter, Argentina's President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and Chile's President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era also condemned the scenes in Washington. Mr Pi\u00f1era said Chile \"trusts in the solidity of US democracy to guarantee the rule of law\".\nIn Japan, one of America's closest allies and partners, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said the government hoped for a \"peaceful transfer of power\" in the United States. \nFrom Fiji, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who led a coup in 2006, also expressed outrage at the events that took place. \nAnd in Singapore, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said he had watched as the \"shocking\" scenes took place, adding: \"Its a sad day.\" "

      "text": "Bosses of Britain's biggest companies will earn more in the first three days of this week than the average worker's annual wage, research claims.\nBy 17:30 GMT on Wednesday, the pay of FTSE 100 chiefs will have overtaken the \u00a331,461 annual median wage for full time workers, the High Pay Centre says.\nBosses' pay was flat last year, while average wages generally rose slightly.\nThat meant that FTSE chief executives had to work 34 hours to beat median annual pay, not the 33 hours in 2020.\nThe High Pay Centre think-tank based its annual calculations on analysis of disclosures in companies' annual reports, combined with government statistics.\nHigh Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard said chief executive pay is about 120 times that of the typical UK worker, up significantly from two decades ago.\n\"Estimates suggest it was around 50 times at the turn of the millennium or 20 times in the early 1980s,\" he said.\n\"Factors such as the increasing role played by the finance industry in the economy, the outsourcing of low-paid work and the decline of trade union membership have widened the gaps between those at the top and everybody else over recent decades.\"\nHe said the figures should raise concern about the governance of Britain's biggest companies. \"They should also prompt debate about the effects that high levels of inequality can have on social cohesion, crime, and public health and wellbeing,\" he said.\nMedian FTSE 100 chief executive pay was \u00a33.61m in 2019, the last year for which a full set of data is available, the High Pay Centre said.\nThe centre said its analysis was based on chief executives' average working day being 12 hours.\nHowever, critics said such analysis just fuels the politics of envy without looking at why chief executives matter and the contribution they make.\nDaniel Pryor, head of programmes at the Adam Smith Institute, said: \"Good management is more important than ever in a globalised world and small differences in top talent make a big impact on a business' bottom line. \n\"That bottom line makes a big difference to workers across the UK, anyone with a private pension, and shareholders.\"\nHe pointed out that there is strong, if morbid, evidence about chief executive deaths that shows why the corporate and investment world believe leadership makes a huge difference to the fortunes of their companies.\n\"In the past 60 years, unexpected CEO deaths have consistently affected stock price, profitability, investment and sales growth - for better or worse,\" he said, adding: \"Which is why it makes sense for firms to open their wallets to attract the best talent.\" "

Drive-through and delivery services across the fast food chain will remain open.\nUnder new lockdown restrictions which came into force in England and Scotland this week, hospitality firms are allowed to offer takeaways and deliveries.\nBut rules which previously allowed takeaways or click-and-collect services for alcoholic drinks have been scrapped.\nWales and Northern Ireland were already in lockdown, which meant that pubs, restaurants and cafes were restricted to takeaway-only too.\nAfter the first nationwide lockdown in March, many chains including McDonald's, Burger King and Pret closed their doors to hungry customers.\nThey gradually reopened with additional safety measures in place, such as plastic screens in front of the tills, hand sanitiser dispensers and restrictions on the number of customers allowed in at any one point. Some also pared back the number of dishes on offer.\nA Burger King spokesperson said that takeaway was still available in some branches and that it would continue to offer click-and-collect and delivery services \"in line with guidance issued\".\nSandwich chain Pret A Manger told the BBC that it is keeping some outlets open for both takeaways and delivery, but it would keep the number under review in the coming months.\n\"Last year we shifted our business to focus on delivery and expanded our delivery platform partnerships, to make Pret available to a wider customer base\", a spokesperson said.\n\"Since then, we have seen a significant increase in the use of delivery.\"\nSubway and KFC also confirmed that they remain open for in-store takeaways, deliveries and click-and-collect orders across the UK.\nFast food firm Leon, which has 65 outlets, said that 28 of their sites will remain open for takeaways and deliveries. \n\"We will continue to keep as many restaurants open as possible, as we did in the previous two lockdowns in line with government guidelines,\" a spokesperson said.\nDespite adapting their business models, many casual dining chains have been forced to make job cuts in the last year as lockdown restrictions hit sales. Pret, for example, announced 3,000 job cuts in August, while Greggs made 820 job cuts at the end of 2020."

It's just a bit scary.\"\nMeanwhile, Tegwen Bruce-Deans, a Welsh student at Bangor University, said she believes it is important students like herself return to university.\n\"We can do our work there, we will have enough room to do so,\" she said.\n\"We can be around people who are our own age, so that will be nice after everyone is back safely.\n\"It's so important to have somewhere safe to do our work and try and live a normal of a life as possible\". \nWelsh universities were contacted for comment.\nThe University of South Wales said it was planning for a \"phased return of on-campus learning over the next few weeks, in line with Welsh Government guidelines and prioritisation for courses\". It said safety measures, which were in place last term, would remain in place.\nSwansea University said there had been a lot of changes over the last few days and it understood further meetings would be taking place with Welsh Government and universities and if there were changes to the policy in Wales,\u00a0updated advice would be issued. \nBangor University said it was currently asking students to return to their term-time addresses, allowing time for Covid tests and to\u00a0\"lay low\"\u00a0at least\u00a0until the results of the second. \"If the Welsh Government rules change, we will send information about any changes to our students by email,\" a spokesman added.\nBBC Wales understands that representatives from Welsh universities met with Ms Williams on Tuesday afternoon and the current position was discussed but not changed. \nUniversities Wales said institutions were \"rigorously adhering\" to Welsh Government regulations and that students will be tested asymptomatically so \"Covid-secure, in-person teaching can resume\". \nIt added in a statement that evidence suggested transmission of the virus had not been taking place in a teaching setting. \nThe Welsh Government said it had issued advice to students, including the rules around a mix of in-person and blended learning."

The protesters must leave.\"\nThe US Congress has now reconvened after the violence - spurred on by Mr Trump's  unproven claims of electoral fraud - to certify Mr Biden's victory in the US election in November \nHundreds of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol, and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC. \nBoth chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released.\nFour people died on Capitol grounds during the violence, including a woman shot by police and three others, who died as a result of \"medical emergencies\", local police said.\nUK MPs from across the political spectrum have criticised the events in the US.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said there was \"no justification for these violent attempts to frustrate the lawful and proper transition of power\", while Home Secretary Priti Patel called the scenes \"unacceptable and undemocratic\".\nShe added: \"There is no justification for this violence and Donald Trump must condemn it.\"\nHer Conservative colleague, and former Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt directly addressed President Trump for telling the crowd to march on Congress, tweeting: \"He shames American democracy tonight and causes its friends anguish - but he is not America.\"\nLabour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner said: \"The violence that Donald Trump has unleashed is terrifying, and the Republicans who stood by him have blood on their hands.\"\nAnd shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the events were \"the legacy of a politics of hate that pits people against each other and threatens the foundations of democracy\".\nMeanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has defended the prime minister's response to the rioting.\nAsked on ITV's Peston programme why Mr Johnson hadn't criticised Mr Trump, she said: \"The prime minister has been clear tonight that we need a peaceful and orderly transition.\"\nMs Coffey added that events in the US were a \"reminder that democracy is something precious - and will only continue to thrive as long as we protect institutions that make this country important and not demean each other when the majority of what we want to achieve is similar outcomes\".\nMeanwhile, the SNP's leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said the end of Mr Trump's presidency \"cannot come quick enough\".\nHe tweeted: \"What a legacy the events of today are to his time in office.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The end of England's lockdown will not happen with a \"big bang\" but will instead be a \"gradual unwrapping\", Boris Johnson has told MPs.\nThe prime minister made the comments in the Commons ahead of a retrospective vote later on the lockdown measures.\nHe said the legislation runs until 31 March to allow a \"controlled\" easing of restrictions back into local tiers. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's decisions \"have led us to the position we're now in\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said there were now 30,074 patients with coronavirus in UK hospitals.\nAll of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown.\nIt came as the UK reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus, the highest daily death toll since April.\nIn a statement to the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new variant had \"led to more cases than we've seen ever before\" and that this had left the government with \"no choice but to return to national lockdown\". \nHe said the legislation ran until the end of March \"not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis\".\nHe said this would happen \"brick-by-brick... without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us\".\nBut in response to MPs' questions, he said there was a \"cautious presumption\" that restrictions could start being eased from mid-February. \n\"And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping,\" he added.\nUnder the measures, which came into force legally on Wednesday, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, for exercise outdoors only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close.\nPolice have the powers to enforce the new restrictions with a \u00a3200 fine for each breach, doubling on every offence up to a maximum of \u00a36,400 - and a \u00a310,000 penalty for mass gatherings.\nOfficers in London arrested at least a dozen people in Parliament Square after a protest against the new measures on Wednesday.\nThe need to debate and vote on the restrictions means the Commons has been recalled from its Christmas break for the second time - the first being for the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. \nWith Sir Keir saying Labour will support the motion, the measures are expected to pass with ease.\nThe restrictions will be kept under \"continuous review\", Mr Johnson added, with a statutory requirement to reconsider them every two weeks.\nAddressing the closure of schools, the PM said \"we did everything in our power to keep them open as long as possible\" and that was why schools were the \"very last thing to close\".\nThey would be the \"very first thing to reopen\" after lockdown - that could be after the February half term - but \"we must be very cautious\" about the timetable, he said.\nMeanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons that GCSEs, A-level and AS-level exams would be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades. \n\"This year, we're going to put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms,\" he said, referencing controversy over the way exam grades were awarded to some students last year.\nAll national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are now cancelled, Mr Williamson confirmed.\nHe said every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week.\nThe prime minister wasted no time in emphasising the \"fundamental difference\" between this and previous lockdowns.\nTo keep opposition from his own MPs at bay he needs to demonstrate that the government's aim to vaccinate the most at-risk groups by mid-February is viable.\nHe is also under pressure to give a sense of how quickly restrictions might be lifted after that.\nThe course of the pandemic has changed swiftly at times, though, and may do so again, so it's unlikely we'll get any firm new timelines from Boris Johnson today.\nMost Conservative backbenchers seem resigned to the need for this new national lockdown and agree the prime minister had \"no choice\" but to act.\nBut MPs on all sides are impatient to hear how soon things may start returning to something like life as normal at last.\nMr Johnson said unlike in March last year, during the first lockdown, vaccines offered \"the means of our escape\". \nBut he said there was now a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. \n\"After the marathon of last year, we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them,\" Mr Johnson said. \n\"Every needle in every arm makes a difference.\"\nEarlier, Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said he was \"confident\" the government would meet its \"ambitious\" target, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that new daily vaccination figures for the UK - which will be released for the first time on Monday - will show there has been a \"significant increase\" in the number of people who have received the jab.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK had been vaccinated so far.\nMr Zahawi also said nursery schools presented \"very little risk\", are Covid-safe and he defended the decision to keep them open during England's lockdown.\nResponding to the prime minister's statement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party will support the new restrictions and urged people to comply with them.\n\"The virus is out of control, over a million people in England now have Covid, the number of hospital admissions is rising, tragically so are the numbers of people dying,\" he said.\n\"It's only the early days of January and the NHS is under huge strain. In those circumstances, tougher restrictions are necessary.\"\nBut he added \"this is not just bad luck, it's not inevitable, it follows a pattern\" of the government being slow to respond.\n\"These are the decisions that have led us to the position we're now in - and the vaccine is now the only way out and we must all support the national effort to get it rolled out as quickly as possible.\"\nHow have you been affected by Covid?

      "tags": "James Gallagher,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lockdowns have worked before, but can we expect the new one to do the same?\nIt feels like we are back in March or April last year, when the strict controls on all our lives led to a fairly quick decline in levels of coronavirus. \nBut one of the crucial differences this time is the new variant, which is thought to spread between 50 and 70% faster than previous forms of the virus. \nExperts warn there are now no guarantees that lockdown will be enough to bring the variant under control. \n\"It still would not have been easy, but it would have been a much easier situation if it had not been for the new variant,\" Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told Inside Health.\n\"That really pushes the bounds of our ability to control the spread of the virus, even with measures that were previously relatively quite effective.\"\nThe coronavirus spreads when we come into contact with each other so moving classrooms online, telling people to stay at home and closing shops breaks many of those opportunities for human contact. \nIf we consider the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - it was about 3.0 in the run up to the first lockdown and anything above 1.0 means cases are climbing.\nR fell to 0.6 during the first lockdown.\nThen every 1,000 infected people passed the virus on to 600 others, who passed it on to 360 others and so on. \nBut if the new variant is 50% more transmissible then the R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be about 0.9.\nThen 1,000 infected people would pass the virus onto 900 others, then 810 and so on. \nAs you can see this leads to far slower decline. \nAnd that assumes lockdown can get R down to 0.9 in areas where the new variant has become the most common form of the virus. \nIf, as some studies suggest, the variant is about 70% more transmissible then R may stay above 1.0 and cases may not fall at all.\n\"We'd at best flatten the curve, keep numbers at a roughly constant level, and that's frankly why there is so much emphasis on getting vaccine into people's arms as quickly as possible,\" said Prof Ferguson.  \nIt is hard to lock down even harder as there are some parts of society - hospitals, supermarkets - that need to be kept open. \nWhat happens to the number of cases over the coming weeks will be closely monitored. If this lockdown is less effective then we will have to live with it for longer.\nThere have been some encouraging signs over the Christmas break, which was a bit like a lockdown due to school holidays and other restrictions.\n\"We are in a very difficult situation here, but my initial assessment of the last few days is that the rate is slowing which is good news,\" Prof John Edmunds, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC.\nHe added: \"It looks likes those restrictions should be sufficient to stop the increase, whether they will be sufficient to bring cases down sufficiently we are yet to see.\"\nEventually the vaccine will give people immunity so we do not need the same controls on our lives.  \nNow more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Social media,Revenge porn,Pornography",
      "text": "A woman who has been the victim of deepfake pornography is calling for a change in the law. \nLast year, Helen Mort discovered that non-sexual images of her had been uploaded to a porn website.\nUsers of the site were invited to edit the photos, merging Helen's face with explicit and violent sexual images. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Mobeen Azhar, Helen said she wanted to see the creation and distribution of these images made an offence. \n\"This is a crime which in many cases is going on invisibly,\" Helen said. \"Those images of me had been out there for years and I didn't know about them, and I'm still having nightmares about some of them now. It's an incredibly serious form of abuse.\"\nDeepfakes are realistic computer-generated images or video, based on a real person.\nHelen, a poet and writer from Sheffield, was alerted to the deepfake images by an acquaintance. \nThe original images were taken from her social media and included holiday pictures and photos from her pregnancy.  \nShe said although some of the images were clearly manipulated, there were a few more \"chilling\" examples that were a \"lot more plausible'.\n\"You go through different phases with things like this,\" she said. \"There was one point where I was just trying to laugh about the almost ridiculous nature of some of it.\n\"But obviously, the underlying feeling was shock and actually I initially felt quite ashamed, as if I'd done something wrong. That was quite a difficult thing to overcome. And then for a while I got incredibly anxious about even leaving the house.\"\nShe alerted the police to the images but was told that no action could be taken. \nDr Aislinn O'Connell, a lecturer in law at Royal Holloway University of London, explained that Helen's case fell outside the current law. \n\"In England and Wales, under section 33 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015, it is an offence to non-consensually distribute a private sexual photograph or film with the intent to cause distress to the person depicted,\" she said. \n\"But this only applies where the original photo or video was private and sexual. \n\"In Helen's situation, where non-sexual photos were merged with sexual photos, this isn't covered by the criminal offence. \n\"Furthermore, as the photos were not shared with Helen directly, nor did the intention seem to be to cause distress to Helen, the second element is not fulfilled - even though it did, evidently, cause distress. The other potential criminal offence would be harassment, but given the perpetrator here did not direct it at Helen herself, this didn't apply either.\"\nThe independent Law Commission is currently reviewing the law as it applies to taking, making and sharing intimate images without consent. The outcome of the consultation is due to be published later this year.\nHowever, Dr O'Connell said the process of changing the law would take years which she says is \"too long\". \nHelen hopes to use her experience to raise awareness around deepfake pornography and has launched a petition calling for a change in the law. \nIt has received more than 3,400 signatures.\nShe has also written a poem in response to the images. \n\"I'm a writer by trade,\" she said. \"And I thought the only thing that is going to allow me to reclaim any sense of agency here is to say something about it using my art form. That's the only power that I have.\n\"The intention of this person, as they said in their post, was to humiliate. They said they wanted to see this person humiliated, and I thought well actually I'm not humiliated, and I'm going to speak out about it because I shouldn't be the one who feels ashamed.\"\nThe Home Office said it was taking steps to tackle new and emerging forms of violence against women and girls, including intimate image abuse, \"whether this be cyber flashing, revenge porn or deep fake videos.\"\n\"We are currently consulting on the development of our new strategy to tackle violence against women and girls and we encourage people to give their views,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"This new strategy will ensure victims and survivors are supported, and that perpetrators are identified and brought to justice.\""

      "text": "Supermarkets are seeking to reassure shoppers that there is no need to bulk-buy products as new lockdown restrictions come into force.\nAsda asked its customers to \"continue to shop considerately and not buy more than they normally would.\"\nThere was a surge in online grocery shopping after new lockdown restrictions were announced on Monday, but demand has since dropped back.\nStores said they have good availability and have increased delivery slots.\nTesco and Sainsbury's have doubled the number of delivery slots since March.\nWhen fresh lockdown restrictions were announced on Monday there was a rush online by supermarket shoppers to book delivery slots.\nThat surge has since calmed down, but big supermarkets were keen on Wednesday to reassure customers that there is no need to bulk-buy, as stores would like to avoid a repeat of the panic-buying that was triggered by the first lockdown.\nAsda said it \"currently has strong product availability across its stores and depots and its colleagues are working around the clock to keep the shelves stocked.\"\nSainsbury's said it had \"good availability and encourage customers to shop as normal. We aren't currently restricting products.\"\nTesco has had buying limits on various products since the first lockdown, and most recently limited items including eggs, rice, soap and toilet roll after freight delays in December as ports got snarled up.\nTesco said on Wednesday that it had \"good availability in stores and online, with plenty of stock to go round, and we would encourage our customers to shop as normal.\"\nDuring the first lockdown supermarkets saw a huge spike in demand for online shopping as people tried to avoid mixing in shops.\nThe big chains have all increased their capacity to deliver food.\nTesco, the biggest UK supermarket chain, has more than doubled the number of online delivery slots available since the start of the crisis, and now has 1.5 million slots per week.\nNot all of these get used across the UK at present, so Tesco has no plans at the moment for further slots.\nSainsbury's, the second biggest, has also more than doubled the number of its online delivery slots since March, and can meet more than 800,000 orders per week.\nAsda, the third biggest chain, has upped the number of available weekly slots by 90% since March to 850,000, and by the start of April it's planning to offer 900,000 slots per week.\nMorrison's, the fourth largest UK supermarket chain, said it had increased its online operation fivefold since March.\nAsda said on Wednesday that it was also doubling the size of its partnership with Uber Eats. From February Asda will offer a 30-minute delivery service from 200 stores.\nAsda is also stepping-up Covid safety measures, including doubling safety marshal hours, more sanitation stations, increasing cleaning, and \"adding a protective antimicrobial coating to customer 'touch points' in stores such as fridge and freezer handles, checkout areas, plus all trolley and basket handles\".\nThe chain also has a virtual queueing app called \"Quidini\" whereby customers can sit in their car to wait for a slot in a store if it is busy."

      "tags": "Gavin Williamson,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.\nHe told MPs he would \"trust in teachers rather than algorithms\", a reference to the U-turn over last year's exams.\nFor primaries, he confirmed there would be no Year 6 Sats tests this year.\nMr Williamson promised parents it would be \"mandatory\" for schools to provide \"high-quality remote education\" of three to five hours per day.\nHe said this would be \"enforced\" by Ofsted, with inspections where there were \"serious concerns\" about what was provided for children now studying at home.\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary, Kate Green, accused Mr Williamson of \"chaos and confusion\" - and said he had failed to listen to the \"expertise of professionals on the front line\". \nShe said he had given a \"cast-iron commitment\" that exams would go ahead - and Ms Green said: \"At that moment, we should have known they were doomed to be cancelled.\"\nMr Williamson, in a statement to the House of Commons, said there would be \"training and support\" for teachers in estimating grades, \"to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently\".\nHe also told MPs there would be no Sats tests for those at the end of primary school.\n\"I can absolutely confirm that we won't be proceeding with Sats this year. We do recognise that this will be an additional burden on schools \nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said rather than a \"vague statement\" of how A-levels and GCSEs would be graded, ministers should already have a system ready in place - and it was a \"dereliction of duty\" that it was not already prepared.\nAnd he warned against repeating the \"shambles\" of last summer's cancelled exams.\nThe education secretary confirmed to MPs that GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown.\nThe exams watchdog Ofqual will draw up proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, for qualifications that could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places.\nSimon Lebus, the watchdog's interim head, said evidence for replacement grades could include tests, homework, mock exams and teachers' observations - and would take into account how much of the syllabus had been covered.\nA consultation is expected to begin next week, with plans to be decided by the end of February or possibly sooner.\nLast year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades.\nAnd without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' assessments, with some process of moderation between schools, will be used for this summer's candidates.\nOn vocational qualifications, Labour's Ms Green said the education secretary was \"failing to show leadership on exams in January\".\nVocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them - but college leaders had complained that there needed to be a national decision to avoid confusion.\nIf students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will still be awarded a grade, if they have \"enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression\", says the awarding body Pearson.\nAn Ofqual spokeswoman said they would consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, \"to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances\".\nThe exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades.\nMr Williamson's statement in the Commons came as all GCSE, AS and A-level exams in Northern Ireland were  cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday.\nScotland has already cancelled its Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers.\nGCSEs  and A-levels in Wales were scrapped in November."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland hopes to accelerate its vaccine rollout programme if supplies of the jab allow it to do so, the country's first minister has said.\nThe Scottish NHS hopes to vaccinate everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May. \nIf the target is achieved, it would mean 2.7 million people - about half of the population - will have had the jab.\nIt would then be rolled out to the rest of the adult population. \nBut Nicola Sturgeon said that timetable was a \"cautious prediction\", and the aim was to accelerate the rollout \"as fast as we possibly can\" as more details about supply became available. \nMs Sturgeon was speaking as new lockdowns began in both Scotland and England, with people being told to stay at home except for a handful of permitted reasons. \nThe tough restrictions will remain in force across all of mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha until at least the end of the month, and will see schools closed to most pupils, places of worship shut and group exercise banned. \nSpeaking to the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister said it was difficult to be definitive about when the restrictions would be lifted.\nBut she said it might be possible to ease some of the rules if the vaccination programme managed to push ahead of the virus in the \"race\" over the coming months.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"Lockdown is about trying to slow down the virus and push rates of it back down.\n\"Now, if we manage to do that, then hopefully we will be able to start lifting some of these restrictions while the vaccination programme is ongoing, even in that first phase of it.\n\"But I can't be certain about that yet, because it's dependent on us managing to get the levels of infection down.\"\nScotland hopes to have received just over 900,000 doses of the vaccine by the end of January - including the 100,000 doses that have already been administered to people. \nMs Sturgeon said the government did not yet have full certainty about supply schedules after this month, but said details were being firmed up all the time.\nAnd she said a \"cautious prediction\" would be that \"we will have vaccinated the whole of the JCVI priority list by early May, which is everybody in Scotland above the age of 50 and people under 50 with underlying health conditions. \n\"That is about 2.7 million people, and we will then go on to the rest of the population.\n\"But we will be working as information on supplies becomes clearer to accelerate that timetable as fast as we possibly can.\"\nThe NHS in England has said it hopes to be able to deliver two million vaccines a week by the end of this month.\nAnd Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to vaccinate people in the top four priority groups in England by mid-February - which would include everyone over the age of 70 and the most clinically vulnerable, as well as care home staff and residents and frontline health and social care workers.\nMs Sturgeon later told her daily briefing that said she would ideally want to do the same, but that she did not yet have enough certainty about the supply of the vaccine to be able to make a firm commitment.\nShe said this could risk \"undermining people's confidence in our ability to deliver\" if it was not possible to meet the timetable.\nOpposition parties have called on the Scottish government to publish daily vaccination figures so that the public can clearly see what progress is being made in the fight against Covid-19.\nA further 2,529 new coronavirus cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours, about half of which are thought to be the new variant. \nThe number of hospital patients confirmed to have coronavirus has also risen steeply to 1,347, an increase of 255 over the past week.\nOf these patients, 93 are in intensive care, an increase of 28 in the same period, while a further 11 deaths of people who had tested positive have been recorded. \nThe first minister also said she hoped the situation would have improved enough to allow pupils to return  to school on 1 February, but admitted that she cannot be certain that this will happen.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have warned that the attainment gap between richer and poorer pupils is poised to stretch even wider unless the Scottish government radically increase their support for learning at home.\nThe party says the government has had months to prepare for a return to remote learning, but that schools still do not have the necessary guidance and resources they need to provide equal access to high quality education. \nThe Children and Young People's Commissioner, Bruce Adamson, has also warned that closing schools poses a \"serious risk of harm to the wellbeing of children and young people\" and online learning is being provided \"inconsistently\" across Scotland.\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the closure of schools had left working parents in a very difficult position. \nMs Sturgeon said plans were being developed to extend testing for the virus in schools, but said it would be \"wrong\" to divert vaccine doses away from the most vulnerable people so they could be given to teachers instead. \nMs Sturgeon added: \"We are trying to work out, within the overall programme, how quickly can we prioritise getting teachers and school staff vaccinated, so we have some discussions and some thinking still to do around that.\"\nShe also said she could see no reason why the Scottish Parliament election would not go ahead in May, adding that it was \"really important\" that the democratic process continues. \nMSPs passed legislation last month which contains contingency options for the election.\nIt could allow voting to take place on more than one day, though ministers do not expect this power will have to be used.\nA legally-enforceable stay-at-home order is now in place across mainland Scotland and Skye with people only permitted to leave their home for an \"essential purpose\".\nThis includes essential shopping, exercise, caring for someone, or if you are part of an extended household.\nAnyone able to work from home must do so, although those shielding to protect themselves from Covid-19 should not go into work - even if they cannot work from home.\nSchools will be closed to most pupils until 1 February at the earliest, meaning an additional two weeks of home learning for youngsters, in a move welcomed by teaching unions on Monday.\nMs Sturgeon also revised the numbers of those allowed to gather outside to just two people from two different households, instead of the previous limit of six people from two households.\nHowever children aged 11 and under are not included in this limit and can still \"play outdoors in larger groups, including in organised gatherings\".\nFrom Friday, places of worship must close but can open to broadcast a service or conduct a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.\nA maximum of 20 people can attend a funeral service but wakes are banned, while up to five people can attend weddings and civil partnership services.\nPolice Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone also confirmed there will be \"increased patrols\" in Scotland's communities and said and officers will continue to act against anyone making \"wilful breaches\" of the law.\nShetland, Orkney, Western Isles and several other islands currently remain at level three restrictions."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,NHS,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus, the highest daily death toll since April.\nIt came as 62,322 new cases were recorded, the highest daily rise since mass testing began, and as MPs supported England's lockdown.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said doctors could be forced to ration treatment without the new curbs. \nThere are 30,074 Covid patients in UK hospitals, he said, as an ambulance trust told of severe pressure.\nCurrent patient numbers are 39% higher than the previous peak on 12 April last year, when 21,684 were in hospital.\nThe number of those who died within 28 days of a positive test in the past week is 37% higher than the previous seven days.\nAndrew Hayward, a professor of infectious diseases, said the number of deaths could continue to increase for the next few weeks.\nHe explained deaths \"lag two or three weeks behind the number of cases in the community, and those have been increasing\". \nProf Hayward, who is also a government science adviser, added: \"I think the lockdown measures will turn that number of deaths around but it is going to take a little while.\"\nMr Hancock told MPs the consequences of inaction could be similar to scenes elsewhere in the world - of overrun hospitals and doctors choosing \"who to treat and who to turn away\".\n\"If we don't act now, we know that eventually the NHS would not be able to cope,\" he said.\nWest Midlands Ambulance Service experienced its busiest-ever day on Monday, handling 5,383 emergency calls due to a combination of Covid-19 pressures and winter weather.\nSussex and Surrey have rolled out \"major incident\" plans, allowing the two counties to seek more central government support as pressure mounts on health services.\nAnd hospitals in Greater Manchester are in danger of \"falling over\" as cancer operations risk being cancelled, Manchester City Council's leader Sir Richard Leese said.\nAll of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown.\nWhile England's lockdown became law at midnight, MPs voted overwhelmingly - by 524 to 16 - in support of the tougher measures on Wednesday evening.\nLabour backed the restrictions but 12 Conservative MPs rebelled to vote against. \nSpeaking during the Commons debate, Health Minister Helen Whately said although the regulations allowed the lockdown to be in place until the end of March, the government did not expect it to continue until then. \nInstead, the plan was for a \"steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a local basis\" to exit lockdown. \nFew MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions.\nMost agree they are needed now, even if they do not like them.\nThe start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too.\nThis vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March.\nThe questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan.\nMPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention.\nMeanwhile, GCSEs, A-level and AS-level exams will be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.\nAll national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are also cancelled, he confirmed.\nHe said that during this lockdown, every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week.\nThe figures are stark. But sadly they were to be expected. Infection rates were climbing throughout December - they are now more than four times higher than they were at the start of last month.\nMore infections, mean more hospital admissions and more deaths.\nThe fact deaths have gone over 1,000 for the first time since April is alarming.\nBut one caveat to that is that the figures over the past week have been jumping around because of delays reporting deaths over the Christmas period.\nA better way to measure deaths is to look at the average number of deaths over the course of the week. This metric shows we are seeing just below 700 a day - although that is still up by 40% compared to the figure before Christmas.\nAnd these numbers are only going to continue rising. That's because this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions and some of those being admitted then will die maybe a week or so later.\nLockdown is expected to have an impact, but it will take some time - and even then it may have less affect than previous ones because of the more transmissible variant. \nThe rollout of the vaccines cannot come soon enough.\nAs MPs debated the new lockdown, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for the government to ramp-up its vaccination programme to six million doses a week.\nIt came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs England's new lockdown would not end with a \"big bang\" but a \"gradual unwrapping\".\nHe said that, unlike during the first lockdown from March 2020, vaccines now offered \"the means of our escape\". \nBut he said there was a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. \nVaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi earlier said he was \"confident\" the \"ambitious\" target would be met, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. \nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK had been vaccinated so far.\nThe locations for seven mass vaccination centres in England have been announced by the government.\nSites in Stevenage, London, Newcastle, Manchester, Surrey, Bristol and Birmingham will be staffed by NHS workers and volunteers from next week.\nHow have you been affected by Covid?

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has called for a \"round the clock\" vaccination programme to tackle the rise in Covid cases.\nAs part of a televised speech, the Labour leader said the government needed to deliver \"millions of doses a week by the end of the month\". \nHe said there were \"serious questions for the government to answer\" over the timing of the lockdown in England, but Labour would support the restrictions.\nBoris Johnson said daily vaccination figures would be published from Monday.\nThe prime minister has also said the four most vulnerable groups of people across the UK should receive their first dose by mid-February. \nBoth the PM and Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have announced lockdowns this week.\nWales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December.\nEngland's lockdown will become law from 00:01 GMT Wednesday and MPs will return to the Commons later that day to vote on the measures retrospectively. \nThe restrictions come into force as the number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\nOn Tuesday, 60,914 had tested positive in the previous 24 hours and a further 830 people had died within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn an address to the nation on BBC One, in response to Boris Johnson's televised address on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK had reached a \"critical moment in our fight against coronavirus\".\nThe Labour leader said people were \"angry at the mistakes the government has made\" and ministers needed to answer questions on why they did not act sooner over locking down England. \nHe stressed that Labour would continue to hold the government to account, but added: \"Whatever our quarrels with the government and with the prime minister, the country now needs us to come together.\n\"At this darkest of moments, we need a new national effort to re-kindle the spirit of last March - to come together and to do everything possible to stay at home [and] to protect the NHS and save lives.\"\nSir Keir reiterated that Labour would support the new lockdown when it comes to the retrospective Commons vote on Wednesday and \"join in this national effort\".\nBut he called for the government to use the lockdown to establish \"a massive, immediate, and round the clock vaccination programme\" to \"deliver millions of doses a week by the end of the month in every village and town, every high street and every GP surgery\".\nThe Labour leader added: \"This is now a race between the virus and the vaccine and if we pull together as a nation, we can win.\n\"We need a new contract between the government and the British people: The country stays at home, the government delivers the vaccine.\"\nEarlier at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said more than 1.3 million people across the UK had now been vaccinated with either the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines.\nThe figure included 23% of over-80s in England - part of a programme Mr Johnson said aimed to save \"the most lives the fastest\".\nThe PM said there will \"still be long weeks ahead\", but that he wanted to give \"maximum possible transparency\" about the vaccination roll-out.\nMore details will be announced on Thursday, with daily updates starting on Monday, \"so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making\", he added.\nAsked whether the target could be met, Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, said the timetable was \"realistic but not easy\"."

      "tags": "Georgia,Republican Party,Democratic Party,United States Senate",
      "text": "The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden has won control of the Senate - and of Congress overall - with two victories in the state of Georgia.\nRaphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeated Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue respectively.\nDemocrats will control the Senate, the House of Representatives and the White House for the first time since 2009. \nAn estimated four million Georgians turned out to vote in the run-off election.\nThe result is a severe blow for outgoing Republican President Donald Trump.\nThe Georgia election was rerun because none of the candidates in the November general election achieved the 50% needed for victory under state rules. \nMr Warnock, a Baptist pastor, becomes the first black senator for Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black member of the Senate in US history. \nMr Warnock paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. \n\"The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,\" he said. \nWith the result in Georgia, the Democrats and the Republicans will now each have 50 seats in the Senate, the upper house of Congress.\nHowever, the incoming Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, will preside over the Senate once she takes office and will have the tie-breaking vote.\nThis gives the Biden administration a greater chance of achieving its agenda on issues such as healthcare and climate change. \nThe Senate also has the power to approve or reject Mr Biden's nominees for cabinet and judicial posts.\nIt appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up at the polls in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Meanwhile, Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers.\nThe two Democrats at times ran as a team, and appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Mr Ossoff drew out suburban and educated voters around Atlanta.\nDonald Trump is set to receive considerable blame for the Republican defeat. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state.\nInstead, the two races remained close, as Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Georgia's Republican leaders.\nIt turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it will cost Republicans control of the Senate. \nBoth races were very tight. Mr Warnock defeated Senator Kelly Loeffler by a projected 50.7% to 49.3%, figures from the Associated Press indicate. \nMs Loeffler, who was appointed to the Senate last year to fill a vacancy, is a Trump loyalist. \nThe other contest was even closer. Jon Ossoff edged ahead of Senator David Perdue, 70, taking 50.28% to 49.72%.\nFinal results are expected later.\nPresident Trump continued to make unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud, doubting the integrity of the Georgia vote. \nOn Sunday, a recording emerged of Mr Trump putting pressure on Georgia's top election official, Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to \"find\" enough votes to overturn Mr Biden's win in the state.\nRaphael Warnock, 51, is a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta - the church where civil rights leader Martin Luther King once preached.\nMr Warnock was a youth pastor in New York City in the 1990s before moving to Baltimore, one of the poorest cities in the US.\nThere, he worked to educate his congregation about the risks of HIV/Aids. He also supports access to abortion, making him a rarity among faith leaders, and opposes the death penalty. In 2013, he gave the benediction at the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.\nJon Ossoff, 33, is a documentary filmmaker, born in Atlanta. As a high school student, he interned for John Lewis, the civil rights campaigner and congressman who died in 2020.\nHe became an aide to a Democratic member of Congress, specialising in foreign policy and national security.\nIn 2012, Mr Ossoff joined an independent production company specialising in investigative journalism, Insight TWI, which is based in London. He is now the CEO. "

      "text": "Greggs expects up to a \u00a315m loss for the year, which would be its first annual loss since it listed its shares on the stock exchange in 1984.\nThe bakery chain said it does not expect profits to return to pre-Covid levels until 2022 at the earliest.\nIt has been battling a sales slump due to the coronavirus pandemic, but sales declines have been lessening.\nGreggs made 820 job cuts at the end of last year, after its sales were hit by coronavirus lockdowns and restrictions.\nChief executive Roger Whiteside said the impact of the Covid-19 crisis had been \"enormous\" and that a fresh lockdown meant \"significant uncertainties remain in the near term\".\nCoronavirus restrictions towards the end of last year led to \"variable trading conditions across the UK\", he said.\nSales in the final three months of the year fell by nearly a fifth, but this decline was less than its sales slump in the third quarter.\nIn September, Greggs, which is based in Newcastle, said it was in talks with staff to cut hours in an effort to minimise job losses.\nBut it still decided to cut 820 jobs because of \"lockdown levels of business\" as High Streets were hit by the crisis.\n\"Looking ahead, the significant uncertainty over the duration of social restrictions, along with the impact of higher unemployment levels, makes it difficult to predict performance,\" the firm said.\n\"However, we do not expect that profits will return to pre-Covid levels until 2022 at the earliest.\"\nGreggs said on Wednesday that total sales for the year were down nearly a third to \u00a3811m, but government support had helped to limit pre-tax losses.\nIt said it had developed its takeaway business and a delivery tie-up with Just Eat, and had also seen \"strong sales\" through its partnership with retailer Iceland.\n\"We have taken action to position Greggs to withstand further short-term shocks and are optimistic about our prospects for growth once social restrictions are lifted,\" Mr Whiteside added.\nGreggs wants to open about 100 new stores, on a net basis, over the year ahead.\nJulie Palmer, a partner at insolvency consultants Begbies Traynor, said: \"The latest national lockdown will be unwelcome news for Greggs, which has operated shrewdly during the past year in spite of a lack of footfall, with non-essential stores forced to close and millions working from home.\n\"The bakery chain has had to adapt its business model and invest digitally to accommodate for the rapid change in shopping habits, offering click-and-collect purchases, as well as a nationwide delivery service through its partnership with Just Eat.\n\"This should provide a solid base for the business to expand when government restrictions are eased and the world returns to some normality.\""

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has called for a \"round the clock\" vaccination programme to tackle the rise in Covid cases.\nAs part of a televised speech, the Labour leader said the government needed to deliver \"millions of doses a week by the end of the month\". \nHe said there were \"serious questions for the government to answer\" over the timing of the lockdown in England, but Labour would support the restrictions.\nBoris Johnson said daily vaccination figures would be published from Monday.\nThe prime minister has also said the four most vulnerable groups of people across the UK should receive their first dose by mid-February. \nBoth the PM and Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have announced lockdowns this week.\nWales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December.\nEngland's lockdown will become law from 00:01 GMT Wednesday and MPs will return to the Commons later that day to vote on the measures retrospectively. \nThe restrictions come into force as the number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\nOn Tuesday, 60,914 had tested positive in the previous 24 hours and a further 830 people had died within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn an address to the nation on BBC One, in response to Boris Johnson's televised address on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK had reached a \"critical moment in our fight against coronavirus\".\nThe Labour leader said people were \"angry at the mistakes the government has made\" and ministers needed to answer questions on why they did not act sooner over locking down England. \nHe stressed that Labour would continue to hold the government to account, but added: \"Whatever our quarrels with the government and with the prime minister, the country now needs us to come together.\n\"At this darkest of moments, we need a new national effort to re-kindle the spirit of last March - to come together and to do everything possible to stay at home [and] to protect the NHS and save lives.\"\nSir Keir reiterated that Labour would support the new lockdown when it comes to the retrospective Commons vote on Wednesday and \"join in this national effort\".\nBut he called for the government to use the lockdown to establish \"a massive, immediate, and round the clock vaccination programme\" to \"deliver millions of doses a week by the end of the month in every village and town, every high street and every GP surgery\".\nThe Labour leader added: \"This is now a race between the virus and the vaccine and if we pull together as a nation, we can win.\n\"We need a new contract between the government and the British people: The country stays at home, the government delivers the vaccine.\"\nEarlier at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said more than 1.3 million people across the UK had now been vaccinated with either the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines.\nThe figure included 23% of over-80s in England - part of a programme Mr Johnson said aimed to save \"the most lives the fastest\".\nThe PM said there will \"still be long weeks ahead\", but that he wanted to give \"maximum possible transparency\" about the vaccination roll-out.\nMore details will be announced on Thursday, with daily updates starting on Monday, \"so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making\", he added.\nAsked whether the target could be met, Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, said the timetable was \"realistic but not easy\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Department for Education,Early education,Nadhim Zahawi,Coronavirus pandemic,Nurseries",
      "text": "Nursery schools present \"very little risk\" and are Covid-safe, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi has said, as he defended keeping them open.\nMr Zahawi contrasted nurseries with schools, which were closed because they had been \"vectors for the new variant\". \nEarly years providers have called for mass testing and for their staff to be prioritised for vaccination.\nThe Unison union called for nurseries to close to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers.\nAnnouncing the national lockdown for England on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised: \"Everyone will still be able to access early years settings such as nurseries.\"\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, nurseries are closed along with other schools. But in Wales they also remain open.\nOne nursery owner in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, told the BBC that a prolonged closure carried the risk of going out of business but said it was hard to reassure staff on safety when he did not have \"any of the facts\".\n\"I've come in this morning and I've got staff crying and saying they are scared of this new variant,\" said Paul Trauberman, of the Rainbow Smiles nursery.\nThe Early Years Alliance, which represents nursery providers, said most nurseries wanted to stay open but do not feel confident they have the support and protection they need.\nSome which share sites with schools have been given discretion to close by the government guidance and some others have independently decided to shut, the alliance said.\n\"If the government wants the sector to remain open, it must now put forward specific evidence about the risks of doing so, including the rates of transmission of the new variant of Covid-19 in early years settings - not just for children but also for adults working there,\" said chief executive Neil Leitch.\nThe alliance is calling for mass testing at nurseries and priority access to vaccines for their staff - they say many are aged over 50.\nBy Smitha Mundasad, BBC health reporter\nIn general, a child's risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus is tiny and considerably less than an adult's. That has remained true throughout the pandemic.\nAnd younger children have had the lowest admission rates to hospital compared to all other age groups.\nThe advice that will have steered the government towards keeping nurseries open is that younger children are also considered to be less likely to pass on coronavirus than older children.\nIn the Sage minutes from 22 December, the government scientific advisers say the \"closure of secondary schools [is] likely to have a greater effect than closure of primary schools\".\nThe concern is that it is older children - particularly teenagers - who may be able to pass the virus on even without symptoms - and drive it further into communities.\nUnison backed the call for vaccine priority and mass testing, but said nurseries should be shut, alongside schools across the UK, to protect staff and communities.\nThe union's head of education Jon Richards said: \"Social distancing is impossible with young children and the government has yet to publish the scientific evidence to justify \u200bnurseries being treated differently to schools.\"\nEmma, a nursery worker in South Cambridgeshire, told the BBC: \"Everybody at the nursery feels let down. We feel as though we have been kicked to one side.\"\nShe said when children develop symptoms, staff have to stay with them until their parents can pick them up for self-isolation. \"Many members of staff are putting their lives at risk on a daily basis,\" Emma said.\nAsked about concerns from staff about keeping early years education open, Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast: \"It's the right thing to do.\"\nHe said that at nurseries with the very youngest children \"there is very little risk\". \"The nursery sector has taken tremendous care in making sure the premises are Covid-safe,\" he added.\nMoving education at primary and secondary schools online for all but the children of key workers and those deemed vulnerable was \"a last resort\", the minister said.\nHe said: \"The schools are safe but they can act as vectors for the new variant which is much more transmissible in community settings.\"\nIn the House of Commons, Labour MP Paula Barker asked Education Secretary Gavin Williamson why nurseries were staying open, saying she had been \"inundated\" with queries from concerned parents and staff.\nMr Williamson said evidence from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) found that early years education had a smaller impact on transmission rates than primary schools.\nBristol mother-of-three Eleni Franklin said she could see the case for treating schools and nurseries differently, having seen only one case at her daughter's nursery, while her older child's school had experienced several.\nKara Willetts, from Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, said her three-year-old daughter \"really suffered\" from isolation during the first lockdown. She said she had full confidence in her nursery's Covid measures."

      "tags": "Hong Kong anti-government protests,China,Hong Kong national security law,Hong Kong",
      "text": "More than 50 of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested in the biggest crackdown since China imposed a draconian security law last year.\nAbout 1,000 police took part in morning raids on 72 premises across the city.\nThose held helped run an unofficial \"primary\" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections.\nThey are accused of trying to \"overthrow\" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent.\nChina's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. \nBeijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop \"external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security\".\nBut the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are \"the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment\".\nDozens have been arrested under the security law since it was enacted in June, but never have so many been rounded up at the same time as on Wednesday, which marked a major escalation in the crackdown and sent a chill through pro-democracy figures.\nPolice fanned out around the city and in early morning raids detained 53 people who represent a who's who of democratic forces in the former British colony, young and old. They include: \nPolice also searched the home of already detained activist Joshua Wong, as well as three news outlets. \nApple Daily and Stand News, which had co-organised election forums for the primaries candidates, and In-Media, which ran ads around the primaries, were ordered to hand over information.\nMr Clancy, a veteran legal activist and long-time resident of Hong Kong, is chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the first US citizen held under the new law. He was detained when police searched the offices of law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners where he works.\nHours after the dawn arrests John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, confirmed a group of people had been arrested as part of an operation targeting those suspected of \"overthrowing\" the city's government.\nThe government will not tolerate \"subversive\" acts, he said, speaking at the city's Legislative Council.\nIf charged under the new national security law, the detainees could face life in prison. \nThe BBC's Danny Vincent in Hong Kong says the legislation has spread what activists call \"white terror\" across the city. It has all but silenced the street protest movement and led to a growing number of activists fleeing the territory.\nWhen authorities introduced the law, they claimed it would target only a small number of activists, but the wide-ranging nature of Wednesday's operation has led many to fear the authorities are now trying to eliminate the entire opposition camp, he says. \nIn July last year, an alliance of opposition parties ran independently organised primaries to see which of their candidates had the best chances in September's election for the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's parliament. \nMore than 600,000 people voted in the primaries. The election was later postponed, with officials citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the delay. \nThe opposition groups had hoped that winning more seats would give them enough power to block government proposals and increase pressure for democratic reforms. \nHong Kong's leader Carrie Lam had warned at the time the primaries could amount to subversion if the candidates intended to obstruct government policies through their election.\nSeveral of the opposition figures planning to stand in the LegCo election were later disqualified from running, including Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist who rose to prominence covering the 2019 protests. \nMost of the opposition lawmakers in the current LegCo resigned in November in protest at four of them being dismissed from parliament. \nThe crackdown has stunned people in Hong Kong.\n\"Seeing the news today I feel completely shocked. I feel very disappointed. It seems that such major things are happening in Hong Kong and there's nothing we can do about it. \n\"I feel very unhappy and it seems that even during the epidemic the government can still do so many things to terrorise people,\" Mannie Ng, a Hong Kong resident, told Reuters news agency.\nThe arrests have been widely condemned internationally. \nAntony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick as next US Secretary of State, said they were an \"assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights\".\n\"The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy.\"\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the arrests were a \"grievous attack\" on rights applied under the joint declaration signed with Britain when the territory was handed over in 1997.\nHe said it demonstrated the national security law was \"being used to crush dissent and opposing political views\".\nChris Patten, the territory's last British governor, said: \"The Chinese Communist Party has further turned the screw in Hong Kong. Liberal democracies around the world must continue to speak out against the brutal destruction of a free society.\"\nMaya Wang, China specialist at Human Rights Watch, said China was now \"removing the remaining veneer of democracy in the city\".\n\"Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government,\" she said.\nNathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist who fled the territory in July last year, said the widespread arrests had taken \"the suppression of political freedom and freedom of speech\" to \"another level\". \n\"Anyone who is still defending the National Security Law and making peace is the enemy of Hong Kong people.\"\nBy Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai\nBeijing sees \"vicious plans\" to topple Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government. Supporters of the dozens arrested see another crude crackdown on what's left of the territory's nascent democracy. \nDespite co-ordinated international criticism, with some targeted retaliation, led by the US and the UK, the authorities have enthusiastically embraced their powers under the new national security law passed last year. \nHow these latest arrests come under that jurisdiction is not yet clear. But it's worth remembering this law is ambiguous and sweeping in its definition, targeting anyone, anywhere in the world.\nThe street protests are now a distant memory. Some prominent figures have fled to friendly countries, almost certainly never to return. \nThe security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.\nIt has been widely criticised by rights groups and Western nations as effectively curtailing dissent.\nA former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It retained more civil and political freedoms than the mainland has.\nActivists say that in recent years, these freedoms have been eroded. Pro-democracy protests have often led to violent clashes with police. \nThe Chinese government has defended the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland.\nAfter the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety and several high profile court cases under the security law have started.\nMedia tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under it as well as several activists who tried to flee the territory by boat last August.

However, her death was then confirmed on Tuesday.\nRoberts had collapsed while walking her dogs on 24 December and was admitted to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre.\nHer partner Lance O'Brien mistakenly thought she had died on Sunday after visiting her in hospital.

      "tags": "Radio",
      "text": "Woman's Hour host Emma Barnett has defended herself after a guest who was booked to appear on the BBC Radio 4 programme dropped out due to remarks the presenter made about her off-air.\nKelechi Okafor said she was treated in a \"degrading\" and \"vile\" manner.\nBarnett said she and her producers were discussing alleged anti-Semitic remarks Okafor had made in the past.\nThe host said she then raised these directly, adding: \"I stand by my questions to my team and to Kelechi.\"\nBarnett said Okafor \"denied the allegations and hung up\". \nOkafor, who is an actress, dance instructor and podcaster, had been booked for an item about the #MeToo movement.\nWednesday's programme marked a year since the trial of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, who was jailed for 23 years for rape and sexual assault.\nThe 15-minute discussion was intended to explore what the #MeToo movement has achieved. \nAfter Okafor pulled out of the programme, the item went ahead with the other guests, Rosanna Arquette and Caitlin Dulany - two of the actresses who accused Weinstein of sexual assault. \nWriting on Twitter, she said Barnett spoke about her in a disrespectful way, without realising she could be heard.\n\"The host didn't realise her mic was on as she was talking about me before the interview started,\" Okafor posted.\n\"You can have a genuine concern about something you've been told about me and address it in a manner that is kind. That wasn't what took place.\n\"The need for me on today's show was to offer balance to these wayward women thinking that the MeToo movement is no longer needed. The fact is that if you feel it's no longer needed for your white middle class sensibilities, marginalised voices still need it.\n\"We haven't heard from everybody regarding the violations they've faced. The originators of the MeToo movement were black women. From enslaved black women who were raped by slave owners to Tarana Burke yet their voices are yet to be honoured.\"\nWriting on Twitter, Barnett said: \"Just before I went on air this morning to present a special programme about Me Too... it came to my attention that one of our guests, Kelechi Okafor, had made alleged anti-Semitic remarks.\n\"I was also sent a press report of the transcript of what she had said on her podcast supporting Reggie Yates's comments about Jewish male managers and profits.\"\nYates apologised in 2017 after saying in a podcast interview: \"The thing that makes it great about this new generation of [music] artists is that they ain't signing to majors. They're independent, they're not managed by some random fat Jewish guy from north west London, they're managed by their brethren.\"\nLater that year, Okafor said Yates had been speaking \"the truth\" and said his comments were \"not problematic\".\nBarnett continued: \"As Weinstein is also Jewish and was referenced as part of this same podcast, I was discussing with my producers the role of this guest in light of her allegedly anti-Semitic comments. Kelechi overheard that chat on our open Zoom link - with two minutes to airtime.\n\"I then directly talked to Kelechi about the allegations, standing by my queries, and said she could put her response across in the programme. She denied the allegations and hung up, choosing to no longer be part of the programme.\n\"I stand by my questions to my team and to Kelechi. I would have happily hosted her on the programme with a question on this issue.\"\nShe added: \"I believe people can always answer for themselves - but equally it is my duty to ask people what qualifies them as a leading voice in a space.\"\nA BBC spokesman said: \"During an off-air conversation ahead of the programme, Emma Barnett and the production team talked about a guest's role in the discussion, and how to reflect some of the guest's alleged previous comments and the issue of anti-Semitism as part of the Woman's Hour discussion on the role of minority voices in the MeToo movement.\n\"This was also raised directly with the guest before going on air.\"\nThe BBC said the off-air conversation did not make reference to Okafor's race.\nThe alleged incident occurred on Barnett's third day as the new presenter of Woman's Hour. Dame Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey both left the programme last year.\nBarnett has previously spoken out against anti-Semitism on her BBC Radio 5 Live programme after controversial comments from the rapper Wiley.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Head teachers have warned a replacement system for cancelled exams in England must avoid the \"shambles\" of last year's results.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson is to make a statement on \"alternative arrangements\" for GCSE and A-level exams cancelled in the pandemic.\nThis could include using teachers' estimated grades.\nA replacement system must not \"inflict further disadvantage on students\", says the exams watchdog Ofqual.\nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said there were \"no easy answers\" in picking an approach - but it had to avoid repeating the \"disaster\" of last summer's cancelled exam season.\nHe said there was a \"real need for urgency\" to allow schools time to plan - and that any system for grading had to show \"fairness and consistency\".\nWritten papers for GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown.\nMr Williamson will instruct the exams watchdog to come up with proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, which could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places.\nLast year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades.\nAnd without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' grades, with some process of moderation, is likely to be a key option once again.\nVocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them.\nBut if students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will be able to take them at a later date or otherwise still be awarded a grade, if they have \"enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression\", says the awarding body Pearson.\nAn Ofqual spokeswoman said they could consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, \"to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances\".\nAlthough the process is only formally beginning, with a consultation likely on proposals, it is understood that contingency planning had already started to find a back-up if exams were cancelled.\nThe exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades.\n\"We are discussing alternative arrangements with the Department for Education. We know that many are seeking clarity as soon as possible,\" said Simon Lebus, Ofqual's interim chief regulator."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Thursday morning.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 has reached 30,074. That is 39% higher than the previous April peak. The UK also recorded its highest daily death toll since April, at 1,041. And the 62,322 new cases reported is the largest number since mass testing began. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it had its busiest day on record as hospitals struggled to cope with the influx of virus patients. Four patients faced waits of over five hours outside hospitals. And NHS Wales' chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall\u00a0has warned Covid patient numbers could soon reach twice April's peak.\nWith the cancellation of A-levels and GCSEs already confirmed, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson set out how year 11 and 13 students will receive their grades. He said the government would \"trust in teachers rather than algorithms\", after the experience of last year when results were widely disputed before being overturned. Teachers will be given training and support to ensure grades can be awarded \"fairly and consistently\", he told MPs. Mr Williamson confirmed that primary schools' national curriculum tests - often known as Sats - will be cancelled for all age groups as well. Northern Ireland has also cancelled its GCSE and A-level exams, meaning none of the UK nations will hold public exams in academic subjects this summer.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has tried to allay concerns from MPs, including those in his own party, about the length of England's lockdown, given that the legislation for it runs until the end of March. Mr Johnson said that there was a \"cautious presumption\" restrictions could be eased in mid-February, but he said there would a \"gradual unwrapping\" of the \"lockdown cocoon\" and not a \"big bang\". The measures came into force on Wednesday morning, with MPs voting on them retrospectively this evening. Scotland,\u00a0Wales and\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0are also under lockdowns now.\nFraudsters are sending bogus text messages about coronavirus vaccination to try and obtain people's bank details, trading standards officers have warned. The scam messages say the recipient is \"eligible to apply for your vaccine\" and give a link which leads to a fake NHS website. It asks for personal information and bank details \"for verification\" - but health authorities stressed that they would never ask for an individual's bank details. \nThe woman who started Clap for Carers for 10 weeks during the first lockdown has urged people to give frontline workers a big hand once again. Annemarie Plas is reviving the weekly applause from gardens, doorsteps and balconies to show appreciation for key workers and the NHS as the whole of the UK finds itself again under lockdown. Calling it Clap for Heroes this time, Ms Plas said she hoped the applause, starting on Thursday at 20:00 GMT, would \"lift the spirit of all of us\" in a difficult time.\nGet a longer news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.    \nConcerned about how to help your child learn online?

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,E-learning",
      "text": "With schools once again closing their doors to most pupils, parents, many juggling work and childcare, are having to step in to fill the gap.\nIf your child's school already puts work online, via Google Classroom, for example, this will probably continue. \nBut these sort of tools tend to be used more by secondary schools than primaries. \nSo older pupils are more likely to be in the routine of checking their school's chosen platform and completing work.\nAnd they are more likely to have their own laptops.\nSome schools are asking older children to follow their existing timetables, with some active lessons, involving Google Hangouts and virtual classrooms, and some passive ones, in which children work independently.\nAnd depending on the individual school, there will probably be a system to allow children to submit work and have it marked.\nParentKind has published a list of free online resources, as has Oak National Academy, which is collated by teachers.\nMany schools are also providing lists of resources on a range of topics, to help parents navigate this difficult time, such as:\nMany schools already pay for online resources, so it is worth checking which ones you can access, as these will follow the curriculum. \nAbout half of UK schools use sites such as MathsWatch, for example, which caters for children from Year 4 up to A-level.\nBBC Bitesize has lots of content divided into subject and age categories, with much new material added since March.\nThe BBC will also show curriculum content on TV every weekday from Monday, 11 January: \nThe government, meanwhile, unlike during the first national lockdown, will expect schools to deliver their own online learning.\nIf parents have any concerns about their child's education, the government says they should raise it with a teacher in the first instance. If the matter is still not resolved, parents can contact the schools watchdog, Ofsted.\nLittle and often is the advice from MathsWatch co-founder Ken Smith, a teacher for 34 years. \n\"Even an hour's lesson at school is broken down by teachers,\" he says.\n\"And parents need to do the same. \n\"It is much better to do a little bit every day.\" \nBut like the school day, it is important to establish a routine, says Sarah Dove, a teacher who works online with children who cannot attend school.\n\"The key is finding out what works for you as a family but have a delineation between home life and school,\" she says.\n\"Don't spend all day in pyjamas. \n\"Come together for a mindfulness session rather than an assembly and do topic-based work too.\"\nEven at school, children are not working from 09:00 to 15:00, Ms Wespieser says.\nSo expecting them \"to sit at the table with paper and pen\" all day is unrealistic.\nBut it is important parents think about themselves as well.\n\"One of the biggest challenges parents have reported to us is balancing their own work with school work,\" she says. \n\"And employers may be a bit less sympathetic this time.\n\"Parents need to look after their own wellbeing and take the time to find what works for you. \n\"And schools should be giving a lot more advice.\"\nIn the last lockdown, there were concerns about a digital divide between affluent families with access to laptops and those who did not have devices and may have struggled to get their children online at all.\nAdd to that the cost of broadband and the fact some parts of the country still don't have access to decent internet speeds, and home-schooling has been a nightmare for many families.\nThe Department for Education says that more than 700,000 devices have been delivered to schools in England so far during the pandemic - 100,000 of which were delivered last week. \nIt says  it has bought a further 300,000 laptops and tablets which will be delivered to schools for distribution. \nTeaching unions have said more still needs to be done, while others have called for data costs on educational apps and websites to be deducted from broadband charges.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said that the government is working with mobile phone operators to provide free data for key educational sites, \nCustomers using BT Mobile, EE, and Plusnet Mobile will be able to access BBC Bitesize content from the end of January without eating into their data allowance. \nThe Department for Education already runs a scheme for disadvantaged children who do not have access to a home broadband connection, while some internet providers are also helping out.

      "text": "The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden is on the verge of taking control of the Senate as results come in from two elections in Georgia.\nPastor Raphael Warnock is projected to win one seat. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leads narrowly in the other.\nIf they both win, Mr Biden will control Congress fully and have a much better chance of pushing through his agenda.\nHe said it was \"time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity\".\nThe election is being rerun because of Georgia's rule that a candidate must take 50% of the vote in order to win.\nNone of the candidates in November's general election met that threshold. \nWith 98% of votes counted, US TV networks and the Associated Press news agency called the first of the two races for Mr Warnock. \nControl of the Senate in the first two years of Mr Biden's term will be determined by the outcome of the second run-off.\nMr Warnock is set to become the first black senator for the state of Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black senator in US history. \nHe serves as the reverend of the Atlanta church where assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached.\nClaiming victory, he paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. \n\"The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,\" he said. \nIf both Democrats win, the Senate will be evenly split 50-50, allowing incoming Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Democrats narrowly control the House of Representatives.\nMr Ossoff has also claimed victory in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue, but that race is even tighter. At 33, he would be the Senate's youngest member for 40 years.\nA Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years but the party has been boosted by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. Mr Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast.\nMr Biden is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. He won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the president. \nMr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president.\nFinal results are expected later on Wednesday. \nThe margins are extremely tight. Mr Warnock is projected to have won his race by 50.6% to 49.4% over incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler.\nEdison Research, which supplies election results to news organisations including the BBC, says Mr Ossoff is leading by 50.2%, to 49.8% over Mr Perdue. \nMore than 98% of ballots from Georgia's 159 counties have now been counted. The remaining votes come from the Atlanta suburbs, which are projected to go heavily for the Democrats. \nMore than three million voters - about 40% of those registered in Georgia - voted before Tuesday. Early voting benefited Mr Biden in November's White House election.\nAlthough the results are not final, it appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers.\nThe two Democrats, at times running as a team, appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Although Mr Ossoff slightly underperformed his Democratic counterpart, he still attracted the kind of white suburban voters around Atlanta who have been moving away from the Republican Party during the Trump presidency.\nIf it turns out both prevail, Donald Trump will receive considerable blame for the Republican defeats. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state.\nBut Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Republican leaders in the state.\nIt turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it could cost Republicans control of the Senate."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Public health,Scottish Parliament election 2021,Scottish Parliament,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland has entered a new Covid-19 lockdown, but is also preparing to go to the polls in just a few months time. How can an election take place during a pandemic, and what plans are in place?\nTo start with, yes. Many countries have held elections already during the pandemic.\nSome, like New Zealand, have had relatively few cases of coronavirus to contend with. But others, like the US, have successfully conducted ballots while in the grip of nationwide outbreaks.\nThere have even been a number of council by-elections in Scotland over the past year, from Edinburgh and Aberdeen to the Western Isles.\nYes, they featured a far smaller turnout than is expected in May - but they provide vital experience for returning officers in terms of the ease of finding polling places and recruiting staff in the present conditions.\nThe Holyrood election is not the only one due in the UK this spring, either - there are also elections to the Welsh Parliament and a host of local council and mayoralty contests across England.\nAs it stands, everyone is still planning for an election on Thursday 6 May.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she can \"see no reason at this stage\" why it should have to be delayed, despite the fact the vaccination programme will still be ongoing come polling day.\nAny change would be a decision for Holyrood as a whole, rather than the government. However the principal opposition party - the Conservatives - have backed Ms Sturgeon's position.\nMSPs have introduced contingency plans which would allow the vote to be pushed back by up to six months - either by a vote of parliament, or in the most extreme circumstances via a decree from Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh.\nBut the hope is that the combination of the vaccine and the other backup plans that have been put in place will be enough for the vote to go ahead safely.\nAny delay would likely have implications across the UK, with the races mentioned above in mind - polling and politics guru Prof Sir John Curtice has suggested that a joint approach may ultimately be taken in Cardiff, Edinburgh and London if there are to be any changes.\nVoting by post is expected to be a big feature of the coming election - but current plans would not allow for everyone to mail in their ballots.\nIt was already a growing trend - 3.6% of the electorate registered for a postal vote in 2003, then 11.2% in 2007, 14.1% in 2011, and 17.7% in 2016 - and surveys suggest more Scots than ever will want to take the socially-distant option to cast their vote in 2021.\nAt present only 17% of the electorate have signed up for a postal ballot, but officials are braced for this to surge to up to 40% once campaigning gets under way - with parties expected to urge their supporters to sign up en masse.\nThe challenge will be what happens if an even greater number than that apply. The deadline for postal registrations has already been brought forward to provide time to process the expected wave of applications.\nIf, say, half of the electorate were to ask for a postal ballot, the Electoral Management Board have voiced fears the election would have to be pushed back in order to get through the paperwork.\nAnd they say an all-postal election likely would not be possible until November, such would be the burden of signing up all 4.2m Scottish voters to the system.\nOne contingency plan on the table is to hold polling across more than one day - potentially even with different age groups voting on different days.\nSeveral parties - Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems - have voiced cautious support for multi-day polling. However the Election Management Board have stated a preference for voting on a single date, and both the SNP and Tories are behind that position.\nAnother consideration is where votes are cast. For the most part, there are few concerns about polling places becoming the epicentre of new outbreaks - they are highly regulated environments at the best of times, and officials say they would pose no more risk than a supermarket.\nHowever, the Electoral Commission have said they might reconsider using schools as polling places, particularly if voting does take place over more than one day, due to the risk of disrupting education still further.\nWithin polling places, more stations where voters can cast their ballot may be set up, to reduce queues - which would require extra staff to be taken on.\nOne final question applies to when votes might be counted. Talks have been held about whether the traditional overnight count - with staff packed into community centres and gym halls - would go ahead as normal, or whether results could be tallied at a more sedate pace the following day.\nThe election campaign is due to officially begin in March - although arguably some parties have already been in campaign mode for some time now.\nIt seems highly unlikely that social distancing guidelines will have been relaxed enough by then for politicians to go out shaking hands and kissing babies.\nIndeed there have been complaints in some quarters about candidates going out knocking on doors during selection contests, so the traditional \"boots on the ground\" approach will likely take a back seat to the \"air war\" of wider messaging.\nThe US election is likely to be instructive - Joe Biden managed to win the presidency despite rarely leaving the house.\nOne final wrinkle is that this year, MSPs will likely still be MSPs right up to polling day.\nNormally in an election year, Holyrood would shut down in late March. However this year \"dissolution\" is likely to be delayed until the day before polling, in case parliament needs to be recalled in an emergency.\nThis is mostly a technical matter - Holyrood would be in recess, so members wouldn't be prevented from campaigning - but would mean members were bound by the MSPs code of conduct throughout the election period."

      "text": "Closing schools will have \"grave consequences for children\", Wales' education minister has said.\nAll schools and colleges in Wales have been told to move to online learning until 18 January at the earliest.\nKirsty Williams said the decision was \"really difficult,\" but education \"has a role in supressing the virus\". \nSome school leaders and opposition politicians have questioned whether a two-week classroom closure would be sufficient.\nSchools in England will move to online teaching until February. \nMs Williams told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"I'm a mother too and I'm dreading the prospect of home-schooling. The vast majority of children want to be in school as home-learning is not as good as being in front of teachers.\n\"But we have to understand the seriousness of the situation we face and have the confidence of staff that when they are in school, they are safe.\"\nShe said there was no evidence the new variant was more transmissible in children than adults.\nSchools will only stay closed after 18 January \"if that's the only thing we can do to suppress the virus\", she added.\n\"Clearly any decision to close schools for face-to-face contact for the majority of children is a really really difficult decision and it's a decision which has grave consequences for children.\n\"Education has a role to play in helping suppress the virus and helping our NHS to cope and helping those doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front line and struggling so hard to look after us all.\" \nSome schools had been due to open on Wednesday and others by 11 January with decisions made by local authorities - nurseries and other childcare settings remain open.\nTeaching unions had called for a delayed start to term amid concerns about the coronavirus variant.\nPlaid Cymru called for urgent help for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nJane Jenkins, head teacher at Moorland Primary School in Splott, Cardiff, said: \"We started planning for this before Christmas. It's not really any surprise.\n\"We learnt a lot of lessons in the first lockdown about the difficulties some children and families had with online learning, so we've been able to tailor our support much better this time around.\"\nMother-of-two Clare Ferguson-Walker from Tavernspite, Pembrokeshire, said parents were suffering from \"exhaustion\", but it was the right decision to close schools.\n\"In terms of how it's going to impact on families, I just think we're all tearing our hair out.\n\"Trying to get our kids to actually engage with online learning is a massive task... my kids just don't want to do it, I'm the last person they want to listen to.\"\nChanelle Taylor, a painter and decorator from Caerphilly, said she was worried about balancing schooling with running her business. \nShe said: \"The most worrying concern I have is that with my daughter goes to a Welsh school and we're not Welsh speakers. \n\"It's made a big impact at home trying to home-school her as well as me trying to find childcare to keep my business afloat. \n\"At the moment I'm managing with my mum doing childcare, but it's difficult for my mum because my brother has Asperger's so she also cares for him. At the moment I'm limiting my quotations and working as much as I can without bringing more stress home for my mother.\"\nSara Powell-Davies, who is also from Caerphilly, said she had struggled to get childcare for her four-year-old daughter and other parents she had spoken to had been frustrated by the timing of the announcement. \nShe said: \"You can't do things like this last minute, it's not fair on parents and it's not fair on teachers and schools. \n\"We've been scrambling around now trying to sort out childcare.\"\nStephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and a member of the Independent Sage advisory group, said the focus needed to shift away from keeping schools open to keeping them safe.\n\"A lot of the talk has been about whether schools should be open or closed. Everyone wants schools to be open. We should also be thinking about the best way of making schools safe so we can reopen them as soon as possible,\" he said.\nHe suggested reducing class sizes, hiring more teachers and more spaces and dividing classes.\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said support needed to be made urgently available to children from disadvantaged backgrounds who \"will now fall further behind with their education\".\nShe added: \"Hubs for vulnerable children and the children of key workers are also a necessity alongside an immunisation programme for all school staff so that schools can become a safer environment upon re-opening.\"\nNAHT Cymru, which represents head teachers, welcomed the announcement, saying it had been \"inevitable for some time\".\nDirector Laura Doel added: \"It is uncertain whether the next two weeks will be enough time to ensure a fully risk-assessed plan is put in place.\"\nThe Association of Schools and College Leaders Cymru questioned why it had taken so long for the minister to reach a decision.\nBut Ms Williams said: \"We need to reassess the evidence, which comes through on a daily basis, which makes decision-making really hard. Sometimes, when the data arrives, you simply have to act\". \nThe decision in Wales came as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increased the Covid threat level to five - its highest level.\nLevel five warns of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\", according to the UK government's website.\nWales has been under \"stay-at-home\" lockdown restrictions since 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, with more than 31,000 cases in the two weeks over Christmas.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties.\nHowever, the latest available data shows both England's and Northern Ireland's Covid case rate has risen above Wales.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set of new national restrictions for England, with schools and colleges closed until the end of February half term and pupils being taught online.\nScotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at home, with schools to be closed.\nMost pupils in Northern Ireland were not expected to return to school this week as had been planned.\nOn Monday, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a \"last resort\"."

      "text": "A Chinese scientist at the centre of unsubstantiated claims that the coronavirus leaked from her laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan has told the BBC she is open to \"any kind of visit\" to rule it out.\nThe surprise statement from Prof Shi Zhengli comes as a World Health Organization team prepares to travel to Wuhan next month to begin its investigation into the origins of Covid-19. \nThe remote district of Tongguan, in China's south-western province of Yunnan, is hard to reach at the best of times. But when a BBC team tried to visit recently, it was impossible. \nPlain-clothes police officers and other officials in unmarked cars followed us for miles along the narrow, bumpy roads, stopping when we did, backtracking with us when we were forced to turn around.\nWe found obstacles in our way, including a \"broken-down\" lorry, which locals confirmed had been placed across the road a few minutes before we arrived.\nAnd we ran into checkpoints at which unidentified men told us their job was to keep us out. \nAt first sight, all of this might seem like a disproportionate effort given our intended destination, a nondescript, abandoned copper mine in which, back in 2012, six workers succumbed to a mystery illness that eventually claimed the lives of three of them.\nBut their tragedy, which would otherwise almost certainly have been largely forgotten, has been given new meaning by the Covid-19 pandemic. \nThose three deaths are now at the centre of a major scientific controversy about the origins of the virus and the question of whether it came from nature, or from a laboratory.\nAnd the attempts of Chinese authorities to stop us reaching the site are a sign of how hard they're working to control the narrative.\nFor more than a decade, the rolling, jungle-covered hills in Yunnan - and the cave systems within - have been the focus of a giant scientific field study.\nIt has been led by Prof Shi Zhengli from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). \nProf Shi won international acclaim for her discovery that the illness known as Sars, which killed more than 700 people in 2003, was caused by a virus that probably came from a species of bat in a Yunnan cave. \nEver since, Prof Shi - often referred to as \"China's Batwoman\" - has been in the vanguard of a project to try to predict and prevent further such outbreaks.\nBy trapping bats, taking faecal samples from them, and then carrying those samples back to the lab in Wuhan, 1,600km (1,000 miles) away, the team behind the project has identified hundreds of new bat coronaviruses.\nBut the fact that Wuhan is now home to the world's leading coronavirus research facility, as well as the first city to be ravaged by a pandemic outbreak of a deadly new one, has fuelled suspicion that the two things are connected.\nThe Chinese government, the WIV, and Prof Shi have all angrily dismissed the allegation of a virus leak from the Wuhan lab.\nBut with scientists appointed by the World Health Organization (WHO) scheduled to visit Wuhan in January for an inquiry into the origin of the pandemic, Prof Shi - who has given few interviews since the pandemic began - answered a number of BBC questions by email.\n\"I have communicated with the WHO experts twice,\" she wrote, when asked if an investigation might help rule out a lab leak and end the speculation. \"I have personally and clearly expressed that I would welcome them to visit the WIV,\" she said.\nTo a follow-up question about whether that would include a formal investigation with access to the WIV's experimental data and laboratory records, Prof Shi said: \"I would personally welcome any form of visit based on an open, transparent, trusting, reliable and reasonable dialogue. But the specific plan is not decided by me.\"\nThe BBC subsequently received a call from the WIV's press office, saying that Prof Shi was speaking in a personal capacity and her answers had not been approved by the WIV.\nThe BBC denied a request to send the press office a copy of this article in advance.\nMany scientists believe that by far the most likely scenario is that Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, jumped naturally from bats to humans, possibly via an intermediary species. And despite Prof Shi's offer, for now there appears to be little chance of the WHO inquiry looking into the lab-leak theory.\nThe terms of reference for the WHO inquiry make no mention of the theory, and some members of the 10-person team have all but ruled it out.\nPeter Daszak, a British zoologist, has been chosen as part of the team because of his leading role in a multimillion dollar, international project to sample wild viruses.\nIt has involved close collaboration with Prof Shi Zhengli in her mass sampling of bats in China, and Dr Daszak previously called the lab-leak theory a \"conspiracy theory\" and \"pure baloney\".\n\"I've yet to see any evidence at all of a lab leak or a lab involvement in this outbreak,\" he said. \"I have seen substantial evidence that these are naturally occurring phenomena driven by human encroachment into wildlife habitat, which is clearly on display across south-east Asia.\"\nAsked about seeking access to the Wuhan lab to rule the lab-leak theory out, he said: \"That's not my job to do that.\n\"The WHO negotiated the terms of reference, and they say we're going to follow the evidence, and that's what we've got to do,\" he added.\nOne focus of the inquiry will be a market in Wuhan which was known to be trading in wildlife and was linked to a number of early cases, though the Chinese authorities appear to have already discounted it as a source of the virus. \nDr Daszak said the WHO team would \"look at those clusters of cases, look at the contacts, look at where the animals in the market have come from and see where that takes us\".\nThe deaths of the three Tongguan workers following exposure to a mineshaft full of bats raised suspicions that they'd succumbed to a bat coronavirus.\nIt was exactly the kind of animal-to-human \"spillover\" that was driving the WIV to sample and test bats in Yunnan.\nIt is no surprise then that, following those deaths, the WIV scientists began sampling bats in the Tongguan mineshaft in earnest, making multiple visits over the next three years and detecting 293 coronaviruses.\nBut apart from one brief paper, very little was published about the viruses they collected on those trips.\nIn January this year, Prof Shi Zhengli became one of the first people in the world to sequence Sars-Cov-2, which was already spreading rapidly through the streets and homes of her city.\nShe then compared the long string of letters representing the virus's unique genetic code with the extensive library of other viruses collected and stored over the years.\nAnd she discovered that her database contained the closest known relative of Sars-Cov-2. \nRaTG13 is a virus whose name has been derived from the bat it was extracted from (Rhinolophus affinis, Ra), the place it was found (Tongguan, TG), and the year it was identified, 2013. \nSeven years after it was found in that mineshaft, RaTG13 was about to become one of the most hotly contested scientific subjects of our time.\nThere have been many well-documented cases of viruses leaking from labs. The first Sars virus, for example, leaked twice from the National Institute of Virology in Beijing in 2004, long after the outbreak had been brought under control.\nThe practice of genetically manipulating viruses is also not new, allowing scientists to make them more infectious or more deadly, so they can assess the threat and, perhaps, develop treatments or vaccines.\nAnd from the moment it was isolated and sequenced, scientists have been struck by the remarkable ability of Sars-Cov-2 to infect humans.\nThe possibility that it acquired that ability as a result of manipulation in a laboratory was taken seriously enough for an influential group of international scientists to address it head on.\nIn what has become the definitive paper ruling out the possibility of a lab leak, RaTG13 has a starring role.\nPublished in March in the magazine Nature Medicine, it suggests that if there had been a leak, Prof Shi Zhengli would have found a much closer match in her database than RaTG13.\nWhile RaTG13 is the closest known relative - at 96.2% similarity - it is still too distant to have been manipulated and changed into Sars-Cov-2.\nSars-Cov-2, the authors concluded, was likely to have gained its unique efficiency through a long, undetected period of circulation in humans or animals of a natural and milder precursor virus that eventually evolved into the potent, deadly form first detected in Wuhan in 2019.\nWhere though, some scientists are beginning to wonder, are those reservoirs of earlier natural infection?\nDr Daniel Lucey is a physician and infectious disease professor at the Georgetown Medical Centre in Washington DC and a veteran of many pandemics - Sars in China, Ebola in Africa, Zika in Brazil.\nHe is certain that China has already conducted thorough searches for evidence of precursor viruses in stored human samples in hospitals and in animal populations.\n\"They have the capability, they have the resources and they have the motivation, so of course they've done the studies in animals and in humans,\" he said.\nFinding the origin of an outbreak was vital, he said, not just for wider scientific understanding, but also to stop it emerging again.\n\"We should search until we find it. I think it's findable and I think it's quite possible it's already been found,\" he said.  \"But then the question arises, why hasn't it been disclosed?\"\nDr Lucey still believes that Sars-Cov-2 is most likely to have a natural origin, but he does not want the alternatives to be so readily ruled out.\n\"So here we are, 12, 13 months out since the first recognised case of Covid-19 and we haven't found the animal source,\" he said. \"So, to me, it's all the more reason to investigate alternative explanations.\"\nMight a Chinese laboratory have had a virus they were working on that was genetically closer to Sars-Cov-2, and would they tell us now if they did? \"Not everything that's done is published,\" Dr Lucey said.\nIt's a point I put to Peter Daszak, the member of the WHO origins study team.\n\"You know, I've worked with the WIV for a good decade or more,\" he said. \"I know some of the people there pretty well and I have visited the labs frequently, I've met and had dinner with them over 15 years.\n\"I'm working in China with eyes wide open, and I'm racking my brain back in time for the slightest hint of something untoward. And I've never seen that.\"\nAsked if those friendships and funding relationships with the WIV presented a conflict of interest with his role on the inquiry, he said: \"We file our papers; it's all there for everyone to see.\" \nAnd his collaboration with the WIV, he said, \"makes me one of the people on the planet who knows the most about the origins of these bat coronaviruses in China\".\nChina may have provided only limited data about its hunt for the origin of Sars-Cov-2, but it has begun to promote a theory of its own.\nBased on a few inconclusive studies conducted by scientists in Europe that suggest Covid-19 may have been circulating earlier than previously thought, state propaganda is full of stories suggesting the virus didn't start in China at all.\nIn the absence of proper data, speculation is only likely to grow, much of it focused on RaTG13 and its origins in a Tongguan mineshaft. Old academic papers have been dug up online that appear to differ from the WIV's statements about the sick mine workers - among them a thesis by a student at the Kunming Hospital University.\n\"I've just downloaded the Kunming Hospital University student's masters thesis and read it,\" Prof Shi told the BBC. \n\"The narrative doesn't make sense,\" she said. \"The conclusion is neither based on evidence nor logic. But it's used by conspiracy theorists to doubt me. If you were me, what you would do?\"\nProf Shi has also faced questions about why the WIV's online public database of viruses was suddenly taken offline. \nShe told the BBC that the WIV's website and the staff's work emails and personal emails had been attacked, and the database taken offline for security reasons.\n\"All our research results are published in English journals in the form of papers,\" she said.  \"Virus sequences are saved in the [US-run] GenBank database too. It's completely transparent. We have nothing to hide.\"\nThere are important questions to be asked in the Yunnan countryside, not just by scientists, but by journalists too.\nAfter a decade of sampling and experimenting on viruses collected from bats, we now know that back in 2013 the closest known ancestor was discovered of a future threat that would claim well over a million lives and devastate the global economy.\nYet the WIV, according to the published information, did nothing with it, except sequence it and enter it into a database.\nOught that to call into question the very premise on which the expensive, and some would say risky, mass sampling of wild viruses is based?\n\"To say that we didn't do enough is absolutely correct,\" Peter Daszak told the BBC. \"To say that we failed is not fair at all. What we should have been doing is 10 times the amount of work on these viruses.\"\nBoth Dr Daszak and Prof Shi are adamant that pandemic prevention research is vital, urgent work.\n\"Our research is forward-looking, and it's difficult for non-professionals to understand,\" Prof Shi wrote by email. \"In the face of countless micro-organisms that exist in nature, we humans are very small.\"\nThe WHO is promising an \"open-minded\" inquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus, but the Chinese government is not keen on questions, at least not from journalists.\nAfter leaving Tongguan, the BBC team tried to drive a few hours north to the cave where Prof Shi carried out her ground-breaking research on Sars almost a decade ago.\nStill being followed by several unmarked cars, we hit another roadblock, and were told there was no way through.\nA few hours later, we discovered that local traffic had been diverted onto a dirt track that skirted the obstruction, but as we attempted to use the same route, we met yet another \"broken down\" car in our path.\nWe were trapped in a field for over an hour, before finally being forced to head for the airport."

      "text": "The first coronavirus vaccine 'smart patch' is being developed at a Welsh university, researchers say.\nThe disposable device uses micro-needles to both administer the vaccine and monitor its efficacy by measuring the body's immune response.\nA prototype will be developed by the end of March in the hope it can be put forward for clinical trials.\nSwansea University researchers aim to make the device commercially available within three years.\nThe project received Welsh Government and European funding as part of the global response to the pandemic, though it it hoped it can be used to treat other infectious diseases.\nThe smart patches' millimetre-long micro-needles, made from polycarbonate or silicon, will penetrate the skin to administer a vaccine and held in place with a strap or tape for up to 24 hours.\nIt will simultaneously measure a patient's inflammatory response to the vaccination by monitoring biomarkers in the skin.\nThe device is then scanned, providing a data reading that can be used to understand the efficacy of the vaccine and the body's response to it.\nDr Sanjiv Sharma, a senior lecturer in medical engineering at Swansea University, said the body's production of immunoglobulins are \"good markers\" of showing the efficacy of vaccination.\nImmunoglobulins are antibodies which form a critical part of our immune defences.\nDr Sharma said: \"What we expect in response to the self-administration of this vaccine patch is to see the production of immunoglobulins, which the device will be able to detect.\n\"This low-cost vaccine administration device will ensure a safe return to work and management of subsequent Covid-19 outbreaks. \n\"Beyond the pandemic, the scope of this work could be expanded to apply to other infectious diseases as the nature of the platform allows for quick adaption to different infectious diseases.\"\nHe said there are no other devices commercially available which provide this function, though are similar to \"continuous glucose monitoring sensors\" used by people with diabetes.\nBenefit to those 'scared of needles'\nPhD student, Olivia Howells, said the device could benefit people who are scared of needles and injections.\n\"They do not penetrate as deeply into the skin and they do not stimulate the pain receptors, so they're less painful than a hypodermic needle,\" she said.\nMs Howells said the patches are a cheaper alternative to hypodermic needles, which could also help countries \"which don't have huge resources for vaccine rollout\".\nThe team at the university's IMPACT research centre hope to carry out human clinical studies on the transdermal delivery of the vaccine in partnership with Imperial College London."

      "tags": "Wrexham,Rhyl,Cardiff,NHS Wales,Intensive care,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of patients in Welsh hospitals with Covid-19 could reach twice the number seen in April, if current trends continue.\nNHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall said there are already almost 2,800 Covid-related patients, taking up more than a third of all hospital beds.\nHis warning comes amid rapid increases in cases in north Wales.\nThe number of critical care patients in one north Wales hospital has doubled since Christmas Eve.\nSpeaking at a press conference, NHS Wales chief executive Dr Goodall said the number of Covid-related patients in hospital was 4% higher than last week and is the highest on record.\n\"If this trend continues, very soon the number of coronavirus related patients in hospital will be twice the peak we saw during the first wave in April,\" he said.\nTwo health boards are close to 50% of their beds occupied by Covid-related patients.\nDr Goodall said he was \"genuinely concerned\" about the resilience of the health service. \n\"We are not able to deliver a complete range of NHS services with such high rates of coronavirus in our communities or hospitals,\" he said.\nAn intensive care consultant at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, said the Welsh NHS could be facing its \"hardest month\" since it was established in 1948.\nDr Matt Morgan said: \"January will be the hardest month in the pandemic so far and possibly the hardest month in the 73 years since Aneurin Bevan started the NHS\". \n\"That's not just about ICU\u2026 it's for the whole hospital system.\"\nMore patients are in critical care across Wales than during the peak of the first wave in April.\nDr Richard Pugh, of Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighsire, said fatality rates were rising, with 40% of Covid patients needing intensive care not surviving.\nHe told Radio Wales Breakfast: \"Our unit is essentially full and the number of patients in north Wales has doubled since Christmas Eve.\"\nDr Pugh, who is also head of the Welsh Intensive Care Society, said patients were arriving in critical care sicker than at any other time in the pandemic.\n\"Wales was not in a robust position going in to coronavirus. We are already maxed out in terms of our capacity and the cases keep coming.\"\nIn Glan Clwyd, half the patients in critical care are there because of Covid, he said, and they included previously healthy younger people.\n\"I've looked after patients in their thirties who've previously been fit and well,\" the specialist said.\n\"And people in their 40s and 50s who've unfortunately succumbed to coronavirus.\"\nAcross the six north Wales counties, only Gwynedd has seen a decrease in infection rates over the last seven days, and is the only north Wales county under 100 cases for 100,000 population.\nBut Dr Pugh added: \"I have concerns that in north-west Wales, it won't be long before we're seeing a rise again unfortunately.\"\nSpeaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Wales' Chief Medical Officer Dr Atherton said the situation in parts of north Wales was very serious. \n\"There are signs cases are rising in many parts of the country,\" he said.\n\"In north Wales, in particular, we are seeing quite rapid increases in Wrexham, Flintshire and Denbighshire.\"\nHe said this was a result of the new variant strain of the virus and \"too much population mixing\". \nDr Atherton said around 70% of Covid-19 cases in north Wales are related to the fast-spreading variant of the virus - he said the region was a \"hotspot\" for the variant.\nThere were 140 people being treated on invasive ventilated beds, including in critical care, for confirmed or suspected coronavirus on Tuesday.\nThis is the highest number since 20 April, just after the peak, which saw 164 patients in critical care with Covid.\nCardiff and Vale had 34 patients in critical care or on invasive ventilation. These are the highest numbers it has seen since mid-April\nThere were 29 in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, 25 critical patients in Swansea Bay, 20 in Betsi Cadwaladr hospitals - the highest since mid-May, 19 in Aneurin Bevan - where there were no vacant critical care beds - and 13 in the Hywel Dda area.\nThe number of recovering patients in hospital - those too sick to go home due to the effects of Covid - is at a record of nearly 1,000 patients. A third of these are in Cwm Taf Morgannwg.\nThere were also 55 new cases of Covid linked to hospital infection within the health board in the week up to 3 January, according to Public Health Wales.\nDr Pugh believed it was too early to tell what the impact of mixing at Christmas might be but was \"grateful\" the Welsh Government had reduced the relaxation in mixing rules from five days to one.\nHe highlighted the strain the pandemic was having on staff.\n\"People are putting on a brave face. It's been a difficult time and people are very tired and exhausted,\" he said.\n\"I often catch colleagues who are close to the edge at work and the end isn't quite in sight yet.\""

      "tags": "UK economy,Car industry",
      "text": "New car registrations fell to their lowest level in nearly three decades last year, according to preliminary figures from the industry's trade body. \nIt was also the biggest one-year fall since World War Two, when factories were being turned over to military production, the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.\nAbout 1.63 million new cars were registered in 2020, compared with 2.3 million in 2019 - a decline of 29%.\nIt was the lowest total since 1992.\nThe bulk of the lost sales occurred during the first lockdown in the Spring, when showrooms were forced to close, and factories shut down.\n\"We lost half a million units from March, April, May - and we never recovered them,\" said the SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes.\nThe restrictions introduced later in the year were less damaging, largely because dealers were able to sell cars remotely, using 'click and collect' services.\nThat remains the case during the new lockdown, announced on Monday. \n\"We can still do click and collect, which is important, because that's the very minimum we need,\" said Mr Hawes. \"Not just to keep retail going, but also to keep manufacturing going.\"\nOverall, the SMMT said the Covid crisis has cost the car industry some \u00a320bn - and cost the exchequer nearly \u00a32bn in lost VAT.\nThere are also serious questions about the extent to which the car market can recover this year. Previous forecasts, which had suggested new registrations could rise to about 2 million in 2021, have been thrown into doubt by the latest restrictions.\nBut while the market as a whole has suffered over the past year, sales of electric cars have risen dramatically, increasing their share of the market from 1.5% to 6.5%. Sales of plug-in hybrids also rose sharply.\n\"If we see this continued level of uptake in electric vehicles, then we anticipate that sales of new EVs and plug-in hybrids will overtake diesel cars in 2021,\" said Ian Plummer, commercial director of motoring website Auto Trader. \"Then, pure EVs will overtake those of their internal combustion engine counterparts in 2026.\"\nWith the pandemic continuing to inflict serious damage on the industry, Mr Hawes says the trade deal between the UK and the EU came as a \"massive relief\".\nIt confirmed that cars and car parts could continue to move between the two regions, without tariffs - or taxes - being imposed, provided certain conditions are met.\nThe SMMT had previously warned that failing to reach a deal could have cost the industry \u00a355bn over five years - and add \u00a32,000 to the cost of each vehicle\nBut manufacturers still face potentially significant additional costs due to so-called non-tariff barriers - including border formalities, and the need to obtain extra regulatory approvals for new designs.\n\"This is not a free deal\", said Mr Hawes.\nAnother consequence of the trade deal is that the UK will need to focus on battery production, if it is to maintain its car industry while phasing out petrol and diesel engines.\nThat's because in order to qualify for tariff-free access to the European market, the value of car components made outside the UK and the EU will have to be strictly limited.\nSpecific rules relating to batteries effectively mean that from 2027, they themselves will have to be made in the EU or the UK.\nThe SMMT believes that, based on current investment plans, UK battery factories will have a capacity of 15 gigawatt-hours (GWh) by 2024.\nThat is more than seven times the current level, and would be enough to produce 250,000 electric cars per year.\nBut the SMMT insists much more is needed: 60GWh in order to produce 1 million cars per year by 2030, and 120GWh to produce 2mby 2040.\nThat, says Mr Hawes, will require \"massive investment\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The end of England's lockdown will not happen with a \"big bang\" but will instead be a \"gradual unwrapping\", Boris Johnson has told MPs.\nThe prime minister made the comments in the Commons ahead of a retrospective vote later on the lockdown measures.\nHe said the legislation runs until 31 March to allow a \"controlled\" easing of restrictions back into local tiers. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's decisions \"have led us to the position we're now in\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said there were now 30,074 patients with coronavirus in UK hospitals.\nAll of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown.\nIt came as the UK reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus, the highest daily death toll since April.\nIn a statement to the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new variant had \"led to more cases than we've seen ever before\" and that this had left the government with \"no choice but to return to national lockdown\". \nHe said the legislation ran until the end of March \"not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis\".\nHe said this would happen \"brick-by-brick... without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us\".\nBut in response to MPs' questions, he said there was a \"cautious presumption\" that restrictions could start being eased from mid-February. \n\"And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping,\" he added.\nUnder the measures, which came into force legally on Wednesday, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, for exercise outdoors only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close.\nPolice have the powers to enforce the new restrictions with a \u00a3200 fine for each breach, doubling on every offence up to a maximum of \u00a36,400 - and a \u00a310,000 penalty for mass gatherings.\nOfficers in London arrested at least a dozen people in Parliament Square after a protest against the new measures on Wednesday.\nThe need to debate and vote on the restrictions means the Commons has been recalled from its Christmas break for the second time - the first being for the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. \nWith Sir Keir saying Labour will support the motion, the measures are expected to pass with ease.\nThe restrictions will be kept under \"continuous review\", Mr Johnson added, with a statutory requirement to reconsider them every two weeks.\nAddressing the closure of schools, the PM said \"we did everything in our power to keep them open as long as possible\" and that was why schools were the \"very last thing to close\".\nThey would be the \"very first thing to reopen\" after lockdown - that could be after the February half term - but \"we must be very cautious\" about the timetable, he said.\nMeanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons that GCSEs, A-level and AS-level exams would be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades. \n\"This year, we're going to put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms,\" he said, referencing controversy over the way exam grades were awarded to some students last year.\nAll national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are now cancelled, Mr Williamson confirmed.\nHe said every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week.\nThe prime minister wasted no time in emphasising the \"fundamental difference\" between this and previous lockdowns.\nTo keep opposition from his own MPs at bay he needs to demonstrate that the government's aim to vaccinate the most at-risk groups by mid-February is viable.\nHe is also under pressure to give a sense of how quickly restrictions might be lifted after that.\nThe course of the pandemic has changed swiftly at times, though, and may do so again, so it's unlikely we'll get any firm new timelines from Boris Johnson today.\nMost Conservative backbenchers seem resigned to the need for this new national lockdown and agree the prime minister had \"no choice\" but to act.\nBut MPs on all sides are impatient to hear how soon things may start returning to something like life as normal at last.\nMr Johnson said unlike in March last year, during the first lockdown, vaccines offered \"the means of our escape\". \nBut he said there was now a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. \n\"After the marathon of last year, we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them,\" Mr Johnson said. \n\"Every needle in every arm makes a difference.\"\nEarlier, Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said he was \"confident\" the government would meet its \"ambitious\" target, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that new daily vaccination figures for the UK - which will be released for the first time on Monday - will show there has been a \"significant increase\" in the number of people who have received the jab.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK had been vaccinated so far.\nMr Zahawi also said nursery schools presented \"very little risk\", are Covid-safe and he defended the decision to keep them open during England's lockdown.\nResponding to the prime minister's statement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party will support the new restrictions and urged people to comply with them.\n\"The virus is out of control, over a million people in England now have Covid, the number of hospital admissions is rising, tragically so are the numbers of people dying,\" he said.\n\"It's only the early days of January and the NHS is under huge strain. In those circumstances, tougher restrictions are necessary.\"\nBut he added \"this is not just bad luck, it's not inevitable, it follows a pattern\" of the government being slow to respond.\n\"These are the decisions that have led us to the position we're now in - and the vaccine is now the only way out and we must all support the national effort to get it rolled out as quickly as possible.\"\nHow have you been affected by Covid?

      "tags": "UK TV licence fee,BBC",
      "text": "Former Goldman Sachs banker Richard Sharp is set to be named the BBC's next chairman, the corporation's media editor Amol Rajan says.\nMr Sharp spent 23 years working for the banking giant and was reportedly Chancellor Rishi Sunak's boss there.\nHe has recently been acting as an unpaid economic adviser to Mr Sunak during the coronavirus pandemic.\nHis new role will see him lead negotiations with the government over the future of the licence fee.\nThe licence fee is due to stay in place until at least 2027, when the BBC's Royal Charter ends, with a debate about how the broadcaster should be funded after that.\nThe government is currently reviewing whether its cost, currently \u00a3157.50, should continue rising with inflation from 2022, and whether non-payment should remain a criminal offence.\nMr Sharp's career at Goldman Sachs culminated as chairman of its principal investment business in Europe before his departure in 2007. He was then on the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee for six years until 2019.\nAs an advisor to the Treasury about its pandemic response, the 63-year-old reportedly played a key role in the \u00a31.57bn arts rescue package, and the film and television production restart scheme.\nMr Sharp is a former donor to the Conservative party.\nHe was chairman of the Royal Academy of Arts from 2007 to 2012, and founded the charity London Music Masters.\nSir David Clementi, the current BBC chairman, steps down in February. The post-holder is officially appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the government.  \nJulian Knight, the chair of the DCMS Committee, said in a statement: \"It is disappointing to see this news about the next BBC chairman has leaked out ahead of a formal announcement from the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The Committee previously expressed some concerns over the appointments process, calling for it to be fair and transparent.  \n\"The DCMS Committee looks forward to questioning the preferred candidate for the post in a pre-appointment hearing next week on their views at a critical time for the BBC about its role and the future of public service broadcasting more generally.\"\nHis views on the BBC itself are unknown. But like new director general Tim Davie, who he met a few weeks before Christmas, he has a commercial background. Just as the relationship between Lord Hall, Davie's predecessor, and Sir David was strong, so the bond between the new DG and chair will be critical. \nWhether Sharp supports the licence fee as the pillar of a future BBC settlement is unclear. \nThe last time the BBC's future was negotiated with a sceptical Conservative government, the relationship between the director general and the chancellor - then George Osborne - was critical, as Lord Hall explained to me in his exit interview.\nThis time, Davie will go into that negotiation with a very close ally of the current chancellor - though Sharp's first duty is to support Davie, and the BBC, and not his old mentee."

      "text": "Scotland will follow England's example and lift its working from home guidance. \nPeople across the rest of the UK are still advised to work remotely wherever possible. \nFrom Monday 31 January, the government will no longer recommend home working wherever possible.\nInstead, employers are being asked to let workers return gradually. It wants workers to spend some time in the office and some time at home. \nA wholesale \"mass return\" to offices next week could risk pushing up infection levels, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on 19 January, Boris Johnson said that the government was no longer asking staff to work from home.\nHe said people \"should now speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office\". \nThe government had reintroduced its guidance to work remotely when it tightened Covid regulations on 8 December to help tackle the spread of Omicron. \nHowever, that guidance did also say that people should continue travelling to work if they needed \"to access equipment necessary for their role, or where their role must be completed in person\".  \nEmployers were also told to consider letting people come to work if they had a \"challenging home working environment\".\nIn Northern Ireland, ministers said that more people working from home would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they didn't tell employers to impose home working, but instead asked them to support it \"where possible\".\nIn Wales, employers are also encouraged to let people work from home where possible. Guidance says staff should not be \"required or placed under pressure to return\" to the workplace unless there's a clear business need. Employers could be fined up to \u00a310,000 for failing to allow staff to work from home where it is \"reasonably practicable to do so\".\nFrom 28 January, the requirement to work from home moves from law to guidance. \nLatest figures suggest that 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home in 2020, up from 27% the previous year.\nIn the last week of November 2021, seven in 10 travelled to work at least once. \nIn the same week, one in seven said they had been working at home and travelling to work.\nAlthough social distancing limits no longer apply across most UK workplaces businesses still have a legal duty to manage the risks to staff and customers. \nEmployers must follow official safety guidance and carry out Covid risk assessments for those staff who are in the office. \nSafety measures can include:\nFace-coverings remain mandatory for staff and customers in shops and on public transport across the UK, apart from England, where they will cease to be required in any public space on 27 January. \nRegular lateral flow testing remains widespread across the NHS and other parts of the public and private sector.\nNorthern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have already introduced Covid passport schemes which are partly designed to protect staff who work in hospitality and events. \nHowever, England will scrap its mandatory Covid certification scheme from Thursday 27 January, although venues will be able to keep checking customers' status on a voluntary basis if they wish. \nThere is more detailed advice for some industries - including construction, hospitality and manufacturing, plus specific advice for employers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIf employees feel unsafe, they can raise concerns with their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). \nWorking from home is one of the most effective ways to reduce social exposure, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nIt greatly limits face-to-face contact both with colleagues and on public transport.\nAs such, Sage says it has a \"strong impact\" against virus transmission and the R number, which represents a disease's ability to spread.\nMuch of the risk depends on how crowded it is and your distance from other people.\nWearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible."

      "tags": "NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Doctors,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Doctors in Scotland have raised concerns about plans to delay the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. \nAll four UK nations will now leave up to 12 weeks between the first and second doses of the jab rather than giving both within 21 days. \nDr Lewis Morrison, head of the BMA in Scotland, said members had concerns about the potential impact of leaving such a big gap between the two doses. \nBut the UK's chief medical officers have defended the move.\nThey said that the first dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines - the only two so far approved for use in the UK - will give people substantial protection against the virus within two to three weeks of being administered.\nAnd they said that the second dose was \"likely to be very important for duration of protection, and at an appropriate dose interval may further increase vaccine efficacy\".\nThe Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments and recommended the new strategy, said data showed that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine would be \"90% effective\".\nBut the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it would not recommend following the UK's decision to delay giving the second Pfizer dose, saying there was no evidence to support the decision. \nPfizer has said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart.\nThe Pfizer vaccine was the first to be approved for use in the UK, with more than a million people having already been given the first dose.\nThe change to the vaccination strategy has meant health boards have had to change plans and cancel people booked in for their second doses of the Pfizer jabs.\nThis includes medics who are among the priority groups for Covid vaccinations. \nDr Morrison told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that some doctors had told him they would have waited for the AstraZeneca jab, which has been proven to work in the longer timetable, if they had known the second Pfizer dose was going to be delayed. \nHe said: \"We are concerned because there's clearly disagreement about the effectiveness of the second dose of Pfizer after that period of time.\n\"Furthermore I think if you give more people the first dose when you don't know what vaccine supplies are going to be within that 12-week window, that's a worry that has been expressed to me by a lot of doctors.\n\"If we give more people the first dose, do we definitely know that the second one is coming?\n\"The announcement about this before a four-day NHS holiday weekend left many places with great difficulty in reorganising vaccinations, with a real risk that vaccination numbers might perversely drop because of the organisational issues.\"\nIt comes as NHS staff were left queueing for hours outside Glasgow Royal Infirmary on Tuesday after an \"scheduling error\" meant vaccination staff did not turn up.  \nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has apologised to those affected and said it was rearranging the appointments.\nThe Scottish government has said it aims to have given at least one vaccine dose to everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the timetable could be accelerated if there were sufficient supplies of the jab. \nThe Scottish government is being pressured to provide daily figures on the number of people being vaccinated, as the UK government has already pledged to do.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"There are now no excuses left for the SNP government to dodge publishing daily vaccination rates alongside the daily infection numbers as soon as possible.\n\"The SNP's evasion to try and avoid scrutiny is nothing new but on something so important, the Scottish public must have the same information as will be provided across the UK.\"\nHis call was echoed by Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon, who added: \"It is simply unacceptable that scores of NHS staff were left queueing outside in the cold for hours, and well into the evening.\n\"It's time for Health Secretary Jeane Freeman to get to grips with the vaccination programme, publish daily figures on the number of vaccinations available and administered, and ensure that our NHS staff do not pay the price of a bungled rollout.\""

Three officers returned fire with 32 shots, six of which hit Ms Taylor.\nMs Taylor's name became a global rallying cry as people demanded a thorough investigation into her death.\nBlack Lives Matter activists in the US have demanded that Louisville police take stronger action against the officers in the case and say that police too often escape unpunished after killing members of the public.\nBut despite the outcry against Ms Taylor's shooting, no criminal charges were sought relating to her death."

      "tags": "Cookery",
      "text": "Chef and restaurateur Albert Roux, who brought great French cooking to the UK with his brother Michel, has died at the age of 85.\nThe pair made gastronomic history in 1982 when their London restaurant, Le Gavroche, became the first in Britain to earn three Michelin stars.\nAlbert's death comes almost a year after Michel died at the age of 78.\nGordon Ramsay, one of many leading chefs who earned their stripes in Le Gavroche's kitchen, led the tributes.\n\"So so sad the hear about the passing of this legend, the man who installed Gastronomy in Britain,\" Ramsay wrote on Instagram.\nMarco Pierre White, Marcus Wareing, Pierre Koffman and Monica Galetti are among the other chefs who rose through the ranks at Le Gavroche.\nIn his tribute, TV chef James Martin described Albert Roux as \"a true titan of the food scene in this country [who] inspired and trained some of the best and biggest names in the business\".\nA family statement said: \"The Roux family has announced the sad passing of Albert Roux, OBE, KFO, who had been unwell for a while, at the age 85 on 4th January 2021.\n\"Albert is credited, along with his late brother Michel Roux, with starting London's culinary revolution with the opening of Le Gavroche in 1967.\"\nHis son Michel Roux Jr, who now runs Le Gavroche and is a former judge on MasterChef: The Professionals, said: \"He was a mentor for so many people in the hospitality industry, and a real inspiration to budding chefs, including me.\"\nFood critic Jay Rayner described Albert Roux as \"an extraordinary man who left a massive mark on the food story of his adopted country\".\nHe added: \"The roll call of chefs who went through the kitchens of Le Gavroche alone, is a significant slab of a part of modern UK restaurant culture.\"\nChef Tom Kitchin wrote that \"one of the true culinary greats has left us\", and baker and food writer Dan Lepard said it was the \"end of an era\".\nAlbert and Michel Roux came from a family of butchers in eastern France, and trained to be patissiers before moving to the UK.\nAlbert arrived in the mid-1950s, and in 1967 put his \u00a33,000 savings with money borrowed from friends to open the first Gavroche off Sloane Square in Chelsea.\nWith uncompromising standards, elaborate presentation and first-rate service, it raised the standards of haute cuisine in a then-limited English restaurant scene.\nIt moved to Mayfair in 1981, and soon became the first British-based establishment to carry the maximum three Michelin stars.\n\"An Olympic gold medal,\" Albert said at the time. \"I have had no other ambition.\"\nIts kitchen would also become the training ground for a new, enlightened generation of British chefs.\n\"If cooking is an art form, Le Gavroche was the Royal College of Music, Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design, Rada and the Courtauld and Warburg institutes all rolled up into one, poached, wrapped in a puff pastry shell with foie gras and served with truffle sauce,\" The Guardian wrote in 2010.\nThe brothers also launched the Roux Scholarship, an annual chef competition, in 1983, with many scholars having gone on to win Michelin stars themselves.\nAlbert and Michel opened a string of other restaurants, fronted a 13-part TV series on BBC Two in 1990, and published a series of best-selling books about French cookery."

      "tags": "Kamala Harris,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The inauguration of a new president is a day that usually follows decades of custom and precedent. A day that follows a routine set in stone. Well, you can forget all that this year.\nJoe Biden and Kamala Harris will still take the oath, of course, to make them officially US president and vice-president, but this will be a much scaled back affair, due to Covid and the recent riots.\nHere's everything you need to know about the big day. \nThe inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the start of a new presidency, and it takes place in Washington DC. \nThe only required feature is that the president-elect recite the presidential oath of office.\n\"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" \nOnce he utters these words, Mr Biden will then take his place as the 46th president and the inauguration will be complete (but that's not all - celebrations follow). \nKamala Harris will become vice-president once she takes the oath of office, which usually happens just before the president.\nOpening remarks are usually scheduled for around 11:30 EST (16:30 GMT) and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in around midday. By law, inauguration day is always 20 January.\nMr Biden will move into the White House later in the day - his home for the next four years. \nPresidential inaugurations typically involve detailed security plans, but even more so now, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol on 6 January. \nOfficials have ramped up security and closed off large sections of the city. The Secret Service has taken command of the security plans, backed up by some 25,000 National Guard troops, in addition to thousands of police officers. \nWashington DC is already under a state of emergency and will remain that way through inauguration. \nAgent Matt Miller, who is leading the security effort on behalf of the Secret Service, told reporters on Friday that planning for the event has been going on for over a year.\nAnd while Mr Biden has insisted on taking the oath of office outside, as is tradition, attendance to the event will be scaled back. \nIt's become customary for the outgoing president to watch the next in line being sworn in, which can sometimes make things awkward. This year, it will be a different type of awkward - the outgoing president will be a no-show. \n\"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,\" Mr Trump tweeted on 8 January. He is widely expected to be travelling to his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago.\nSome of his supporters say they are planning a virtual \"second inauguration\" for Mr Trump on the same day (and time) that Mr Biden takes office. More than 68,000 people said on Facebook they would attend an online event to show their support for Mr Trump.  Facebook said it removed this event the week before the inauguration, because it violated its policies.\nWhen Mr Trump was sworn in, Hillary Clinton joined her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at the inauguration - just two months after her election defeat and a bitter campaign against Mr Trump. \nOnly three presidents - John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Johnson - have actively chosen to sit out their successor's inaugurations, and none in the last century.\nVice-President Mike Pence, however, has said that he will attend. \nIn normal circumstances, Washington DC would see hundreds of thousands of people flock to the city, swarming the National Mall and selling out hotels - an estimated two million came when President Obama was sworn in for his first term in 2009. \nBut this year, the celebration's size will be \"extremely limited\", the Biden team has said, and it has urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital, a call that has been repeated by DC authorities following the storming of Congress.  Viewing stands that had been constructed along the parade route have been taken down. \nOne tradition that will be preserved is that Mr Biden and Ms Harris will still take their oaths in front of the US Capitol, overlooking the Mall (a tradition that started with President Ronald Reagan in 1981). About 200 people will sit, socially distanced, on the stage with them, the Washington Post reports.\nThere will be masks and everybody on the platform will have to be tested within a couple of days of the event itself, it added. As for the moment of the swearing in itself, Mr Biden said back in June that he would not wear one to take the presidential oath.\nIn the past, up to 200,000 tickets were up for grabs to attend the official ceremony, but with infections still surging across the US, only around 1,000 tickets will be available. \nThis year, there will still be a \"pass in review\" ceremony - a traditional part of the peaceful transfer of power, where the new commander in chief inspects the troops, but instead of the usual parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, organisers say they will host a \"virtual parade\" across the US.\nMr Biden, Ms Harris and their spouses will then be escorted to the White House by members of the military, including a band and drum corps. \nTickets are required for seated and standing areas near the stage and seats along the parade route in normal years, and traditionally, the rest of the National Mall remained open to the public. \nSo if you want to watch the inaugural ceremonies from up close, you'll need to talk to your local representatives first. \nInaugural balls and other related events around the city require separate tickets.\nSenators and members of Congress are the keepers of the keys. Each has an allotted number of free tickets that they can distribute. \nThis year's pandemic-restricted number amounts to each lawmaker plus a guest. Commemorative tickets will be available for constituents after inauguration day. \nIn recent years, incoming presidents have added some of the country's most beloved performers to the day's programme. Despite the pandemic, this year won't be any different. \nMr Biden and Ms Harris will be joined by Lady Gaga - an active supporter of the incoming president - who will sing the national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez will sing during the ceremony's musical performance. \nAfter Mr Biden is sworn in, actor Tom Hanks will host 90-minutes of primetime television - a Covid-friendly replacement of celebrations typically held in-person.\nIt will feature Garth Brooks, Jon Bon Jovi, Demi Lovato and Justin Timberlake and will be broadcast across all major US networks and streaming platforms - with the exception of Fox News, a conservative network that has primarily supported Mr Trump during his presidency. \nIn 2009, Aretha Franklin sang at Barack Obama's inauguration, performing My Country 'Tis of Thee. Beyonc\u00e9 was also present, singing At Last to the first couple at Mr Obama's inaugural ball. \nAt his second inauguration in 2013, President Obama called on Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson to do the honours. Beyonc\u00e9 was back again, this time to sing the national anthem. \nDonald Trump reportedly had more trouble booking performers. Elton John declined Mr Trump's offer to perform, and reports circulated that Celine Dion, Kiss and Garth Brooks did the same. In the end, the Rockettes, country artist Lee Greenwood, and the band 3 Doors Down turned out for Mr Trump's day. "

      "text": "Greggs expects up to a \u00a315m loss for the year, which would be its first annual loss since it listed its shares on the stock exchange in 1984.\nThe bakery chain said it does not expect profits to return to pre-Covid levels until 2022 at the earliest.\nIt has been battling a sales slump due to the coronavirus pandemic, but sales declines have been lessening.\nGreggs made 820 job cuts at the end of last year, after its sales were hit by coronavirus lockdowns and restrictions.\nChief executive Roger Whiteside said the impact of the Covid-19 crisis had been \"enormous\" and that a fresh lockdown meant \"significant uncertainties remain in the near term\".\nCoronavirus restrictions towards the end of last year led to \"variable trading conditions across the UK\", he said.\nSales in the final three months of the year fell by nearly a fifth, but this decline was less than its sales slump in the third quarter.\nIn September, Greggs, which is based in Newcastle, said it was in talks with staff to cut hours in an effort to minimise job losses.\nBut it still decided to cut 820 jobs because of \"lockdown levels of business\" as High Streets were hit by the crisis.\n\"Looking ahead, the significant uncertainty over the duration of social restrictions, along with the impact of higher unemployment levels, makes it difficult to predict performance,\" the firm said.\n\"However, we do not expect that profits will return to pre-Covid levels until 2022 at the earliest.\"\nGreggs said on Wednesday that total sales for the year were down nearly a third to \u00a3811m, but government support had helped to limit pre-tax losses.\nIt said it had developed its takeaway business and a delivery tie-up with Just Eat, and had also seen \"strong sales\" through its partnership with retailer Iceland.\n\"We have taken action to position Greggs to withstand further short-term shocks and are optimistic about our prospects for growth once social restrictions are lifted,\" Mr Whiteside added.\nGreggs wants to open about 100 new stores, on a net basis, over the year ahead.\nJulie Palmer, a partner at insolvency consultants Begbies Traynor, said: \"The latest national lockdown will be unwelcome news for Greggs, which has operated shrewdly during the past year in spite of a lack of footfall, with non-essential stores forced to close and millions working from home.\n\"The bakery chain has had to adapt its business model and invest digitally to accommodate for the rapid change in shopping habits, offering click-and-collect purchases, as well as a nationwide delivery service through its partnership with Just Eat.\n\"This should provide a solid base for the business to expand when government restrictions are eased and the world returns to some normality.\""

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),China,Wuhan,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A team of 10 international scientists will travel to the Chinese city of Wuhan next month to investigate the origins of Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.\nBeijing has been reluctant to agree to an independent inquiry and it has taken many months of negotiations for the WHO to be allowed access to the city.\nThe virus is thought to have come from a market in the city selling animals.\nBut the search for the source has led to tensions, notably with the US.\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has accused China of trying to conceal the initial outbreak.\nA biologist on the team travelling to Wuhan told the Associated Press news agency that the WHO was not seeking to apportion blame, but rather to prevent future outbreaks.\n\"It's really not about finding a guilty country,\" Fabian Leendertz of Germany's Robert Koch Institute said. \n\"It's about trying to understand what happened and then see if, based on those data, we can try to reduce the risk in the future.\"\nDr Leendertz said the aim was to find out when the virus began circulating and whether or not it originated in Wuhan.\nThe mission was expected to last four or five weeks, he added.\nIn the early days of the virus, it was traced to a so-called \"wet market\" in Wuhan, Hubei province, and it was suggested that this was where it made the leap from animals to humans.\nBut experts now believe it may simply have been amplified there.\nResearch suggests that coronaviruses capable of infecting humans may have been circulating undetected in bats for decades.\nLast December, a Chinese doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital - Li Wenliang - tried to warn fellow medics about a possible outbreak of a new disease, but was told by police to \"stop making false comments\" and was investigated for \"spreading rumours\".\nDr Li died in February after contracting the virus while treating patients in the city.\nIn April, suspicions and allegations emerged that the virus might have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan. \nUS State Department cables came to light suggesting that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there. \nThe office of the US national intelligence director said at the time that while the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, officials were investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident.\nRecent reports in Chinese media have suggested that Covid-19 could have started outside China.\nBut analysts say the reports are without foundation, and the campaign reflects anxiety within the leadership in Beijing about damage to the country's international reputation from the pandemic.\nAnalysis by Naomi Grimley, BBC health correspondent\nThe question of an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus has become embroiled in international geopolitics and rows about the WHO.\nThe Trump administration has always taken a hard line, arguing that the WHO has been too soft on China and citing examples of officials praising the Chinese regime for its actions such as locking down Wuhan, mass testing and its publication of the genetic code of the virus.\nHowever, lots of other countries also said there needed to be a proper inquiry - including Australia and the UK. The Associated Press revealed transcripts of video calls from WHO officials complaining back in January that they had not received the right data they needed from the Chinese authorities. A two-man WHO team that visited China this summer had difficulty negotiating access to Wuhan.\nThis trip, when it does happen, will probably concentrate on fundamental biological questions: did the virus originally come from bats? Was there an \"intermediate host\" linking bats to humans? And were Wuhan wet markets at the centre of the initial outbreak?\nChina's tackling of the developing crisis was praised in January by the head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Mike Ryan, who said the \"challenge is great but the response has been massive\". \nBeijing had helped slow the spread of the virus, the WHO said, by quickly volunteering to share its knowledge of the virus's genetic code.\nHowever, the US - among a number of other countries - raised questions about whether China was fully transparent when the virus first emerged there.\nIn March, the head of the WHO in China, Dr Gauden Galea, told the BBC there were \"shortcomings\" in tackling the outbreak in the early days, but that experts would look at how issues could be avoided in the future.\nMr Trump later attacked the WHO itself for being too \"China-centric\" in praising Beijing, saying the organisation \"really blew it\" with its early guidance during the outbreak.\nHe announced that he was pulling the US out of the body and said funding would be redirected elsewhere.\nHowever, US President-elect Joe Biden, who is due to be sworn in on 20 January, has since set up a foreign policy team tasked with keeping America in the WHO.

      "text": "Guidance for people in England identified as being \"clinically extremely vulnerable\" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing?\nFormal advice telling them to take extra care, or \"shield\", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. \nMost coronavirus restrictions are being lifted in England on 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else.\nHowever, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to \"think particularly carefully\" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including:\nThere is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAlthough Scotland moves to Covid protection level zero on 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said keeping the mandatory use of face coverings past then would give \"added protection and assurance\" to people who were particularly vulnerable.\nFrom 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace.\nHowever, companies still have legally binding health and safety responsibilities - and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. \nSome firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people.\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough) is available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. \nYou may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons.\nRead the updated government advice.\nAlthough the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it \"expects and recommends\" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport.\nYou should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. \nThe NHS Volunteer Responders programme is still available to offer support.\nData shows Covid vaccines are highly effective in most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection.\nBeing double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. \nYou should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not, book through the NHS website or call 119.\nThe most vulnerable people are likely to be offered booster jabs from September, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. \nYou are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions.\nThe pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The government recommends several support websites.\nIf you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on the NHS Shielded Patient List. \nA combination of factors can contribute to a person's risk, including: \nHigh risk categories include people: "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "England's third national lockdown has legally come into force, with MPs set to vote retrospectively on it later.\nThe measures, which include a stay-at-home order and the closure of schools to most pupils, were announced by the prime minister on Monday.\nAll of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown.\nOn Tuesday the number of new daily confirmed cases of Covid in the UK topped 60,000 for the first time.\nAnd it is thought one in 50 people in private households in England had the virus last week - rising to one in 30 in London.\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics also suggested more than one million people in England had Covid between 27 December and 2 January.\nAt a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had \"no choice\" but to impose the new lockdown, with the number of patients in hospitals 40% higher than in the first peak.\nHe would not guarantee that all children would be back in school before the summer holidays but insisted he was full of \"optimism and fundamental hope\" that things would be different in the spring.\nThe need to debate and vote on the measures means the House of Commons has been recalled from its Christmas break for the second time - the first being for the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. \nMr Johnson will update MPs, most of whom will not physically be in the chamber, on the new rules before the vote, which is due in the evening.\nThe regulations, which allow the lockdown to be in place until the end of March, are expected to pass with ease - as Labour is set to support the motion.\nUnder the measures, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, exercise outdoors will be allowed only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close.\nMeanwhile, Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said new daily vaccination figures for the UK - which will be released for the first time on Monday - will show there has been a \"significant increase\" in the number of people who have received the jab.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK had been vaccinated so far.\nThe government has set the target to immunise all over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers by mid-February - some 13 million people - which would require around two million vaccinations a week.\nMr Zahawi said he was \"confident\" the government would meet the \"ambitious\" target, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. \n\"We will make sure that community pharmacies and the independent sector are involved and that we deliver what I think is a credible plan that the NHS has put together to hit that target of 13 million vaccinations ... by mid-February,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nOn the same programme, Royal Pharmaceutical Society president Sandra Gidley accused the government of ignoring an \"army\" of small pharmacies. Thousands of high street chemists were \"ready, willing and able\" to help, she said.\nIn other developments, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is to make a Commons statement later about the cancellation of A-Level and GCSE exams in England. \nEngland's lockdown came into force legally overnight. But it's actually today that the measures will be brought before MPs. \nAny rebellion by Conservative MPs is expected to be smaller than those seen late last year on restrictions. \nHowever, some do want more of a say in the next couple of months over how long the regulations might last. \nOn Tuesday, Boris Johnson said that by mid-February - with hopes for the vaccine rollout - there is the \"prospect\" of beginning the relaxation of some measures. \nBut at the same news conference, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said we shouldn't \"kid ourselves\" that the virus will disappear with the spring - and suggested a \"few\" restrictions might have to be brought in next winter.\nElsewhere in the UK, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also announced a new lockdown on Monday - across mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha for the rest of January. Level three restrictions apply in the remaining areas of the nation.\nWales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December, and schools and colleges in the nation will remain closed until at least 18 January.\nIn Northern Ireland - which entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December - \"stay at home\" restrictions will be brought back into law from Friday.\nThe UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, urged people to take the \"stay at home\" rules seriously and warned that the country is facing a \"really serious emergency\".\nHe cited the ONS data for England as showing how widespread the virus is.\n\"We're now into a situation where across the country as a whole, roughly one in 50 people have got the virus, higher in some parts of the country, lower in others,\" he said.\nHe also said some restrictions may have to be introduced again next winter. \nProf Graham Medley, a member of Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said \"we're in for a long haul\" with coronavirus.\nHe told Today: \"Vaccination is a way out, but I think he's right to raise that possibility that there could be - next winter or even the winter after - the possibility that we will see a resurgence of Covid to such an extent that government again has to take measures to prevent another large outbreak.\"\nThat latest estimates include:\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for the government to use the lockdown to create a \"round-the-clock\" vaccination scheme in order to end \"this nightmare\".\nIn a televised address to the nation, Sir Keir also confirmed he would back the new restrictions on Wednesday.\nIn other developments: \nHow have you been affected by Covid?

      "text": "There are three main symptoms of coronavirus. \nIf you have any of them, you should get a test.\nPublic Health England says about 85% of people with Covid will have at least one of these symptoms.\nPeople infected with new variants such as Delta may be more likely to have other symptoms, such as headache, sore throat or a runny nose, according to research from the Zoe Covid Study and an ONS survey.\nIf you have any symptoms you should get tested as soon as possible and not leave home for any other reason. \nIt takes five days on average from the moment you're infected for symptoms to show.\nNo - it can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms.\nScientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types:\nResearchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps could be a sign of coronavirus in children.\nSome people who catch Covid develop chilblain-like lesions on their toes or fingers.\nIt can happen to anyone, but is more common in children and teenagers. \nFor some it's painless, but the rash can be very sore and itchy.\nIt appears to be a side effect of the body switching into attack mode to fight off the virus.\nWriting in the British Journal of Dermatology, researchers say they've pinpointed which parts of the immune system are responsible, which should lead to better treatments. \nLots of other viruses have similar symptoms to Covid, including flu. \nPublic Health England says just under half of people who have one of the three main Covid symptoms will not have it.\nIf you have a positive test result you should self-isolate at home for at least 10 days from the time symptoms started.\nMost people will only have mild symptoms, which can be managed with pain relief (like paracetamol), bed rest and fluids.\nYou should not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.\nSince 16 August, people who are double jabbed (or aged under 18) don't have to self-isolate if they're identified as a close contact of a person who tests positive.\nGetting vaccinated is the best way to prevent serious illness, hospitalisation or death from Covid. \nIf you are seriously unwell and you have a medical emergency you should call 999 - this includes feeling so breathless that you can't speak more than a few words.\nIf you're worried your symptoms are getting worse, use the NHS 111 website England, NHS Inform in Scotland or the equivalents in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe main reason people need hospital care is for difficulty breathing where they may be given oxygen.\nThe most seriously ill patients may require ventilation - where patients are sedated and air is pushed into their lungs.\nOlder people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women."

      "text": "An investment firm has bought 50% of the rights to all Neil Young's songs.\nHipgnosis Songs Fund spent an estimated $150m (\u00a3110m) on 1,180 songs written by the Canadian folk rocker.\nThe fund, which lets people invest in hit songs, has previously splashed out about \u00a31bn snapping up rights to songs from the likes of Mark Ronson, Chic, Barry Manilow and Blondie.\nFounded by music industry veteran Merck Mercuriadis, Hipgnosis turns music royalties into an income stream.\n\"This is a deal that changes Hipgnosis forever,\" said Mr Mercuriadis.\n\"I bought my first Neil Young album aged seven. Harvest was my companion and I know every note, every word, every pause and silence intimately. \n\"Neil Young, or at least his music, has been my friend and constant ever since.\"\nHipgnosis has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since July 2018. When songs owned by the fund get played on the radio or placed in a film or TV show, it makes money.\nBefore setting up Hipgnosis, Mr Mercuriadis managed artists such as Beyonc\u00e9, Elton John, Iron Maiden and Guns 'N' Roses.\nIn his view, songs are \"as investible as gold or oil\".\nHe says hit songs are a stable investment because their revenue is unaffected by fluctuations in the economy.\nThe sale of song catalogues has become a booming business during the Covid-19 pandemic, with investors seeing music as a relatively stable asset in an otherwise turbulent market.\nEarlier this week, Hipgnosis bought 100% of the rights to Lindsey Buckingham's 161 songs for an undisclosed amount.\nThe songs include hits that Buckingham wrote or co-wrote for Fleetwood Mac, including Go Your Own Way and The Chain.\nThe group's Stevie Nicks sold 80% of her publishing rights last year to Hipgnosis rival Primary Wave for about $80m.\nLast month, Universal Music Group announced it had bought 100% of Bob Dylan's 600 songs for between an estimated $200m and $450m (\u00a3150m-\u00a3340m).\nThe singer-songwriter was the latest of a number of artists to join up with the Los Angeles-based Universal, following other big names such as Bruce Springsteen, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone.\nNeil Young rose to prominence in the 1960s and 70s and is one of the most influential songwriters of all time.\nHe is known not only for his work as a solo artist, but also with the bands Buffalo Springfield, Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. \nYoung has released almost 50 studio albums and more than 20 live albums, of which 18 have been certified gold, seven are platinum and three are multi-platinum.\nSeven of his albums were included on Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time chart: Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, After The Gold Rush, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Harvest, On The Beach, Tonight's the Night and Rust Never Sleeps.\n\"I built Hipgnosis to be a company Neil would want to be a part of,\" said Mr Mercuriadis.\n\"We have a common integrity, ethos and passion born out of a belief in music and these important songs. \n\"There will never be a 'Burger of Gold', but we will work together to make sure everyone gets to hear them on Neil's terms.\""

We know that many are seeking clarity as soon as possible,\" said Simon Lebus, Ofqual's interim chief regulator."

      "text": "Violent supporters of President Donald Trump have breached the Capitol in Washington, as lawmakers met to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's poll win.\nIn dramatic scenes, demonstrators swarmed the building as Congress members were escorted out by police.\nMr Biden said it was an \"insurrection\", and Mr Trump released a video message asking supporters to go home.\nThe joint session of Congress certifying Mr Biden's win has been suspended and forced into recess.\nThere are reports of guns drawn in the building and at least one person shot. A woman was reported to be in a critical condition and several police were injured.\nThere has been an armed confrontation at the doors of the House of Representatives. Tear gas has also been used.\nRioters were seen marching through the building chanting \"We want Trump\" and one was photographed in the Senate president's chair.\nWashington police said it was clear the crowd was intent on using chemical irritants to force entry to the building.\nAfter an occupation lasting several hours, the sergeant-at-arms - the executive office of the Senate - announced that the building had been secured by law enforcement.\nBut there is little sign that the protesters are obeying Mr Trump's call to go home, despite a citywide curfew declared by the city mayor from 18:00 to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT).\nMr Trump recorded a video message on Twitter calling on supporters to leave the Capitol, but continuing to make unsubstantiated claims that Democrats had stolen the election.\n\"I know your pain, I know you're hurt,\" he said. \"You have to go home now, we have to have peace... we don't want anybody hurt.\"\nMr Biden said the demonstration \"borders on sedition and it must end now\".\n\"At this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault,\" he said.\nPolitical figures across the world expressed shock. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned \"disgraceful scenes\" and called for a \"peaceful and orderly transfer of power\".\nMr Trump's spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, tweeted that the National Guard was being deployed.\nTroops and police have also been mobilised in neighbouring states, and the FBI has been deployed to help Capitol police.\nThere are also reports of protests at state legislatures around the country.\nBy Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Washington\nOn the steps of Capitol Hill, hundreds of loyal Trump supporters are packed closely together, as nearby armed police officers keep a watchful eye.\nThe mood here is tense and defiant.\n\"We're not [expletive] Antifa!\" one man screams at the police, referring to the loose coalition of \"anti-fascist\" activists that oppose Mr Trump.\nTrump loyalists near him wave placards that say \"show us the ballots\".\n\"All we want is for the Capitol police to stand down, and surrender the building to us,\" says one man to news cameras, as he is filmed by other Trump supporters.\nThe conviction here is that the election was stolen from President Trump, and the lawmakers inside the building should do their duty and somehow award the election to him.\nNever mind that election officials have certified the results and the courts have thrown out Trump campaign lawsuits alleging fraud because there's no evidence.\nIt's a siege mentality here, as word spreads through the crowd that the National Guard is on its way to the Capitol.\nA joint session of Congress was being held to certify Mr Biden's election victory on 3 November.\nThe proceedings are usually brief and ceremonial but Republican lawmakers have been objecting to some results.\nFor days Mr Trump had also been putting pressure on Mr Pence, who is presiding over the session, to block certification of the result.\nBut in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said that he had no \"unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted\".\nThe protesters arrived at the Capitol from a \"Save America Rally\", where Mr Trump had urged them to support those legislators opposing Mr Biden's confirmation.\nMr Trump has refused to concede the 3 November election, repeatedly alleging fraud without providing any evidence.\nOn Wednesday, he said again: \"We will never give up. We will never concede.\"\nHe has also tried to throw doubt on the integrity of Tuesday's Senate run-off votes in the southern, traditionally Republican, state of Georgia. Projections by US TV networks suggest the Democrats have won one of the seats and are neck-and-neck for the second seat.\nIf the Democrats win both they will gain effective control of the Senate - something that will help Mr Biden push forward his agenda after he is inaugurated as president on 20 January."

      "text": "A World Health Organization (WHO) team due to investigate the origins of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan has been denied entry to China.\nTwo members were already en route, with the WHO saying the problem was a lack of visa clearances.\nHowever, China has challenged this, saying details of the visit, including dates, were still being arranged.\nThe long-awaited probe was agreed upon by Beijing after many months of negotiations with the WHO.\nThe virus was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019, with the initial outbreak linked to a market.\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was \"very disappointed\" that China had not yet finalised the permissions for the team's arrivals \"given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute\".\n\"I have been assured that China is speeding up the internal procedure for the earliest possible deployment,\" he told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday, explaining that he had been in contact with senior Chinese officials to stress \"that the mission is a priority for WHO and the international team\".\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the BBC \"there might be some misunderstanding\" and \"there's no need to read too much into it\".\n\"Chinese authorities are in close co-operation with WHO but there has been some minor outbreaks in multiple places around the world and many countries and regions are busy in their work preventing the virus and we are also working on this,\" she said.\n\"Still we are supporting international co-operation and advancing internal preparations. We are in communication with the WHO and as far as I know with dates and arrangements we are still in discussions.\"\nThe WHO has been working to send a 10-person team of international experts to China for months with the aim of probing the animal origin of the pandemic and exactly how the virus first crossed over to humans.\nLast month it was announced that the investigation would begin in January 2021.\nThe two members of the international team that had already departed for China had set off early on Tuesday, said the WHO. According to Reuters news agency, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said one had turned back and one was in a third country.\nCovid-19 was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central Hubei province in late 2019. \nIt was initially believed the virus originated in a market selling exotic animals for meat. It was suggested that this was where the virus made the leap from animals to humans.\nBut the origins of the virus remain deeply contested. Some experts now believe the market may not have been the origin, and that it was instead only amplified there. \nSome research has suggested that coronaviruses capable of infecting humans may have been circulating undetected in bats for decades. It is not known, however, what intermediate animal host transmitted the virus between bats and humans."

I know you're hurt,\" said the president.\n\"We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. \n\"But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.\"\nFor the first time, Twitter froze Mr Trump's account. The social media company announced it would keep the account locked for 12 hours, demanding he delete three tweets that it said could stoke violence and threatening \"permanent suspension\". Facebook and Instagram followed suit.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump addressed a \"Save America Rally\" outside the White House.\nHe had urged supporters to head to the Capitol and said: \"Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore.\"\nLittle is known about the woman who died, but disturbing footage from the scene shows her slumped on the ground with blood on her face. Police have not yet released her identity and it is unclear who fired the shot. \nLocal US media have named her as a San Diego-area US Air Force veteran and Trump supporter, Ashli Babbitt. \nThe protesters surged up the Capitol steps at around 14:15 local time (19:15 GMT), shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building.\nThe mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee.\nThey marched through the building shouting \"Where are they?\" and chanting \"We want Trump\".\nOne climbed on to the Senate dais and shouted: \"Trump won that election.\" Another protester was photographed sitting in House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office with a foot on the table.\nPolice with guns drawn piled furniture against the doors of the House chamber to keep protesters out.\nMembers of Congress - including Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, who is a senator - were told to evacuate the building.\nSeveral thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police.\nAfter an occupation lasting several hours, the sergeant-at-arms - the executive office of the Senate - announced that the building had been secured by law enforcement. \nBut there was little sign the protesters were heeding Mr Trump's call to go home, despite a citywide curfew declared by the city mayor from 18:00 to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT).\nMeanwhile, a suspicious device was found outside the Republican National Committee's headquarters, near the Capitol complex, and it was detonated by a bomb squad.\nWashington DC Metropolitan Police said five guns were seized. At least 13 people were arrested.\nThere were also protests at state legislatures in Kansas, Georgia, Utah and on the other side of the country in Oregon and the north-western state of Washington.\nBy Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Washington\nOn the steps of Capitol Hill, hundreds of loyal Trump supporters were packed closely together, as nearby armed police officers kept a watchful eye.\nThe mood was tense and defiant.\n\"We're not [expletive] Antifa!\" one man screamed at the police, referring to the loose coalition of \"anti-fascist\" activists that oppose Mr Trump.\nTrump loyalists near him waved placards that said \"show us the ballots\".\n\"All we want is for the Capitol police to stand down, and surrender the building to us,\" said one man to news cameras, as he was filmed by other Trump supporters.\nThe conviction was that the election was stolen from President Trump, and the lawmakers inside the building should do their duty and somehow award the election to him.\nNever mind that election officials have certified the results and the courts have thrown out Trump campaign lawsuits alleging fraud because there's no evidence.\nA joint session of Congress was being held to certify Mr Biden's election victory on 3 November.\nThe proceedings are usually brief and ceremonial but Republican lawmakers have been objecting to some results.\nFor days Mr Trump had also been piling pressure on Mr Pence, who was presiding over the session, to block certification of the result. \"Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!\" the president tweeted on Wednesday.\nBut in a letter to Congress, Mr Pence said that he had no \"unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted\".\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor.\nThe Kentucky senator warned: \"If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.\"\nAfter the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as \"rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists\".\nHe said the president \"bears a great deal of the blame\". \nSenator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her bid for election in Georgia's vote on Tuesday, said she could no longer in good conscience vote against certification as she had originally planned, citing the \"abhorrent\" invasion of the Capitol.\nPolitical figures across the world expressed shock. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned \"disgraceful scenes\" and called for a \"peaceful and orderly transfer of power\".\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said: \"Trump and his supporters must accept the decision of American voters at last and stop trampling on democracy.\" \nAnd former US President George W Bush said in a statement: \"It is a sickening & heartbreaking sight. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic - not our democratic republic.\"\nFormer President Barack Obama said in a statement that history would rightly remember the assault on the Capitol as \"as a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Doctors are calling for a significant ramping up of the vaccination programme following approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThe first patients are expected to receive the jab - the second approved for use in the UK - on Monday.\nBut with just over 500,000 doses available to use next week, experts are worried there may be a bottleneck in the system.\nThere are more than 25m people in the nine priority groups identified so far.\nThis includes all those over 50 and younger adults with health conditions, as well as frontline health and care staff.\nMeanwhile, GPs have questioned the wisdom of cancelling patients already booked in for their second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first jab that was approved and has been used since early December.\nAs well as approving the Oxford vaccine on Wednesday, regulators also said that doctors could wait longer between the two courses needed, to ensure faster rollout of vaccination.\nBut the British Medical Association's Dr Richard Vautrey said GPs were unhappy they were being asked to cancel appointments that had already been made for second doses. The original advice said they should be given three weeks apart.\nHe said it was \"grossly unfair\" and would waste staff time.\nOne of those who has been affected is Stella Joseph, who is 82 and has a chronic lung condition.\n\"The thing I feel most is utterly helpless, that there's nobody to appeal to, that you can't get any assistance with this at all. \n\"I think it is so hard that those of us who were in this first wave were obviously people who are at high risk and we're the ones who have been left high and dry.\"\nThe move has also prompted some debate about how strong the evidence is for delaying the second dose. \nProf Peter Openshaw, of Imperial College London, said there was \"pretty convincing\" data showing it would enhance the effect of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nBut he said because the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had not been tested in the same way, there was no comparable evidence.\nSo far nearly 950,000 people have received a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nThe hope was that when the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was approved, it would lead to a significant increase in the rate of vaccination.\nThe jab is easier to store and distribute as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature, unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech one that has to be kept in ultra-cold storage.\nThere are thought to be more than five million doses of the Oxford vaccine in the UK, but only just over 500,000 are ready for use. \nThat is because vaccines have to be put into vials and batched and certified.\nSources at the NHS expressed frustration at the situation. \"The NHS is ready to go, but we can only go as quickly as supply allows,\" one said.\nQueen Mary University epidemiologist Deepti Gurdasani said there appeared to be a \"bottleneck\", and the government looked like it was still going to be under its target of two million doses a week.\n\"We really need to speed up rollout,\" she said.\nThere are currently more than 700 vaccination sites up and running, with several hundred more thought to be ready to go once vaccines are available.\nBut the limited supply of the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be shipped in from Belgium, has meant some centres have not been able to vaccinate people every week.\nDame Clare Gerada, a former chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"We really now need a massive operational system. We need a 24/7 system with GPs, mass vaccination centres and hospitals - this needs to be scaled up.\n\"It's got to be football stadia, all these large venues that we've got currently lying dormant.\n\"If we can really get a mass operational system up and running, then I can't see why we can't be getting the whole population immunised by the spring.\"\nNHS England's medical director for primary care, Dr Nikki Kanani, promised there would be a significant expansion of the vaccination programme in the coming weeks.\nShe predicted the majority of care home residents would be protected by the end of January, and frontline staff would start to get a vaccination in large numbers.\nShe also praised the progress made so far, thanking the \"tireless efforts of staff\".\nEngland Health Secretary Matt Hancock also praised staff, adding the numbers being vaccinated would \"rapidly increase in the months ahead\"."

The NHS will never ask you for banking details, passwords, or PIN numbers and these should serve as instant red flags.\"\nShe urged people to report the scams to Action Fraud or Police Scotland.\nThe warning came as MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee heard how fraudsters were seizing on victims' financial uncertainty during the pandemic to draw them into pension scams.\nRules allowing people to withdraw cash from their pension pot from the age of 55 have led some people to move money into investment schemes which look generous, but are simply vehicles to steal money. \n\"Household finances are stretched and so the temptations to use savings or to be tempted by offers of 'free pension reviews', for example, which we've warned about, are very real,\" Mark Steward, from the Financial Conduct Authority told the committee.\n\"Of course, a 'free pension review' is hardly free. It is the first step on a process that will lead someone to investing in something that is too good to be true.\"\nHe said that fraudsters had used social media advertising to \"industrialise\" this kind of fraud.\nWhereas previously, fraudsters had to produce sophisticated glossy brochures and office fronts, they could now operate in anonymity on social media, sending fake information to millions of people.\nMillions of pounds have been lost to pension scams in recent years, but it is a crime considered to be widely under-reported by victims and pension companies.\nGraeme Biggar, director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, told the committee that fraudsters were continuing to use new avenues to reach potential victims.  \n\"What we're looking to do next is to move on to fake comparison websites, which is this new gateway into investment frauds, to spot those and take them down at source,\" he said.\nSource: ScamSmart"

      "text": "Everyone in England must stay at home except for permitted reasons during a new coronavirus lockdown expected to last until mid-February, the PM says.\nAll schools and colleges will close to most pupils and switch to remote learning from Tuesday.\nBoris Johnson warned the coming weeks would be the \"hardest yet\" amid surging cases and patient numbers.\nHe said those in the top four priority groups would be offered a first vaccine dose by the middle of next month.\nAll care home residents and their carers, everyone aged 70 and over, all frontline health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be offered one dose of a vaccine by mid-February.\nScotland earlier issued a stay-at-home order and Wales said schools and colleges would shut until 18 January  for most pupils. \nSchools in Northern Ireland will have an \"extended period of remote learning\", the Stormont Executive said.\nSpeaking from Downing Street, Mr Johnson told the public to follow the new lockdown rules immediately, before they become law in the early hours of Wednesday.\nAll the new measures in England will then last until at least the middle of February, he said, as a new more infectious variant of the virus spreads across the UK.\nThe PM added that he believed the country was entering \"the last phase of the struggle\".\nHospitals were under \"more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic\", he said.\nAnd he reiterated the slogan used earlier in the pandemic, urging people to immediately \"stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\".\nOn Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. \nA further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded.\nAs of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. \nThis is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high.\nThose who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be contacted by letter and should now shield once more, Mr Johnson said.\nSupport and childcare bubbles will continue under the new measures - and people can meet one person from another household for outdoor exercise.\nCommunal worship and life events like funerals and weddings can continue, subject to limits on attendance.\nWhile Mr Johnson said end-of-year exams would not take place as normal in the summer, he said alternative arrangements would be announced separately.\nThe government has published a 22-page document outlining the new rules in detail.\nThe House of Commons has been recalled to allow MPs to vote on the new restrictions on Wednesday.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his MPs would \"support the package of measures\", saying \"we've all got to pull together now to make this work\".\nOnce again it is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. \nIn England there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid since Christmas day.\nTo put that into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled.\nCurrently around three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease.\nIn some hospitals it is more than six in 10.\nBut what is worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to increase.\nIn the spring it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak.\nThe last six days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the UK - a number of these infections are next week's hospital admissions.\nIt is why the UK's chief medical officers were warning there was a \"material risk\" of some hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change.\nMr Johnson spoke after UK chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.\nLevel five means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement.\nNHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a \"critical point\" and that \"immediate and decisive action\" was needed.\nAnnouncing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: \"It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"\nFor pupils who returned for their first day of the new term at primary school on Monday, it's turned out to be an extremely short-lived visit. \nBoris Johnson's announcement will see primary, secondary and further education colleges closed for at least the next six weeks, except for vulnerable and key workers' children.\nIt's a much bigger shift in policy than had been anticipated, even a few days ago.\nEven the return date will depend on the progress in tackling the virus.\n\"I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term,\" said the prime minister.\nKeeping schools open was the government's most definite of red lines, a few weeks ago they were threatening councils that wanted to close them - but it's now been overtaken by the spiking lines on the Covid infection charts.\nEven after the chaos of last year's replacement grades, GCSEs and A-levels are being cancelled again - with a replacement system still to be decided. Vocational exams are to continue.\nFor parents dreading home schooling, there are plans for it to be better supported this time - with more computer devices available and suggestions that Ofsted inspectors will check what schools are offering.\nBut there's no escaping that this will feel like another sudden and chaotic change of direction for schools and parents. \nMr Johnson's pledge on vaccinations comes after an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager became the first person in the UK to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab\nSome 13.9 million people are among the four priority groups who will receive a vaccine dose by about 15 February, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said.\nHow will you be affected by the latest developments?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Some 1.3 million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, says the government.\nIn England, that includes nearly a quarter of the most elderly, vulnerable patients.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said it meant that within a two to three weeks they should have a \"significant degree of immunity\" to the virus.  \nHe said there would be a ramping up to get more people immunised - up to 2 million a week. \nThe ambition is to vaccinate all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers by mid-February. That will require around 13 million vaccinations. \nHe defended the UK's policy of immunising more people with one dose immediately - rather than holding some stock back to give people a second booster shot - in order to save \"the most lives the fastest\". \nUS regulators have questioned the policy, saying it is premature without more trial evidence, but the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says it is a pragmatic decision to protect more people.\nBoth the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection.\nInitially, the strategy for the Pfizer vaccine was to offer people the second dose 21 days after their initial jab - full immunity starts seven days after the second dose.\nBut when approval was announced for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 30 December, it was also announced that the policy would now change - the new priority would be to give as many people a first shot of either vaccine, rather than providing the required two doses in as short a time as possible.\nEveryone will still receive their second dose, but this will now be within 12 weeks of their first.\nEngland's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told the Downing Street press conference that extending the gap between the first and second jabs would mean the number of people vaccinated can be doubled over three months.\n\"If over that period there is more than 50% protection then you have actually won. More people will have been protected than would have been otherwise.\n\"Our quite strong view is that protection is likely to be lot more than 50%.\"\nAsked whether the longer gap could lead to an increase risk of the virus mutating into a version that could escape the vaccine, he said it was a worry, but a small one. \nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said vaccines would probably need to be changed further down the line to continue to be a good match for the virus - but that this was relatively quick to do. \nOne of the exciting things about the science of the RNA vaccines is that they are incredibly fast to make in response to new mutations, he said.

      "text": "All GCSE, AS and A-level examinations in Northern Ireland will not go ahead this year due to the Covid-19 crisis.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday.\nSpeaking BBC's Evening Extra programme, he said plans for awarding arrangements to replace the exams would be finalised before the end of January.\nSome GCSE exams were due to take place next week and more were scheduled for February, May and June.\nThey will not take place but it is not yet clear what alternative arrangements will be in place for awarding grades.\nThe news comes a day after transfer tests were cancelled in Northern Ireland.\nHours later a single Association for Quality Education (AQE) transfer test was scheduled for 27 February.\nStrabane Academy in County Tyrone said on Wednesday afternoon that it had decided not to facilitate this additional test and would instead apply contingency criteria.\nIn a statement, the school said it understood the amount of time and effort invested in preparing for the exams.\n\"However, in these exceptional and unprecedented circumstances, we have taken this decision based on what we believe is the correct decision for children's welfare.\"\nNorthern Ireland is under tight lockdown restrictions amid a sharply-rising number of Covid-19 cases.\nSchools will remain shut until after the half-term break in mid-February, with the majority of pupils facing an extended period of remote learning.\nSpeaking in the assembly on Wednesday, Mr Weir said his department had been \"preparing for all eventualities\".\n\"I now feel we have reached a point where, while I still believe examinations are the most appropriate and fairest awarding methodology, with a further six weeks of remote learning having to be imposed, we cannot continue with exams in the way that was planned,\" he said.\nThe minister added that details about alternative arrangements would be brought forward as soon as possible but he did not commit to a timeframe.\nMr Weir does not have responsibility for BTec exams - they fall under the remit of the Department for the Economy.\nEconomy Minister Diane Dodds has said \"further flexibilities\" would be put in place for January's BTecs assessments and exams.\nSiblings Will, 17, and Rosemary, 16, who attend Lagan College in Belfast, said they were relieved and happy that the exams had been scrapped.\nBut they told BBC News NI that they wished the guidance had been issued sooner.\nThey said they hoped their grades would be formed by teachers' predictions.\nWill, who is in year 14, has missed seven weeks of school this academic year due to extended school holiday periods and having been identified as a close contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus.\n\"I'm happy with the decision to cancel them because everyone is at such a disadvantage this year and like last year we couldn't have done anything else,\" he said.\nRosemary was due to sit her maths and english GCSEs next week.\n\"I'm relieved that after missing so much school I don't have to go in to any serious exams unprepared and hopefully they will find a better way of getting us our grades,\" said Rosemary.\n\"I don't think that the work we've done up to now will go to waste.\"\nIn other coronavirus-related developments on Wednesday:\nLast year, Mr Weir had set out changes to how GCSE and A-levels would be assessed, with students able to sit fewer exams.\nHowever, there had been calls for him to reconsider after the governments in England, Scotland and Wales announced that exams would not go ahead.\nSinn F\u00e9in described the decision to cancel the exams in Northern Ireland as \"the right thing to do\".\nKaren Mullan, the party's education spokesperson, said students had been placed under extra stress due to the pandemic.\n\"We now need to see the education minister bringing forward credible alternative arrangements which avoid the debacle of last year and recognise the hard work put in by both students and teachers,\" she added.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was the \"right thing to do but it's unacceptable that this decision wasn't taken sooner\".\n\"Young people and their parents [were] given mixed messaging and left in limbo for far too long,\" he added."

      "text": "No speeding fines have been issued to drivers breaking the 50mph limit on three stretches of main road and two sections of the M4 motorway in Wales.\nThe limits were introduced as a trial in June 2018 to cut nitrogen dioxide levels and made permanent in 2019.\nAdvisory notices will begin to be issued to speeding drivers to explain the reasons for the 50mph limit.\nThe Welsh Government said this was the \"second phase\" of \"promoting compliance\", after a monitoring phase.\nRoad safety charity Brake said it urges \"more stringent enforcement\".\nTransport Minister Ken Skates' decision to issue advisory letters will apply to the following roads, in which the 50mph restrictions were introduced to reduce emissions:\nSouth Wales Police said management of cameras within environmental 50mph limits in its force area currently lay with the Welsh Government. \n\"GoSafe is working with the Welsh Government to bring the schemes under GoSafe management,\" said a spokesperson.\n\"In the meantime therefore, no Notices of Intended Prosecution (NIPs) have been issued for speeding offences within these camera systems by GoSafe.\"\nRoad safety partnership GoSafe confirmed it had not issued any NIPs within those specific areas.\nThe Welsh Government is trying to cut nitrogen dioxide levels on roads where they are above legal limits.\nThe High Court had ordered ministers to act after they failed to meet EU targets on air pollution.\nThe minimum penalty for speeding is usually a \u00a3100 fine and three penalty points added to your licence.\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said the advisory notices would have a \"strong emphasis\" on giving guidance about the reasons for the reducing speed, such as public health and air quality benefits. \nShe explained that \"a phased approach to promoting compliance with the 50mph speed limits has been undertaken - issuing advisory notices is the second phase\". \n\"The police have been enforcing the speed limits on these routes where driver behaviour/speeds are considered dangerous. \n\"This phased partnership approach will ensure the small minority of drivers who do not comply with the speed limit are given the opportunity to do so before any sanctions are applied.\"\nJoshua Harris, of road safety charity Brake, backed the trial 50mph limits to improve air quality and road safety but urged more stringent enforcement. \n\"Breaking the speed limit is a crime and until road crime is treated like real crime, we will never truly shift the dial on road safety,\" he said.\nIn January 2018, the Welsh Government conceded a case brought by environmental campaign group Client Earth which said ministers had failed to meet EU targets to cut pollution.\nThe Welsh Government's latest annual report on roadside nitrogen dioxide concentrations  last March 2020 said that although the annual trend of NO2 was falling at all five stretches of road, the situation still remained \"complicated\". \n\"Air quality is sensitive to a number of issues including the weather/seasonal effects, traffic flows including volume, speeds and fleet mix,\" it said.\nThe report also noted that \"while the average speeds are below 50mph and compliance is much greater, there still remains a certain percentage of drivers exceeding the 50mph at certain times of the day\".\nLast month, a nine-year-old girl who died following an asthma attack became the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as a cause of death."

We do recognise that this will be an additional burden on schools \nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said rather than a \"vague statement\" of how A-levels and GCSEs would be graded, ministers should already have a system ready in place - and it was a \"dereliction of duty\" that it was not already prepared.\nAnd he warned against repeating the \"shambles\" of last summer's cancelled exams.\nThe education secretary confirmed to MPs that GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown.\nThe exams watchdog Ofqual will draw up proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, for qualifications that could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places.\nSimon Lebus, the watchdog's interim head, said evidence for replacement grades could include tests, homework, mock exams and teachers' observations - and would take into account how much of the syllabus had been covered.\nA consultation is expected to begin next week, with plans to be decided by the end of February or possibly sooner.\nLast year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades.\nAnd without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' assessments, with some process of moderation between schools, will be used for this summer's candidates.\nOn vocational qualifications, Labour's Ms Green said the education secretary was \"failing to show leadership on exams in January\".\nVocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them - but college leaders had complained that there needed to be a national decision to avoid confusion.\nIf students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will still be awarded a grade, if they have \"enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression\", says the awarding body Pearson.\nAn Ofqual spokeswoman said they would consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, \"to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances\".\nThe exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades.\nMr Williamson's statement in the Commons came as all GCSE, AS and A-level exams in Northern Ireland were  cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday.\nScotland has already cancelled its Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers.\nGCSEs  and A-levels in Wales were scrapped in November."

The vice-president has no legal authority to declare Mr Biden's election victory invalid.\nIn the US, electors - based on the results in each state - officially decide who is to be the next president. \nCongress is meeting to count the electoral votes and confirm the nomination of president-elect Biden.\nThis process usually takes place without controversy, but the president and his supporters are continuing to dispute the election results, citing unfounded claims of fraud.\nOnce the electoral votes are counted, it will be up to Mr Pence to formally announce Mr Biden as the next US president.\nMr Trump wants the vice-president to step in and reject the results of the election, declaring the vote fraudulent. \nThe vice-president's role is largely procedural, as the president of the Senate.\nThe 12th Amendment of the US Constitution says: \"The President of the Senate [in this case, Mike Pence] shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.\"\nMr Pence has released a statement ahead of the session saying he doesn't have the power to change the results, and his role is to conduct proceedings \"in an orderly manner\".  \nHis will then be required to read out the final presidential result as approved by Congress.\nThe Electoral Count Act of 1887 gives Congress the power to review the results, not the vice-president.\nMembers of Congress can raise disputes. If a challenge is supported by a member in both the Senate and House (the upper and lower chambers of Congress), then counting is paused and the challenge is debated.\nDespite some significant support among Republicans in Congress, the president is not expected to have enough backers to overturn the results. \nThis would require a majority of both chambers of Congress to vote in favour of nullifying the disputed results.\nMr Pence has said he \"welcomes\" the Republican lawmakers' plan to raise objections.\nBut once disputes are debated and settled, it's over to Mr Pence to announce the final confirmation that Mr Biden won the 2020 election.\nThis is something Mr Biden did to officially confirm Mr Trump as the winner of the 2016 election.\nThat would certainly be an option for a reluctant vice-president - or perhaps leaving the room before the announcement of the final result.\nThere is a precedent for this. Vice-President Hubert Humphrey declined to preside over the counting of electoral votes in 1969, after he lost to Richard Nixon. \nIn this scenario, the role falls to the second most senior member of the US Senate, currently the Republican Chuck Grassley.  \nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions"

      "text": "All schools and colleges will move to online learning until 18 January in Wales.\nSome schools had been due to open on Wednesday and others by 11 January with decisions made by local authorities.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said the decision had been taken jointly with the Welsh Local Government Association and Colegau Cymru.\nTeaching unions had called for a delayed start to term amid concerns about the coronavirus variant.\nHowever, the timing of the decision has been criticised, with some claiming it left little time for parents and schools to make plans.\nMs Williams said: \"As a government we will use the next two weeks to continue to work with local authorities, schools and colleges to best plan for the rest of term.\n\"This is the best way to ensure that parents, staff and learners can be confident in the return to face to face learning, based on the latest evidence and information.\"\nThe announcement comes as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increased the Covid threat level to five - its highest level.\nLevel five warns of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\", according to the UK government's website.\nWales has been under \"stay-at-home\" lockdown restrictions since 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, with more than 31,000 cases in the two weeks over the Christmas period.\nA \"flexible\" agreement on reopening schools had been put in place before Christmas with the decision in the hands of local authorities.\nHowever, that decision has changed following the latest announcement.\nChildren's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: \"It continues to be a difficult situation for children and young people.\n\"Children certainly would rather be in school, and are concerned about uncertainty, but it is clear we are living in difficult times,\" she said.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted to say moving classes online was the \"best way to help reduce the spread of this deadly virus\".\nEithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said the decision made sense but the plan to resume face-to-face education after 18 January should be kept under review and \"not set in stone\".\nLaura Doel, director of the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said the decision brought \"much-needed clarity\". \n\"The Welsh Government has repeatedly said it wants to prioritise education, in that case it must also prioritise safety in schools and the communities schools serve,\" she said.\n\"Work should be undertaken with school leaders and Public Health Wales to establish and agree new Covid-related safety measures in schools during the temporary restriction for implementation in good time prior to lifting restrictions.\"\nClaire Jones, deputy head teacher at Crickhowell High School, Powys, said she was \"really optimistic that blended learning is a way forward\" although \"it's not the ideal\".\nConservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: \"With many children having been due to begin a staggered return to school from Wednesday onwards, this news has come late for them and for their parents.\"\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the decision had left \"little or no time for parents and teachers to adapt to the changing circumstances\".\n\"It is unclear what the Welsh Government expects will change in just two weeks' time and so we risk being in the same position yet again with yet more confusion in a fortnight,\" she said.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties.\nIt went into a level four national lockdown on 20 December.\nHowever, the latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK.\nThis delay until 18 January is something the unions had been calling for but to decide on the Monday before some schools are about to go back on the Wednesday is quite late in the day.\nAnd that's something the opposition parties have picked up on.\nWith all the uncertainty that we are facing over how this new variant will play out and the condition, and the pressure that's on the NHS, I wouldn't put any money necessarily on face-to-face learning resuming on the 18th.\nI'm told that is something that will be kept very much under review.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set of new national restrictions for England, as head teachers over the border warned of a \"confusing picture\" with thousands of pupils unable to start primary school as expected.\nSchools and colleges will be closed until the end of February half term and pupils will be taught online.\nScotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at home from midnight, with schools to be closed.\nMost pupils in Northern Ireland were not expected to return to school this week as had been planned.\nEarlier on Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a \"last resort\"."

      "tags": "Chris Whitty,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\nAccording to government figures on Tuesday, the number of people who tested positive was 60,916.\nOne in 50 people in private households in England had Covid last week - and one in 30 in London, according to estimates based on the latest data.\nA further 830 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test.\nIt comes as England and Scotland announced new strict lockdowns, with people told to stay at home.\nAt a press conference at Downing Street on Tuesday, Boris Johnson said 1.3 million people had now been vaccinated in the UK - including 23% of over 80s in England, some 650,000 people.\nBut he said more than one million people were currently infected - with the number of patients in hospitals 40% higher than in the first peak.\nThe government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty cited the Office for National Statistics' random sampling data for England as showing how widespread the virus is.\n\"We're now into a situation where across the country as a whole, roughly one in 50 people have got the virus, higher in some parts of the country, lower in others,\" he said.\nThat latest estimates include:\nThe number of new daily cases has consistently been above 50,000 since 29 December.\nBack in the first peak of the pandemic in the spring, the number of daily confirmed cases never went above 7,000. \nHowever, it is thought the true number of cases then was much higher but not picked up because testing capacity was limited. It was estimated there were about 100,000 new infections a day at the end of March - but there was not the testing to detect it. \nHospital admissions of people with Covid-19 in England also reached another record high on Tuesday, NHS England figures show.\nAt a hospital in Lincolnshire, a \"critical\" incident has been declared after a sharp rise in patients requiring admission.\nAnd potentially life-saving cancer operations have been put on hold at a major London NHS trust because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients. \nHowever, Cancer Research UK said such cancellations did not appear to be widespread across the country.\nIn a statement after the case numbers were released, Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle said the rapid rise in cases was \"highly concerning and will sadly mean yet more pressure on our health services in the depths of winter\".\nAfter seven consecutive days of more than 50,000 cases being confirmed, the fact that more than 60,000 have been recorded should not come as a surprise.\nIt will take a week, if not more, for the impact of lockdown to be felt.\nAnd all the evidence suggests the new variant of coronavirus, which is more transmissible than previous ones, means the impact is likely to be more limited than it was in previous ones.\nThe figures are also a warning about what the NHS is facing. \nSome of this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions.\nAbout three in 10 beds are now occupied by Covid patients. In some hospitals more than six in 10 are.\nHospitals are now busy making more spaces on their wards - that means cancelling planned work, including in some places cancer treatment.\nBoris Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon both announced new lockdowns on Monday.\nWales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December.\nRestrictions are also being tightened further in Northern Ireland, and an order for people to stay at home will become legally enforceable from Friday. \nIn a televised address to the nation, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to use the lockdown to create a \"round the clock\" vaccination programme.\nHe also called on people to \"recapture the spirit\" of the beginning of the pandemic.\nAt the press conference on Tuesday, Mr Johnson repeated his suggestion that there is a \"prospect\" of the lockdown being eased in mid-February.\n\"But you will also appreciate there are a lot of caveats, a lot of ifs built into that, the most important of which is that we all now follow the guidance,\" he said.\nEarlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Sky News he could not say exactly when the lockdown in England would end, but \"as we enter March we should be able to lift some of these restrictions but not necessarily all\".\nMr Whitty said the virus \"is not going to go away, just as flu doesn't go away, just as many other viruses don't go away\".\n\"We shouldn't kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring,\" he said. \nMr Whitty said although hopefully there would be nearly no measures needed from the spring onwards, the government might have to bring in a few restrictions next winter.\nOn Monday the UK's chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.\nAlthough the new variant is now spreading more rapidly than the original version, it is not believed to be more deadly."

It's just a bit scary.\"\nMeanwhile, Tegwen Bruce-Deans, a Welsh student at Bangor University, said she believes it is important students like herself return to university.\n\"We can do our work there, we will have enough room to do so,\" she said.\n\"We can be around people who are our own age, so that will be nice after everyone is back safely.\n\"It's so important to have somewhere safe to do our work and try and live a normal of a life as possible\". \nWelsh universities were contacted for comment.\nThe University of South Wales said it was planning for a \"phased return of on-campus learning over the next few weeks, in line with Welsh Government guidelines and prioritisation for courses\". It said safety measures, which were in place last term, would remain in place.\nSwansea University said there had been a lot of changes over the last few days and it understood further meetings would be taking place with Welsh Government and universities and if there were changes to the policy in Wales,\u00a0updated advice would be issued. \nBangor University said it was currently asking students to return to their term-time addresses, allowing time for Covid tests and to\u00a0\"lay low\"\u00a0at least\u00a0until the results of the second. \"If the Welsh Government rules change, we will send information about any changes to our students by email,\" a spokesman added.\nBBC Wales understands that representatives from Welsh universities met with Ms Williams on Tuesday afternoon and the current position was discussed but not changed. \nUniversities Wales said institutions were \"rigorously adhering\" to Welsh Government regulations and that students will be tested asymptomatically so \"Covid-secure, in-person teaching can resume\". \nIt added in a statement that evidence suggested transmission of the virus had not been taking place in a teaching setting. \nThe Welsh Government said it had issued advice to students, including the rules around a mix of in-person and blended learning."

      "tags": "Doctors,NHS,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Personal protective equipment (PPE), like masks and gloves, helps stop the spread of coronavirus and saves lives.  \nWith a new, more contagious variant of Covid circulating in the UK, doctors and nurses are calling for more kit that provides the highest protection.\nAnyone in close contact with patients should wear some form of protection. That includes staff in care homes, prisons and the community, as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. People giving vaccines will also use PPE. \nThe type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. \nGuidelines say all hospital staff should wear a face mask, while people visiting hospital or attending outpatient departments should wear a face covering. \nFace coverings, unlike surgical face masks, are not classed as PPE as they are not usually made to a recognised standard and do not provide a proven level of protection for work.\nIn hospitals, anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection. \nClinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection. This includes disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. \nThat would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing. \nAmbulance staff driving the ambulance (if the cab is closed off from the patient compartment) do not need to wear any PPE. The rest of the crew should wear PPE appropriate to their likely risk of exposure. \nPharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask.\nSome staff in other higher-risk occupations like cleaners, mortuary workers and members of the prison service may need to use PPE and should follow guidelines. \nThe NHS needs billions of items each month.\nThere are about 1.6 million NHS staff in UK hospitals and the community, who need varying amounts of PPE.\nOrdering is done on a UK-wide level, but different parts of the NHS have different levels of stock. \nThe government says 32 billion items, including masks, visors and gowns, have been bought.\nAlmost three quarters of expected demand for PPE will be met by UK manufacturers, it says.\nBefore coronavirus, in 2019, the NHS and social care sector in England received around 2.4 billion items of PPE. \nSince the start of the pandemic, more than 8.4 billion items have been delivered to the health and social care system in England.\nThat includes body bags, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent as well as masks, gowns and gloves. \nA breakdown of PPE delivered in the week to 6 November 2020 included:\nSince March, more than 908 million items of PPE have been delivered in the NHS in Scotland.\nIn the week to 30 December, this included:\nSince March, nearly 630 million items of PPE have been delivered to the health and social care sectors in Wales.\nIn the week to 20 December, this included:\nIn Northern Ireland, more than 376.5 million items of PPE were sent between March and the end of January 2021. \nIn the week to 27 November, this included:\nSome bits of kit can only be used once per patient. Others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients. \nAll PPE worn during the highest-risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated.\nAprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session.\nWhen there are shortages, guidelines say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer.\nThe Health and Safety Executive says it recognises \"some compromise\" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit. \nFor example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. \nThe Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association say PPE guidance should take a more precautions to stop airborne spreading.\nBoth say members can refuse to treat patients as a \"last resort\" if there is not adequate PPE. \nUK anaesthetic and intensive care bodies says doctors should carefully evaluate the risks before deciding whether to provide care. \nThe government said it was monitoring evidence on airborne transmission and would update advice \"where necessary\"."

      "text": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese apps. \nThe apps include popular payments platform Alipay, as well as QQ Wallet and WeChat Pay.   \nThe order, which takes effect in 45 days, says that the apps are being banned because they are a threat to US national security. \nIt flags the possibility that the apps could be used to track and build dossiers on US federal employees.  \nTencent QQ, CamScanner, SHAREit, VMate and WPS Office are also included within the order, which only kicks in after Mr Trump has left office.\n\"The United States must take aggressive action against those who develop or control Chinese connected software applications to protect our national security,\" the order said. \nPresident Trump's order says \"by accessing personal electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, Chinese connected software applications can access and capture vast swaths of information from users, including sensitive personally identifiable information and private information.\"\nThe Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on Chinese companies in its final months in office, including those it considers a national security risk. \nPresident Trump has signed executive orders against a range of Chinese firms arguing they could share data with the Chinese government.\nChinese social media app TikTok and telecoms giant Huawei have been among the casualties of Washington's crackdown.\nLast month, the Commerce Department added dozens of Chinese companies, including the country's top chipmaker SMIC and drone manufacturer DJI Technology, to a trade blacklist.\nThe administration also restricted a number of Chinese and Russian companies with alleged military ties from buying sensitive US goods and technology.\nChina has consistently denied claims that these firms share their data with the Chinese government and has responded by imposing its own export laws restricting the export of military technology. \nIn August, the US ordered ByteDance, the owner of social media app TikTok, to either shut down or sell off its US assets.  \nDespite missing a deadline to complete the sale, the US is yet to shut down the app and negotiations continue over its future. \nThe latest ban comes as the White House quietly pushed the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to consider a second U-turn on its decision to delist three Chinese telecoms giants. \nLast week the NYSE announced it would delist the China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom in line with another executive order. \nOn Monday, however, the NYSE reversed that decision, announcing it had decided not to delist the three companies after further consultation with US regulators. \nThe NYSE made the decision based on ambiguity about whether the securities were actually covered by the order. \nHowever, the exchange has come under pressure over its decision. \nThe US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the NYSE President Stacey Cunningham to tell her he disagrees with the decision, according to Reuters.\nRepublican Senator and China hardliner Marco Rubio has also spoken out, saying that the NYSE's refusal to delist the companies was an \"outrageous effort\" to undermine the President's executive order. \nThe NYSE is owned by Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is run by billionaire Jeffrey Sprecher. \nHis wife Kelly Loeffler is one of two Republican senators facing run-off elections on Tuesday in Georgia.

      "tags": "Great Ormond Street Hospital,Twins,Cardiff,Senegal,Sully",
      "text": "Conjoined twins who were expected to die within days when they were born are nearly four years later said to be settling in at their Cardiff school.\nMarieme and Ndeye Ndiaye were brought to the UK from Senegal in 2017 by their father Ibrahima for treatment at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital.\nThe girls, now four, are learning to stand and their father said their progress was \"a Herculean achievement\".\nTheir head teacher said the girls had made friends and were \"laughing a lot\".\nThe girls, who have separate hearts and spines but share a liver, bladder and digestive system, have conditions which put them at higher risk of complications from Covid.\nHowever, Mr Ndiaye said he had wanted them to start school for their development.\n\"When you look in the rear view mirror, it was an unachievable dream,\" he said.\n\"From now, everything ahead will be a bonus to me. My heart and soul is shouting out loud, 'Come on! Go on girls! Surprise me more!'.\"\nMr Ndiaye brought the girls to the UK through funding from a charitable foundation run by Senegal's first lady Marieme Faye Sall, before he sought asylum.\nIn March 2018, the family were moved by the Home Office to Cardiff as asylum seekers can be moved anywhere in the UK and they now have discretionary leave to remain.\nIn 2019, Great Ormond Street surgeons considered attempting separation but it was something Mr Ndiaye did not want because of the risks involved.\nSince then, doctors have found the girls' circulatory systems to be more closely linked than previously thought and neither would survive without the other, making separation now impossible.   \nThe girls' head teacher Helen Borley said they were learning well since starting reception in September and had made new friends. \nShe said: \"Children either say, 'I'm Marieme's friend' or 'I'm Ndeye's friend' - they don't say, 'I'm the twins' friend'. Children very much identify as being one person's friend or another - because the girls are very different characters.\n\"They are laughing a lot - which is always a good sign, isn't it? Any child that is laughing a lot is a happy child.\"\nFor the twins, school needs to fit around hospital visits.\nIn October, the girls needed surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital. \nDr Gillian Body, a paediatric consultant at the Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff, said the procedure was important, despite the risks.\nShe said: \"The girls have complex anatomies and that makes them prone to infections and potentially sepsis.\n\"One of the challenges we had was getting antibiotics into them quickly, and this tube or cannula they've had fitted, means we can get them into them more quickly with less distress to the girls.\"\nShe said Marieme's heart was complex with lots of abnormalities that cause her problems with doing exercise and can lead to breathlessness.\nAt children's' hospice Ty Hafan in Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, the girls have been learning what it feels like to stand. \nA special frame gives them the experience of being upright, helping build strength in their legs.\nPhysiotherapist Sara Wade-West said it had been hard for them.\n\"It's a really different sensation when you're used to being sat down, to be upright can be scary,\" she said. \n\"To start with, particularly Ndeye wasn't very keen. We try and sneak the therapy in around the play, encouraging them to reach for toys to make them work a bit harder, but if they know it's therapy it's not so fun. \n\"Because of their cardiac function we can't push them too much so it's finding that balance - challenging them to get stronger but not exhausting them.\" \nWatching his daughters stand is more than just a breakthrough for their father.\n\"They are showing that they don't only want to live, but be active and play their part in society,\" he said.\n\"All these achievements bring light and hopes for the future. But I know how fragile, complex and unpredictable their lives can be.\"\nMr Ndiaye said his hopes were \"parallel to my fears\" as the girls had \"so many times come close to the worst\".\n\"But the very least I can do for the girls is figure out my hopes for them,\" he said.\n\"The most I can do is to be beside them and live inside that hope and never allow anything to take that hope away.\n \"They are my warriors. They have proved they will never surrender without fighting. It is not yet over.\""

The vast majority of children want to be in school as home-learning is not as good as being in front of teachers.\n\"But we have to understand the seriousness of the situation we face and have the confidence of staff that when they are in school, they are safe.\"\nShe said there was no evidence the new variant was more transmissible in children than adults.\nSchools will only stay closed after 18 January \"if that's the only thing we can do to suppress the virus\", she added.\n\"Clearly any decision to close schools for face-to-face contact for the majority of children is a really really difficult decision and it's a decision which has grave consequences for children.\n\"Education has a role to play in helping suppress the virus and helping our NHS to cope and helping those doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front line and struggling so hard to look after us all.\" \nSome schools had been due to open on Wednesday and others by 11 January with decisions made by local authorities - nurseries and other childcare settings remain open.\nTeaching unions had called for a delayed start to term amid concerns about the coronavirus variant.\nPlaid Cymru called for urgent help for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nJane Jenkins, head teacher at Moorland Primary School in Splott, Cardiff, said: \"We started planning for this before Christmas. It's not really any surprise.\n\"We learnt a lot of lessons in the first lockdown about the difficulties some children and families had with online learning, so we've been able to tailor our support much better this time around.\"\nMother-of-two Clare Ferguson-Walker from Tavernspite, Pembrokeshire, said parents were suffering from \"exhaustion\", but it was the right decision to close schools.\n\"In terms of how it's going to impact on families, I just think we're all tearing our hair out.\n\"Trying to get our kids to actually engage with online learning is a massive task... my kids just don't want to do it, I'm the last person they want to listen to.\"\nChanelle Taylor, a painter and decorator from Caerphilly, said she was worried about balancing schooling with running her business. \nShe said: \"The most worrying concern I have is that with my daughter goes to a Welsh school and we're not Welsh speakers. \n\"It's made a big impact at home trying to home-school her as well as me trying to find childcare to keep my business afloat. \n\"At the moment I'm managing with my mum doing childcare, but it's difficult for my mum because my brother has Asperger's so she also cares for him. At the moment I'm limiting my quotations and working as much as I can without bringing more stress home for my mother.\"\nSara Powell-Davies, who is also from Caerphilly, said she had struggled to get childcare for her four-year-old daughter and other parents she had spoken to had been frustrated by the timing of the announcement. \nShe said: \"You can't do things like this last minute, it's not fair on parents and it's not fair on teachers and schools. \n\"We've been scrambling around now trying to sort out childcare.\"\nStephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and a member of the Independent Sage advisory group, said the focus needed to shift away from keeping schools open to keeping them safe.\n\"A lot of the talk has been about whether schools should be open or closed. Everyone wants schools to be open. We should also be thinking about the best way of making schools safe so we can reopen them as soon as possible,\" he said.\nHe suggested reducing class sizes, hiring more teachers and more spaces and dividing classes.\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said support needed to be made urgently available to children from disadvantaged backgrounds who \"will now fall further behind with their education\".\nShe added: \"Hubs for vulnerable children and the children of key workers are also a necessity alongside an immunisation programme for all school staff so that schools can become a safer environment upon re-opening.\"\nNAHT Cymru, which represents head teachers, welcomed the announcement, saying it had been \"inevitable for some time\".\nDirector Laura Doel added: \"It is uncertain whether the next two weeks will be enough time to ensure a fully risk-assessed plan is put in place.\"\nThe Association of Schools and College Leaders Cymru questioned why it had taken so long for the minister to reach a decision.\nBut Ms Williams said: \"We need to reassess the evidence, which comes through on a daily basis, which makes decision-making really hard. Sometimes, when the data arrives, you simply have to act\". \nThe decision in Wales came as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increased the Covid threat level to five - its highest level.\nLevel five warns of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\", according to the UK government's website.\nWales has been under \"stay-at-home\" lockdown restrictions since 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, with more than 31,000 cases in the two weeks over Christmas.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties.\nHowever, the latest available data shows both England's and Northern Ireland's Covid case rate has risen above Wales.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set of new national restrictions for England, with schools and colleges closed until the end of February half term and pupils being taught online.\nScotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at home, with schools to be closed.\nMost pupils in Northern Ireland were not expected to return to school this week as had been planned.\nOn Monday, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a \"last resort\"."

mid-February as part of efforts to stem the soaring number of coronavirus cases.\nNorthern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed.\nWith more than 12,000 new cases of Covid-19 over the last seven days, further restrictions are coming and Stormont ministers are meeting later to discuss them.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health reported a further 1,378 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours.\nThere have also been 18 more Covid-19 related deaths.\nThe number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\nAccording to government figures on Tuesday, the number of people who have tested positive reached 60,916.\nCOVIDCare NI Mobile App is now providing daily updates of the latest statistics related to coronavirus.\nThe transfer tests are run by the Association for Quality Education (AQE) and the Post Primary Transfer Consortium (PPTC). \nThe AQE tests were due to go ahead on 9, 16 and 23 January.\nThe PPTC test was due to take place on Saturday 30 January with a supplementary test on Saturday 6 February.\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, AQE said the tests would not take place in January due to the executive's decision to close schools.\nIt said it would now consult with the 34 grammar schools that use its tests about a way forward.\nThe PPTC said an expected announcement by the executive that schools would move to remote learning for many pupils until late February meant their tests would not proceed.\n\"If no pupils are able to sit the Entrance Assessment on 30 January 2021 because of Covid restrictions, and these restrictions would not have ended before 6 February 2021 then PPTC will be unable to provide an assessment for any pupils,\" said a PPTC statement.\n\"The responsibility falls on PPTC schools to ensure that their admissions criteria cover this contingency.\n\"PPTC accept that this decision may be disappointing to many children who would have welcomed the opportunity to take the assessment.\"\nSome grammar schools had already outlined how they would admit pupils using \"Covid-19 criteria\" if transfer tests were cancelled.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, whose party Sinn F\u00e9in is opposed to the transfer test, was among those who had been calling for the exams to be cancelled.\nShe tweeted: \"The decision to cancel transfer tests due to take place this week is welcome. \n\"This year has been emotionally and mentally challenging enough for children without the burden of these exams. \n\"DUP minister now needs to provide clarity on other exams.\"\nColin Torrens, principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry, said the decision to cancel at such a late stage was \"shocking\" but it was the right decision.\n\"Children have been put through 12 months of all that hard work only to have it all called off at the last minute,\" he said. \n\"They have worked over Christmas, they have worked over holidays and this really should have all been sorted in May.\"\nThe executive is to meet later to discuss more Covid-19 restrictions including arrangements for schools.\nThe Department for Education (DE) is proposing many pupils should switch to remote learning for a prolonged period.\nBut schools will be expected to remain open to admit vulnerable children and the children of key workers.\nIt is also likely that nursery schools and pre-school settings will close although they are likely also to be asked to admit vulnerable children and the children of key workers.\nBut whether special schools should remain open to all pupils is among the measures as yet undecided, BBC News NI understands.\nMs O'Neill said details of what the executive agreed on Monday would be formalised at an executive meeting on Tuesday, where the health and education ministers will bring separate papers.\nMinisters are then due to brief the Northern Ireland Assembly on Wednesday.\nNorthern Ireland's Education Minister Peter Weir had previously announced a staggered return to school for pupils during the month of January.\nSchools in England, Scotland and Wales are closed to most pupils, and the government in the Republic of Ireland is considering a proposal to close schools for the rest of January.\nAlternative arrangements for GCSE, AS, A-level and vocational exams will also be discussed by the executive on Tuesday.\nThere have already been a number of changes, including fewer exams and reduced content in many courses.\nHowever, the government in England announced on Tuesday that GCSE and A-level exams would be cancelled there.\nIt is not yet clear what alternative arrangements will be put in place in England, with the Education Minister Gavin Williamson to make an announcement on that on Wednesday.\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments announced last month that they would scrap the exams in 2021.\nJustin McCamphill, of teachers' union the NASUWT, said the education minister should scrap GCSEs and A-level exams in Northern Ireland.\n\"If GCSEs and A-levels can't run in England I really don't see why they would continue to run here,\" said Mr McCamphill.\n\"We are not going to be looking at a level playing field and it would not be good for our young people if they were being judged by a different system than children across the rest of UK.\""

      "tags": "Shrewsbury,University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation,Birmingham,West Midlands Ambulance Service,Wolverhampton,NHS,New Cross,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "An ambulance service has experienced its busiest day of calls on record.\nOn Monday, West Midlands Ambulance Service dealt with 5,383 calls in 24 hours. The previous record was 5,001 calls in March 2018.\nSeven hundred of those calls came from London as its calls system struggled, according to BBC health correspondent Michele Paduano.\nThe ambulance service said Covid-19 and winter weather had resulted in hospitals being \"extremely busy\".\nAt the hosptials, the longest a patient waited was five hours and 39 minutes, with two of the longest waits at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham. \nAt one point on Monday night, 15 ambulances were waiting to hand over patients outside New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton.\nA source told the BBC it was \"a very challenging day\" and in total, handovers had accounted for 759 hours of crews' time, equivalent to taking 63 ambulances off the road. \nWhile another said at 06:00 GMT on Tuesday, ambulances were still responding to emergency calls from the night before.\nTraditionally, the first Monday after New Year is always busy. GP surgeries have been closed and people wait until after the festivities to get medical treatment. \nThis year, the number of calls was exacerbated by the service taking about 700 calls for the London ambulance service after its system struggled.\nThere was also the perfect storm of snow and ice coupled with coronavirus - made worse because many of our trusts, particularly University Hospitals Birmingham have been struggling with capacity for many months. Usually hospitals would put patients on corridors, they can't because of Covid risks. \nThey also have fewer beds due to wider spacing to prevent infection and fewer staff on duty. Hence patients left for hours on ambulances outside.\nWest Midlands Ambulance Service is the best performing in the country, but even with near to 500 ambulances a day on the road, it cannot keep up with demand. \nProf David Loughton, the chief executive of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, warned its capacity would \"soon be compromised\".\n\"The numbers are ramping up enormously and I don't think we've seen the full impact of what happened on Christmas Day yet, that will take time to come through,\" Prof Loughton said.\nHe added a two-week \"lag\" meant things could get worst before they get better.\n\"As I always say today's Covid rate is my order book for intensive care in two weeks' time.\" \nA West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: \"A combination of Covid-19 and winter weather has resulted in hospitals being extremely busy which unfortunately resulted in hospital handover delays.\n\"We work closely with the hospitals to try and ensure our crews are able to handover patients quickly and safely, but due to the extremely high demand some patients did wait longer to be handed over than we would normally see.\"\nIn a statement London Ambulance Service NHS Trust said : \"As is standard practice during periods of high demand and high levels of staff sickness, ambulance services provide support for each other, which includes answering 999 calls.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Some 1.3 million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, says the government.\nIn England, that includes nearly a quarter of the most elderly, vulnerable patients.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said it meant that within a two to three weeks they should have a \"significant degree of immunity\" to the virus.  \nHe said there would be a ramping up to get more people immunised - up to 2 million a week. \nThe ambition is to vaccinate all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers by mid-February. That will require around 13 million vaccinations. \nHe defended the UK's policy of immunising more people with one dose immediately - rather than holding some stock back to give people a second booster shot - in order to save \"the most lives the fastest\". \nUS regulators have questioned the policy, saying it is premature without more trial evidence, but the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says it is a pragmatic decision to protect more people.\nBoth the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection.\nInitially, the strategy for the Pfizer vaccine was to offer people the second dose 21 days after their initial jab - full immunity starts seven days after the second dose.\nBut when approval was announced for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 30 December, it was also announced that the policy would now change - the new priority would be to give as many people a first shot of either vaccine, rather than providing the required two doses in as short a time as possible.\nEveryone will still receive their second dose, but this will now be within 12 weeks of their first.\nEngland's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told the Downing Street press conference that extending the gap between the first and second jabs would mean the number of people vaccinated can be doubled over three months.\n\"If over that period there is more than 50% protection then you have actually won. More people will have been protected than would have been otherwise.\n\"Our quite strong view is that protection is likely to be lot more than 50%.\"\nAsked whether the longer gap could lead to an increase risk of the virus mutating into a version that could escape the vaccine, he said it was a worry, but a small one. \nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said vaccines would probably need to be changed further down the line to continue to be a good match for the virus - but that this was relatively quick to do. \nOne of the exciting things about the science of the RNA vaccines is that they are incredibly fast to make in response to new mutations, he said.

      "tags": "US election 2020,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Election Day may feel like an era ago but the presidential saga isn't over yet. Now it's time for Congress to take centre stage - and there's already political drama aplenty.\nAmericans cast their ballots on 3 November, setting in motion the electoral proceedings that led to Democrat Joe Biden becoming the US President-elect. \nBut the presidential cycle is not done and dusted until Congress approves the Electoral College results and Mr Biden takes his oath of office on 20 January. \nFrom constitutional deadlines to congressional objections, there's a lot to explain.\nFirst things first...\nWhen Americans go to the polls in presidential elections they're actually voting for a group of officials who make up the electoral college.\nThe word \"college\" here simply refers to a group of people with a shared task. These people are electors and their job is to choose the president and vice-president, based on the popular vote of their states.\nThere are 538 electors in total, divvyed up among the states. Each elector represents one electoral vote, and a candidate needs to gain a majority of the votes - 270 or more - to win the presidency.\nIn this election, President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump by 306-232. He also won the popular vote by more than seven million ballots.\nThe electoral college meets every four years, a few weeks after election day, to cast their electoral votes. \nCongress will finalise the results of the 2020 election by certifying the electoral college votes. It's a part of the process enshrined in the Constitution.\nAll 50 states have certified the election result, some after recounts and legal appeals.\nOn 14 December, members of the electoral college sent off their votes in sealed certificates to Congress from across the country. \nOn 6 January, these certificates will enter the Capitol in mahogany ballot boxes. \nMembers of both the House of Representatives and Senate from both parties will read the votes out in alphabetical state order and tally them up.\nVice-president Mike Pence, who is the president of the Senate, will preside and eventually declare the winner. \nHis role as president of the Senate is to \"open all the certificates\" in the presence of the House of Representatives and the Senate, according to the US Constitution.\nOK, so once he does that, Biden is winner and we all go home? \nNot this year. Keep reading.\nTaking their cue from the outgoing president, several lawmakers have said they will raise objections.\nThis is against the advice of Senate leader Mitch McConnell.\nAn objection will be heard only if a member of the House and Senate both submit it. Then, the two chambers are allocated two hours per objection to debate the matter before voting on whether to uphold it or not. \nFor a state's electoral votes to be tossed out, majorities in both the House and Senate must vote to do so. With the House in Democratic control and the Senate with Republicans, this would be all but impossible to pull off.\nWhile there is certainly precedent for post-election pushback, and objections have been recorded before (most recently in 2005), no debate has ever resulted in electoral votes being thrown out.\nIt's not exactly Donald Trump's last stand - he may never stop questioning the validity of the 2020 presidential election - but the congressional counting of Electoral College votes is the last major procedural hurdle between Joe Biden and his inauguration. \nIt is a hurdle Biden, with help of Democrats and some Republicans, is sure to clear.\nIt is also the last chance for the president's supporters in Congress to demonstrate fealty to their man while he still holds office.\nAs such, the day's (and night's, and perhaps next morning's) events could shed light on the breadth of support the president still enjoys.\nAlready, there are signs that his backing may not be as strong as even recent predictions suggested. \nIf Republicans fall short of 100 votes in the House and the Senate can't muster much more than the dozen senators who have already announced their intention to object, it could indicate a party sharply divided over its future. Does it involve unquestioning loyalty to Trump or one where his power is receding?\nNo matter the outcome, that such a remarkable, unprecedented attempt to reject the results of a democratic election could become a political litmus test will not easily be forgotten by many.\nEleven Republican senators, led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, want a 10-day delay to audit unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud.\nIn a statement, they said November's election had \"featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities\".\nThere is no proof of widespread voter fraud and numerous legal challenges have been tossed out in the courts. An investigation by the federal Department of Justice (DOJ) found no evidence to back any claims of fraud.\nThe lawmakers said they did not want to \"thwart the democratic process\" but prove that the election was \"lawfully conducted\".\nSeparately, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley has also announced he will object when Congress counts the votes. \nIn the House, Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks heads the group of dozens of Trump loyalists disputing Mr Biden's win in certain states. \nThe representatives are objecting to results in the six key swing states won by Mr Biden where the president has challenged the results (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada). They argue that these states may not have followed election laws properly.\nThe vote row has also prompted questions over Vice-President Mike Pence's role as the one presiding over the joint meeting of Congress. \nMr Pence has said he \"welcomes\" the lawmakers' objections. But by US election law, Mr Pence's duty is purely administrative - and it is highly unlikely he will try to overstep."

      "tags": "Xi Jinping,Asia,China,Corruption,Capital punishment",
      "text": "The death penalty handed out to a former Chinese finance chief found guilty of corruption has been heavily criticised by human rights groups.\nLai Xiaomin was arrested in 2018 on charges of taking 1.8bn yuan (\u00a3200m, $280m) in bribes over a 10-year period.\nIt is one of the most severe sentences to stem from President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption drive.\nHuman Rights Watch said \"China is clearly taking a major step backwards.\"\nChinese officials said crimes committed by Mr Lai were during his time as chairman of Huarong Asset Management. The financial firm was set up in 1999 to to take bad debts off China's largest state-owned banks. \nOn Tuesday, a court in the northern city of Tianjin, said his crimes had \"caused serious losses to the interests of the country\".\n\"Imposing the death sentence on Lai Xiaomin for financial crimes, such as bribe taking, is outrageous and unacceptable and clearly violates China's commitments to respect international human rights standards,\" Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director at Human Rights Watch told the BBC.\nMr Robertson said the death penalty should be immediately commuted to prison time.\n\"By imposing this sentence, China is clearly taking a major step backwards on rights in what appears to be an effort to create fear among businessmen.\"\nHuman Rights Watch calls the tactic 'killing the chicken to show it to the monkeys' so it \"makes an example of one person to instil obedience in all the others.\" \nYaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, added that President Xi \"has little intention to end or slow down the campaign\" to stamp out corruption.\nHuman Rights Watch added that it opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as \"inherently cruel, and believes it violates of the right to life and fundamental dignity that all human beings possess.\"\nThe group has called on the Chinese government to impose an immediate moratorium on its use.\nUnder Mr Lai's leadership, Huarong raised vast amounts of capital and expanded aggressively into investment banking services. \nThe asset management company which is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, also developed its own brokerage, insurance and leasing arms.\nCaixin, a finance magazine in China, reported that 100 properties developed by a Huarong subsidiary in south China were distributed to Mr Lai's ex-wife and mistresses.\nChina's Communist Party has taken an increasingly tough stance on corruption among government officials and corporate executives, with more than one million punished. \nIn 2016, China raised the threshold for capital punishment related to corruption to 3m yuan from 100,000 yuan, but the penalty has seldom been used.\n\"China's leaders clearly continue to rely on the death penalty as a deterrent, but it seems they have a message to send to the broader public about their willingness to use it,\" Joshua Rosenzweig, head of Amnesty International's China team, told the BBC.\n\"If this signals a return to the so-called 'strike hard' approach to crime, then it could have really serious consequences for China,\" he added.\nMr Lai had previously worked at China's central bank and banking regulator."
