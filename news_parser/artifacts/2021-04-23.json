      "text": "More than one million people in Wales have received both doses of their Covid vaccine, official data shows.\nPublic Health Wales (PHW) has confirmed that 1,000,706 people have had the full dose of the coronavirus vaccine - almost a third of the Welsh population.\nFigures also show that 2,091,824 in Wales have now had their first jab - that's two-third of the population.\nTwo further Covid deaths were reported in Wales, both in the north, on Sunday while PHW confirmed 46 new Covid cases.\nWales' weekly infection rate stands at 9.7 cases for every 100,000 people.\nThe overall Covid death toll in Wales, according to PHW figures, is 5,566 people since the start of the pandemic.\nFigures released on Sunday cover 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Friday as data is no longer published on Saturday. \nThe confirmation that one million people - or 31.7% of the population - are fully vaccinated in Wales comes as studies show the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines are highly effective against the variant identified in India after two doses.\nSome 66.3% of the Welsh population have had at least one vaccine but a Public Health England report said two jabs of either vaccine give a similar level of protection against symptomatic disease from the Indian variant as they do for the Kent one.\nHowever, both vaccines were only 33% effective against the Indian variant three weeks after the first dose. This compared with 50% effectiveness against the Kent variant.\nLatest data showed the number of people with the Indian variant of concern had risen to 28 in Wales.\nPHW have said that the \"majority\" of Indian variant cases in Wales are \"associated with travel or with known contacts\" and added \"robust contact tracing processes are in place.\"\nHealth officials say they do \"expect this number to go up\" as it \"may be slightly more transmissible\" than the dominant Kent variant in Wales.\nPHW's coronavirus incident director has said \"most health boards\" have seen cases of the Indian variant of concern and added it \"underlines the message\" to get vaccinated as soon as people are asked.\n\"We are seeing cases of the new variant in Wales but the numbers are small so far,\" said Dr Eleri Davies.\n\"We are seeing an increase in those as we investigate and follow up the contacts and of course, you have seen the figures from England and the fast rise there so we are expecting to see more.\n\"I think with the latest information about the effectiveness of the vaccines, then we are in a good position in Wales with the success of the vaccine programme. \n\"It's clear that, to date, the Kent variant is covered by the vaccine and also the other variants that we are following closely, there is still retained efficacy.\n\"So I think the fact that we are progressing well with our vaccine programme in Wales is very heartening under the circumstances. \"\nThe local authority with the highest rolling case rate for the last seven days is Newport with a case rate of 33 per 100,000 people, followed by Cardiff and Wrexham.\nThere were seven Welsh counties with no new Covid cases while Denbighshire (3.1), Rhondda Cynon Taf (3.3) and Gwynedd (4) and had the lowest infection rates. Wales' rolling average for deaths is 0.6 daily deaths.\nOn the case rates, when broken down into communities, 94% have had two or fewer positive tests in the last week.\nA total of 2,043,254 people have been tested for the virus since the start of the pandemic, with 3,536,315 tests taken. There have been 12,413 tests since the last report. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nThe postcode search has been updated to replace data for health boards in Scotland with data for local councils.

      "text": "More than 2.7 million people in Scotland have had their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccination, 60% of those aged 16 and over. In those aged over-70 close to 100% of people have been vaccinated. Yet in some vulnerable groups the figure is lower.\nThe target was to offer the first dose to all nine JCVI priority groups by the middle of April and the Scottish government said that was \"effectively\" done.\nWhile some priority groups have seen almost total vaccine coverage others appear to remain lower.\nAccording to the latest Public Health Scotland data, 86.6% of people in JCVI category 6 - which covers people aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions - have had their first dose.\nThis is a large group of more than 660,000 people, which means more than 88,000 have not yet had a first dose.\nThe figures also show that about 33,000 people aged 50 to 54 (JCVI group 9) have yet to receive a jab. This is about 9% of the age group.\nSome of these people could be in both categories.\nAlthough these figures are lower than the remarkably high rates for older people, they are still much higher than vaccination targets for most vaccinations including the annual seasonal flu jab.\nFor comparison, the uptake target for the flu jab in people over 65 is 75% and this year it managed 79%.\nThe Public Health Scotland figures for Covid vaccinations suggest that of the 1.35 million people in Scotland aged over 60, just 7,500 people have not had their first dose. That is about five people in every 1,000.\nCovid vaccine coverage in some JCVI groups actually exceeded initial estimates, with 361,028 front-line health staff receiving the jab despite only 230,000 being thought to qualify when the figures were first announced in December.\nHowever, take-up among some front-line social care staff appears to be low at just 82.2%. \nPublic Health Scotland, using the Scottish Social Services Council staff register, estimated the number of staff in this sector to be 96,936. If that figure was correct it would suggest that 17,000 social care staff have not taken up the vaccine offer.\nThe latest weekly figures from NHS England show a similar pattern to Scotland.\nTake-up among the older age groups is generally very high - above 95%.\nThe 50 to 54 age group is slightly lower at 88.8%.\nIn England, just 80% of JCVI category 6 people - those under 65 with an underlying condition or unpaid carers - have received their first dose of the vaccine. While rates for social care workers were down at 80.4% in elderly care homes and even lower for other care staff.\nThe figures in Wales were similar but slightly lower with just 91.2% of those aged 60 to 64 taking the first dose, 88.6% of those aged 55 to 59 and 86% of those 50 to 54-year-olds.\nThe figure for those under 65 with a health condition was 84.5%, just a little lower than the figure for Scotland."

Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

      "text": "The West is faced with a \"moment of reckoning\" when it comes to technology and security, the head of intelligence agency GCHQ has told the BBC.\nJeremy Fleming said there was a risk that key technologies on which we rely will no longer be shaped by the West. \n\"We have to keep evolving our approach if we're going to keep up,\" he said of the growing challenge from China.\nSo-called smart cities, which will collect large amounts of data, are just one example, he added.\n\"The risk is that the technology is implemented in a way in which we can't assure its security,\" he warned.\nThe UK is a \"big beast\" when it comes to technology but \"we can't take that for granted\", the GCHQ director warned, saying this was a moment when we had to decide if we were going to continue to evolve and compete with our adversaries.\nMr Fleming was speaking ahead of giving this year's Vincent Briscoe Annual Security Lecture at Imperial College, and in the wake of the Integrated Review, which placed science and technology at the centre of future security and defence policy.\nThe challenge from China is uppermost in the minds of intelligence chiefs across Western countries, particularly when it comes to technology. \n\"The risk, as I see it today, is that we lose control of the standards that shape our technology environment,\" he told the BBC.\n\"The things that make sure that our liberal Western democratic views are baked into our technology.\"\nMr Fleming said there were lessons to be learnt from the debate over the role of Chinese company Huawei in building a new 5G telecoms system. It was initially given a role in the UK, before being excluded following US sanctions.\nBut there were concerns that there were few other companies actually able to supply the latest technology.\n\"The conversation about 5G was really lost a decade ago, when Western nations decided that they weren't going to invest in the underpinning infrastructures... and the result was we just didn't have the choices,\" he said.\nThe imperative was to make sure in the future the UK took the kind of long-range decisions need to ensure it has choice - so there would not be the same concerns over dependency, he said.\nThat need to look forward prompted a focus on smart cities.\nThese involve a vast number of sensors and cameras built into a city's infrastructure - controlling everything from traffic to utilities such as water and power.\nBut it also means vast amounts of data will be collected about people's movement and activity. \nDone in the right way, the GCHQ chief argues this presents a \"fantastic opportunity\" to increase efficiency and improve services. \nBut he warned it also carries risks around privacy and anonymity. \n\"If we don't control the technology, if we don't understand the security required to implement those effectively, then we'll end up with an environment or technology ecosystem where the data is not only used to navigate, but it could be used to track us\".\nChina is a leading supplier of smart city technology, with councils in the UK already purchasing cameras from its companies. \nMr Fleming said it was vital to ensure all the technologies were not from one place and to understand how data was being processed.\nThere were only a relatively small number of areas where the UK would need to completely control a technology, he said, and more broadly working with allies would be essential to shape international standards and to defend itself in cyberspace. \nAt home, the UK has to invest in skills and innovation. \nThe UK should not be \"fatalistic\", he said, and had a \"very strong track record\" of meeting technology challenges."

      "text": "The House of Commons has declared for the first time that genocide is taking place against Uyghurs and others in north-west China. \nMore than a million people are estimated to have been detained at camps in the region of Xinjiang.\nThe motion approved by MPs does not compel the UK to take action, but is a sign of growing discontent towards the Chinese government in Parliament.\nIn response, China said the UK should \"immediately right its wrong moves\".\nTory Sir Iain Duncan Smith heralded the vote as \"a historic moment\", bringing the UK Parliament in line with Holland, Canada and the United States.\nSir Iain was one of five UK parliamentarians sanctioned by China for spreading what it calls \"lies and disinformation\".\nSpeaking in the debate, Nus Ghani - another MP to be targeted by China - said genocide meant intent to \"destroy in whole or in part\" a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\n\"All five criteria of genocide are evidenced as taking place in Xinjiang,\" she said. \nMs Ghani said detainees were subject to \"brutal torture methods, including beatings with metal prods, electric shocks and whips\".\nShe also said women in the Uyghur region were being fitted with birth control devices, adding: \"The Handmaid's Tale is a fairy tale compared to the reproductive rights of Uighur women.\"\n\"This abuse is evidenced by the Chinese government's own data - 2014, over 200,000 birth control devices were inserted in women in Xinjiang. By 2018, this had increased by 60%,\" she said.\nIn a statement, the Chinese embassy to the UK said: \"The unwarranted accusation by a handful of British MPs that there is 'genocide' in Xinjiang is the most preposterous lie of the century, an outrageous insult and affront to the Chinese people, and a gross breach of international law and the basic norms governing international relations.\n\"China strongly opposes the UK's blatant interference in China's internal affairs.\"\nLabour's shadow Foreign Office minister Stephen Kinnock said the party supported the motion arguing that \"genocide can never be met with indifference or inaction\".\nThe government opposed the motion arguing that deeming an event to be a genocide was a matter for \"competent national and international courts after consideration of all the available evidence\".\nDespite government opposition, the motion passed because ministers did not vote against it.\nForeign Office Minister Nigel Adams insisted the UK was \"ramping up pressure\" on Beijing through the United Nations.\nEarlier this year, Canada, the European Union, the UK and the US imposed sanctions on Chinese officials in protest at rights abuses in the country.\nChina has denied allegations of abuse and argued that the camps are a tool to fight terrorism.

      "text": "The chances of becoming infected by Covid fell sharply after a first dose of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines, a UK study has found.\nThe vaccines worked just as well in the over-75s and those with underlying health conditions, as other people.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) and University of Oxford research also found a strong antibody response in all age groups from either jab.\nEveryone showed some response to both vaccines, they said.\nThe research, contained in two studies which have not yet been peer-reviewed or published, is based on virus tests from 370,000 people in the general UK population - one of the largest to date.\nIt provides further real-world evidence that the vaccines being used in the UK to protect against Covid-19 are effective at protecting people against coronavirus infections.\nIn the first study, people who had been vaccinated with a single dose of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were 65% less likely to get a new Covid infection.\nThree weeks after their jab, given between December 2020 and early April 2021, infections with symptoms fell by 74%, while infections with no reported symptoms fell by 57%.\nThose who had received a second vaccine dose of Pfizer were 90% less likely to be infected. The same calculation could not be made for AZ, because too few people in the study had received a second dose as its rollout started later.\nThe study showed both vaccines were effective against the Kent variant (B117) which was circulating at the time. \nDr Koen Pouwels, senior researcher in University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Population Health, said the data backed up the decision to extend the gap between doses.\n\"The protection from new infections gained from a single dose supports the decision to extend the time between first and second doses to 12 weeks to maximise initial vaccination coverage, and reduce hospitalisations and deaths,\" he said.\nHowever, he said the figures showed there was still a chance vaccinated people could acquire Covid again and pass it to others, emphasising the need for social distancing and masks.\nThe second study, in nearly 46,000 adults who had been vaccinated with one dose, found strong antibody responses - a sign that the vaccines are stimulating the body's defence system to protect against the virus - in all age groups.\nThese antibody responses were \"broadly sustained out to 10 weeks afterwards\", the researchers said.\nAlthough antibody levels rose more slowly and to a lower level with a single dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca, they dropped more quickly after one Pfizer dose, particularly in older age groups.\nThere was a better response in younger adults compared with older adults over 60 with both jabs, but after two doses of Pfizer antibody levels were high across all ages, the study said.\nOne finding that surprised researchers was the amount by which the immune response shot up in the over-80s after a second dose - far more than in younger age groups.\nThe findings highlight the importance of people getting their second vaccine dose for increased protection, the researchers said.\nBut it is still not clear what the build-up of antibodies after a Covid vaccine actually means.\nProf Sarah Walker, chief investigator on the studies, from the University of Oxford, said: \"We don't yet know exactly how much of an antibody response, and for how long, is needed to protect people against getting Covid-19 in the long term - but over the next year, information from the survey should help us to answer these questions.\"\nBoth studies are based on data from the Covid-19 Infection Survey, a partnership between the University of Oxford, the ONS and the Department for Health and Social Care."

      "text": "A malaria vaccine has proved to be 77% effective in early trials and could be a major breakthrough against the disease, says the University of Oxford team behind it.\nMalaria kills more than 400,000 people a year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa.\nBut despite many vaccines being trialled over the years, this is the first to meet the required target.\nThe researchers say this vaccine could have a major public health impact.\nWhen trialled in 450 children in Burkina Faso, the vaccine was found to be safe, and showed \"high-level efficacy\" over 12 months of follow-up.\nLarger trials in nearly 5,000 children between the ages of five months and three years will now be carried out across four African countries to confirm the findings. \nMalaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through mosquito bites. Although preventable and curable, the World Health Organization estimates there were 229 million cases worldwide in 2019 and 409,000 deaths.\nThe illness starts with symptoms such as fever, headaches and chills and, without treatment, can progress quickly to severe illness and often death.\nStudy author Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute and professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said he believed the vaccine was the first to reach the World Health Organization's goal of at least 75% efficacy.\nThe most effective malaria vaccine to date had only shown 55% efficacy in trials on African children.\nThe trials of this malaria vaccine started in 2019, long before coronavirus appeared - and the Oxford team developed its Covid vaccine (with AstraZeneca) on the strength of its research into malaria, Prof Hill said.\nA malaria vaccine has taken much longer to come to fruition because there are thousands of genes in malaria compared to around a dozen in coronavirus, and a very high immune response is needed to fight off the disease.\n\"That's a real technical challenge,\" Prof Hill said. \"The vast majority of vaccines haven't worked because it's very difficult.\"\nHowever, he said the trial results meant the vaccine was \"very deployable\" and \"has the potential to have a major public health impact\".\nIn a pre-print study with The Lancet, the research team - from Oxford, Nanoro in Burkina Faso and the US - reported the trial results of R21/Matrix-M, after testing a low and high dose of the vaccine in children, between May and August, before peak malaria season.\nThe vaccine showed 77% efficacy in the higher-dose group and 71% in the lower-dose group.\nHalidou Tinto, professor in parasitology and the principal trial investigator at the Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro, Burkina Faso, said the results were \"very exciting\" and showed \"unprecedented efficacy levels\".\n\"We look forward to the upcoming 'phase III' trial to demonstrate large-scale safety and efficacy data for a vaccine that is greatly needed in this region.\"\nIn Africa, there have been more deaths from malaria than from coronavirus in the past year.\nThe Serum Institute of India, which has manufactured the vaccine, says it is confident of delivering more than 200 million doses of the vaccine as soon as it is approved by regulators.\nBiotechnology company Novavax provided the adjuvant for the vaccine, an ingredient which is used to create a stronger immune response.\nMalaria is one of the leading causes of childhood mortality in Africa and Prof Charlemagne Ou\u00e9draogo, minister of health in Burkina Faso, said the new data showed that a new malaria vaccine could be licensed \"in the coming years\". \n\"That would be an extremely important new tool for controlling malaria and saving many lives,\" he said."

      "text": "India's healthcare system is buckling as a record surge in Covid-19 cases puts pressure on hospital beds and drains oxygen supplies. \nFamilies are left pleading for their relatives who are desperately ill, with some patients left untreated for hours.\nCrematoriums are organising mass funeral pyres. \nOn Friday India reported 332,730 new cases of coronavirus, setting a world record for a second day running. Deaths were numbered at 2,263 in 24 hours. \nDr Atul Gogia, a consultant at the Sir Ganga Ram hospital in Delhi, told the BBC there had been a \"huge surge\" in patients, leaving no space in the emergency room. \n\"We do not have that many oxygen points. Whatever oxygen points are there, they're full. Patients are coming in with their own oxygen cylinders or without oxygen. We want to help them but there are not enough beds and not enough oxygen points even to supply them oxygen if it is there,\" he said. \n\"All our telephone lines are jammed. People are continuously calling the helpline. There is a big rush outside the hospital: there are ambulances parked, patients wanting to get deboarded, but the problem is, there is no space. \n\"We try to mobilise, we try to discharge patients who become stable as early as possible so that we can increase the turnaround, but things are difficult right now.\"\nEvery morning, for the past few days, I have been waking up to my phone buzzing with desperate messages for help.\nPeople are seeking hospital beds, life-saving drugs, oxygen and plasma for their infected and sick friends and relatives. Often, after a period of silence, the same people announce the deaths of their \"patients\". My Twitter timeline is India's Covid-19 war-room, as the state appears to have largely withered away.  \nEvery essential to save a life is in short supply or available on the black market. Then there's the fear of the virus literally \"at your door\". Over the past week, three buildings in the gated complex where I live have become \"containment zones\", with entire skyscrapers sealed because of too many infections. The days and nights are filled with helplessness, anxiety and fear. The bad news is unrelenting. \nThe Supreme Court of India has called this a \"national emergency\". This is beyond an emergency. It is a \"complete collapse of the goddamn system\", as one of India's leading virologists says. In hotspots like Delhi and Mumbai, life, itself, is now a privilege.\nMaharashtra, the worst-hit state in India, faces an oxygen shortfall. In the state capital, Mumbai, at least 13 patients died after a fire broke out in an intensive care unit of a hospital treating Covid patients. \nTwo days earlier, 24 Covid patients died in another part of the state after a leak interrupted the flow of oxygen to their ventilators. \nOn Friday morning, Max Healthcare, which runs 10 private hospitals around Delhi, put out an \"SOS\" message, saying it had less than an hour's supply remaining at two of its sites. The shortage was later resolved. \nThree other states - Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana - are also facing a critical shortage. The Indian Air Force is being used to lift oxygen tankers and supplies to different parts of the country.\nA separation process takes air and splits it into various gases, including oxygen. The oxygen is then purified, super-cooled and stored as a liquid, which is less bulky than keeping it as a gas. \nThe compressed oxygen is used to fill insulated tanks, which supply hospitals, or canisters for individual patients. \nA vaporiser is used to turn the oxygen back into a gas before it is delivered to patients. \nCases have surged during India's second wave, driven by a number of factors. Health protocols have been lax, with mask mandates sporadically enforced.\nMillions of people attended a Hindu festival, the Kumbh Mela, which culminated 10 days ago with a mass dip in the River Ganges. New strains of the virus have emerged, including a \"double mutant\" strain. \nBollywood composer Shravan Rathod tested positive shortly after returning from the city where the Kumbh Mela was held and died not long after, his family confirmed. \nAs well as the Indian double-mutant strain, the UK strain is the primary variant found in the state of Punjab, National Centre for Disease Control Director Sujeet Kumar Singh told local media. \nThe UK strain is also particularly prevalent in Maharashtra and the city of Delhi, he added.\nDr Saswati Sinha, a critical care specialist in the eastern city of Kolkata, said emergency rooms and wards were packed to capacity.\n\"We are getting direct calls from our patients, our acquaintances, our neighbours: they are pleading with us to be able to accommodate some of their next of kin. But unfortunately, our situation is such that, although we are trying our best, we still have a huge number of patients whom we are not able to accommodate,\" she told the BBC.\n\"In 20 years of working in intensive care, I have never seen anything of this kind, ever.\"\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met chief ministers of the most affected states and oxygen manufacturers on Friday. \nHe asked states to work together to stop hoarding and black marketeering, saying that the government was also looking at diverting industrial oxygen to ease the crisis. \nAre you affected by Covid-19 in India or are you worried about relatives there?

      "text": "Scottish scientists have identified two cases where humans are thought to have passed Covid-19 to their cats.\nResearchers at the University of Glasgow said both cats developed the virus after their owners.\nThey were of different breeds and lived in separate households. One displayed mild symptoms but the other had to be put down.\nScientists now want to improve understanding of whether pets can play a role in infecting humans.\nThe cases were found as part of a screening programme of the feline population in the UK.\nResearchers believe both pets were infected by their owners, who had Covid-19 symptoms before the cats became unwell.\nThe study, published in the Veterinary Record, said there is currently no evidence of cat-to-human transmission or that cats, dogs or other domestic animals play any appreciable role in the epidemiology of human Covid infections.\nBut the scientists said domestic animals could potentially act as a \"viral reservoir\" allowing continued transmission, and said it was important to improve understanding of whether pets can play a role in infecting humans.\nProf Margaret Hosie, from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research who was lead author of the study, said: \"These two cases of human-to-animal transmission, found in the feline population in the UK, demonstrate why it is important that we improve our understanding of animal Sars-CoV-2 infection.\n\"Currently, animal-to-human transmission represents a relatively low risk to public health in areas where human-to-human transmission remains high.\n\"However, as human cases decrease, the prospect of transmission among animals becomes increasingly important as a potential source of Sars-CoV-2 reintroduction to humans.\"\nShe added: \"It is therefore important to improve our understanding of whether exposed animals could play any role in transmission.\"\nResearchers at the centre worked in partnership with the Veterinary Diagnostic Service (VDS) at the university's School of Veterinary Medicine on the study.\nThe first cat was a four-month-old female Ragdoll kitten from a household in which the owner developed symptoms that were consistent with Covid at the end of March 2020, although they were not tested.\nThe kitten was taken to a vet with breathing difficulties in April 2020 but its condition deteriorated and it later had to be put down.\nPost-mortem lung samples revealed damage consistent with a viral pneumonia and there was evidence of Sars-CoV-2 infection.\nThe second cat was a six-year-old female Siamese from a household where one owner tested positive for Covid-19.\nThe cat was taken to the vet with nasal discharge and conjunctivitis, but its symptoms remained mild and the cat later recovered.\nCovid-19 infection was confirmed in a retrospective survey of swabs submitted to VDS between March and July 2020 for routine pathogen testing.\nScientists believe the two cases are likely to be an underestimate of the true frequency of human-to-animal transmission, as animal testing is limited.\nSince the pandemic began there have been reports of cats from Covid-positive households in countries including Hong Kong, Belgium, the USA, France and Spain that tested positive for the virus and were presumed to be infected from their owners.\nProf James Wood, head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Cambridge University said: \"These are important and interesting findings, adding to the body of evidence that humans can infect their pets, in some cases, as here, leading to clinical disease in the animals.\n\"Cats and dogs have been reported to be infected. This is a high quality study, including whole genome sequencing to confirm transmission links.\"\nThe study was funded by the Wellcome ISSF Covid Response Fund and supported by the Medical Research Council.

      "tags": "Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Lobbying,Mobile phones,Civil Service",
      "text": "The lobbying controversy that has enveloped Westminster is a complex and fast-developing story but there is one strand running right through the centre of it - the smartphone. \nWhatsApp and text messages have replaced face-to-face meetings and letters as the favourite method of communication for politicians.\nThe casual, and sometimes untraceable, nature of these communications can make it harder for the Civil Service to ensure everyone - ministers, officials, businesses and lobbyists - plays by the rules.\nIt wasn't that long ago that everything was typed out in triplicate, and phone calls were routed through Whitehall switchboards, with officials listening in and taking notes.\nTony Blair didn't get a mobile phone until he left Downing Street in 2007. Now politicians, like the rest of us, can't live without them.\nFollowing a series of revelations about ministers' use of texts and messaging apps, Labour has warned that the UK is heading towards \"government by WhatsApp\".\nIt's a catchy slogan, but it might be a bit dated, as the prime minister and other leading politicians are reportedly migrating to Signal, a rival messaging app.\nUsers can set encrypted messages to automatically delete after short periods of time, even as short as five seconds.\nThey can also stop screenshots being taken of exchanges if they are using an Android phone. \nMessages sent and received on Facebook-owned WhatsApp - which has been around since 2009 - are also encrypted, but screenshots can be taken and shared.\nMinisters are issued with work mobile phones when they get a job in government. Until a few years ago, they were given Blackberries, but now the iPhone seems to be the favoured brand.\nThe idea is to ensure that professional and personal calls, texts and emails are kept separate from their personal communications.\n\"I was given a phone as soon as I started,\" one former Conservative minister tells the BBC, \"but I wasn't sat down and issued with any advice on how to use it.\"\nA government source says: \"Clearly ministers may have informal conversations from time-to-time, whether that is in person, via digital communications or remotely, and if they find themselves discussing official business then significant content from such discussions should be passed back to officials.\"\nIn official guidance, designed for private emails but applying to all electronic communications, ministers are told to work out whether they include details on \"substantive discussions\" or \"decisions\" made on government business.\nIf they do, they should then forward them to civil servants.\nThe ministerial code, laying out general rules of behaviour, says that a private secretary or another official should be present for \"all discussions relating to government\", to ensure transparency.\nIf that's impossible - such as when ministers chat to business leaders at social events - they have to report back to civil servants as soon as possible.\nIt's widely accepted that phone messaging should be reported in the same way if it's about important official business.\nBut the Institute for Government (IfG) think tank wants a tightening of the rules, so that all messages sent and received on official phones - about whatever topic - are logged, with the names of those taking part published quarterly. This already happens for meetings ministers attend.\n\"There needs to a public record that something's happened,\" IfG associate director Tim Durrant says. \"Texting's essentially a conversation, like a meeting.\"\nA source who used to work in Whitehall in a senior role says it was \"normal\" for ministers to have text exchanges with business leaders - and then let civil servants know about them.\n\"There's nothing wrong with the leaders of this country talking to captains of industry,\" they add. \"It's a part of how government functions. We live in a free country.\n\"What really annoys me is that there's an assumption of wrongdoing of some sort here. It's wrong to say government is run by text message. It's a form of communication that everyone uses for personal and official matters.\"\nCulture minister Caroline Dinenage told Times Radio ministers did not hand out their mobile numbers \"willy-nilly\" and there were \"very clear rules\" about handing contacts to civil servants.\nBut Labour argues that the government's use of messaging fosters \"cronyism\", that those with ministers' phone numbers have an unfair advantage over those who do not.\nAn ex-minister tells the BBC they kept personal and official messages completely separate when they were in office.\n\"You have to rely on people using their common sense,\" they add.\n\"Some ministers actually hand the work mobile across to be carried by a special adviser or a member of their team, so they're not too close to it and don't use it in an inappropriate way.\n\"You've also got to be careful as to whom you give your number out to.\"\nSome in government have suggested the prime minister should be less willing to share his personal contact details, the BBC understands, but officials have denied that he was told to change his number.\nBut Mr Johnson says he will keep his phone, arguing: \"I need to be in touch with people... You need one these days.\"\nAnd there would inevitably be resistance to any rule change among some in Whitehall.\nOne former special adviser asks: \"What are ministers supposed to do? Put in a 30-page submission for every transaction they carry out, even in the midst of a pandemic?\""

      "tags": "Policing,North Wales Police,Dyfed-Powys Police,South Wales Police,Welsh Parliament election 2021,Gwent Police,PCC elections 2021",
      "text": "Policing remains one of the areas governed by Westminster, but it would be wrong to think all the power lies there. \nDrill down into: a) who funds the police, b) who decides policing priorities and c) the causes of crime - and suddenly the role of those we elect on 6 May in Wales is rather important. \nRoughly a third (34.5%) of the 2021-22 budgets of Welsh police forces come from the Home Office. Which means the rest was allocated by those holding purse strings here in Wales.  \nIn some parts of the country, more than half the funding police forces currently rely on was fixed by the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for that area as they set the budget. \nThey have a say in how much council tax we pay, because a chunk of it - the \"precept\" - goes to the police. In England that amount is capped but in Wales it's not. \nThis year, our council tax pays for 47% of the combined police budgets in Wales. \nThe rest - just under a fifth (18.6%) - comes from the Welsh government. \nIt's fair to say police are there to detect crime and catch criminals.  \nBut the bulk of 999 calls are nothing to do with a new crime.\nMany, at their heart, are related to mental health problems or missing, vulnerable people. While a crime may not have been committed, it's the police that are called to assist. \nThe decision on what to prioritise and how to work with organisations, like the NHS and local authority social services, comes down to the police and crime commissioner. \n\"They will listen to the concerns of the public and convey those to the chief Constable,\" said Allison Turner, a former police officer, now a lecturer at the University of South Wales.\n\"Together they'll create what's known as the police and crime plan. Within that there's a number of priorities for the local community.\"\nThe past 12 months have also shone a spotlight on the ways policing CAN be different here, as different approaches by the governments in Wales and England created different rules on either side of the border. \nSpeak to any prison governor and they'll tell you that a disproportionate number of offenders have a history of substance misuse or mental health problems.  \nWork to better understand adverse childhood experiences also shows they can be a factor in setting people on a criminal path.\nThe services that can help support people or steer them away from these negative influences are all funded by those we'll elect to the Senedd on 6 May. \nLikewise, additional projects receive funding from the police and crime commissioners.\nThe government in Westminster introduced them in 2012 to replace police authorities which were considered to be invisible. \nThe elected role - one for each of the four forces in Wales - was designed to make the force more accountable to the community.   \n\"They are a bridge between the public and the chief constable,\" said Allison Turner.\n\"They're responsible for the appointment and also the dismissal of the chief constable, and make sure the public is getting value for money.\n\"The commissioner will also scrutinise policing and ensure the chief constable is accountable for how they run their force. But the PCC is also accountable to us, as members of the public.\"\nWhether they represent a political party or are independent, all must swear an oath of impartiality when they take up office. \nBut this year's election comes at a pivotal moment. The pandemic meant officers were given powers to police areas of our lives that would have been unimaginable in 2019. \nAlso the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which is going through Parliament, could curtail the right to protest and it prompted violent clashes between protesters and police.  \nNewly-elected PCCs will be mindful of the potential attention required to a fragile relationship with their community."

      "text": "When Biju Mathew heard that India was going onto the UK's travel red list, he leapt into action.\n\"I couldn't afford to stay away,\" he says. \"I had to get back to work.\"\nThe social services manager from Walsall, UK, who was in India visiting family, began ringing local travel agents in an attempt to beat the Friday deadline.\nFrom Friday 04:00 BST, most travellers who have been to India in the last 10 days will be refused entry to the UK unless they hold UK passports or residence rights. Those that do will be required to quarantine in hotels on arrival, at significant cost and inconvenience.\n\"Eventually, yesterday, a friend in the UK managed to book me a ticket from Mumbai to Manchester,\" says Biju. He had just half an hour's notice to pack and go.\n\"I had to stop everything. I didn't get time to say a proper goodbye to my parents.\"\nIt also cost him close to \u00a32,000 for the flight and Covid tests required, when a flight from Mumbai is usually well under \u00a31,000.\nHe is one of the lucky ones. His flight touched down in Manchester at around 15:00 BST on Thursday to his great relief.\nKiran and Saumiya Philip travelled to Kerala in March to get married, but once the wedding was over, they realised India's Covid cases were rising rapidly and they started looking for earlier flights back.\n\"I've been trying to get back to the UK since 12 April but there aren't any tickets available,\" says Kiran. \"You get the odd one now and then, but the cost is upwards of \u00a31,200 to travel from Kochi one way.\"\nThe new restrictions are in response to the rapid spread of a new strain of coronavirus in India, which is overwhelming the country's medical services.\nKiran hopes because he's had the Pfizer vaccine as well as a bout of Covid, and plans to stick to all the testing and quarantine rules, he won't pose much of a threat when he does return.\nThe couple have flights booked for 14 May but in the meantime it's nothing like an extended honeymoon. He's working remotely, and there's a curfew at 19:00 local time. They're just waiting and worrying.\n\"I would like to get home ASAP just in case India goes into lockdown and all flights to the UK get cancelled. This has happened before,\" says Kiran.\nThey need to be back in the UK by early June at the latest to renew Saumiya's visa. And they'll have to dip into their savings, supposed to be for buying a house, to pay the \u00a35,000 cost of the flights and quarantine hotels.\n\"All my family and friends are saying 'try to get back as soon as you can',\" says Kiran.\nLike Kiran and Saumiya, Pritha Kejriwal and her son Tanish need to get back to the UK before the summer to renew their visas. They're both students and have been in Kolkata since November. \nPritha has been checking to make sure they will still be allowed to return and believes there is an exception for students studying in the UK, who should still be allowed to return despite the ban on most non-UK residents.\n\"My family were worried and wanted us to come back,\" she says. \"We were just waiting for the right time.\n\"We were looking at flights before 23 April. There were only one or two options, which were extraordinarily expensive. \n\"My son has exams starting 6 May. He was planning to get back in time for group work. If he doesn't get back, I'm sure he could work online, but it's demoralising and he's uncertain.\"\nThe uncertainty is also what is bothering Vick Busa.\nHe, his wife, and young daughter went to India in January when his father-in-law fell seriously ill with Covid. They managed to see him before he passed away and stayed to sort out his affairs.\nVick, an accountant, and his wife, who works in real estate, have been able to work remotely, although with a four-and-half-hour time difference it isn't ideal. Now, though, they want to get back home to Essex.\nThey're UK citizens so they will be allowed back into the country, but Vick is concerned it could be months before India is taken off the red list, meaning the inconvenience and expense of hotel quarantine are unavoidable.\nHe did try amongst the \"panic\" to book flights before the deadline but has settled for travelling on 4 May.\nIn the meantime, they are taking their responsibility to not bring back the Indian strain of the virus very seriously. They only go out when it is essential. And they'll be particularly careful at the airport, he says.\nThere's also the worry that their flight could be cancelled or delayed. He's holding off booking the quarantine hotel for now.\n\"It's a double risk,\" he says. \"If I book the quarantine hotel and my flight is cancelled, changing it will incur extra costs. \n\"I may incur a penalty, if I fly without it.\" Even without the extra charges the cost of quarantine is unreasonably high, he argues, at \u00a32,400 for the family.\nAll of this means \"there's a lot of ambiguity\" to deal with still. He says he won't feel sure that they're really on their way until they finally board the flight at Delhi airport.\n\"We cant be like this for too long,\" he says."

For the men and women involved it marked the end of a long legal battle which took them \"to hell and back\".\n\"The first thing I did was cry,\" says David Blakey, from Cleethorpes, after hearing his conviction had been overturned at the Royal Courts of Justice.\n\"I am ecstatic at the result, it's just pure joy,\" he says.\nThe former postmaster was convicted of theft and false accounting in 2004, one of 39 branded criminals after the Post Office installed a flawed computer system in branches.\nHe lost his job, his home and his pension as a result.\nIt has taken so long to finally clear the group's names that Mr Blakey says the result \"hasn't really sunk in yet\" but \"it means everything\".\nHis sense of delight is shared by Tom Hedges, from Skegness, who received a seven-month suspended sentence for theft and false accounting in 2001.\nOpening a bottle of fizz outside the court, he says: \"It's a wonderful afternoon.\n\"When I told my mother, who's 93, I was coming to court she said: 'Get yourself down to Aldi and get some prosecco'.\"\nMr Hedges says he went to \"hell and back\" as the group \"fought and fought\" to clear their names.\nHe is critical of the Post Office describing its behaviour throughout as \"totally despicable the entire time\".\n\"It has lifted my soul and I feel wonderful,\" he says of the court ruling.\nAlison Hall, from Liversedge, West Yorkshire, says it has been a \"hard 11 years\" since proceedings were first launched against her.\nShe eventually agreed to plead guilty to false accounting so a theft charge would be dropped, and was sentenced to community service.\n\"I never said a word, I was too embarrassed,\" she says.\nMs Hall is delighted her conviction was quashed but still wants an apology for her ordeal.\n\"Nobody from the Post Office has ever come and apologised to me,\" she says. \"There should be a public inquiry. People need to find out what happened and what they did to us all.\"\nThe prosecutions by the Post Office had a huge impact on the lives of those targeted - some were imprisoned, some lost their homes and some struggled to find new work.\nChairman Tim Parker has said the company is \"extremely sorry\" to those affected and their families, blaming \"historical failures\".\nNeil Hudgell, the solicitor who represented 29 of the postmasters, says his clients were \"honest, hard-working people\" whose reputations and livelihoods had been \"so unfairly destroyed\".\nMr Blakey says he was lucky to have the support of his family and friends.\n\"Everyone believed in me, everybody trusted me. There are people out there who have lost so much more than I have and I have lost a lot.\"\nHe believes he and his wife lost about \u00a3400,000 - including their post office business, which they had bought, and their home when they had to declare bankruptcy.\n\"We're living in a council house now, we are paying rent every month. I am living on a state pension because I lost my job so I was unable to pay into my private pension,\" he says.\nJanet Skinner, from Hull, was imprisoned for nine months in 2007 for false accounting, and says having a conviction hampered her employment opportunities. \n\"People look at you and always look down on you,\" she says.\nBut, having at last cleared her name, she says justice has finally been served.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

      "tags": "Caitlyn Jenner,California",
      "text": "Caitlyn Jenner has announced she has filed the paperwork to run for California governor. \nThe former Olympic athlete and reality TV star will run as a Republican in the Democratic stronghold state. \nA recall election in the state could be confirmed this month after a petition against current governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, reached the number required to trigger a vote. \nVoters would be asked if they want Mr Newsom to stay or another candidate. \nAccording to the Axios news site, Ms Jenner has put together a team that includes some of former President Donald Trump's advisers. \n\"Californians want better and deserve better from the governor,\" a statement from Ms Jenner said, confirming the news on her Twitter account on Friday. \n\"For too long, career politicians have over-promised and under-delivered. We need a leader with the vision and resolve to see it through,\" she added. \nMs Jenner promised that her campaign will be one of \"solutions\" and provide a \"roadmap back to prosperity to turn this state around\". \nShe added that she will formally launch her campaign at a later date. \nShould the recall election go ahead, it would be the fourth governor recall in US history. \nMr Newsom has faced criticism for his handling of the pandemic. As infections started to fall, he came under criticism from business owners for still enforcing restrictions. \nMs Jenner described herself as a \"proven winner\" in her statement, adding that she is the \"only outsider who can put an end to Gavin Newsom's disastrous time as a governor\". \nCaitlyn Jenner has been described as the highest-profile American to come out as transgender. \nShe announced she was transgender in 2015 in an interview with broadcaster Diane Sawyer on ABC, and said the star said she had been wrestling with her gender since childhood. \nThe former athlete won a gold medal at the Montreal Games in 1976. \nBefore transitioning, she was married to Kris Jenner and the pair had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie. The family were stars of the hit reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians. \nCaitlyn Jenner said her step-daughter Kim Kardashian had been a big supporter of her transitioning. \nCalifornia is not a stranger to celebrities running for governor.\nArnold Schwarzenegger won the 2003 recall election, beating adult film star Mary Carey and former child actor Gary Coleman. \nSeen as the Republicans' new poster boy at the time, Schwarzenegger was tipped as a possible future president but his Austrian birthplace was a barrier, as the constitution states that candidates must be US-born. \nHe stepped down in 2011, after seven years in office. Since then, California's governorship has been held exclusively by Democrats. \nIn 1966, former actor Ronald Reagan won the governorship of California and he won re-election four years later. Prior to going into politics, he had appeared in more than 50 films, eventually becoming president of the Screen Actors Guild. \nBut his biggest role was yet to come. In 1980, he was elected US president, serving two four-year terms. \nIf she won, Ms Jenner would be one of a small group of transgender Americans to hold such a high-profile role. \nShe told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Show in 2017 that she was considering entering US politics to promote LGBT issues. \nLast year Sarah McBride became the first transgender state senator in the US after she won her race in Delaware during the 2020 elections. And she was not the only transgender candidate to make history during last year's election. \nVermont's Taylor Small, 26, was elected to the House of Representatives, while, in Kansas. Stephanie Byers became the first trans person of colour to be elected to a state legislature.\nThe last time California had a recall election for governor, it ended with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger in the state's top office. Caitlyn Jenner seems to be hoping that history repeats itself 18 years after the Terminator's political success.\nThe California recall process - which sets up a two-part vote to remove the incumbent, then, if successful, selects a replacement from an open field of candidates - lends itself to upstart celebrity contenders who can stand out in a crowd. That is certainly true of both Schwarzenegger and Jenner, whose reality television stardom and personal history makes her unique.\nIt won't be an easy path, however. Unlike Governor Gray Davis in 2003, incumbent Gavin Newsom won his first election in a landslide. He is building a sizable campaign war chest, has higher levels of popularity and is running at a time when California is much more liberal than it was two decades ago.\nNewsom's handling of the coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on his standing, but he's still in better shape than the hapless Davis ever was - and the outlook for the state is improving. If California voters don't opt to kick Newsom out, Jenner's political hopes will fizzle before they really begin. "

the same as that proposed in England.\nOpposition parties accused Mr Drakeford, the leader of Welsh Labour, of electioneering by changing Covid rules during the Welsh Parliament election campaign.\nMr Drakeford disagreed, saying the move was only because Wales' Covid case rate had fallen to the UK's lowest.\n\"The virus doesn't know there is an election on, and I don't think it would have been right not to have given those indications,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\nThe latest restriction easing comes after previous announcements that any six people can meet outdoors in Wales from Saturday, and dates for gyms and swimming pools being moved forward by two weeks to 3 May.\nMr Drakeford has also confirmed outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants, will be allowed to reopen on Monday - alongside outdoor attractions, organised outdoor activities and wedding receptions or funeral services for up to 30 people outdoors. \nTwo people will also be allowed to visit their loved ones in care homes from Monday.\nGyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can also reopen from 3 May, while people can once again form extended households, allowing two households to bubble up and have contact indoors.\nBy the time indoor hospitality reopens on 17 May, Mr Drakeford anticipates being able to increase the number of people who can attend organised activities, such as wedding receptions, to 30 indoors and 50 outdoors, from the same date.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nPeople in Wales haven't been allowed to buy an alcoholic drink inside a pub or restaurant in Wales since 4 December.\nSo allowing people to do so from 17 May would be similar to the plan in England and Scotland - with up to four people from up to four different households in Wales allowed to meet.\nAlthough, Scotland will be the first in the UK to open its cafes, pubs and restaurants indoors from Monday - but no alcohol can be served. \nPeople in England can already visit the pub or have a meal in a restaurant outside - that could extend to inside from 17 May.\nPubs, bars, cafes and restaurants can welcome customers outdoors in Northern Ireland from 30 April, with restrictions, while people may be allowed to socialise inside from 24 May at the earliest, depending on Covid case rates.\nIt has been a long time coming for Treorchy cafe owner Sara Bailey.\nHot Gossip, like so many other catering businesses in Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been shut for four months.\n\"It seems that things are going well at the moment with Covid cases, so it is time to give us a date to reopen,\" she said. \nFor restaurateur Nataniel Martinez, who runs Le Monde in Cardiff and Penarth's Old Customs House, reopening is a large-scale operation.\n\"The opening of indoor hospitality for us means we can bring back about 120 staff into work,\" he said.\n\"The demand for indoor dining is massive, so we are really looking forward now to getting back to it and reopening all the restaurants.\"\nRhian Davies, owner of the Crown and Sceptre pub\u00a0in Cadoxton in Neath Port Talbot, said there was a \"lot of preparation to do\" before reopening - but added the industry was used to it after months of safety measures last year.\nShe said she accepted closures had been needed: \"I wanted to help the hard working staff of our hospitals and health service... and was happy to do my bit to stop Covid spreading.\"\nThe announcement has been warmly welcomed by UKHospitality, the trade body representing the hospitality sector in Wales.\n\"We have led the calls for earlier reopening and have been advising, consulting and negotiating on the need to help protect jobs and businesses - and the public,\" said Dave Chapman, its director for Wales.\nHe said the announcement \"offers clarity and commercial hope, and reflects positively the medical evidence\".\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK when the Welsh government banned sale of alcohol on the premises of pubs and restaurants on 4 December.\nThen came the pre-Christmas lockdown, shutting all restaurants, pubs and shops, as Wales reported more than 3,000 Covid cases in a day and that the Welsh NHS was struggling to cope. \nNow, Wales has the lowest Covid case rate in the UK - around 15 cases per 100,000 people - with, compared to other UK nations, the highest percentage of its population vaccinated. The number of Covid patients in hospitals in Wales has also dropped to its lowest level.\nWhile there now appears to be a broad consensus on hospitality restrictions, both the Tories and Plaid Cymru have said Mr Drakeford should not be using the televised address for announcements easing restrictions.\nThe Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh Labour leader of \"naked electioneering\" while Plaid Cymru said it was \"completely inappropriate\" for the press conference to be used like this. \nPlaid leader Adam Price, said: \"A Plaid Cymru government would plan for the reopening of indoor hospitality, tourist accommodation, cinemas and other entertainment venues on 17 May. \n\"To put businesses on the best possible footing our first steps in office include providing start up grants for hospitality businesses.\n\"Additional financial support would also be backdated to 26 April for those businesses that cannot viably trade on the basis of outdoor opening alone.\"\nWelcoming the announcement Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said it was \"great news\".\nShe said: \"As a nation we must all work together to ensure the vaccination programme continues and that the lockdowns and closures we've been through never need to return.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said:  \"Labour had ample opportunity to bring forward a roadmap out of lockdown, but refused to do so. \n\"Thanks to the UK's great vaccination story much more detail could have been announced prior to the election period... but Labour chose to play politics instead of adopting the Welsh Conservative roadmap.\"\nMark Reckless, from the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, said: \"This is getting to the point of testing election rules to breaking point. \n\"The Labour leader is using his platform as first minister to make political announcements during an election campaign.\"\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. "

      "text": "At least 13 patients have died after a fire broke out in the intensive care unit of an Indian hospital treating Covid patients near Mumbai.\nThe blaze, which took place early on Friday, was extinguished and four survivors have been moved to nearby hospitals, said authorities.\nThe incident comes amid a deadly second wave of infections in India.\nThe spike has overwhelmed hospitals, creating a critical shortage of oxygen, intensive care beds and ventilators.\nOn Friday India recorded 332,730 coronavirus cases, the highest one-day tally anywhere in the world for the second day in a row. Daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by a record 2,263 in the previous 24 hours.\nThe fire happened at the Vijay Vallabh hospital in the Virar area of the western state of Maharashtra, which is about 70km (43 miles) north of Mumbai. \nIt remains unclear how the blaze started, and Maharashtra's chief minister has ordered an inquiry.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has offered condolences on Twitter calling the incident \"tragic\".\nThe rising number of cases has resulted in a deepening healthcare crisis that has gripped several states. Mr Modi is due to hold meetings with chief ministers of the most affected states and oxygen manufacturers on Friday.\nIndia's top court has asked the central government for a national plan by Friday, on bolstering supply, oxygen, medicine, treatment and vaccines.\nThe Supreme Court called the situation a \"national health emergency\" - six high courts across the country are hearing petitions involving medical shortages.\nMaharashtra is the worst hit state in the country in terms of cases and faces an oxygen shortfall. \nTwo days earlier, 24 Covid patients died in another part of Maharashtra after they lost oxygen flow to their ventilators. A leak interrupted supply as a storage tank was being refilled at the Zakir Hussain hospital in Nashik city.  \nIn recent days, several other hospitals in Delhi said they had either run out of oxygen or supplies were dwindling rapidly.\nA number of people have died while waiting for oxygen, and the majority of intensive care beds in Delhi hospitals are full.\nMax Healthcare, which runs 10 private hospitals in the Delhi area, said it had waited more than seven hours for oxygen supplies at two facilities. \nThree other Indian states - Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana - are also facing a critical shortage of oxygen, while others are seeing depleting supplies.\nMedical-grade oxygen is purified and compressed until it is liquid and then delivered to hospital in tankers. The oxygen is then pumped around the hospital in pipes to assist patients whose blood oxygen levels are low. \nMeanwhile a travel ban has taken effect in the UK for visitors from India. British and Irish citizens will still be allowed entry but will have to stay in a government appointed quarantine hotel for 10 days.\nCanada and the United Arab Emirates have suspended passenger flights for 30 days and Singapore has tightened restrictions on travellers from India.  \n Are you affected by Covid-19 in India?

      "title": "Covid-19: How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave",
      "tags": "Asia,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "In early March, India's health minister Harsh Vardhan declared the country was \"in the endgame\" of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMr Vardhan also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership as an \"example to the world in international co-operation\". From January onwards, India had begun shipping doses to foreign countries as part of its much-vaunted \"vaccine diplomacy\".\nMr Vardhan's unbridled optimism was based on a sharp drop in reported infections. Since a peak of more than 93,000 cases per day on average in mid-September, infections had steadily declined. By mid-February, India was counting an average of 11,000 cases a day. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from the disease had slid to below 100.  \nThe euphoria at beating the virus had been building since late last year. Politicians, policy makers and parts of the media believed that India was truly out of the woods. In December, central bank officials announced that India was \"bending the Covid infection curve\". There was evidence, they said, in poetic terms, that the economy was \"breaking out amidst winter's lengthening shadows towards a place in sunlight\". Mr Modi was called a \"vaccine guru\".\nAt the end of February, India's election authorities announced key elections in five states where 186 million people were eligible to vote for 824 seats. Beginning 27 March, the polls would stretch over a month, and in the case of the state of West Bengal, be held in eight phases. Campaigning had begun in full swing, with no safety protocols and social distancing. In mid-March, the cricket board allowed more than 130,000 fans, mostly unmasked, to watch two international cricket games between India and England at the Narendra Modi stadium in Gujarat.\nIn less than a month, things began to unravel. India was in the grips of a devastating second wave of the virus and cities were facing fresh lockdowns. By mid-April, the country was averaging more than 100,000 cases a day. On Sunday, India recorded more than 270,000 cases and over 1,600 deaths, both new single-day records. If the runway infection was not checked, India could be recording more than 2,300 deaths every day by first week of June, according to a report by The Lancet Covid-19 Commission. \nIndia is in now in the grips of a public health emergency. Social media feeds are full with videos of Covid funerals at crowded cemeteries, wailing relatives of the dead outside hospitals, long queues of ambulances carrying gasping patients, mortuaries overflowing with the dead, and patients, sometimes two to a bed, in corridors and lobbies of hospitals. There are frantic calls for help for beds, medicines, oxygen, essential drugs and tests. Drugs are being sold on the black market, and test results are taking days. \"They didn't tell me for three hours that my child is dead,\" a dazed mother says in one video, sitting outside an ICU. Wails of another person outside the intensive care punctuate the silences.  \nEven India's mammoth vaccination effort was now struggling. In the beginning, the rollout had been embroiled in a controversy over the efficacy over a home-grown candidate. Even as the country ramped up the drive and administered more than 100 million doses by last week, vaccine shortages were being reported. Serum Institute of India, the country's - and the world's - biggest vaccine maker said it would not be able to ramp up supplies before June because it didn't have enough money to expand capacity. India placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, because the doses were needed urgently at home, and allowed imports of foreign vaccines. Even oxygen was likely to be imported now to meet the surge in demand. \nMeanwhile, almost in a parallel universe, away from the death and despair, the world's richest cricket tournament was being played behind closed doors every evening, and tens of thousands of people were following their leaders to election rallies and attending the Hindu festival of Kumbh Mela. \"It is beyond surreal, what is happening,\" Shiv Visvanathan, a sociology professor, told me. \nExperts believe the government appears to have completely dropped the ball on the second wave of infections that was about to hit India. \nIn mid-February, Tabassum Barnagarwala, a journalist with the Indian Express newspaper, flagged a seven-fold rise in new cases in parts of Maharashtra and reported that samples from the infected had been sent for genome sequencing to look for imported variants.\nBy the end of the month, the BBC reported the surge and asked whether India was facing a new Covid wave. \"We really don't know what the cause of the surge is. What is worrying is that entire families are getting infected. This is a completely new trend,\" Dr Shyamsunder Nikam, civil surgeon of an affected district in Maharashtra, said at the time. \nExperts now say that crowing about India's exceptionalism in \"beating\" the epidemic - younger population, native immunity, a largely rural population - and declaring victory on the virus turned out to be cruelly premature. \"As is typical in India, official arrogance, hyper-nationalism, populism and an ample dose of bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis,\" said Mihir Sharma, a columnist for Bloomberg.\nIndia's second wave was fuelled by people letting their guard down, attending weddings and social gatherings, and by mixed messaging from the government, allowing political rallies and religious gatherings. With infections declining, fewer people were taking the jabs, slowing down the vaccination drive, which had aimed to inoculate 250 million people by the end of July. In mid-February, Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan, tweeted that India needed to \"accelerate the vaccination drive while the case counts are low\". Nobody quite took notice.\n\"There was a feeling of triumphalism,\" said K Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India. \"Some felt we had achieved herd immunity. Everyone wanted to get back to work. This narrative fell on many receptive ears, and the few voices of caution were not heeded to,\" he said.\nA second wave may have been inevitable, but India could have \"postponed or delayed it and lessened its impact,\" said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology. Like many other countries, India should have begun careful genomic surveillance in January to detect variants, Mr Menon said. Some of these variants could be driving the surge. \"We learnt of new variants in February from reports from Maharashtra. This was initially denied by authorities,\" Mr Menon added. \"This was a significant turning point.\"\nWhat are the lessons of this public health crisis? For one, India should learn not to declare victory over the virus prematurely, and it should put a lid on triumphalism. People should also learn to adapt to short, local lockdowns in the event of the inevitable future spikes of infection. Most epidemiologists predict more waves, given that India is evidently still far away from reaching herd immunity and its vaccination rate remains slow. \n\"We cant freeze human life,\" Professor Reddy said. \"If we can't physically distance in the crowded cities, we can at least make sure everyone wears a proper mask. And wear it properly. That's not a big ask.\""

      "text": " Indonesian rescue teams are fearing the worst as oxygen supplies on a missing Indonesian naval submarine are thought to have run out.\nThere are fears the vessel carrying 53 crew may already have sunk to a depth where it might have been crushed. \nThe KRI Nanggala 402 disappeared on Wednesday during exercises off the coast of Bali, sparking a frantic search to locate the stricken vessel.\nAustralia, India, Malaysia and Singapore have so far sent assistance.\nAnd a US Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft landed in Bali early on Saturday morning.\n\"Indonesia is a good friend and strategic partner. We were all deeply saddened to see the reports about their submarine and our thoughts and our prayers are with the Indonesian sailors, the Indonesian navy, and of course all their families,\" said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby.\nAn oil slick where it was thought to have submerged suggested damage to a fuel tank may have been a factor.\nThe Indonesian military said late on Thursday night that it had detected signs of an object at a depth of between 50 and 100 metres (165 to 330 feet), and had deployed ships with sonar-tracking equipment in the hope it was the KRI Nanggala 402.\nA military spokesman said the submarine would only have enough oxygen to last until around 03:00 local time on Saturday (21:00 GMT on Friday). That deadline has now passed. \nAt least six warships, a helicopter and 400 people have since been involved in the search. Singapore and Malaysia have dispatched ships to the area, and Australia, France and Germany have also offered assistance.\nThe KRI Nanggala 402 lost contact shortly after requesting permission to dive during live torpedo exercises early on Wednesday morning. The German-built vessel is one of five submarines operated by Indonesia. It was made in the late 1970s, and underwent a two-year refit in South Korea that was completed in 2012.\nA navy spokesman told the BBC the incident was the first time Indonesia had lost one of its submarines. But similar incidents have happened elsewhere. \nIn 2000, the Kursk, a Russian navy sub, sank during manoeuvres in the Barents Sea with the loss of all 118 crew. An inquiry found that one torpedo had exploded, detonating all the others. Most of the Kursk's crew died instantly but some survived for several days before suffocating.\nIn 2003, 70 Chinese naval officers and crew were killed in an accident on a Ming-class submarine during exercises. \nAnd in 2017, an Argentine military submarine went missing in the southern Atlantic with 44 crew on board. Its wreck was located a year later and officials said the submarine had imploded."

      "tags": "France",
      "text": "A female police employee has been killed in a knife attack at a police station south-west of Paris.\nAnti-terror prosecutors have taken over the inquiry, and the killing is being treated as a possible terrorist attack.\nThe attacker, who reportedly came to France from Tunisia several years ago, was shot dead by police. \nPresident Emmanuel Macron led tributes to the 49-year-old victim, and said France would never give in to \"Islamist terrorism\".\nThe stabbing took place in the secure entrance to the police station in the commuter town of Rambouillet at 14:20 (12:20 GMT).\nWitnesses said the attacker had been seen walking around while on his mobile phone outside the police station and seized his chance to go in as the woman - an unarmed administrative officer - went through the security doors.\nHe reportedly lunged at the officer, stabbing her in the neck. Her colleagues then opened fire on him. \nAnti-terrorism prosecutors said they took over the investigation because of the way the attack had unfolded, remarks made by the attacker and the fact that he targeted a police official. \nSources close to the inquiry told media outlets that the man had shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is greatest) during the attack. \nOfficials said the attacker, 36, was not previously known to security agencies. Local outlet BFMTV reported that he had lived in the country illegally before obtaining a residency card, which was due to expire later this year.\nThree people were arrested following the attack, according to reports. A judicial source told AFP news agency they were part of the suspect's \"entourage\". \nIn a Twitter post following the attack, Mr Macron said the victim's name was St\u00e9phanie. \"The nation is by the side of her family, her colleagues and security forces,\" he wrote. \nHer full name has not been released, but local media reports describe her as a mother of two. \nPrime Minister Jean Castex and Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin went straight to the scene, in the large Yvelines area to the west of the capital.\nMr Castex said the country had lost an \"everyday heroine\" and condemned what he described as a \"barbaric act of boundless cruelty\".\n\"Our determination to combat terrorism in all its forms is as resolute as ever,\" he told reporters.\nVal\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, president of the Paris region, said the attack had been against a \"symbol of France\". The police, she said, were \"the face of France\".\nFar-right leader Marine Le Pen - seen as the strongest challenger to Mr Macron in next year's presidential election - tweeted condemnation of Friday's attack before details of the suspect's identity had been made public. \n\"The same horrors come one after another, the same infinite sadness as we think about the relatives and the colleagues of this female police employee who has been killed, the same type of person guilty of this barbarity, the same Islamist motives,\" she wrote.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also reacted to the attack on Twitter. \n\"We stand with our French friends and allies following tragic news of a female police officer killed by a terrorist in Rambouillet while doing her job,\" he wrote. \nIn his comments on Friday, Mr Castex noted that the Yvelines area had been targeted before, including in 2016 when two members of the police force were fatally stabbed at their home. \nIn October 2020 the militant Islamist murder of teacher Samuel Paty in Yvelines led to national outrage, as he was attacked after an online campaign that began with false claims from a 13-year-old girl at his school.\nDeadly attacks on French police\nJanuary 2015: Two police officers were among those killed in the attack at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A third was killed in a related attack the following day.\nJune 2016: A police commander and his partner, also a police official, were stabbed to death at their home west of Paris by a man claiming allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group. The attacker was killed in a police assault on the house.\nApril 2017: A French policeman was killed by a jihadist on the Champs Elys\u00e9es in Paris. Two other officers were wounded in the attack. The suspect was shot dead by security forces, and a note defending IS was found near his body.\nMarch 2018: A gunman who pledged allegiance to IS militants launched a series of attacks in southern France, killing four people including a policeman who traded places with a captive. He also opened fire on a group of police officers out jogging, wounding one. The suspect was shot dead by police. \nOctober 2019: A police computer operator stabbed four of his colleagues to death at the Paris police headquarters, before being shot dead. Anti-terror prosecutors said he adhered to a radical version of Islam.."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nTravel to the UK from India is effectively banned from today, as the coronavirus-ravaged country is moved on to the \"red list\". While UK and Irish nationals will still be allowed entry, they must quarantine in a government-approved hotel. People have been telling us of the scramble to get back from India, which has seen infections soaring, a rapidly rising death toll and the discovery of a new virus variant.\nThe chances of becoming infected by Covid fell 65% after a first dose of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines, including in the over-75s and those with underlying health conditions, according to a UK study. The Office for National Statistics and Oxford University research also found a strong antibody response in all age groups from both jabs. The research, taken from two studies which are yet to be peer-reviewed or published, is based on virus tests from 370,000 people.\nUK public sector borrowing reached \u00a3303.1bn in the year to March, the highest level since the end of World War Two, according to the Office for National Statistics. It says the pandemic \"has had a substantial impact on the economy and subsequently on public sector borrowing and debt\", with both tax receipts and National Insurance contributions tumbling.\nResearchers at the University of Glasgow have identified two separate cases where humans are thought to have passed Covid-19 to their cats. One of the cases, found as part of a screening programme of the UK's feline population, displayed mild symptoms but the other had to be put down. Scientists now want to improve understanding of whether pets can play a role in infecting humans.\nWith driving tests suspended since January, it's been a frustrating time for learners. But Jack Croucher, 22, can finally experience the open road alone, having passed his test with just three days' notice to prepare. \"I was really nervous but once I got into the flow of it, it went really easy and I enjoyed it,\" he tells Newsbeat's Annabel Rackham, who's been hearing from newly qualified drivers. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nLockdown rules are eased in Northern Ireland today.

      "text": "The NI Executive will \"keep looking\" to see if Covid restrictions can be eased faster, First Minister Arlene Foster has said. \nBut she added the effect of restrictions due to be eased will need to be monitored. \nFrom Friday, close contact services such as hairdressers are to reopen and driving tests will resume.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the issue will be kept under review.\nMrs Foster and Ms O'Neill were speaking together at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena in Cookstown on Thursday.\nCompetitive outdoor sport organised by a club or individuals can also resume without spectators and with no more than 100 people participating from Friday.\n\"Most people in Northern Ireland have been very careful,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"They recognise what has been happening throughout this pandemic and I think they know that we have to take things in stages, but they do need hope. And of course we'll keep looking to see if we can move faster.\"\nBut she added transmission rates across Northern Ireland had to be monitored. \nMs O'Neill said there needs to be a \"cautious, steady as you go\" approach. \n\"I think there are better days ahead but we just need people to be careful and cautious,\" she said. \n\"We've always said we'll keep things under review and as soon as we can lift things we will and that remains the case. \nA day before some sectors re-open and the weather is reflecting the public's mood. \nBut while we are upbeat, even excited, health officials are appealing for caution.  \nAs Arlene Foster advised this day last week - \"step out but step out carefully\". \nCoronavirus is still out there and wants to meddle.  The vaccine doesn't mean normality - just yet. \nIn fact two patients who have been vaccinated are in ICU with symptoms.  One has had one jab, the other their second dose. \nI understand that at least one of them has underlying health conditions and clinicians believe the vaccine has prevented their condition from deteriorating.  \nAnd it's worth noting, that that is just two patients out of the nearly 900,000 people who have had one dose of the vaccine and the more than 300,000 who have had both - so it is working.\nAs shutters are pulled up in communities, inside hospitals and heads are down preparing for a possible fourth wave in the autumn. \nLaboratories are at the ready, braced for screening a continuing increase in Covid cases - alarm bells will ring if the Indian or potentially other variants are detected.  \nBut on top of that hospitals are also preparing for a resurgence of flu. \nDoctors reckon we are in for a \"bad flu season.\"  A double whammy where flu and Covid patients could be sitting side by side.  \nCan we prevent flu and Covid-19 from taking hold? Probably not, but continuing to socially distance, wear masks and wash hands and getting vaccinated can determine just how severe outcomes might be. \n\nThe current Reproduction (R) number in Northern Ireland, which measures how quickly the virus is spreading, is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.05, down from 0.95-1.4 the previous week.\nBut the average daily number of new cases being confirmed has risen slightly.\nThe seven-day rolling average of new positive cases is 41 per 100,000 people, up from 38 the previous week.  \nThe report says the \"modest increase\" is particularly in the 0-11 age group, and appears to be stabilising.  \nIt adds that it may be partly due to the return of school and the rollout of testing for close contacts.  \nEarlier, Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said the easing of lockdown restrictions in NI and the Republic of Ireland will not be perfectly aligned. \nThe Irish government is not due to announce relaxations until next month.\nMr Martin told NI business leaders he was in regular contact with Stormont's first and deputy ministers about the pace of reopening.\n\"We keep each other informed,\" he said. \n\"But I don't see perfect alignment or anything in the next number of weeks. There will be some gaps.\"\nHe said this was primarily down to the differences in the speed of vaccination programmes in the two jurisdictions.\n\"We are moving at pace now, and hopefully both north and south can look forward to reopening in a cautious and phased way with restrictions, so long as numbers remain as they are now,\" he added. \nOutdoor visitor attractions in Northern Ireland will also be able to open their doors on Friday for the first time since lockdown was imposed after Christmas. \nStormont ministers agreed to the reopening dates earlier this month. \nOutdoor hospitality businesses and non-essential retail can open on 30 April. \nThe Northern Ireland Prison Service announced on Thursday that in-person visits will re-commence from 4 May. In-person visits have been suspended since just after Christmas. \n\"We will of course remain vigilant to the risk of the virus and this decision will be kept under review,\" said Northern Ireland Prison Service director general Ronnie Armour.\n\"However, I know this decision will be welcome news to the people in our care and their families.\"   \nMeanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann said there were still difficulties in getting information about flight passengers who are crossing the border into Northern Ireland.\nHe said he was still concerned that his department was not getting full data from Passenger Locator Forms completed in the Republic of Ireland.  \n\"Progress has been made, but there is still difficulties in regards to data sharing processes is what I think the minister of foreign affairs referred to recently in a joint meeting with the secretary of state,\" the minister told the health committee.  \n\"One of our protections actually is the small number of indirect or direct international flights that we're currently having to manage, so that is keeping us in a pretty secure place in regards to that.\"\nMrs Foster expressed frustration at the delay, and also revealed that Mr Swann only found out that the so-called Indian variant of the virus was in the Republic of Ireland from media reports.

      "text": "A woman has called for a traffic light system to be introduced which displays how environmentally-friendly products are.\nLisa Condron wants everyday products to feature a red, amber or green colour, indicating its environmental harm.\nThis would better educate people about their impact on the planet, she said.\nLisa, from Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said: \"I hear a lot of talk about it, but don't actually see anything happening.\"\nLockdown prompted Lisa to begin thinking about the impact she had on the planet.\nShe later discovered none of her clothes were made in the UK - which led her to wonder how much CO2 was emitted transporting them from east Asia to Wales.\nHad all these items featured traffic light-style warnings - similar to the ones on food products which indicate their levels of fat, sugar and salt - she said she would have been able to make more educated decisions.\nAsked what she would if she was leader of Wales for a day, she said: \"I think it's time that we made some action on climate change and our environment.\n\"So my idea was to have a traffic light system as you do on food. Everyone's familiar with them because they've been on food for years now.\n\"We can see from the traffic light system the impact of fats, sugars and saturates and salt.\n\"If this was on all sorts of products that you buy, you would know whether one product was better for the environment than another.\n\"I just want to switch over to being more environmentally friendly. But I don't know what is environmentally friendly and what is not.\n\"So I just thought of a traffic light system - where if there's a range of products on the shelves and I can see them. \n\"(If) one was red for the environment and the other one was green then I would go for the green.\"\nIn 2019, the Welsh government declared a climate change emergency.\nSpeaking at the time, Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths said she hoped the declaration would trigger \"a wave of action\" as she declared an intention to achieve a \"carbon neutral public sector by 2030\".\nLike the rest of the UK - Wales aims to become totally carbon neutral by 2050.\nLast month, the Senedd approved the goal and set a number of interim targets which include a commitment to reduce net emissions by:\nShould Wales adopt the measure, Lisa believes it can \"really lead in green manufacturing\".\n\"My message to the politicians will be: Please can we stop talking and start doing something.\"\nLisa believes that setting up the system would be good \"for Wales, for the economy and for everybody that lives here\".\nRichard Walker, managing director of Iceland, which has its head offices in Deeside, Flintshire, said he \"loved the idea\", but warned it needed to be \"clear and simple\" for shoppers.\n\"It needs to be easier for consumers to navigate how environmentally-friendly or unfriendly products are,\" he added.\n\"The problem comes from the already complicated labelling. We already have to put high fat, salt and sugar labelling on.\n\"People are calling for a carbon tax (too). So whatever we need to do needs to be clear and simple.\""

      "text": "Researchers are calling for people struggling to regain their sense of smell after falling ill with Covid-19 to undergo \"smell training\" rather than being treated with steroids.\nThis is a process that involves sniffing different odours over a period of months to retrain the brain to recognise different smells.\nA group of international experts say smell training is cheap and simple.\nAnd unlike steroids, it is free from potential side effects. \nA loss of smell is one of the main symptoms of a coronavirus infection, along with a fever and a persistent cough.\nIn most cases, loss of smell will return relatively quickly after the illness has passed.\nBut around one in five people report they are still having problems eight weeks after falling ill. \nOne treatment that has been prescribed by doctors is a course of drugs known as corticosteroids, which lower inflammation in the body and are already used to treat conditions such as asthma.\nBut Prof Carl Philpott, from the University of East Anglia's Norwich Medical School, who was part of the team reviewing current evidence, said there was very little to suggest that corticosteroids would help with smell loss. \n\"And because they have well-known potential adverse side effects, our advice is that they should not be prescribed as a treatment for post-viral smell loss,\" he said.\n\"Luckily most people who experience smell loss as a result of Covid-19 will regain their sense of smell spontaneously.\" \nThe steroids' side effects include fluid retention, high blood pressure, and problems with mood swings and behaviour. \nInstead, in a paper published in the journal International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, the researchers suggest \"smell training\". \nThis involves sniffing four things that have a distinctive, easily identifiable and familiar smell - for example, oranges, mint, garlic or coffee - twice a day for several months. \nProf Philpott said research shows that 90% of people fully recover their sense of smell after six months.\nIf it doesn't return, he says \"smell training\" helps to retrain the brain's smell pathways to recognise different odours. \n\"It aims to help recovery based on neuroplasticity - the brain's ability to reorganise itself to compensate for a change or injury,\" he said."

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Post Office Ltd,Post offices",
      "text": "The convictions of dozens of former sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have been overturned after the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.\nIt marks the latest stage of a computer scandal, and a long and complex legal battle, which could leave the Post Office and government with a huge compensation bill.\nBetween 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - based on information from a recently installed computer system called Horizon. \nSome went to prison following convictions for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined and have described being shunned by their communities. Some have since died.\nAfter 20 years, campaigners won a legal battle to have their cases reconsidered, after claiming that the computer system was flawed.\nHorizon was introduced into the Post Office network from 1999. The system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was used for tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking.\nSub-postmasters complained about bugs in the system after it reported shortfalls, some of which amounted to many thousands of pounds.\nSome sub-postmasters attempted to plug the gap with their own money, even remortgaging their homes, in an (often fruitless) attempt to correct an error.\nMany former postmasters and postmistresses have described how the saga ruined their lives.\nThey had to cope with the long-term impact of a criminal conviction and imprisonment, some at a time when they had been pregnant or had young children.\nMarriages broke down, and courts have heard how some families believe the stress led to health conditions, addiction and premature deaths.\n\"The past nine years have been hellish and a total nightmare. This conviction has been a cloud over my life,\" said former Oxfordshire sub-postmaster Vipinchandra Patel, whose name was cleared late last year.\nSeema Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She said that she had been \"suffering\" for 15 years as a result of the saga.\nIn December 2019, at the end of a long-running series of civil cases, the Post Office agreed to settle with 555 claimants.\nIt accepted it had previously \"got things wrong in [its] dealings with a number of postmasters\", and agreed to pay \u00a358m in damages.\nThe claimants received a share of \u00a312m, after legal fees were paid.\nA few days later, a High Court judgement said that the Horizon system was not \"remotely robust\" for the first 10 years of its use, and still had problems after that.\nThe judge said the system contained \"bugs, errors and defects\", and that there was a \"material risk\" that shortfalls in branch accounts were caused by the system.\nFollowing the High Court ruling, more cases were brought forward to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), an independent body which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice.\nIn a series of rulings, the convictions of a total of 59 former postmasters have now been overturned, with more expected to go through the courts soon.\nThis included 39 postmasters' convictions being quashed in a single ruling at the Court of Appeal in April.\nThe judges determined that these 39 convictions were also \"an affront to the public conscience\".\nThat means the postmasters may pursue civil action against the Post Office for malicious prosecution, seeking significant sums in damages.\nThose whose convictions, based on Horizon evidence, have been overturned will be in line for compensation, which the Post Office has promised as soon as possible.\nIt is inviting applications for interim compensation of up to \u00a3100,000, which will be funded by the government.\nFinal settlements will come via mediated agreements, or through claims in the civil courts.\nThe Post Office has set up a separate historic shortfall scheme designed to repay those who lost out, but this excludes those who were part of the High Court settlement.\nMore than 2,400 claims have been made to the scheme. Ministers said this was more than the Post Office expected and held the potential for the government having to step in to cover some of the cost.\nAn inquiry set up \"to establish a clear account of the failings of the Horizon IT computer system, and assess whether lessons have been learnt at the Post Office\" was given greater powers to investigate and call witnesses to give evidence. This followed pressure on the government after convictions started to be quashed.\nThe\u00a0Justice For Subpostmasters Alliance campaign group, which was instrumental in the High Court battle, had refused to take part, describing it as a whitewash, and is now considering whether the inquiry's extended powers are sufficient for it to be involved.\nSo far, nobody at the Post Office or Fujitsu has been held accountable, although the High Court judge said he would refer Fujitsu to the Director of Public Prosecutions for possible further action because he had \"grave concerns\" about the evidence of the company's employees."

He's been on hunger strike for more than 20 days.\nThe doctors' statement (in Russian) was published on the Mediazona website on Thursday.\nThe doctors, who have been denied access to Navalny, say their conclusions are based on the results of Tuesday's medical tests - described as more or less independent. The tests were carried out at a hospital in the city of Vladimir, just east of Moscow.\nThe doctors - who had treated the opposition leader before he was jailed - warn that problems with Navalny's kidneys and nervous system suggest he would die if the hunger strike goes on even for a little longer.\nThe physicians say Navalny should \"immediately halt the hunger strike to preserve your life and health\".\nThey are also demanding to be given access to their patient.\nThe Russian authorities have not publicly commented on the doctors' statement.\nOn Monday, Navalny was moved to a prison hospital where the authorities said his condition was \"satisfactory\". \nThe FSIN prison service added that he was being examined by a doctor daily and had agreed to take vitamins.\nIn an Instagram post (in Russian) earlier this week, Navalny told his followers: \"You'd laugh if you could see me now. A skeleton staggering round his cell.\"\nWestern countries say Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent last August and only narrowly survived. After his transfer to intensive care in Berlin, toxicologists concluded that the poison was Russian weapons-grade Novichok.\nThe West blamed the Russian state for the attack, and Navalny accused President Vladimir Putin directly. The Kremlin denied any involvement and disputed the conclusion about Novichok.\nNavalny was jailed in February for violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for fraud. He says the case is politically motivated.\nThe US has warned Russia there will be \"consequences\" if Navalny dies in jail."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden is reportedly set to propose a tax hike on the wealthiest Americans.\nThe proposal would raise the top marginal rate and increase taxes on investment gains for the rich.\nThe tax rise would help pay for childcare and education, but would not be used for healthcare, according to reports.\nThe news triggered a selloff on Wall Street, with major indexes slipping during Thursday's trading session.\nThe White House said the American Family Plan, which Mr Biden is expected to lay out in full next week, will not affect any family earning less than $400,000 a year.\n\"His view is that that should be on the backs... of the wealthiest Americans who can afford it and corporations and businesses who can afford it,\" said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.\nThe proposal would increase the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37%, according to the New York Times and Bloomberg.  \nThe move would effectively reverse Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 income tax cut for highest income earners.\nThe plan would also nearly double taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for people earning more than $1m.\nIt\u2019s a dramatic increase from the current rate of 20%.\nIn some states which impose their own capital gains tax, the total bill some investors could face might exceed 50%.\nThe plan is widely expected to encounter resistance from Republicans in Congress.\nAlthough the Democrats hold a slim majority, they may not support the plan unanimously.\nNevertheless, the news was enough to cause a few jitters on Wall Street.  \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 420 points before reining in its losses slightly.\n\"If it had a chance of passing, we'd be down 2,000 points,\" Thomas Hayes, from Great Hill Capital told Reuters.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq index also slipped 0.9%."

      "text": "Scores of people have been injured in clashes in East Jerusalem between far-right Jewish activists, Palestinians and Israeli police. \nThe violence erupted as police tried to keep Palestinians and ultra-nationalist Jewish protesters apart.\nIt follows nights of confrontations in the Israeli-occupied sector amid rising nationalist and religious tensions.\nEast Jerusalem has long been a flashpoint, with an uneasy coexistence there between Jews and Arabs.\nIsrael has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of the international community. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the future capital of a hoped-for independent state.\nThe worst fighting in days broke out on Thursday night after hundreds of Jewish extremists from the ultra-nationalist Lehava group marched towards the Damascus Gate entrance of Jerusalem's Old City - where large numbers of Palestinians had gathered - chanting \"Death to Arabs\".\nStones and bottles were thrown between the two sides, and police used stun grenades, tear gas and water cannon to try to disperse the crowds.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 100 Palestinians were injured, while police said 20 officers were hurt. More than 50 people were arrested.\nTensions in East Jerusalem have escalated since the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on 13 April. Palestinians have clashed with police, accusing them of erecting barriers to stop them from congregating on steps outside Damascus Gate to break the daytime fast. Police say the measures are intended to help pedestrian flow into the Old City.\nJews have also been angered by a spate of TikTok videos showing Palestinians assaulting members of the ultra-Orthodox community, including an attack on two ultra-Orthodox boys on Jerusalem's light rail. The videos were given as a reason by Lehava for its march to Damascus Gate, in what it said would be a show of \"national honour\". \nThere have also been a number of attacks by Jews on Arabs in Jerusalem this week, including an incident where Jewish youth chanting anti-Arab slogans assaulted an Arab driver who stopped to remonstrate with them."

      "tags": "Hip-hop,Music",
      "text": "Shock G, the frontman of pioneering hip-hop group Digital Underground and co-producer of 2Pac's debut album, has died at the age of 57.\nBorn Gregory Jacobs, he was known for his witty lyrics and comical alter-egos, but also played a crucial role in introducing 1970s funk to 90s hip-hop.\nHis biggest hit was The Humpty Dance, a feel-good party anthem based on his goofy character, Humpty Hump.\nChuck D, Snoop Dogg and Busta Rhymes have all paid tribute to the star.\n\"What a tough loss at such a precarious time,\" wrote Public Enemy's Chuck D on Twitter. \"Brilliant beyond... such a beautiful free mind, Brother. #RestinBeats my man.\"\n\"Rest, King, rest,\" added Busta Rhymes on Instagram.\nSnoop Dogg, whose early hits were inspired by Digital Underground, simply posted a photo of Humpty Hump's jewel-encrusted Groucho Marx glasses.\nThe news of Jacobs' death was confirmed by Chopmaster J, who co-founded Digital Underground with Shock G in 1987.\nHe wrote: \"34 years ago almost to the day we had a wild idea we can be a hip-hop band and take on the world.\n\"Through it all, the dream became a reality and the reality became a nightmare for some. And now he's awaken from the fame. Long live shock G Aka Humpty Hump and Rest In Peace my Brotha Greg Jacobs!!!\"\nDigital Underground's security manager, Nzazi Malonga, told the Associated Press that Jacobs, who had struggled with drug addiction, had been found unresponsive in a hotel room in Tampa, Florida.\nThe star's family later issued a statement saying the musician \"suddenly passed away\" on Thursday.\n\"The cause of death is currently unknown,\" they added. \"We truly, truly appreciate all the out-pouring of love and concern. Please keep us in your prayers at this very difficult time.\"\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Jacobs dropped out of high school in the late 1970s and had a brief career as a radio DJ, before finishing his degree and going to college to study music. \nAfter relocating to San Francisco's Bay Area in the 1980s, he started working in a local music shop - which was where he met Chopmaster J and formed Digital Underground.\nInfluenced by free-thinking musicians like George Clinton, Jimi Hendrix and Herbie Hancock, the band's approach was playful and experimental - making them something of an anomaly during the ascendance of groups like Public Enemy and NWA.\n\"Sometimes we'll combine any two, three or more styles and sometimes we'll stick to just one,\" Jacobs said in 1989. \"It depends on whoever is getting involved in the track.\n\"There's often plenty of different things happening in our songs, but that doesn't mean we're not into the idea of doing a simple rap over a basic beat. We like doing real straight stuff, real hardcore stuff too.\"\nAfter several false starts, the band made waves with the independently-released Underwater Rimes - which became a surprise hit in the Netherlands and landed Digital Underground a deal with Tommy Boy Records, the iconic hip-hop label that was home to De La Soul, Afrika Bambaataa and Naughty By Nature. \nTheir debut album, Sex Packets, was released in 1990 and quickly went platinum thanks to singles such as Doowutchyalike and The Humpty Dance.\n\"The Humpty Dance spoke to all the people that were like him,\" said Malonga. \"The fat people, the unattractive people. If you moved like him, you could be whatever you want.\"\nThe song, which earned Digital Underground a Grammy nomination, was actually a last-minute addition to the album after another track, Underground System, was pulled over sample clearance issues.\nThe Humpty Dance became an MTV staple thanks, in part, to the character of Humpty - voiced by Jacobs as a flamboyant, pimp-like character with a blubbery, stuttering voice. He was often played on stage by Kent Racker, leaving many fans unaware that Shock and Humpty were the same person.\nWhile the song marked the band's commercial peak, they remained a powerful force in hip-hop, releasing six albums before winding down in 2008.\nTheir 1991 single Same Song boasts one of 2Pac's first appearances on a commercial recording. Jacobs had mentored the rapper at the start of his career, giving him work as a roadie while shopping his demo tape to record labels.\nHe later produced and rapped on 2Pac's first top 10 single I Get Around, as well as 1995's So Many Tears - but he never took credit for the star's success. \n\"It's a lucky thing in the other direction,\" he told Rolling Stone in 2017. \"Pac discovered us, man, we didn't discover his ass. No way.\"\nAmong his other credits, Jacob co-wrote LL Cool J's 1991 hit Mama Said Knock You Out, mixed Prince's single Love Sign, and appeared on a remix of Luniz's I Got 5 On It.\nHe also toured and performed with George Clinton and P-Funk, including a set at Woodstock 1999.\n\"Oh no, not Shock G,\" tweeted Parliament-Funkadelic bassist Bootsy Collins. \"He helped keep P Funk Alive! Prayers to family & friends. Dang.\"\nAnd 2Pac's official page shared a 1995 quote from the rapper, which read: \"I look back [on my times with Shock G] with the greatest fondness. Those were like some of the best times of my life.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe first people to arrive in the UK from India since the country was placed on the travel \"red list\" have entered hotel quarantine. In a rule change that kicked in at 04:00 BST this morning, only British and Irish nationals and those with UK residency rights can enter the UK - after first isolating in government-approved hotels for 10 days. India has seen a record surge in infections, which has put pressure on hospital beds and drained medical oxygen supplies, leaving some patients untreated. Some returning British Asians have told the BBC of their trauma of witnessing India's Covid crisis. You can read more here.\nAn MP has said there is \"widespread outrage\" about the failure to prosecute anyone over a funeral allegedly attended by up to 150 mourners during lockdown. The event took place at a church in Kettering, Northamptonshire, in November. At the time, Northamptonshire Police said it showed a \"blatant disregard\" for the 30-person limit, with officers sent to the funeral procession and road blocks put in place. A man was charged with a breach of Covid rules, but the case was this week dropped due to lack of evidence. Kettering MP Philip Hollobone told Parliament the funeral was \"a clear and flagrant breach\" of regulations.\nBusiness owners have told the BBC of their \"relief\" after Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland eased today, allowing close-contact services, such as hairdressers, to reopen and driving lessons to resume. Outdoor visitor attractions have also reopened, competitive sports involving 100 people can resume; and static band practice and rehearsals are also permitted in agreed outdoor locations. Meanwhile, people in Wales will be able to have a drink inside a pub or restaurant for the first time in more than five months from 17 May, under a planned relaxation of lockdown rules announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford.\nIn Scotland, police chiefs have urged people not to breach Covid rules by gathering in large groups in public parks to enjoy the weekend sunshine. It comes after about 400 people were refused entry to Glasgow's Kelvingrove Park last weekend in a crackdown on drinking alcohol in public. Nine of the park's 16 gates will be shut on Friday and Saturday. Police Scotland said it had cleared the busiest areas of the park on two occasions due to a lack of social-distancing and it would do the same this weekend if required. \nThe nation's footballs fans could be treated to an extra England match on home soil this summer after news that Wembley has been given another last-16 tie in the Euros 2020 tournament. Dublin had been due to host the knockout match - as well as three group games - but issues over Covid and minimum spectator levels have seen the fixtures handed to other cities - with St Petersburg down to host the group games. The last-16 tie at Wembley will feature the winner of Group D, which includes England, Scotland, Croatia and the Czech Republic. The tournament, delayed a year because of Covid, will take place between 11 June and 11 July.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nLockdown rules are eased in Northern Ireland today.

      "text": "2020 was a strange year for Hollywood film releases but it was also, \"the industry's most successful year on the diversity front\".\nThat's according to a report by UCLA which also found movie watchers in the US are becoming more diverse and prefer content with greater diversity.\nThe number of ethnic minorities involved in watching or making American movies also increased.\nThe top 185 English-language films released were examined.\nEight of the top 10 theatrically released films had casts in which minorities made up more than 30%, including Bad Boys for Life, starring Will Smith - which had 50%. \nChristopher Nolan's Tenet and Sonic the Hedgehog each had between 31%-40%.\nThis is very different from around a decade ago.\nIn 2011, more than half of the films had cast diversity of less than 11% - but in 2020 that fell with less than 10% of films in that lowest level.\nThe report found more people were watching films with diverse casts as well as the entertainment industry hiring more diverse staff for both onscreen and creative roles.\nFor the first time since the report launched, ethnic minorities were represented in the lead actor and total cast categories at levels proportionate to the US population, with writers credited for the top films almost doubling from 2019.\nBut there's a lot more work to do, with few examples of women and minorities running films with the biggest budgets.\n\"There is a clear underinvestment of films made by, written by, and led by women and people of colour,\" Ana-Christina Ramon, the report's co-author said.\nWhite film directors were more than twice as likely as minority directors to lead a film with a budget of $100m (\u00a372m) or more - with women and minorities more likely to direct films that fell into the lowest budget category of less than $20m (14.4m).\nThe most underrepresented groups in all categories, relative to their population in the US, are Latino, Asian and Native actors, directors and writers.\n\"Hollywood would benefit greatly from embracing 2020's revelations about the possibilities associated with major advances on the diversity front,\" the report states. \nKatie Smith-Wong is a British-Asian film critic and says one lesson is Hollywood's move towards greater diversity in casting and writing.\n\"They're acknowledging there are different ethnicities and audiences out there who are looking to find a different branch of story,\" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nThe release of Black Panther in 2018, she says, showed there's an audience around the world which needs stories and talent to be recognised from across ethnicities, cultures and histories.\nIn the UK, Katie feels the influence of diversity is not as strong in the mainstream, with films here not celebrating positive stories as much and leaning more to plots of hardship.\n\"In Hollywood, you see there are more supporting roles, whereas in the UK, it's hard to find ones that don't avoid stereotypes.\"\nIn June 2020, an open letter was published calling on the UK's film and TV industry to \"tackle structural and systemic racism\" in broadcasting and film-making.\nAmong the things the letter asked for was black and brown independent producers to be empowered and for the lack of diversity on productions to be constantly challenged.\n\"There is diverse talent in the UK, we've seen that in a show like Small Axe and the Rocks film.\"\n\"There needs to be more people willing to support different voices that might appeal to more audiences. Because at the end of the day, originality counts,\" she adds.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "tags": "Apps,Mobile phones,Android,Cyber-security",
      "text": "A text-message scam that infects Android phones is spreading across the UK, experts have warned.\nThe message - which pretends to be from a package delivery firm, prompts users to install a tracking app - but is actually a malicious piece of spyware.\nCalled Flubot, it can take over devices and spy on phones to gather sensitive data, including online banking details.\nNetwork operator Vodafone said millions of the text messages were already being sent, across all networks.\n\"We believe this current wave of Flubot malware SMS attacks will gain serious traction very quickly, and it's something that needs awareness to stop the spread,\" a spokesman said. \nCustomers should \"be especially vigilant with this particular piece of malware\", he said, and be very careful about clicking on any links in a text message. \nOther networks, including EE and Three, followed with warnings of their own.\nThe National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) later issued guidance about the threat, including advice on what to do if you have already downloaded the attacker's application by mistake.\n\"If users have clicked a malicious link it's important not to panic - there are actionable steps they can take to protect their devices and their accounts,\" the NCSC said in a statement.\nThe malware also has the ability to send more text messages to an infected user's contacts, helping it spread. \n\"The seriousness of these malicious text messages is underlined by Vodafone making the decision to alert its customers,\" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight.\n\"This has the potential to become a denial-of-service attack on mobile networks, given the clear risk that a rogue application can be installed on users' smartphones and start spewing out endless text messages. \n\"The broader risk for users is a loss of highly sensitive personal data from their phones,\" he added.\nWhile text message scams claiming to be about a package delivery firm are common, they have mostly focused on phishing - trying to trick the user into filling in a form with bank details and other information.\nThis newest wave differs because it tries to install malicious software on the phone itself - and because of the scale of its spread. \nOne version of the scam reported online pretends to be a text message from DHL, with a link to a website for parcel tracking.\nIf someone using an Android phone clicks on the link, they will be taken to a page \"explaining\" how to install the parcel tracking app using something called an APK.\nAPK files are a way of installing Android apps outside of the secure Google Play store. By default, such applications will be blocked for security reasons, but the scam page includes instructions on how to allow the installation.\nThat can be confusing, as there are some niche genuine cases for installing those kind of apps - such as downloading the Fortnite video game, which was removed from the official app store amid a major legal row between its owner and Google. \nApple iPhone users are not affected as those phones cannot install Android APKs.\nIn a blog post detailing the scam, security researcher Paul Morrison wrote that he expects the \"success rate would be low\" due to the hurdles involved.\nBut he said: \"With the number of SMS being sent out, just a 0.1% success rate could be very profitable.\"\nThe Flubot malware has also spread in other countries in recent months - notably Spain, Germany and Poland.\nKate Bevan, computing editor at consumer magazine Which? said people have to be \"wary\" of texts.\n \"If you're not sure, contact the delivery company's official customer service helpline,\" she said.\n\"As ever, it's important to make sure that your mobile phone is up to date with security patches. Consider also installing mobile security software from a trusted brand.\"\nIndustry body Mobile UK said users who receive a suspicious message should forward it to 7726 to report it, a spokesman said - and then delete the message."

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Post Office Ltd,Post offices",
      "text": "Judges have quashed the convictions of 39 former postmasters after the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.\nThey were convicted of stealing money, with some imprisoned, after the Post Office installed the Horizon computer system in branches.\nThe system was flawed. Some of those whose lives were ruined now want those responsible to be \"punished\".\nThe judgement was met with cheers from ex-postmasters outside court and was hailed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nHe called the original convictions an \"appalling injustice\".\nThe clearing of the names of 39 people follows the overturning of six other convictions in December, This means more people have been affected than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK.   \nAmong them was Janet Skinner, who ran a post office in Hull. She was imprisoned in 2007 for nine months over a shortfall of \u00a359,000 - a case which she said \"destroyed everything\". Like others, she said she had no idea fellow sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were being prosecuted and convicted.\nShe was taken away from her two children to go to prison and - after her release - had a job offer taken away owing to her criminal conviction. Outside court, she said she was \"relieved\" at the judgement.\nSpeaking after his name was cleared, Harjinder Butoy, who was convicted of theft and jailed for three years and four months in 2008, described the Post Office as \"a disgrace\".\nHe said those responsible for the scandal \"need to be punished, seriously punished\", adding: \"They're just bullies, that's all they are. Somebody needs to really, really sort this out and charge them for this.\"\nHughie \"Noel\" Thomas, also cleared, said it had been 16 years to fight for justice. \"All I want is my money back. People have walked away from this who were responsible. I'd like to sit down with them and ask them the question 'why?',\" he said.\nNeil Hudgell, who represented 29 of the former sub-postmasters, said the Post Office \"has been found to have been an organisation that not only turned a blind eye to the failings in its hugely expensive IT system, but positively promoted a culture of cover-up and subterfuge in the pursuit of reputation and profit\".\n\"They readily accepted that loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary people as a price worth paying in that pursuit,\" he said.\nFormer Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells - at the the helm from 2012 to 2019 - said she supported a government inquiry.\n\"I was deeply saddened by the sub-postmasters' accounts heard during the Court of Appeal proceedings. I am truly sorry for the suffering caused to them as a result of the convictions which the Court of Appeal has today overturned.  \n\"I fully support and am committed to co-operating with the ongoing Government Inquiry, as I did with last year's Select Committee Inquiry.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further while the Inquiry is ongoing.\"\nThose affected have long called for a judge-led, full, public inquiry, rather than the government's own inquiry which is set to report in the summer.\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, is reviewing another 22 cases.\nThere were more than 700 prosecutions based on Horizon evidence. The commission and the Post Office are asking anyone else who believes their conviction to be unsafe to come forward.\nAt the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Lord Justice Holroyde said the Post Office \"knew there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon\" and had a \"clear duty to investigate\" the system's defects.\nBut the Post Office \"consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable\" and \"effectively steamrolled over any sub-postmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy\", the judge added.\nThe Court of Appeal also allowed the appeals on the basis that their prosecutions were an affront to justice - a decision that allows for the possibility of further claims for compensation against the Post Office.\nThose whose convictions have been quashed are Josephine Hamilton, Hughie Noel Thomas, Allison Henderson, Alison Hall, Gail Ward, Julian Wilson, Jacqueline McDonald, Tracy Felstead, Janet Skinner, Scott Darlington, Seema Misra, Della Robinson, Khayyam Ishaq, David Thomas Hedges, Peter Anthony Holmes, Rubina Shaheen, Damien Owen, Mohammed Rasul, Wendy Buffrey, Kashmir Gill, Barry Capon, Vijay Parekh, Lynette Hutchings, Dawn O'Connell, Carl Page, Lisa Brennan, William Graham, Siobhan Sayer, Pauline Thomson, Tim Burgess, Nicholas Clark, Margery Williams, Tahir Mahmood, Ian Warren, David Yates, Harjinder Butoy, Gillian Howard, David Blakey and Pamela Lock. \nFollowing the convictions - including theft, fraud and false accounting - some of these former postmasters went to prison, were shunned by their communities and struggled to secure work. \nSome lost their homes and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions. Three have since died.\nThey always said the fault was in the computer system, which had been used to manage post offices' finances since 1999.\nInvestigative journalist Nick Wallis has followed this saga for years, reporting on the case for BBC Panorama and Radio 4.\n\"Just over 10 years ago, I spoke on the phone to a man who was crying his eyes out,\" he said. \n\"His pregnant wife, Seema Misra - the sub-postmaster at West Byfleet Post Office in Surrey - had been sent to prison for theft. He swore she was an innocent victim of the Post Office's computer system, Horizon. \n\"After meeting dozens of sub-postmasters over the past decade, I have been struck by the dignity and quiet anger they convey in interviews and conversation - emotions never stray far from the surface.  \n\"There will be some jubilation at the quashing of so many convictions today, but the trauma, the loss of reputation and the years of financial hardship for the dozens of people who were prosecuted by the Post Office will never leave them.\"\nPost Office chief executive Nick Read said: \"I am in no doubt about the human cost of the Post Office's past failures and the deep pain that has been caused to people affected.\n\"Many of those postmasters involved have been fighting for justice for a considerable length of time and sadly there are some who are not here to see the outcome today and whose families have taken forward appeals in their memory. I am very moved by their courage.\n\"The quashing of historical convictions is a vital milestone in fully and properly addressing the past as I work to put right these wrongs as swiftly as possible and there must be compensation that reflects what has happened.\"\nIn three additional cases - those of Stanley Fell, Wendy Cousins and Neelam Hussain - the judges ruled the convictions were not based on Horizon evidence, so their appeals against conviction failed.\nThe Horizon system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. \nBut from an early stage, it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. \nHorizon-based evidence was used by the Post Office to successfully prosecute 736 people.\nBut campaigners fought a long and hard series of legal battles for compensation in the civil courts, which have been followed by referrals by the Criminal Cases Review Commission."

One displayed mild symptoms but the other had to be put down.\nScientists now want to improve understanding of whether pets can play a role in infecting humans.\nThe cases were found as part of a screening programme of the feline population in the UK.\nResearchers believe both pets were infected by their owners, who had Covid-19 symptoms before the cats became unwell.\nThe study, published in the Veterinary Record, said there is currently no evidence of cat-to-human transmission or that cats, dogs or other domestic animals play any appreciable role in the epidemiology of human Covid infections.\nBut the scientists said domestic animals could potentially act as a \"viral reservoir\" allowing continued transmission, and said it was important to improve understanding of whether pets can play a role in infecting humans.\nProf Margaret Hosie, from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research who was lead author of the study, said: \"These two cases of human-to-animal transmission, found in the feline population in the UK, demonstrate why it is important that we improve our understanding of animal Sars-CoV-2 infection.\n\"Currently, animal-to-human transmission represents a relatively low risk to public health in areas where human-to-human transmission remains high.\n\"However, as human cases decrease, the prospect of transmission among animals becomes increasingly important as a potential source of Sars-CoV-2 reintroduction to humans.\"\nShe added: \"It is therefore important to improve our understanding of whether exposed animals could play any role in transmission.\"\nResearchers at the centre worked in partnership with the Veterinary Diagnostic Service (VDS) at the university's School of Veterinary Medicine on the study.\nThe first cat was a four-month-old female Ragdoll kitten from a household in which the owner developed symptoms that were consistent with Covid at the end of March 2020, although they were not tested.\nThe kitten was taken to a vet with breathing difficulties in April 2020 but its condition deteriorated and it later had to be put down.\nPost-mortem lung samples revealed damage consistent with a viral pneumonia and there was evidence of Sars-CoV-2 infection.\nThe second cat was a six-year-old female Siamese from a household where one owner tested positive for Covid-19.\nThe cat was taken to the vet with nasal discharge and conjunctivitis, but its symptoms remained mild and the cat later recovered.\nCovid-19 infection was confirmed in a retrospective survey of swabs submitted to VDS between March and July 2020 for routine pathogen testing.\nScientists believe the two cases are likely to be an underestimate of the true frequency of human-to-animal transmission, as animal testing is limited.\nSince the pandemic began there have been reports of cats from Covid-positive households in countries including Hong Kong, Belgium, the USA, France and Spain that tested positive for the virus and were presumed to be infected from their owners.\nProf James Wood, head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Cambridge University said: \"These are important and interesting findings, adding to the body of evidence that humans can infect their pets, in some cases, as here, leading to clinical disease in the animals.\n\"Cats and dogs have been reported to be infected. This is a high quality study, including whole genome sequencing to confirm transmission links.\"\nThe study was funded by the Wellcome ISSF Covid Response Fund and supported by the Medical Research Council.

He slipped into 13cm of water and drowned on 27 January 2019.\nPerry, 27, was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter by a jury at Northampton Crown Court in March.\nPassing sentence at the same court, Judge Adrienne Lucking QC told Perry: \"On discovering Renzo, you immediately called the emergency services and tried to resuscitate Renzo.\n\"When the paramedics arrived you told them that you had left your baby for about four minutes... and it was your fault.\"\nPerry later told doctors what had happened but \"omitted to tell them about using the phone\", said the judge.\n\"I am sure that was because you knew you had allowed yourself to be avoidably distracted,\" she added.\nThe court heard Perry initially denied using a phone in a police interview - a lie the judge said was a deliberate attempt to mislead the investigation.\nJudge Lucking added: \"I am satisfied that you remain in denial of your responsibility for your son's death and your lies were in part a reflection of the fact that you have not yet accepted that you are responsible for the death of your baby.\n\"This is an extremely serious offence resulting in the death of a baby and the consequences were completely avoidable.\n\"In my judgement, tragic though your situation is, I would be failing in my public duty if I did not impose an immediate custodial sentence.\n\"Babies and young children are at serious risk of death or grave injury if left unsupervised in a bath, and even more so if their carer is avoidably distracted.\"\nPerry's barrister David Nathan QC had argued for a non-custodial sentence, saying his client's \"lapse\" had occurred amid an otherwise satisfactory standard of care.\n\"Plainly this is a young woman with significant problems identified in the psychologist's report,\" said Mr Nathan.\n\"In a sense she is the victim in this case. I appreciate she caused this child's death but she will live with this for the rest of her life.\n\"You know this is not a callous young woman. This is someone who cares very deeply what happened... a woman who feels remorse for what happened to her child.\n\"She will bear the loss as much as anybody else in the years to come.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell has appeared in court on new charges of sex-trafficking, her first appearance since her arrest last summer. \nShe attended the New York court in person on Friday for arraignment on new charges against her filed last month. \nMs Maxwell, 59, pleaded not guilty to the new counts. \nThe British socialite is accused of helping convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein recruit, groom and sexually abuse girls. \nMs Maxwell, the daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell, was in a relationship with Epstein in the 1990s. She allegedly introduced him to wealthy and powerful figures including Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family and Bill Clinton. \nShe now faces six counts including sex-trafficking of a minor and sex-trafficking conspiracy. She also faces a further two charges relating to allegations of perjury in 2016. \nThe two new charges relate to allegations that Maxwell recruited a 14-year-old girl to provide Epstein with sexualised massages between 2001 and 2004. The girl was then paid hundreds of dollars in cash in return and was encouraged to recruit other young women. \nThe entire proceeding on Friday lasted less than 10 minutes. Maxwell only spoke three times in order to answer the judge's question about whether or not she had received a copy of the indictment. \nJury selection is set for 12 July but the judge is considering a request to delay the trial. \nMs Maxwell has previously denied all of the charges. If convicted on all charges, she faces up to 80 years in prison. \nEpstein killed himself in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, more than a decade after he was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor."

      "tags": "Radiation,Chernobyl disaster",
      "text": "There is no \"additional DNA damage\" in children born to parents who were exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl explosion before they were conceived.\nThis is according to the first study to screen the genes of children whose parents were enlisted to help in the clean-up after the nuclear accident. \nParticipants, all conceived after the disaster and born between 1987 and 2002, had their whole genomes screened.\nThe study found no mutations that were associated with a parent's exposure. \nThe findings are published in the journal Science. \nProf Gerry Thomas, from Imperial College London, has spent decades studying the biology of cancer, particularly tumours that are linked to damage from radiation. She explained that this new study was the first to demonstrate that \"even when people were exposed to relatively high doses of radiation - when compared to background radiation - it had no effect on their future children\".  \nThe new study was led by Prof Meredith Yeager, at the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), in Maryland. It focused on the children of workers who were enlisted to help clean up the highly-contaminated zone around the nuclear power plant, and the children of evacuees from the abandoned town of Pripyat, and other settlements within the 70km zone around it.\nOne of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Chanock, also from the NCI, explained that the research team recruited whole families, so the scientists could compare the DNA of a mother, a father and a child. \n\"Here we're not looking at what happened to those children who were [in the womb] at the time of the accident; we're looking at something called de novo mutations.\"\nThese are new mutations in DNA - they occur randomly in an egg or sperm cell. Depending on where in the genetic blueprint of a baby a mutation arises, it could have no impact at all, or could be the cause of a genetic disease. \n\"There are about 50-100 of these mutations every generation - and they're random,\" explained Dr Chanock. \"In some ways, they're the building blocks of evolution. This is how new changes are introduced into a population one birth at a time. \n\"We looked at the mothers' and the fathers' genomes and then at the child. And we spent an extra nine months looking for any signal - in the number of these mutations - that was associated with a parents' radiation exposure. We couldn't find anything.\"\nThis means, the scientists say, that the effect of radiation on a parent's body has no impact on the children they conceive in the future. \n\"There are a lot of people who were scared to have children after the atomic bombs [in Nagasaki and Hiroshima],\" Prof Thomas told BBC News. \"And people who were scared to have children after the accident at Fukushima, because they thought their child would be affected by radiation they were exposed to.\n\"It's so sad. And if we can show that there's no effect, hopefully we can alleviate that fear.\"\nProf Thomas was not involved in the genome study. She and her colleagues have carried out another piece of research on the cancers that were linked to Chernobyl. They studied thyroid cancer, because the nuclear accident is known to have caused about 5,000 cases of that specific cancer, the vast majority of which were treated and cured.\nThe authorities at the time of the accident failed to prevent contaminated milk from being sold in the region; many who were children at the time drank it, receiving large doses of radioactive iodine - one of the contaminants blasted out of the damaged reactor.\n\"Essentially, we found that there is no difference between thyroid cancers caused by Chernobyl radiation and any other thyroid cancers,\" Prof Thomas explained. \n\"So there's no 'demon tumour' that comes out of Chernobyl that we won't be able to treat - we can just treat in exactly the same way as we treat other cases.\"  \nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "text": "People in Wales will be able to have a drink inside a pub or restaurant for the first time in more than than five months from 17 May.\nAll tourist accommodation, indoor entertainment and attractions in Wales are also set to reopen that day, in time for the Spring bank holiday.\nIndoor children's activities and groups of up to 15 adults, like gym classes, have been brought forward to 3 May.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford described it as a \"major reopening of Wales\".\nHe said the relaxation of a number of lockdown rules had been moved forward because of falling Covid rates.\nIt is the first time a proposed date has been given for the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors in Wales.\nIt comes after the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for the industry to be allowed to resume indoor trade on that date - the same as that proposed in England.\nOpposition parties accused Mr Drakeford, the leader of Welsh Labour, of electioneering by changing Covid rules during the Welsh Parliament election campaign.\nMr Drakeford disagreed, saying the move was only because Wales' Covid case rate had fallen to the UK's lowest.\n\"The virus doesn't know there is an election on, and I don't think it would have been right not to have given those indications,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\nThe latest restriction easing comes after previous announcements that any six people can meet outdoors in Wales from Saturday, and dates for gyms and swimming pools being moved forward by two weeks to 3 May.\nMr Drakeford has also confirmed outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants, will be allowed to reopen on Monday - alongside outdoor attractions, organised outdoor activities and wedding receptions or funeral services for up to 30 people outdoors. \nTwo people will also be allowed to visit their loved ones in care homes from Monday.\nGyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can also reopen from 3 May, while people can once again form extended households, allowing two households to bubble up and have contact indoors.\nBy the time indoor hospitality reopens on 17 May, Mr Drakeford anticipates being able to increase the number of people who can attend organised activities, such as wedding receptions, to 30 indoors and 50 outdoors, from the same date.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nPeople in Wales haven't been allowed to buy an alcoholic drink inside a pub or restaurant in Wales since 4 December.\nSo allowing people to do so from 17 May would be similar to the plan in England and Scotland - with up to four people from up to four different households in Wales allowed to meet.\nAlthough, Scotland will be the first in the UK to open its cafes, pubs and restaurants indoors from Monday - but no alcohol can be served. \nPeople in England can already visit the pub or have a meal in a restaurant outside - that could extend to inside from 17 May.\nPubs, bars, cafes and restaurants can welcome customers outdoors in Northern Ireland from 30 April, with restrictions, while people may be allowed to socialise inside from 24 May at the earliest, depending on Covid case rates.\nIt has been a long time coming for Treorchy cafe owner Sara Bailey.\nHot Gossip, like so many other catering businesses in Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been shut for four months.\n\"It seems that things are going well at the moment with Covid cases, so it is time to give us a date to reopen,\" she said. \nFor restaurateur Nataniel Martinez, who runs Le Monde in Cardiff and Penarth's Old Customs House, reopening is a large-scale operation.\n\"The opening of indoor hospitality for us means we can bring back about 120 staff into work,\" he said.\n\"The demand for indoor dining is massive, so we are really looking forward now to getting back to it and reopening all the restaurants.\"\nRhian Davies, owner of the Crown and Sceptre pub\u00a0in Cadoxton in Neath Port Talbot, said there was a \"lot of preparation to do\" before reopening - but added the industry was used to it after months of safety measures last year.\nShe said she accepted closures had been needed: \"I wanted to help the hard working staff of our hospitals and health service... and was happy to do my bit to stop Covid spreading.\"\nThe announcement has been warmly welcomed by UKHospitality, the trade body representing the hospitality sector in Wales.\n\"We have led the calls for earlier reopening and have been advising, consulting and negotiating on the need to help protect jobs and businesses - and the public,\" said Dave Chapman, its director for Wales.\nHe said the announcement \"offers clarity and commercial hope, and reflects positively the medical evidence\".\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK when the Welsh government banned sale of alcohol on the premises of pubs and restaurants on 4 December.\nThen came the pre-Christmas lockdown, shutting all restaurants, pubs and shops, as Wales reported more than 3,000 Covid cases in a day and that the Welsh NHS was struggling to cope. \nNow, Wales has the lowest Covid case rate in the UK - around 15 cases per 100,000 people - with, compared to other UK nations, the highest percentage of its population vaccinated. The number of Covid patients in hospitals in Wales has also dropped to its lowest level.\nWhile there now appears to be a broad consensus on hospitality restrictions, both the Tories and Plaid Cymru have said Mr Drakeford should not be using the televised address for announcements easing restrictions.\nThe Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh Labour leader of \"naked electioneering\" while Plaid Cymru said it was \"completely inappropriate\" for the press conference to be used like this. \nPlaid leader Adam Price, said: \"A Plaid Cymru government would plan for the reopening of indoor hospitality, tourist accommodation, cinemas and other entertainment venues on 17 May. \n\"To put businesses on the best possible footing our first steps in office include providing start up grants for hospitality businesses.\n\"Additional financial support would also be backdated to 26 April for those businesses that cannot viably trade on the basis of outdoor opening alone.\"\nWelcoming the announcement Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said it was \"great news\".\nShe said: \"As a nation we must all work together to ensure the vaccination programme continues and that the lockdowns and closures we've been through never need to return.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said:  \"Labour had ample opportunity to bring forward a roadmap out of lockdown, but refused to do so. \n\"Thanks to the UK's great vaccination story much more detail could have been announced prior to the election period... but Labour chose to play politics instead of adopting the Welsh Conservative roadmap.\"\nMark Reckless, from the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, said: \"This is getting to the point of testing election rules to breaking point. \n\"The Labour leader is using his platform as first minister to make political announcements during an election campaign.\"\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. "

Everybody knows we couldn't maintain the conditions we had in terms of lockdown forever.\n\"The time is good for opening up with hospital being relatively in very good shape with regards to the number of patients and deaths being very low.\"\nWhile he said the fall in the R number was encouraging, he warned that infection numbers could increase again as restrictions are relaxed. \nProf Kao added: \"It will be two to three weeks before any single measure can show any impact in terms of numbers of cases. To be cautious I would say let's see what happens three, four weeks down the line. Look at if  things have changed very much and hopefully any increases in transmission will not be great.\"\nThe latest State of the Epidemic in Scotland document highlighted progress in fighting the virus using a variety of measures.\nIt reported that an average of 220 cases were reported per day in the seven days to 22 April, which is a 12% decrease in reported cases since the week before.\nThere were 28 weekly cases per 100,000 in the week to 19 April, a decrease in the previous week and in contrast to 302 weekly cases per 100,000 in the first week of January. The case number has not been that low since 16 September last year.\nScotland's average daily deaths per 100,000 people (0.03) are level with England (0.03), and below Northern Ireland (0.06) and Wales (0.04).\nClackmannanshire currently has the highest weekly case rate in Scotland reporting 70 cases per 100,000 in the last week, while Argyll and Bute, Midlothian, East Lothian, Dumfries and Galloway, and Scottish Borders reported fewer than 10 weekly cases per 100,000 in the same period. \nThe current UK variant of concern - sometimes known as the \"Kent variant\" - remains the dominant strain in Scotland.\nThere have been four cases of the so-called \"India variant\", six cases of a variant first identified in Brazil, 32 cases of the \"South Africa\" variant and 26 cases of a variant first found in Nigeria."

It has 700 patients admitted at the two facilities.\nIn recent days, several other hospitals in Delhi had said they had either run out of oxygen or their supplies were dwindling rapidly.\nThree other states - Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana - are also facing a critical shortage of oxygen, while other states like Maharashtra are seeing depleting supplies.\nOn Thursday India recorded the highest one-day tally of new cases anywhere in the world.\nThere were 314,835 new coronavirus cases during the previous 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,104.\nThere have been reports of state authorities stopping oxygen tankers from travelling to other states, according to Delhi television station NDTV. Some facilities have been accused of hoarding their supplies. \nIndian politician, Saurabh Bharadwaj, who is being treated in a Delhi hospital for Covid, posted a plea for help in Hindi on Twitter, saying there were just three hours of oxygen left where he was.\n\"A lot of people are dependent on oxygen and without oxygen, these people will die just like fish die in the absence of water,\" he said. \"This is a time for all to come together to work.\" \nDelhi is known to have among the best healthcare facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the latest surge in cases, says BBC India correspondent Yogita Limaye.\nFamilies are also waiting hours to perform funeral rites, Reuters news agency reports, with at least one Delhi crematorium resorting to building pyres in its car park in order to cope with the numbers arriving. Crematoriums are holding mass cremations, and working day and night in several cities.\n\"During the first phase of coronavirus, the average here was eight to 10. One day it reached 18. But today the situation is very bad. Last night we cremated 78 bodies,\" Jitender Singh Shunty, who runs a crematorium in northeast Delhi, told Reuters.\n\"It is four times more frightful, this coronavirus... Many bodies are around, waiting. We have no place left in the crematorium to cremate them. Very bad times, very bad times,\" he added.\nA doctor working in a government hospital in the south of India, who wished to remain anonymous, said tensions were running high.\n\"Patients are trying to hit doctors,\" they told the BBC. \"They are blaming doctors for everything and even the [hospital] management is also blaming the doctors. It's a stressful environment.\"\n\"We have presently almost used 99% of oxygen ports - only 1% is left. It's a very pathetic situation.\"\nA travel ban has taken effect in the UK for visitors from India. British and Irish citizens will still be allowed to enter the UK but will have to stay in a government-appointed quarantine hotel for ten days.\nCanada and United Arab Emirates (UAE) have temporarily suspended passenger flights, while Singapore has tightened restrictions on travellers from India.  \nSukhbinder Singh, who lives in Leicester in the UK, told the BBC that his mother, 90-year-old Harbans Kaur, died on Wednesday in Delhi after she and seven members of his family tested positive for Covid-19.\nA nursing home refused to admit Ms Kaur without a family member to care for her, but no-one was well enough to do so and she had to stay at home.\n\"After several phone calls and pleading,  I managed to organised the cremation through a charity for my mother, which was carried out with some usual rituals,\" he added. \"But there were no final farewells by family and the memory of her death is very difficult to deal with mentally.\"\nMr Singh's brother and sister-in-law were admitted to hospital in Delhi, and using his contacts in India, he was finally able to secure the medicine and oxygen they needed - although he said he struggled in part because of rising medicine costs due to the black market.\n\"My lower-middle-class family is not rich to afford big private hospital fees and treatment costs. What about poor daily wagers who can't even afford paracetamol?\"\nIn January, the pandemic was comparatively controlled, but since then the situation has gone from bad to worse.\nIndia has seen a rapid rise in case numbers over the past month driven by lax safety protocols, a Hindu festival attended by millions and variants of the virus, including a \"double mutant\" strain.\nPolitical parties have come under criticism for holding huge state election rallies - including one by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - in West Bengal. The government has defended the decision to continue with polling, which is taking place in phases, but India's election body has now banned campaign rallies.\nPrime Minister Modi chaired a high-level meeting on Thursday to discuss the oxygen supply issue. According to a government statement, he was told that an \"elaborate exercise\" is under way, with state governments to identify their needs so they can be supplied with oxygen.\nTo transport oxygen around the country faster, the canisters are being airlifted and put on direct trains, the statement says.\nThere is no national lockdown currently in place, and regions are implementing their own rules.\nDelhi announced a week-long lockdown at the weekend, leaving just government offices and essential services like hospitals, pharmacies and grocers open. \nTougher restrictions have been announced in the worst affected state of Maharashtra, which is India's richest region and home to its financial hub, Mumbai. It has also been a Covid hotspot since the start of the pandemic, accounting for a quarter of India's cases.\nDespite a promising start in January, India's inoculation drive has been lagging.\nSome 130 million doses have so far been administered, but with a population of more than a billion people, it is a small percentage, and the drive has been restricted to health workers, frontline staff, those above the age of 45 and anyone with co-morbidities. \nExperts say India is unlikely to meet its target of covering 250 million people by July.\nFrom 1 May, people above 18 will also be eligible for the vaccine. But there is a shortage of doses, which could slow it down further.\n Are you affected by Covid-19 in India?

      "text": "The UK and Australia say they have agreed \"the vast majority\" of a free trade deal.\nAfter talks on Friday in London the two said they aim to seal a deal by June.\n\"Both countries are confident the remaining issues will be resolved, and will now enter a sprint to agree the outstanding details with the aim of reaching agreement in principle,\" a joint statement said.\nIt is estimated a deal could add \u00a3500m ($694m) to UK GDP over the long-term.\nThe final day of talks between UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan ended in London without a deal but both sides will spend the next few weeks ironing out the outstanding issues standing in the way of an agreement.\nMs Truss said the trade deal between the two countries \"will help us emerge stronger from the pandemic, strengthening ties between two democracies who share a fierce belief in freedom, enterprise and fair play\".\nIf concluded, the UK-Australia free trade agreement will be one of the first post-Brexit trade deals negotiated by the UK that is not a \"rollover deal\", a replica of a trading arrangement earlier negotiated on the UK's behalf by the European Union.\nThe UK inked a trade deal with Japan in October 2020.\nA free trade deal aims to encourage trade - usually in goods but occasionally in services - by making it cheaper. This is often achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs - taxes or charges by governments for trading goods across borders. \nTrade agreements also aim to remove quotas - which are limits on the amount of goods which can be traded.\nTrade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be checked."

There will be some gaps,\" Mr Martin told Northern Ireland business leaders on Thursday. "

      "tags": "UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The cost of measures to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic has pushed government borrowing to the highest level since the end of World War Two.\nGovernment borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - hit \u00a3303.1bn in the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said.  \nCompared to the previous year, borrowing is nearly \u00a3250bn higher.\nMeasures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard.\nBorrowing hit \u00a328bn in March alone - a record high for that month.\nDespite the record figure, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme the annual borrowing figure was \"slightly better than expected a month ago\".\nBut, he added: \"The big story in a sense is they [the borrowing figures] are \u00a3250bn more than a year ago.\n\"And that, of course, is because of to some extent the recession of the last year but mostly because of the huge amount of additional government spending to support the economy over the last year.\" \nGovernment borrowing of \u00a3303bn is at the same time, an extraordinary record, but also something a relief. \nFor starters it is not \u00a3400bn, as anticipated only a few months ago, though this number will go up when some Covid support loans fail to be repaid. \nBut its cause has been primarily an active government decision to spend more to support incomes during the pandemic. Of the \u00a3250bn difference in borrowing between this year and last, over \u00a3200bn comes from extra spending, the rest on a reduction in taxes.\nIn the latest reported month, March, taxes were barely down on last year. Whereas VAT, fuel duty and business rates were down, self assessment, PAYE, stamp duty and capital gains taxes were up. \nThat is part of a wider trend of the economy riding the second lockdown much more effectively than the first. It is epitomised by this morning's separate retail sales figures showing a boost even ahead of the physical reopening of shops.\nThe ONS suggested Britons wanted to look good and deck out their gardens ahead of some restrictions being lifted. Others, less charitable,  suggested lockdown excess meant our clothes no longer fit.\nThe chancellor's slimming regime for the public finances is a gentle one. Borrowing is predicted to continue at high levels this year, as jobs support continues until the autumn, and massive tax cuts are meant to persuade companies to invest in plant and machinery.\nIt is a rebound in growth that will most effectively shrink these record borrowing numbers. That is why amid the sea of red ink, there is some reason for relief.\nMeasures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic contributed to a \u00a3203.2bn, or 27.5%, increase in central government day-to-day spending in the year to March, the ONS said.\nMeanwhile, tax and National Insurance receipts fell by \u00a334.9bn, down 5% compared with the previous 12 months.\nThe ONS also said public borrowing as a percentage of GDP, or national output rose, to 14.5% - also the highest since the end of the second world war when it reached 15.2% in 1946.\nThe huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed public sector net debt up to \u00a32.142 trillion, which is 97.7% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s.\nMichal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG, said: \"Rising debt is largely an unfortunate consequence of the government's focus on shielding the economy as much as possible from the impact of Covid-19.\n\"However, doing otherwise could have created long-lasting scars which would be far worse for fiscal sustainability.\"\nDespite the record annual figure, the ONS said it was \u00a324.3bn lower than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the fiscal watchdog, had forecast in March.\nRuth Gregory at Capital Economics said: \"If we are right in thinking the economic recovery will be faster and fuller than the OBR anticipates, borrowing will probably fall more quickly than most expect.\"\nSeparate research published on Friday added to hopes of a swift rebound for the economy, as it suggested that the easing of lockdown measures this month has triggered a surge in activity among UK businesses.\nA closely watched survey, produced by IHS Markit/CIPS, indicated that the looser pandemic restrictions had led to the fastest UK private sector growth since late 2013.\nThe IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60 in April, according to initial findings, up from 56.4 in March. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion.\nThe service sector grew faster than manufacturing for the first time since the Covid pandemic began, the survey found, largely because of the reopening of non-essential shops in England and Wales from mid-April.\n\"Companies are reporting a surge in demand for both goods and services as the economy opens up from lockdowns and the encouraging vaccine rollout adds to a brighter outlook,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.\n\"Business activity should continue to grow strongly in May and June as virus restrictions are eased further, setting the scene for a bumper second quarter for the economy.\n\"There's also good news for the job market,\" he added. \"Firms have been encouraged to take on extra staff at a rate not seen for over three-and-a-half years.\n\"There are some causes for concern, however, as export performance remains relatively lacklustre, often linked to post-Brexit trading conditions, and prices continue to rise sharply.\""

This is government by WhatsApp.\n\"They are all at it - whether it's access to the prime minister, whether it's the former prime minister accessing ministers and officials, whether it's the health secretary with shares in companies with the contracts with the NHS. The list just grows and grows...\n\"Sleaze is back and it's bigger than it was before.\"\nShadow Treasury minister Bridget Phillipson tweeted: \"Dominic Cummings is a distraction. Follow the money, not the soap opera.\"\nMr Cummings has not accepted invitations to respond to the reports and, so far, no evidence of his involvement in the leaks has been produced.\nLabour has called for an urgent investigation into the prime minister's conduct by the Liaison Committee of senior MPs.\nIt said the text messages showed Mr Johnson had offered a \"tax break\" to a \"chum\". \nThe head of the committee, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, turned down the call for an inquiry, saying three other parliamentary committees were already looking at the issues.\nHe told Radio 4's Today programme ministers should not be \"locked away in ivory towers\" with people unable to contact them and should be able to carry out conversations about policy in private, as this would \"stifle proper conversation\".\n\"What's got to come out of this is obviously a system of managing conflicts of interest, which commands more public confidence, and is more rigorous, but also a balance,\" he added.\nThe SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has written to the Cabinet Secretary, calling for officials to \"secure and publish\" all Mr Johnson's private correspondence on coronavirus contracts, and not just his texts with Sir James Dyson. \nHe said \"such a narrow and limited internal investigation totally and utterly fails to address the scale of the scandal\".

Daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by a record 2,263 in the previous 24 hours.\nAt least two hospitals in the Indian capital Delhi are running out of oxygen, and at least 13 patients have died after a fire broke out in the intensive care unit of a hospital set up to treat Covid patients near Mumbai.\nThe rising number of cases has resulted in a deepening healthcare crisis that has gripped several states, and India's top court has asked the central government for a national plan by Friday on bolstering supply, oxygen, medicine, treatment and vaccines.\nNayan Gangyan is facing a 10-day hotel quarantine when he flies back to London from northern India on Saturday. He travelled to Chandigarh a few weeks ago, when his parents both contracted coronavirus. \nHe told BBC Breakfast he was left feeling \"helpless\" in the UK when his father's oxygen levels dropped, there were no beds available in hospital and his mother started to panic.\n\"It was at that point that I decided 'my family needs help and I need to go back come what may',\" he says.\nHe says the situation in India is \"really bad\", with the government healthcare system \"completely overrun\". But they eventually managed to get his father admitted to a hospital where he had previously undergone a liver transplant, and he is doing \"much better now\".\nNow Nayan is preparing to return home to London. \"The flight as of now, it's running. I really hope that it does take off,\" he says.\n\"I've already booked my quarantine hotel so I'll be going straight there. I'll be landing [then] straight to the hotel and 10 days in the room.\"\nHis wife Vani, who has been watching from a distance from their London home, says it has been difficult \"not to be able to control or influence\" events. \nOn India's red list status, she says: \"We got just over three days' notice so very little time for us to actually affect the outcome or do anything. \n\"We're just in the position where we have to be okay. After Nayan's ordeal in India he has to go through another ordeal.\"\nTina Patel and her husband arrived back in the UK on Thursday from Pune, Maharashtra, after travelling to India in March to visit her father-in-law, who was ill due to old age and later died. \nShe told the BBC people in the city were \"desperate\" - trying to find hospital beds or a slot in the crematoriums. \"We left a city with ambulances wailing away day and night,\" she said. \n\"I left broken-hearted as there was nothing we could do but catch the BA flight last night and all we could do was to be thankful that we finally got home.\"\nFriday's travel rule change means direct flights from India are still permitted, but UK and Irish nationals, as well as those with residency rights, must isolate in government-approved hotels - at their own cost - for 10 days.\nTravel to the UK is banned for all others who have been in red-list countries in the past 10 days.\nThere are 40 countries on the government's red list across the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice.\nThere are specific rules for people arriving in each UK nation, including England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nPublic Health England (PHE) confirmed on Thursday that a further 55 cases of the virus variant first identified in India - known as B.1.617 - were found in the UK in the latest week to 14 April.\nPHE experts are currently unsure whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity.\nThe final scheduled commercial flight ahead of the rule change - Vistara flight VTI017 - landed at London's Heathrow Airport at 18:48 on Thursday, according to FlightRadar24.\nFour airlines asked for a total of eight extra flights to arrive at the west London airport before the 04:00 deadline but were refused permission by airport authorities.\nHeathrow bosses are believed to have declined the requests to ensure pressures at the border, reported in recent weeks, were not exacerbated.\nLater scheduled arrivals from Delhi and Mumbai to Heathrow, and Delhi to Gatwick Airport, were cancelled on Thursday, airport data showed.\nSome of those who arrived before the red list change told the BBC they \"couldn't afford to stay away\" and \"had to get back to work\".\n\"Eventually, yesterday, a friend in the UK managed to book me a ticket from Mumbai to Manchester,\" Biju Mathew, a social services manager from Walsall, said.\nDemand for flights from India to the UK quickly became overwhelming after the government's red list announcement, according to Suresh Kumar, chairman of specialist travel agents Indra Travel.\n\"A lot of people were hoping that the [UK] government would have made arrangements for people trying to get back,\" he said. \"They were disappointed.\"\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who cancelled an official visit to India due to take place next Monday - said the addition to the red list was a \"purely precautionary\" step over a new coronavirus variant.\nHe said: \"What we're seeing in India is a result of a variant under investigation, it hasn't yet been deemed a variant of concern - I think that was why there has been the delay.\"\nThe B.1.617 variant was first noted internationally in October and first identified in the UK on 22 February.\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

Like others, she said she had no idea other sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were being prosecuted and convicted.\nShe was taken away from her two children to go to prison, and - after her release - had a job offer taken away owing to her criminal conviction.\nNow she is waiting for the Appeal Court's verdict. \"I'm so nervous, because I know my life is in the hands of three judges,\" she said.\nJulian Wilson owned and ran the Astwood Bank village post office branch in Worcestershire. He was convicted following a Post Office prosecution in 2008.\nHe died of cancer in 2016, but his widow Karen has been fighting to clear his name.\n\"He couldn't get a job, so I had three jobs. I sold everything he'd ever bought me - my engagement ring, all my jewellery. I didn't tell him,\" she said.\n\"He used to say: 'I feel I have a ball and chain with an anchor around my leg and I'm dragging it over a stormy sea, and I want somebody to cut it free because I am not a criminal.'\"\nIn an earlier ruling, a High Court judge found the Fujitsu-developed\u00a0Horizon\u00a0accounting system contained \"bugs, errors and defects\" and that there was a \"material risk\" shortfalls in branch accounts were caused by the system.\nIn December 2019, the Post Office agreed to pay almost \u00a358m to settle the long-running dispute with more than 500 sub-postmasters and postmistresses affected by the scandal.\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred 51 cases back to the courts. Six people's convictions were overturned last year. \nLater on Friday, following a hearing at the Court of Appeal in March, judges will give a ruling in 42 more cases.\nIn 39 cases, the Post Office did not contest that those involved \"did not or could not have a fair trial\", but in 35 of these cases it did challenge a second element that their convictions were \"an affront to the public conscience\".\nThe Horizon system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. \nBut from an early stage it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. \nHorizon-based evidence was used by the Post Office to successfully prosecute 736 people.\nBut campaigners fought a long and series of legal battles for compensation in the civil courts, which have been followed by referrals by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.\nOthers hoping to have their names cleared include Seema Misra, who was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010.\n\"Prison was my worst nightmare,\" she said.\nAlso waiting for the decision is Jo Hamilton, who was accused by the Post Office of taking \u00a336,000 from the village shop she ran in Hampshire. \nShe had to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. Declaring the criminal record also affected everyday life, such as failing to get car insurance.\nShe made ends meet by doing cleaning jobs for people in her village who did not believe she was guilty. Many of them, including the local vicar, came to support her at her sentencing hearing.\n\"It's just gone on for so long. It's been a massive part of my life,\" she said.\nA Post Office spokesman said: \"We sincerely apologise to the postmasters affected by our historical failures. \n\"Throughout this appeals process we have supported the quashing of the overwhelming majority of these convictions and the judgment will be an important milestone in addressing the past.\""

      "text": "Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has resisted pressure to set more ambitious carbon emission targets while other major nations vowed deeper reductions to tackle climate change.   \nAddressing a global climate summit, Mr Morrison said Australia was on a path to net zero emissions.\nBut he stopped short of setting a timeline, saying the country would get there \"as soon as possible\".\nIt came as the US, Canada and Japan set new commitments for steeper cuts. \nUS President Joe Biden, who chaired the virtual summit, pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by the year 2030. This new target essentially doubles the previous US promise.\nBy contrast, Australia will stick with its existing pledge of cutting carbon emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels, by 2030. That's in line with the Paris climate agreement, though Mr Morrison said Australia was on a pathway to net zero emissions. \n\"Our goal is to get there as soon as we possibly can, through technology that enables and transforms our industries, not taxes that eliminate them and the jobs and livelihoods they support and create,\" he told the summit.\n\"Future generations... will thank us not for what we have promised, but what we deliver.\" \nAustralia is one of the world's biggest carbon emitters on a per capita basis. Mr Morrison, who has faced sustained criticism over climate policy, said action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would focus on technology. \nThe prime minister said Australia is deploying renewable energy 10 times faster than the global average per person, and has the highest uptake of rooftop solar panels in the world. \nMr Morrison added Australia would invest $20bn ($15.4bn; 11.1bn) \"to achieve ambitious goals that will bring the cost of clean hydrogen, green steel, energy storage and carbon capture to commercial parity\". \n\"You can always be sure that the commitments Australia makes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are bankable.\"\nAustralia has seen growing international pressure to step up its efforts to cut emissions and tackle global warming. The country has warmed on average by 1.4 degrees C since national records began in 1910, according to its science and weather agencies. That's led to an increase in the number of extreme heat events, as well as increased fire danger days.\nAhead of the summit, President Biden's team urged countries that have been slow to embrace action on climate change to raise their ambition. While many nations heeded the call, big emitters China and India also made no new commitments. \n\"Scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade - this is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis,\" President Biden said at the summit's opening address.\nReferring to America's new carbon-cutting pledge, President Biden added: \"The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting.\""

      "text": "Reopening pubs too soon could run the risk of \"undoing all the good\" during lockdown, an infectious disease expert has said.\nBeer gardens reopened in England on Monday, but in Wales industry experts have expressed frustration they cannot open until 26 April.\nDr Mike Tildesley said it was important lockdown was eased gradually to stop a spike in coronavirus cases.\nThe Welsh government said it was taking \"a careful step-by-step approach\".\nDr Tildesley, who is part of a modelling group which advises the UK government on the pandemic, said he understood people were \"frustrated\" at the different timetables out of lockdown.\nHowever, he said a cautious approach was needed for the next few weeks to prevent a third wave, in the hope \"we can get back to normal by summer\".\n\"We need to remember that these are paced at a rate that the vaccinations can keep up with us and can help us along the way,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\nMore than half the people in Wales have now had their first Covid-19 vaccination dose, and Covid admissions to hospitals in Wales have hit record low levels.\nDr Tildesley said while things were moving in the right direction, scientists needed to monitor the impact of relaxing other restrictions on case rates, before reopening other parts of life.\nOn Monday shoppers queued as non-essential shops reopened in Wales for the first time since they were forced to close in the run-up to Christmas.\n\"The key thing is we need to take it at a gradual rate so we can ensure that we can reopen safely... we are doing well, but if we go too fast we run the risk of too much mixing, and undoing all the good we have done so far,\" he said.\nWhile he said cases could go up as people began mixing again and going back to their daily lives, the progress of the vaccine should help avoid a \"significant resurgence\".\nDr Tildesley urged people to be cautious for a few more weeks, adding the biggest concern was that if there was a spoke in cases the virus could mutate.\n\"We are not quite out of the woods yet, in the not too distant future we will be in a position where we can meet people... and hug our friends and family again, but we are not there yet,\" he said.\nOne landlord, whose pub is on the border said it was \"frustrating\" remaining closed until 26 April when outdoor hospitality opened on Monday in England.\nJohn Turner said two other pubs in his village - that are technically in England - had now reopened.\nBut Mr Turner, who runs the Dolphin Inn, in Llanymynech, on the Powys-Shropshire border, said Wales was \"always two weeks behind England\" and he was anxious to open again.\nOn Monday, the border reopened between Wales and England and people are now allowed to travel in both directions.\nOnce in England, you can visit a pub or cafe garden with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households.\nHowever, some people have agreed with Dr Tildesley's view and expressed relief pubs remain closed in Wales.\nGarfield Doc Oakleeffe posted on Facebook: \"After seeing the footage of the lack of social distancing when drinking in Soho, I think slow and cautious is better.\"\nSian Louise said: \"I know it's horrible to not be open and I feel for businesses, I really do as I was getting annoyed with it all, but by looking how this last lockdown went and how it started I actually understand why [Mark Drakeford is] doing it slowly, because we don't want another lockdown and we don't want anymore people getting seriously ill either. \n\"Hopefully, in time we will come out better and safer by doing it gradually.\"\nMichelle Murphy commented: \"I am so glad they are still closed. If this is what it is going to be like, no wonder they predict a third wave.\"\nKerry Lea Edwards did not understand the \"urgency to be back in the pub\", adding: \"If it's the social side you can meet outdoors in your garden with your friends and have a drink.\n\"Surely it's not worth the risk - we will be in another lockdown before we know it, very sad.\"\nMr Turner said: \"The firebreak [lockdown] was going to be the saviour for Christmas and then I didn't even imagine we would miss out on Easter as well.\n\"An extra two weeks' trade will be lost once again to England.\" \nHe added that even when pubs in Wales can reopen, it could be a struggle only being able to serve outside because of \"the weather element\".\nWhile he has used some of his government support to put up a marquee, and purchase heaters and furniture, he said other pubs might not be able to keep up.\nHe said he was anxious to make the money back to make the new equipment worthwhile. \n\"People are desperate to get to the pub. I am hopeful we will be full and I'm looking forward to being busy again because otherwise it will be harder and more disappointing,\" he said.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association (WBPA), said pubs across Wales were \"hugely disappointed\" to not open on Monday alongside England.\nShe said pubs in Wales having to wait another two weeks while pubs in England were trading outdoors was \"a bitter pill to swallow\". \nMs McClarkin said: \"Vaccination rates continue to climb while case rates are falling week on week. Even when they will be allowed to open, we still think about 60% of pubs in Wales will be unable to because of a lack of usable outside space.\n\"The Welsh government need to recognise that and bring forward a package of funding as soon as possible that will prevent hundreds of Welsh pubs being lost for good.\"\nThe Welsh government said it had provided more than \u00a32bn of funding to support businesses impacted by the pandemic, safeguarding 165,000 Welsh jobs. \nA spokesperson said tourism and hospitality businesses would continue to receive cash grants this month to help them through until the reopening date in May. \n\"Businesses will therefore see no interruption in the flow of financial support, as we move cautiously to relax public health restrictions,\" they said.\n\"Another \u00a3200m in additional support for business has already been earmarked in the Final Budget 2021-22. \n\"Ministers have had a constructive meeting with representatives from the hospitality sector and Welsh government officials will work with them on options for a further support package to be put to the new government following May's Senedd election.\"\nA Plaid Cymru spokesperson said many would question the decision not to move forward the reopening of beer gardens after scenes like those seen in Cardiff Bay, where crowds gathered to drink over the bank holiday weekend.\n\"A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"Likewise, the lack of clear date on indoor hospitality remains a major problem and at the very least the government should urgently revisit its decision to delay any additional financial support until after election.\"\nLeader of the Welsh Conservative group Andrew RT Davies, said the Welsh government's decision was about politics not science, and lost trade meant \"lost livelihoods in Wales\".\n\"After a crippling 12 months for businesses, Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay seem to have a tin ear to these concerns. Welsh Conservatives would cut the border games, end the confusion, and get Wales on the road to recovery with a safe, consistent and one-nation approach,\" he said.\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said: \"Lockdown is frustrating but we all need to stay safe and follow the regulations. \n\"If we do, we will not need to enter a lockdown again and that is the the most important thing. We've seen before what happened when lockdowns were eased too quickly.\" "

The world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heatwaves and hurricanes - tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods.\"\nHe said there was a moral and economic imperative to immediately act on climate change.\nReferring to America's new carbon-cutting pledge, President Biden added: \"The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting.\n\"The US isn't waiting, we are resolving to take action.\"\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg, who was testifying before Congress on Thursday, challenged world leaders to do more on the climate crisis.\n\"Unlike you, my generation will not give up without a fight,\" she said. \"How long do you honestly believe that people in power will get away with it?\"\nThe UK is playing a critical role this year as president of the crucial COP26 later this year. The government is tasked with achieving agreement in Glasgow when world leaders meet there in November.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson was in ebullient form on his virtual conference address. He assured global leaders that tackling climate change was \"not bunny-hugging\".\nAt the summit, Mr Johnson called President Biden's announcement about cutting US greenhouse gas emissions \"game-changing\".\n\"We can do this together across the world. It's going to mean the richest nations coming together and exceeding the $100bn commitment they already made in 2009,\" he said.\nClimate has been the central focus of the Biden administration's first few months in office. \nAs well as re-joining the Paris climate pact and organising Thursday's summit, the Biden team has been working on a strong pledge to convince the world that they mean business.\nThe fact that President Biden is prepared to go beyond a 50% cut will be a welcome surprise to many scientists and campaigners. \n\"By announcing a bold target of cutting emissions 50-52% below 2005 by the end of the decade, President Biden has met the moment and the urgency that the climate crisis demands,\" said Nathaniel Keohane from the US Environmental Defense Fund.\n\"This target aligns with what the science says is necessary to put the world on the path to a safer climate, and vaults the US into the top tier of world leaders on climate ambition.\"\nBut the new pledge will mean major changes to the American way of life. Coal will have to disappear from the electricity mix, while gas guzzling cars and trucks will have to go electric.\nOthers stepping up with new promises included Canada, Japan and South Korea.\nBut Canada's promise to limit carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 came in for immediate criticism from campaigners.\n\"Canada's new 2030 emissions reduction target is stronger than its previous commitment, but it falls short of what is needed to avoid dangerous levels of warming,\" said Helen Mountford from the World Resources Institute.\n\"Canada's efforts to deliver real action on the ground are welcome, like placing a price on carbon pollution, but the country should aim for a much more ambitious goal than what it put forward today.\"\nMeanwhile, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshide Suga said the country was \"ready to demonstrate its leadership\" on the climate.\nMr Suga said that Japan would reduce emissions by 46% in 2030 compared to 2013 levels. Previously, the country had pledged only a 26% cut in emissions.\nSouth Korea also pledged a new target and said they would stop financing the building of coal-fired power stations overseas.\nBut China made no new pledges but hinted that coal, which is set to grow again as the economy recovers from Covid, will be tackled in the next few years.\n\"We will strictly control the coal-fired power generation projects,\" the country's President Xi Jinping told the gathering.\n\"We will strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th five-year plan period and phase it down in the 15th five-year plan period.\"\nHowever, that's likely to be after 2026.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China will be responsible for around half the growth in coal around the world this year, as economies recover from Covid.\nIndia's Prime Minister Modi stressed that his country's per capita emissions were 60% lower than the global average.\nHe said that lifestyle changes should play a bigger role in limiting climate change. However he made no new promises on curbing emissions.\nPresident Biden's team is also urging countries that have been slow to embrace action on climate change - such as Australia and Brazil - to raise their ambition.\nBrazil and Australia's sceptical approach to the issue had found favour in the Trump White House.

      "text": "Thirteen houses have sold in less than three hours after dozens of people slept outside an estate agent to bid for new homes in Aberdare.\nUp to 30 people arrived at Bidmead Cook on Thursday with chairs, blankets and prosecco, preparing for a long wait. \nEstate agent Gavin Williams said he had never seen buyers queuing overnight in his professional life.\nThe scenes - more than 18 hours before the 14 homes went on sale - were described as \"completely bonkers.\"\nAngharad Hamilton-Shaw, 32, from Cwmaman, was first in line having began queuing at 15:15 BST the previous day.\n\"Originally we planned to go queue at midnight but with more interest, the time got earlier and earlier,\" she said.\n\"And it's a good job we did as the next person came around four o'clock.\n\"People were still coming in the early hours and then walking away once they asked those of us queuing which properties we were interested in - it was really heart-breaking.\" \nMs Hamilton-Shaw said family and friends queued through the night in shifts to make sure to help secure her \"forever home.\"\n\"It has been really emotional, just feelings of excitement and anxiety,\" she said.\n\"It was really cold throughout the night, but everyone seemed to be in good spirits and that helped pass the time.\n\"And technically those of us that have got the properties are now all neighbours and we have made friends for once we move in.\"\nHanna Owen sold her house in February and has been looking for another since the beginning of March. \nDespite seeing a few on the market, she has missed out until now.\n\"It's crazy, there are loads of people buying at the moment.\"\nThe 34-year-old from Aberdare said she was not planning on queuing for as long as she did.\n\"My mother-in-law walked past and told me there was already someone waiting there and she got in behind so we ended up being second in the queue.\n\"My sister-in-law and niece took over from 17:00 BST and then me and my mother-in-law were there from 22:00. \n\"It was freezing cold and my mother-in-law went back to the house numerous times to get bottles of water and flasks of tea,\" she said. \nShe said it was definitely worth queueing - with the bonus being she got to meet her new neighbours. \n\"When my sister-in-law first suggested queuing so early I thought she was joking, but I am so glad I did - you have got to be in it to win it.\n\"It felt like such a long night but when I think it about it, it's gone so quickly, and it's only now kicking in that I we are homeowners,\" she said. \nEstate agent director Jeanne Fry-Thomas said she \"couldn't believe my eyes\" at the scenes and that colleagues had handed out coffee and donuts overnight to those waiting.\nThe site called Cwm Heulwen, has three-bedroom properties priced at \u00a3184,950 and with four-bed homes coming in at \u00a3320,000.\nCurrently, the average house price in Wales is \u00a3209,723, according to the Principality Building Society.\nMs Thomas said homebuyers were now looking for extra space.\n\"People want gardens and more space,\" she said.\n\"It's bouncing and it's completely bonkers. It's local people, people moving from outside the area, investors - it's madness, our busiest offices are all the valleys offices. \n\"And we just don't have the stock. The demand is there, but we don't have the properties.\" \nBidmead Cook said the houses are off-plan and they are the second phase of a development by Welsh family-owned company, Davis Homes. \nDeveloper Matthew Davis said he was \"flummoxed\" by the situation. \nThe 42-year-old, from Pontyclun, said: \"The housing market is strong but this is absolutely unbelievable. \n\"The first lady decided to park up and camp mid-afternoon and it must have created a situation where people thought they should start queuing as well.\""

      "text": "A group of charities has sounded the alarm over the growing use of buy-now-pay-later to buy goods.\nCitizens Advice, a network of legal, money and consumer groups, said many users were getting into debt and struggling to pay for food and bills.\nBuy-now-pay-later (BNPL) is increasingly popular among young people buying online, and at some High Street outlets.\nHowever, Citizens Advice said many consumers regretted using it.\nThe charity network did not want to name BNPL firms, but called for tougher regulation.\nIt found that 45% of 18-to-34 year olds have used the payment option in the last 12 months.\nThe repayment option is often advertised at online checkouts as an easy way of splitting or delaying payments on items such as clothing or electronics, with incentives such as it being \"interest-free\". \nHowever, the charity network said it can be a \"slippery slope into debt\". \nThe charity network said that, overall, 27% of UK adults have used these firms in the last 12 months, rising to 37% of disabled people and 45% of people with a mental health problem. \nThe average person was repaying \u00a363 a month, but CA found almost two-in-five (5.7 million) who have used BNPL in the last year didn't think it was \"proper borrowing\" and six million didn't fully understand what they were signing up for. \nOne consumer who signed up for more than she expected is Sharonjit, whose story was cited  by Citizen's Advice as an example of the trouble people can get into.\nAged 32, she bought \u00a3600 worth of clothes and used a BNPL firm to pay in instalments. She didn't receive the goods and cancelled her payment to the firm while she waited for the issue to be resolved by the retailer. \nShe said: \"The whole thing has been so stressful. I'm constantly on edge. I've just been barraged with calls, emails and letters from a debt collector - all for buying some clothes online.\n\"The firm said they were referring me on to someone and I had no idea it was a debt collector. I had no idea buy-now-pay-later could [hit] my credit score.\n\"I've never had issues shopping this way before. But this time it's like as soon as something went wrong they've washed their hands of me.\"\nAnd the charity warned that four-in-10 of those who've used BNPL in the last 12 months are struggling to repay.\nIt found a quarter of consumers regretted paying using these platforms, with consumers frequently saying they cannot afford repayments or are spending more than they expected.\nCitizens Advice said firms must overhaul their checkout processes and improve affordability checks.\nBoth the Financial Ombudsman Service and Financial Conduct Authority had a greater role to play in the protection of consumers and regulation of the industry, it said.\nAlistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"Buy Now Pay Later borrowing can be like quicksand - easy to unwittingly slip into and much more difficult to get out of. \n\"It shouldn't be possible for people to sign up for credit without realising, and the fact this is happening so often signals that a drastic overhaul is needed. \n\"This industry more than trebled in 2020, and while these products work for many shoppers, the regulator has rightly recognised the potential for harm. It must ensure robust consumer protection keeps pace with changes in how we shop,\" Mr Cromwell said.\nSeveral big - and smaller - names now operate in the fast-growing BNPL market, including Klarna, Clearpay, and Laybuy. PayPal launched a BNPL service last year.\nHowever, firms stress that not all operate to the same standards.\nAlex Marsh, UK head of the one of the most popular BNPL firms, Klarna, said: \"There is now a variety of buy now pay later providers in the market and the findings in this report do not represent the experiences of the more than 12 million consumers who choose to use Klarna's interest free, fee-free services each year. \n\"We make it crystal clear for our consumers at check out that this is a credit product, we perform a credit check each time they use our service, and we are available 24/7 to support the small number of customers who unfortunately find themselves in difficulty.\" \nAnother firm, Openpay, said it had strict rules to protect consumers. Andy Harding, the firm's UK managing director of payments said: \"Openpay has never run a marketing campaign specifically targeting young people and Openpay is never the default payment option at checkout - a practice that can lead to people using BNPL services unwittingly.\"\nHe added that Openpay has a financial hardship policy in place for any customers experiencing financial difficulty, including as a result of the coronavirus pandemic."

      "text": "The first people to arrive in the UK from India since the country was placed on the travel \"red list\" have entered hotel quarantine.\nBritish and Irish nationals and those with residency rights must isolate in approved accommodation for 10 days after rules changed overnight.\nIndia has seen a second wave of infections, with shortages of medical oxygen leaving some patients untreated.\nSome British Asians have spoken of the trauma of witnessing India's surge.\nMeeta Joshi, from Guildford, Surrey, described how she has lost nine close relatives and friends in India in the past week - four due to Covid.\n\"One was an aunt I have known since I was born\u2026 I was in communication with her regularly through mobile calls,\" she said. \n\"Life is so fragile and there is no guarantee. Until February, everything was looking fine in India.\"\nAshree Singh described \"a state of mental agony\" as relatives and friends sent worsening updates from the country on messaging apps.\nThe NHS worker who lives in London said she had a \"feeling of worthlessness and helplessness when you're seeing your family, relatives and friends suffering and dying\".\nOn Friday, India reported 332,730 new cases of coronavirus, setting a world record for a second day running. Deaths were numbered at 2,263 in 24 hours as crematoriums organise mass funeral pyres.\nPassengers from one of the first scheduled commercial flights to land in the UK from India since the red list changed were seen being escorted to government-approved hotels at London's Heathrow Airport on Friday afternoon.\nTV chef Romy Gill returned from India before the travel rules changed on Thursday and is isolating in a hotel in Bristol. She praised the UK government's handling of the rules for those returning from the country.\n\"I was in India last November and what has been done now is completely different,\" she said. \"I think the [UK] government is doing what they should have done ages ago.\"\nBut some have spoken of their struggle to leave India amid restrictions on travel and widespread flight cancellations.\nMukti Mulligan, from London but currently in Goa, told BBC Asian Network's Big Debate he lost out on tickets to return to the UK because his mandatory Covid test did not return within the time limit.\nHe said the situation in India was \"very worrying\" - though Goa seemed calmer than elsewhere - and he expressed surprise at how visible Covid was among his friends in their 20s and 30s.\n\"Even now a number of my friends are isolating, stuck in bed, most of them are not tested,\" he said. \"Almost certainly a vast majority have got Covid.\n\"We're talking about under 40s, mostly in their 20s and 30s. Pretty much everyone is affected in some way or another.\"\nDeepa Bajaj, an IT consultant living in London, travelled back to India in early March to visit her elderly parents in Mumbai.\nWhen the red list change was announced, she secured a seat on a return flight back to the UK - but her mandatory pre-departure Covid tests returned positive results.\n\"It was a bit shocking because I had no symptoms, I was being super careful, I don't even remember having gone out for the past five or six days,\" she told Asian Network.\nThe 53-year-old is now experiencing Covid symptoms including a sore throat and fever but hopes to return to the UK once her she recovers from the virus.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK stands \"ready to support our friends in India with whatever we can\". \n\"We are actively engaged with how we can support from where we are,\" he said.\nFriday's travel rule change means direct flights from India are still permitted, but UK and Irish nationals, as well as those with residency rights, must isolate in government-approved hotels - at their own cost - for 10 days.\nTravel to the UK is banned for all others who have been in red list countries in the past 10 days.\nThere are 40 countries on the government's red list across the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Countries can be added to the list with just a few hours' notice.\nThere are specific rules for people arriving in each UK nation, including England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nPublic Health England (PHE) confirmed on Thursday that a further 55 cases of the virus variant first identified in India - known as B.1.617 - were found in the UK in the latest week to 14 April.\nPHE experts are currently unsure whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity.\nMeanwhile, scientific advisers to the UK government are increasingly optimistic that Covid restrictions will continue to lift in line with the roadmap in England - with hints this could include ditching the requirement for face coverings in many indoor settings during the summer.\nBut there is an expectation that some of the precautions such as masks and social distancing, if eased over the summer, may have to be brought back in the autumn to prevent further surges of cases.\nThe latest R number range for England was estimated to be 0.8 to 1.0, with a growth rate indicating the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1% and 5% every day.\nThe UK reported a further 2,678 coronavirus cases on Friday. Another 40 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded, a slight rise on recent days. \nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

      "tags": "Germany",
      "text": "She did not break any rules, but Sarah Voss's full-body suit this week at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships defied convention.\nUntil now women and girls have only covered their legs in international competition for religious reasons.\nVoss, from Germany, said she was proud of her decision and she was supported by her country's gymnastics federation.\nTwo team-mates then did the same on Friday, wearing full-body suits during the women's all-around final.\nThe German federation (DTB) said its gymnasts performing in the Swiss city of Basel were taking a stand against \"sexualisation in gymnastics\", adding that the issue had become all the more important to prevent sexual abuse. \n\"We hope gymnasts uncomfortable in the usual outfits will feel emboldened to follow our example,\" said Voss.\nKim Bui had initially performed in a conventional leotard on Wednesday but said they had wanted to set an example as a team. Elisabeth Seitz said earlier that it was one less thing to worry about, as there was no risk of revealing anything by accident.\nVoss explained her decision in an interview with public broadcaster ZDF: \"We women all want to feel good in our skin. In the sport of gymnastics it gets harder and harder as you grow out of your child's body. As a little girl I didn't see the tight gym outfits as such a big deal. But when puberty began, when my period came, I began feeling increasingly uncomfortable.\"\nThe German federation said sport and gymnastics should be fields where female athletes felt comfortable in their clothing at all times.\nIn a message posted on Instagram on Thursday, Voss described the decision as a project \"close to the hearts of our team\". Her performance on the beam had not gone as well as she had hoped, she said, but her message won widespread praise. \"Feeling good and still looking elegant? Why not?\" she wrote.\nUnder the rules of the international gymnastics federation (FIG) competitors are allowed to wear a \"one-piece leotard with full-length legs - hip to ankle\", provided it is of elegant design.\nSeitz said everyone trained in full-body outfits and then at one point asked themselves why they should not do the same in competition.\nDutch Gymnastics has also praised the move. A spokesman told public broadcaster NOS that judges had often deducted points when a competitor had tried to make her leotard more comfortable during their performance.\nVoss said that while she had never herself been abused, she and her colleagues were role models for younger athletes and wanted to encourage everyone to stand up for themselves.\nUS gymnast Simone Biles, who has said she was sexually abused by jailed sports doctor Larry Nassar, said last week that one reason she was competing at the Tokyo Olympics this year was to speak out and give survivors of abuse a voice."

      "tags": "UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The cost of measures to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic has pushed government borrowing to the highest level since the end of World War Two.\nGovernment borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - hit \u00a3303.1bn in the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said.  \nCompared to the previous year, borrowing is nearly \u00a3250bn higher.\nMeasures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard.\nBorrowing hit \u00a328bn in March alone - a record high for that month.\nDespite the record figure, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Today programme the annual borrowing figure was \"slightly better than expected a month ago\".\nBut, he added: \"The big story in a sense is they [the borrowing figures] are \u00a3250bn more than a year ago.\n\"And that, of course, is because of to some extent the recession of the last year but mostly because of the huge amount of additional government spending to support the economy over the last year.\" \nGovernment borrowing of \u00a3303bn is at the same time, an extraordinary record, but also something a relief. \nFor starters it is not \u00a3400bn, as anticipated only a few months ago, though this number will go up when some Covid support loans fail to be repaid. \nBut its cause has been primarily an active government decision to spend more to support incomes during the pandemic. Of the \u00a3250bn difference in borrowing between this year and last, over \u00a3200bn comes from extra spending, the rest on a reduction in taxes.\nIn the latest reported month, March, taxes were barely down on last year. Whereas VAT, fuel duty and business rates were down, self assessment, PAYE, stamp duty and capital gains taxes were up. \nThat is part of a wider trend of the economy riding the second lockdown much more effectively than the first. It is epitomised by this morning's separate retail sales figures showing a boost even ahead of the physical reopening of shops.\nThe ONS suggested Britons wanted to look good and deck out their gardens ahead of some restrictions being lifted. Others, less charitable,  suggested lockdown excess meant our clothes no longer fit.\nThe chancellor's slimming regime for the public finances is a gentle one. Borrowing is predicted to continue at high levels this year, as jobs support continues until the autumn, and massive tax cuts are meant to persuade companies to invest in plant and machinery.\nIt is a rebound in growth that will most effectively shrink these record borrowing numbers. That is why amid the sea of red ink, there is some reason for relief.\nMeasures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic contributed to a \u00a3203.2bn, or 27.5%, increase in central government day-to-day spending in the year to March, the ONS said.\nMeanwhile, tax and National Insurance receipts fell by \u00a334.9bn, down 5% compared with the previous 12 months.\nThe ONS also said public borrowing as a percentage of GDP, or national output rose, to 14.5% - also the highest since the end of the second world war when it reached 15.2% in 1946.\nThe huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed public sector net debt up to \u00a32.142 trillion, which is 97.7% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s.\nMichal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG, said: \"Rising debt is largely an unfortunate consequence of the government's focus on shielding the economy as much as possible from the impact of Covid-19.\n\"However, doing otherwise could have created long-lasting scars which would be far worse for fiscal sustainability.\"\nDespite the record annual figure, the ONS said it was \u00a324.3bn lower than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the fiscal watchdog, had forecast in March.\nRuth Gregory at Capital Economics said: \"If we are right in thinking the economic recovery will be faster and fuller than the OBR anticipates, borrowing will probably fall more quickly than most expect.\"\nSeparate research published on Friday added to hopes of a swift rebound for the economy, as it suggested that the easing of lockdown measures this month has triggered a surge in activity among UK businesses.\nA closely watched survey, produced by IHS Markit/CIPS, indicated that the looser pandemic restrictions had led to the fastest UK private sector growth since late 2013.\nThe IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60 in April, according to initial findings, up from 56.4 in March. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion.\nThe service sector grew faster than manufacturing for the first time since the Covid pandemic began, the survey found, largely because of the reopening of non-essential shops in England and Wales from mid-April.\n\"Companies are reporting a surge in demand for both goods and services as the economy opens up from lockdowns and the encouraging vaccine rollout adds to a brighter outlook,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.\n\"Business activity should continue to grow strongly in May and June as virus restrictions are eased further, setting the scene for a bumper second quarter for the economy.\n\"There's also good news for the job market,\" he added. \"Firms have been encouraged to take on extra staff at a rate not seen for over three-and-a-half years.\n\"There are some causes for concern, however, as export performance remains relatively lacklustre, often linked to post-Brexit trading conditions, and prices continue to rise sharply.\""

      "tags": "Myanmar coup ,Myanmar,ASEAN",
      "text": "South East Asian leaders have urged the head of the Myanmar army, which took power in a coup in February, to end the violent crackdown in the country.\nIn his first known foreign trip since the takeover, General Min Aung Hlaing heard calls for the military to stop killing protesters and to release political prisoners.\nMore than 700 people have been killed and thousands detained since the coup.\nThe talks in Indonesia were the first big effort to address the crisis.\nA statement released after the summit said the leaders and foreign ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) had reached a consensus on five points.\nThey included asking for an immediate stop to the violence and opening a dialogue between the military and civilian leaders, with that process overseen by a special Asean envoy who would also visit with a delegation. The group also offered humanitarian assistance.\nThe consensus was welcomed by Myanmar's newly formed National Unity Government (NUG), a group made up of opponents of the coup - including pro-democracy figures, representatives of the armed ethnic groups and former members of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi's former government.\nAfter the meeting, which was held in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the general was \"not opposed\" to a visit by as Asean delegation or humanitarian assistance, adding: \"He said he heard us, he would take the points in which he considered helpful.\"\nMalaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin also called for unconditional release of political prisoners. Aung San Suu Kyi remains in detention, as well as anti-coup leaders. \n\"The deplorable situation in Myanmar must stop immediately,\" he said.\nDemonstrators gathered near the venue of the summit, beating pots and pans and holding signs that read \"Restore democracy\" and \"We stand against the military coup\". Protests were also held in Myanmar's main cities but there were no immediate reports of violence.\nAsean leaders have been widely criticised for inviting to their meeting the man responsible for overthrowing the elected government in Myanmar, and for unleashing savage violence on those opposed to his coup.\nThey may now argue that it was worth it; that by attending, Min Aung Hlaing has accepted the meeting's concluding statement calling for an end to the violence and the start of dialogue with an opposition movement that enjoys substantial popular support. The general was described by his Indonesian hosts only as the armed forces commander and not the head of a legitimate government.\nHowever, an appeal for the release of political prisoners was dropped from the final communique. Much detail remains to be hashed out on how dialogue will happen. But, in his first diplomatic encounter since his disastrous coup, Min Aung Hlaing, until now deaf to appeals for restraint, does appear to have agreed that his regime needs to change course. Asean member states fear that unless this happens, they may have a civil war, or even a failed state, on their doorstep.\nThis afternoon people across the commercial capital Yangon banged pots and pans to show their defiance of a military junta that has shocked the world by its brutality. Never before has Asean had to deal with a member state whose government faces such entrenched public hostility. It is a challenge the countries of this region, many of them undemocratic, are ill-equipped to meet.\nUnited Nation's Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres had called for the Asean summit to resolve the crisis and prevent \"possible grave humanitarian implications beyond Myanmar's borders,\" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. \nThere have been calls for Myanmar, also known as Burma, to be expelled from Asean but the members historically do not get involved in each other's internal affairs. \nThe UN special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, is in Jakarta for meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\nMass protests have been taking place across Myanmar since the military seized control and declared a year-long state of emergency.\nThe armed forces claim there had been widespread fraud during a general election late last year which had returned elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party (NLD) to power.\nThe military promised instead that it would hold \"free and fair\" elections once the state of emergency is over.\nIn the past few weeks, the military has been increasing its use of force against protesters. More than 80 people were killed in one incident in the city of Bago earlier this month. "

      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The chances of becoming infected by Covid fell sharply after a first dose of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines, a UK study has found.\nThe vaccines worked just as well in the over-75s and those with underlying health conditions, as other people.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) and University of Oxford research also found a strong antibody response in all age groups from either jab.\nEveryone showed some response to both vaccines, they said.\nThe research, contained in two studies which have not yet been peer-reviewed or published, is based on virus tests from 370,000 people in the general UK population - one of the largest to date.\nIt provides further real-world evidence that the vaccines being used in the UK to protect against Covid-19 are effective at protecting people against coronavirus infections.\nIn the first study, people who had been vaccinated with a single dose of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were 65% less likely to get a new Covid infection.\nThree weeks after their jab, given between December 2020 and early April 2021, infections with symptoms fell by 74%, while infections with no reported symptoms fell by 57%.\nThose who had received a second vaccine dose of Pfizer were 90% less likely to be infected. The same calculation could not be made for AZ, because too few people in the study had received a second dose as its rollout started later.\nThe study showed both vaccines were effective against the Kent variant (B117) which was circulating at the time. \nDr Koen Pouwels, senior researcher in University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Population Health, said the data backed up the decision to extend the gap between doses.\n\"The protection from new infections gained from a single dose supports the decision to extend the time between first and second doses to 12 weeks to maximise initial vaccination coverage, and reduce hospitalisations and deaths,\" he said.\nHowever, he said the figures showed there was still a chance vaccinated people could acquire Covid again and pass it to others, emphasising the need for social distancing and masks.\nThe second study, in nearly 46,000 adults who had been vaccinated with one dose, found strong antibody responses - a sign that the vaccines are stimulating the body's defence system to protect against the virus - in all age groups.\nThese antibody responses were \"broadly sustained out to 10 weeks afterwards\", the researchers said.\nAlthough antibody levels rose more slowly and to a lower level with a single dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca, they dropped more quickly after one Pfizer dose, particularly in older age groups.\nThere was a better response in younger adults compared with older adults over 60 with both jabs, but after two doses of Pfizer antibody levels were high across all ages, the study said.\nOne finding that surprised researchers was the amount by which the immune response shot up in the over-80s after a second dose - far more than in younger age groups.\nThe findings highlight the importance of people getting their second vaccine dose for increased protection, the researchers said.\nBut it is still not clear what the build-up of antibodies after a Covid vaccine actually means.\nProf Sarah Walker, chief investigator on the studies, from the University of Oxford, said: \"We don't yet know exactly how much of an antibody response, and for how long, is needed to protect people against getting Covid-19 in the long term - but over the next year, information from the survey should help us to answer these questions.\"\nBoth studies are based on data from the Covid-19 Infection Survey, a partnership between the University of Oxford, the ONS and the Department for Health and Social Care."

      "tags": "David Cameron,Public Accounts Committee,Greensill Capital,Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Lobbying",
      "text": "The Treasury has published 40 pages of messages relating to its contact with David Cameron and Greensill Capital.\nThe former PM is embroiled in a row over attempts to lobby top officials on behalf of the financial firm. \nIt had already come to light that Mr Cameron contacted the chancellor and two other ministers about Greensill.\nBut the emails also revealed former Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill \"connected\" Lex Greensill with the Treasury in March 2020.\nOther emails and texts - released as a result of a Freedom of Information request - showed contact between senior civil servants in the department and the former PM and financier.\nThey also showed the rejection letters for Greensill's appeal for access to government-backed loans during the pandemic.\nEarlier, the Bank of England said Mr Cameron had contacted it multiple times last year as the finance firm sought access to a Covid loan scheme.\nThe Treasury's top civil servant, Sir Tom Scholar, also told MPs Mr Cameron had called and texted him on his official phone.\nBut he added that Greensill's proposals were ultimately rejected.\nThree MP-led inquiries and a lawyer-led government review are looking at Mr Cameron's work for the company, which collapsed in March.\nThe former Conservative leader, who began working for Greensill as an adviser two years after leaving Downing Street, has insisted he broke no lobbying rules but accepted he should have contacted ministers using more formal channels.\nBut Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the correspondence showed the firm \"was carrying the begging bowl from the Bank of England to the Treasury and back\". \n\"We need to understand why Greensill Capital was given so much time and access to the Treasury, and why so much public money was put at risk.\"\nOn Wednesday, the Bank of England released details of contacts between Mr Cameron and its officials, in response to Freedom of Information requests. \nThey show the ex-PM contacted Bank officials before and after the firm applied to join a government scheme to support lending to businesses. \nAlongside the Treasury, the Bank had been running the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), set up in the early stages of the pandemic. \nGreensill had wanted the terms of the CCFF changed so it could take part - a request the Treasury went on to reject, after concluding the firm's proposals were not suitable. \nThe published correspondence from the Bank of England includes email exchanges with Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy governor. \nIn one email from early April, Mr Cameron told Sir Jon that Greensill had \"failed to get anywhere\" with its proposals, despite \"numerous conversations\" with the Treasury. \nIn another email to him later in the month, the ex-PM said Greensill's inability to access the scheme had proved \"incredibly frustrating\".\nRecords show a phone call later took place between Sir Jon and Lex Greensill, the firm's Australian founder, to discuss the firm's ideas further. \nThey show Sir Jon telling Mr Greensill his firm fell outside the \"boundaries of the scheme\" - and changing these would be a decision for the Treasury.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Sir Tom - the Treasury's permanent secretary - said Greensill Capital had \"persistently\" approached his department about being involved. \nGiving evidence to MPs on the the Public Accounts Committee, he added: \"We listened to what they said. We analysed it, we tested it and in the end, despite them submitting a series of successive proposals, we decided to reject them all.\"\nSir Tom, who previously worked for the former PM as a Europe adviser, told them Mr Cameron had rung him directly in April 2020, although the call did not include \"substantive discussion\" of Greensill's proposals.\n\"It was simply a call to draw it to my attention,\" he said, adding that Mr Cameron had his work phone number \"because I used to work with him\".\nAsked if he would have taken a call from a lobbyist if they hadn't been a former prime minister, Sir Tom said: \"I've also from time-to-time had calls from other senior people, maybe private sector people who I've previously worked with in another capacity.\"\nHe added: \"I think it's natural when somebody that you know asks to speak to you... it's quite natural to take that.\"\nThe second most senior official at the Treasury, Charles Roxburgh, told the committee he had met Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill at nine meetings spread out over four months from March to June 2020.\nMr Roxburgh told the committee civil servants would not have consulted on their proposals \"if we didn't think there was some potential - turns out there wasn't\"."

Russian authorities denied being behind the attack, but last December Navalny tricked an FSB agent into revealing that a Novichok agent had been placed in his underpants.\nNavalny was sent to a penal colony in February for over two and a half years, after a court ruled he had broken the terms of a suspended jail term, even though he had been in a coma. Russia rejected a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights that he should be freed because his life was at risk.\nThousands of Navalny supporters took to the streets of Russian cities on Wednesday and more than 1,700 were arrested.\nNavalny has complained of numbness and back pain and said he had not been given proper treatment by prison doctors.\nIn his message from the penal colony in Vladimir, east of Moscow, Navalny said he was still determined to be seen by a doctor of his choice. \"I am losing feeling in areas of my arms and legs, and I want to understand what it is and how to treat it,\" he said."

      "tags": "Sir James Dyson,Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Lobbying in the United Kingdom",
      "text": "Dominic Cummings has launched a blistering attack on his old boss Boris Johnson, questioning his \"competence and integrity\".\nThe former top adviser denied leaking text messages sent between Mr Johnson and businessman Sir James Dyson.\nAnd he claimed Mr Johnson once had a \"possibly illegal\" plan for donors to pay for renovations of the Downing Street flat.\nNo 10 said ministers had always obeyed codes of conduct and electoral law.\nMr Cummings was forced out of his Downing Street role at the end of last year, following an internal power struggle.\nOn Friday, in his first blog post since leaving that role, he also denied leaking details of the second Covid lockdown in England.\nThis is an explosive intervention from a man Boris Johnson used to count on as one of his closest allies. \nAnd if you're tempted to roll your eyes and think it's just sour grapes from a jilted adviser, think again. \nDominic Cummings' blog is proof that he is willing to lift the lid on his time at the heart of Downing Street, regardless of how it reflects on the prime minister. \nBeyond his denial of leaking text messages, he has also given his version of events relating to two potential political weak spots for Boris Johnson. \nThey are the questions over the financing of the renovation of the Downing Street flat and the leaking of a plan to impose a lockdown.\nThe level of detail shows that Mr Cummings is willing to expose others while defending himself and lay bare the inner workings of No 10.\nSeveral newspapers ran front page stories suggesting Mr Cummings was the source of leaked messages between Mr Johnson and Sir James Dyson, first reported this week by the BBC.\nThe BBC - whose political editor Laura Kuenssberg first reported on the text messages on Tuesday - said it did not discuss the sources of stories.\nAsked whether he had blamed his former adviser for it, Mr Johnson said: \"I don't think people give a monkey's, to be frank, about who is briefing what to who.\"\nNo 10 has launched an inquiry into who leaked the text messages.\nThe text exchange between Mr Johnson and Sir James happened in March last year, after the government asked companies to help build thousands of ventilators needed to deal with very ill patients.\nIn it, the prime minister agreed to \"fix\" concerns the businessman had about tax bills for his Singapore-based staff if they moved to the UK to do this.\nWriting on his blog, Mr Cummings said: \"I was not directly or indirectly a/the source for the BBC/Kuenssberg story on the PM/Dyson texts.\"\nHe adds: \"I am happy to meet with the cabinet secretary and for him to search my phone for Dyson messages.\"\nMr Cummings continues that he is \"happy for No 10 to publish every email I received and sent July 2019-November 2020\".\nHe also calls for an \"urgent parliamentary inquiry into the government's conduct over the Covid crisis\", adding that he thinks Mr Johnson has fallen \"far below\" the standards of \"competence\" the \"country deserves\".\nMr Cummings promises to answer questions about \"any\" issues when he appears before a parliamentary inquiry into the government's pandemic response on 26 May.\nIn his blog, Mr Cummings also claimed the prime minister once planned to have donors \"secretly pay\" for renovation of his official Downing street flat. \nLike several of his recent predecessors, the PM is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, which is larger than the one above No 10.\nHe adds that Mr Johnson \"stopped speaking to me about the matter in 2020\", as he told him the renovation plans were \"unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended\".\nMr Cummings says he would be \"happy to tell the cabinet secretary or Electoral Commission\" what he knew about the matter but that his knowledge is \"limited\". \nIn response to Mr Cummings's claims, a No 10 spokesperson said: \"At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law.\n\"Cabinet Office officials have been engaged and informed throughout and official advice has been followed.\n\"All reportable donations are transparently declared and published - either by the Electoral Commission or the House of Commons registrar, in line with the requirements set out in electoral law.\n\"Gifts and benefits received in a ministerial capacity are, and will continue to be, declared in transparency returns.\"\nEarlier on Friday, the government said that \"costs of wider refurbishment in this year have been met by the Prime Minister personally.\" \nLabour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the issue needed \"investigating in full\". \nDenying being the source of a leak last year ahead of the second Covid lockdown in November, Mr Cummings says an inquiry at the time found that neither he nor the then-Downing Street director of communications, Lee Cain, had been responsible.\nHe adds that the events around that inquiry \"contributed to [his] decision to stick to [his] plan to leave No 10 by 18 December\", which he says were \"communicated to the prime minister in July\".\nIn his blog, Mr Cummings also claimed Mr Johnson had considered stopping the inquiry.\nHe wrote that he recalled a meeting between Mr Johnson and the cabinet secretary at the time, after an inquiry had been launched, at which the cabinet secretary allegedly said \"all the evidence definitely leads to Henry Newman and others in that office\".\nAt the time, Mr Newman was a special adviser at the Cabinet Office. He took up a role in Downing Street earlier this year. \nMr Cummings claims that, in a conversation he had with the PM afterwards, Boris Johnson said: \"If Newman is confirmed as the leaker then I will have to fire him, and this will cause me very serious problems with Carrie [Symonds - the PM's fiancee] as they're best friends\u2026 [pause] perhaps we could get the cabinet secretary to stop the leak inquiry?\"\nIn response to Mr Cummings' claims, a Downing Street statement said: \"The prime minister has never interfered in a government leak inquiry.\"\nAnd a senior government official said: \"The allegations against Henry Newman are entirely false. He wouldn't be working in Downing Street if he was suspected of leaking information.\"\nEarlier, Downing Street declined to comment on \"speculation\" that Mr Cummings - who quit his government job last November after a row over his role as the PM's chief adviser - had leaked the texts.\nOn a visit to Derbyshire, Mr Johnson said anyone who thought there was something \"dodgy or rum\" in his dealings with Sir James Dyson was \"out of their mind\"."

      "tags": "Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Healthcare workers have welcomed a change in scientific advice on how to protect them from coronavirus.  \nA document by the government's scientific advisory group (Sage) says higher grade masks may be needed when caring for Covid patients.\nCurrent guidance says that thinner surgical masks are adequate, outside of intensive care units. \nThe Department of Health said guidance \"is kept under constant review\" and protecting NHS staff was a priority.\nSome doctors described it as a \"crack of light\" after more than a year of campaigning for improvements.\nA long list of healthcare unions and professional bodies has been making increasingly desperate appeals for what are called FFP3 respirators.\nThese are designed to filter out infectious aerosols that may be lingering in the air, particularly in close proximity to patients.\nGrowing evidence of the risks of airborne transmission has led the government to emphasise the importance of ventilation - with the words \"fresh air\" now added to the public messaging.\nAnd now a technical document released by Sage concludes that healthcare workers may need higher standards of respiratory protective equipment (RPE). \nIt says that where there's \"an unacceptable risk of transmission\", and other measures have already been applied, \"it may be necessary to consider the extended use of appropriate RPE (such as FFP3 masks)\".\nDr Matt Butler, a consultant in geriatrics in Cambridge, said: \"This is huge, it's the first time they've acknowledged this, it's a crack of light.\"\nHe has long argued that surgical masks don't offer enough protection against aerosols, and that FFP3 masks should instead be issued to all medics caring for confirmed or suspected Covid patients. \nAs the guidance stands, they are only worn in intensive care units or where certain \"aerosol generating procedures\" are carried out.\nThe new scientific assessment has yet to be adopted by the authorities in charge of the rules on PPE. \nBut Dr Butler hopes that will follow, and that the lull in the numbers being admitted to hospital will allow stocks of the devices to be built up and for staff to be fitted for them.\n\"We've got a bit of reprieve until the next wave or peak, so now's the time to get ready,\" he said.\nAt least 23 hospital trusts have broken with the official guidelines by giving the Covid-facing staff FFP3 masks. \nDr Eilir Hughes, a GP in north Wales who helped to set up the FreshAirNHS campaign group, says the shift in scientific advice marks a significant moment.\n\"It feels like a door that was locked has now been opened, at least slightly, and it sounds like the science on airborne transmission is starting to be recognised.\"\nThe Sage document points out that FFP3 masks are \"intrusive and can be uncomfortable to wear\".\nAnd it warns that they need to be properly worn and can give a false sense of security, with a risk of self-contamination as staff touch them or remove them.\nThis follows multiple official reviews which have concluded that there is no need to change policy on PPE. \nThe Royal College of Nursing's professional lead for infection prevention and control, Rose Gallagher, said: \"This is a step in the right direction.\n\"What we need is for the UK's infection prevention and control guidance to reflect this change, so that health and care organisations feel confident they can apply it in line with local circumstances and risks.\n\"We have heard many reports from our members that their employers do not feel able to deviate from the letter of national guidance for fear of being criticised.\n\"We hope that this change will empower to them to find local solutions that offer a greater level of protection to nurses, midwives and patients.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The safety of NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work round the clock to deliver PPE that helps protect those on the frontline.\n\"Guidance on the appropriate levels and standards of PPE is written by experts and agreed by all four UK chief medical officers.\n\"Our guidance is kept under constant review based on the latest evidence.\"\nFollow David on Twitter."

      "text": "US health regulators have lifted an 11-day pause on the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Covid-19 jab, but will add a warning label about the potential for extremely rare blood clots.\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panel earlier approved restarting US rollout of the shot. \nFifteen vaccine recipients suffered from a dangerous blood clot out of nearly eight million given the jab. \nThis week, Europe's drug regulator also ended restrictions on the J&J vaccine. \nEuropean regulators this month also linked similar, highly unusual blood clots to the AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot, but found the benefits of the drug outweighed any risks.\nOn Friday afternoon, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration swiftly followed the recommendation of the CDC advisory panel after it voted 10-4 to continue rolling out the vaccine for people 18 years of age and older in line with its original authorisation.\nThe decision means at least 10 million doses of the J&J vaccine, shipped from the company's factory in the Netherlands, can be deployed across the US immediately. \nThe health officials on Friday identified nine more cases of the blood clots, adding to six cases already identified since regulators first approved the jab as safe and effective in February.\nAll were women, most under the age of 50. Three died and seven remain in hospital.\nAbout a dozen of the cases affected women aged 30-39. Seven of the women were obese, two had high blood pressure, and two were using oral contraceptives, according to health officials. \nCDC officials who presented the data on Friday said a few cases of blood clots in men were being reviewed, too.\nThe officials also said it was important for women be told about the potential risks of the vaccine so they could decide whether to seek alternatives.\nDr Sarah Long, of Drexel University College of Medicine, was among the panel members who voted against the proposal because she thought it did not go far enough in warning women. \n\"This is an age group that is most at risk [of the blood clot] that is getting vaccine predominantly to save other peoples' lives and morbidity, not their own,\" she told AP new agency. \"And I think we have a responsibility to be certain that they know this.\"\nSymptoms can arise within three weeks of vaccination and include acute headaches, shortness of breath, and leg and abdominal pain. \nUS health officials are warning doctors that heparin, a common treatment for blood clots, can worsen the vaccine-linked condition.\nThe US paused use of the single-dose shot earlier this month over a few reports of blood clotting in the brain post-vaccine among US women. \nFollowing the advice, all federal sites in the US stopped using the vaccine. \nIt was not the first setback for J&J in its US coronavirus vaccine rollout. Last month, the ingredients for up to 15 million doses of the pharmaceutical giant's vaccine were ruined at a Baltimore facility.\nFederal inspectors this week identified a series of problems at the Emergent BioSolutions plant, including cleanliness and safety issues."

      "text": "Japan has announced emergency Covid measures in Tokyo and three other areas in a bid to curb rising infections, just three months before the country is set to host the Olympics. \nThe government said the state of emergency - set to last for about two weeks - would be \"short and powerful\".\nUnder the measures, bars will be required to close and big sporting events will be held without spectators. \nThe government has insisted that the Olympics will go ahead in July.\nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced the measures on Friday, saying they would begin on Sunday and remain in place until 11 May. In addition to Tokyo, the prefectures of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo will be affected. \nIt marks the third state of emergency in Japan since the pandemic began. \n\"I sincerely apologise for causing trouble for many people again,\" he said. \"It is feared that contagion in major cities will spread across the whole country if we take no measures.\"\nUnder the rules, major commercial facilities like department stores will close, as well as restaurants, bars, and karaoke parlours serving alcohol.\nRestaurants that do not serve alcohol are being told to close early, and companies are being asked to make arrangements for people to work remotely. Schools will remain open.\nThe emergency measures coincide with the country's \"Golden Week\" holiday, which runs from late April to the first week of May and is the busiest travel period of the year.\nTokyo Governor Yuriko Koike urged residents to start taking precautions immediately. In an effort to discourage people from going out at night, she said illuminations and neon signs would be turned off. \nThe coronavirus toll in Japan has been much lower than in many other countries, with about 558,000 cases and fewer than 10,000 deaths, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University.\nBut there are concerns over the latest rise in infections, with reports of hospital bed shortages in some areas.\nTokyo 2020 president Seiko Hashimoto said at a news conference on Friday that organisers were not considering cancelling the event. \n\"I hope the coronavirus situation improves with the countermeasures the government, Tokyo, and other regional governments have put into place,\" she said.\n\"We, as Tokyo 2020, continue to wish for the swift return to normalcy and will continue to work closely with the relevant parties to make sure a safe and secure Olympics can happen.\""

      "title": "A nightmare on repeat - India is running out of oxygen again",
      "tags": "Asia,Oxygen,Maharashtra,India,Pune,New Delhi,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Twenty-five families in India's capital Delhi woke up to the news on Friday morning that someone they loved had died in the city's Sir Ganga Ram hospital, reportedly because coronavirus patients could not get enough oxygen. \nThe hospital's medical director said a severe shortfall had slowed the flow of oxygen to 25 of the sickest patients, who needed a high pressure, stable supply.\nThe tragedy came at the end of a week where several major hospitals in Delhi have repeatedly come close to running out of oxygen, which can help patients with the virus who need support with their breathing stay alive. \nOn Tuesday, it took a desperate public plea from the chief minister and an intervention from the high court for the Indian central government to organise a late night refill. \nAn oxygen tanker eventually arrived at Sir Ganga Ram hospital on Friday morning, shortly after a dire warning that 60 more patients were on the verge of death. \nBut India's rising wave of cases is pushing its healthcare system to the brink - from the country's richest cities to its remotest corners. \nMaharashtra and Gujarat in the west, Haryana in the north, and Madhya Pradesh in central India are all facing an oxygen shortage. \nIn the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, some hospitals have put \"oxygen out of stock\" boards outside, and in the state capital Lucknow hospitals have asked patients to move elsewhere. \nSmaller hospitals and nursing homes in Delhi are doing the same. Desperate relatives in several cities are lining up outside oxygen refilling centres. One plant in the southern city of Hyderabad hired bouncers to manage the crowd. \nMany stricken with coronavirus are dying while they wait. Hospitals are struggling to accommodate breathless patients, or even keep alive those who were lucky enough to find a bed. Social media feeds and WhatsApp groups are full of frantic pleas for oxygen cylinders.\nFor a week, India has been reliving this nightmare on repeat, waiting for the terrifying moment when there is no oxygen left at all.\nFor anyone who has watched the pandemic unfold here - from doctors to officials to journalists - this feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Seven months ago, the country had grappled with a similar oxygen shortage amid a rapid surge in case numbers. But this time, it's much worse. \nTypically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply, leaving the rest for industrial use. But amid India's second wave nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. \nThat's nearly three times higher than was consumed every day at the peak of the first wave in mid-September last year.  \nThen, India was adding about 90,000 cases daily. Just two weeks ago, in early April, the single-day spike was around 144,000. Now, the daily caseload has more than doubled to well more than 300,000. \n\"The situation is so bad that we had to treat some patients in a cardiac ambulance for 12 hours until they could get an ICU bed,\" said Dr Siddheshwar Shinde, who runs a Covid hospital in Pune, a western district with India's second-highest active caseload and third-highest death toll from the virus. \nLast week, when there were no ventilators left, Dr Shinde began moving patients to other cities - unheard of in Pune, where patients usually arrive from nearby districts seeking treatment. \nThe state of Maharashtra, where Pune is located, is among the worst-affected parts of India, and currently accounts for more than a third of active cases. The state is producing about 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen daily but all of it is already being used for Covid patients. \nAnd demand is rising along with cases, and outstripping supply. It shows no signs of letting up.  \n\"Usually hospitals like ours were able to have enough oxygen supply. But in the past fortnight, keeping people breathing has become a task. Patients as young as 22 need oxygen support,\" said Dr Shinde.\nDoctors and epidemiologists believe the deluge of cases is delaying tests and consultation, leading to many people being admitted to hospital when their condition is severe. So the demand for high-flow oxygen - and therefore more oxygen - is higher than it was during the last wave.\n\"Nobody knows when this is going to end,\" Dr Shinde said. \"I think even the government did not foresee this.\"\nSome governments did. The southern state of Kerala increased supply by monitoring demand closely and planning for a rise in cases. Kerala now has surplus oxygen that it is sending to other states. \nBut Delhi and some other states do not have their own oxygen plants and are relying on imports. \nThe Supreme Court has weighed in, asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration for a national Covid plan that addresses the oxygen crunch.  \nThe federal health ministry had invited bids for new oxygen plants in October last year - more than eight months after the beginning of pandemic in India. Of the 162 that were sanctioned, only 33 have been installed so far - 59 will be installed by the end of April and another 80 by the end of May, the ministry has said. \nThe scramble to increase supply points to the lack of any emergency plan. \nLiquid oxygen, pale blue and extremely cold, with a temperature of around -183C, is a cryogenic gas that can only be stored and transported in special cylinders and tankers. \nAbout 500 factories in India extract and purify oxygen from air and send it to hospitals in liquid form. Most of it is supplied through tankers. \nMajor hospitals usually have their own tank where oxygen is stored and then piped directly to beds. Smaller and temporary hospitals rely on steel and aluminium cylinders. \nOxygen tankers often queue outside a plant for hours and it takes about two hours to fill one tanker. It takes several hours more for these tankers to travel to various towns within or across states. \nThe tankers also have to follow a specific speed limit - no more than 25mph (40km/h) - and they often don't travel in the night to avoid accidents. \nThe head of one of India's biggest oxygen suppliers has said part of the struggle has been getting oxygen from eastern India, where supply in industrial states such as Orissa and Jharkhand is high, to western or northern India such as Maharashtra or Delhi, where cases are rising fast. \nAnd the demand for oxygen at individual facilities is unpredictable, making it difficult to gauge a hospital's requirement and adequately get supply where it is needed.\n\"Not every patient needs the same amount of oxygen for the same duration. How many patients need oxygen changes by hour in a hospital,\" said Dr Om Shrivastav, an infectious diseases expert at a Mumbai hospital. \n\"We are taking all the care we can. But I've not seen anything like this. I think nobody here has.\"\nBefore the crunch of the oxygen crisis, the federal government was already facing criticism for allowing election rallies and a massive Hindu festival, and failing to expand the vaccination drive quickly enough. Critics have accused various state governments of doing too little to prepare for the devastating second wave now washing through the county.\nDoctors and virologists who spoke to the BBC said the oxygen shortfall was more a symptom than a cause of the crisis - effective safety protocols and strong public messaging could have kept more people at home, and the virus at bay. \nBut a sharp drop in cases by January lulled the country into a false sense of safety, they said, creating the conditions for a terrible second wave. \nMr Modi's government has now started an \"oxygen express\", with trains carrying tankers to wherever there is demand, and the Indian Air Force is airlifting oxygen from military bases. They are also mulling plans to import 50,000 metric tonnes of of liquid oxygen. \n\"We have been telling authorities that we are willing to increase our capacity, but we need financial aid for that,\" said Rajabhau Shinde, who runs a small oxygen plant in Maharashtra. \n\"Nobody said anything and now suddenly, hospitals and doctors are pleading for more cylinders,\" he said. \n\"This should not have happened. As the saying goes, dig the well before you're thirsty. But we didn't do that.\"\nHave you been affected by any of the issues raised in this story?

Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has told a major summit that we are in a \"decisive decade\" for tackling climate change.\nThe US has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by the year 2030. \nThis new target, which was unveiled at a virtual summit of 40 global leaders, essentially doubles their previous promise.\nBut the leaders of India and China, two of the world's biggest emitters, made no new commitments.\n\"Scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade - this is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis,\" President Biden said at the summit's opening address.\n\"We must try to keep the Earth's temperature to an increase of 1.5C. The world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heatwaves and hurricanes - tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods.\"\nHe said there was a moral and economic imperative to immediately act on climate change.\nReferring to America's new carbon-cutting pledge, President Biden added: \"The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting.\n\"The US isn't waiting, we are resolving to take action.\"\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg, who was testifying before Congress on Thursday, challenged world leaders to do more on the climate crisis.\n\"Unlike you, my generation will not give up without a fight,\" she said. \"How long do you honestly believe that people in power will get away with it?\"\nThe UK is playing a critical role this year as president of the crucial COP26 later this year. The government is tasked with achieving agreement in Glasgow when world leaders meet there in November.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson was in ebullient form on his virtual conference address. He assured global leaders that tackling climate change was \"not bunny-hugging\".\nAt the summit, Mr Johnson called President Biden's announcement about cutting US greenhouse gas emissions \"game-changing\".\n\"We can do this together across the world. It's going to mean the richest nations coming together and exceeding the $100bn commitment they already made in 2009,\" he said.\nClimate has been the central focus of the Biden administration's first few months in office. \nAs well as re-joining the Paris climate pact and organising Thursday's summit, the Biden team has been working on a strong pledge to convince the world that they mean business.\nThe fact that President Biden is prepared to go beyond a 50% cut will be a welcome surprise to many scientists and campaigners. \n\"By announcing a bold target of cutting emissions 50-52% below 2005 by the end of the decade, President Biden has met the moment and the urgency that the climate crisis demands,\" said Nathaniel Keohane from the US Environmental Defense Fund.\n\"This target aligns with what the science says is necessary to put the world on the path to a safer climate, and vaults the US into the top tier of world leaders on climate ambition.\"\nBut the new pledge will mean major changes to the American way of life. Coal will have to disappear from the electricity mix, while gas guzzling cars and trucks will have to go electric.\nOthers stepping up with new promises included Canada, Japan and South Korea.\nBut Canada's promise to limit carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 came in for immediate criticism from campaigners.\n\"Canada's new 2030 emissions reduction target is stronger than its previous commitment, but it falls short of what is needed to avoid dangerous levels of warming,\" said Helen Mountford from the World Resources Institute.\n\"Canada's efforts to deliver real action on the ground are welcome, like placing a price on carbon pollution, but the country should aim for a much more ambitious goal than what it put forward today.\"\nMeanwhile, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshide Suga said the country was \"ready to demonstrate its leadership\" on the climate.\nMr Suga said that Japan would reduce emissions by 46% in 2030 compared to 2013 levels. Previously, the country had pledged only a 26% cut in emissions.\nSouth Korea also pledged a new target and said they would stop financing the building of coal-fired power stations overseas.\nBut China made no new pledges but hinted that coal, which is set to grow again as the economy recovers from Covid, will be tackled in the next few years.\n\"We will strictly control the coal-fired power generation projects,\" the country's President Xi Jinping told the gathering.\n\"We will strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th five-year plan period and phase it down in the 15th five-year plan period.\"\nHowever, that's likely to be after 2026.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China will be responsible for around half the growth in coal around the world this year, as economies recover from Covid.\nIndia's Prime Minister Modi stressed that his country's per capita emissions were 60% lower than the global average.\nHe said that lifestyle changes should play a bigger role in limiting climate change. However he made no new promises on curbing emissions.\nPresident Biden's team is also urging countries that have been slow to embrace action on climate change - such as Australia and Brazil - to raise their ambition.\nBrazil and Australia's sceptical approach to the issue had found favour in the Trump White House. But that's no longer the case.\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Asia,Mumbai,India coronavirus lockdown,Delhi,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Rajeshwari Devi, 58, died on Sunday after waiting for two days to get uninterrupted oxygen, an ambulance and a bed in a Covid-19 hospital.\nShe kept waiting and gasping but it was too late by the time help arrived. She was taken to a hospital emergency room on 16 April after her oxygen saturation level dropped. Her CT scan showed that she had developed severe pneumonia.\nBut without her Covid report the hospital refused to admit her. She spent around 36 hours in the emergency room on oxygen support in the northern Indian district of Robertsganj. The staff there told her family they were running out of oxygen and she needed to be moved to a bigger hospital but there was no ambulance or any promise of a bed. \nThe desperate family took her in their car to a hospital where a bed had become available after the intervention of a politician. She had no oxygen support in the car - she died minutes before she could be admitted to hospital. \nAshish Agrahari, her son, says his mother \"would have had a chance at survival if treatment was given in time\".\nHeartbreaking stories such as this are coming in from across India as a second Covid wave wreaks havoc. Data suggests that this wave is proving to be more infectious and deadlier in some states, although India's death rate from the virus is still relatively low. \nBut the county's healthcare system is crumbling amid the surge in cases - doctors say it's hard for them to \"see the light at the end of the tunnel this time\".  \nThe rise in case numbers has been exponential in the second wave. \nOn 18 June last year, India recorded 11,000 cases and in the next 60 days, it added 35,000 new cases on average every day. \nOn 10 February, at the start of the second wave, India confirmed 11,000 cases - and in the next 50 days, the daily average was around 22,000 cases. But in the following 10 days, cases rose sharply with the daily average reaching 89,800.\nExperts say this rapid increase shows that the second wave is spreading much faster across the country. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of Kerala state's Covid taskforce, said the rise was not entirely unexpected given that India let its guard down when daily infections in January fell to fewer than 20,000 from a peak of over 90,000 in September.\nBig religious gatherings, the reopening of most public places and crowded election rallies are being blamed for the uptick. Dr Fathahudeen said there were warning signs in February but \"we did not get our act together\".\n\"I said in February that Covid had not gone anywhere and a tsunami would hit us if urgent actions were not taken. Sadly, a tsunami has indeed hit us now,\" he added.\n\"A false sense of normalcy crept in and everybody, including people and officials, did not take measures to stop the second wave.\"\nMany Indian cities are reporting a chronic shortage of hospital beds. It's also evident in the desperate cries for help on social media platforms. Disturbing reports of people dying without getting timely treatment are coming from all over the country.\nSeveral state governments say they are creating new facilities but experts say it's going to be hard to keep up with the pace of the rising number of infections.\nIndia has been consistently reporting more than 150,000 cases for days now. It reported 273,810 cases on Monday - the biggest daily spike since the pandemic began.\nBadly-affected cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad have almost run out of hospital beds. \nThe situation is not very different in other cities, such as Lucknow, Bhopal, Kolkata, Allahabad and Surat. Public health expert Anant Bhan says officials did not use the lean period to boost facilities.\n\"We didn't learn any lesson from the first wave. We had reports of some cities running out of beds even in the first wave and that should have been a good enough reason to be prepared for the second wave,\" he said.\nHe adds that there appears to be a lack of co-ordination between states and the federal government over the supply of oxygen and essential drugs. \"We need a consolidated response and resources should be shared between states.\" \nThe situation is much more dire when it comes to ICU beds. Several cities have just a few dozen ICU beds left and they are now frantically trying to build extra capacity in hotels and stadiums.\nBut getting ICU beds up and running quickly is not easy. Dr Fathahudeen says adding beds alone is not enough. \"We need to ensure that most of these beds have oxygen facility. We need more doctors and nurses to manage extra ICU beds,\" he adds.\nHe says it's going to be a \"daunting task\" for the government to get such facilities up and running and ensure good quality of care in a short span of time.\nThe number of daily deaths has risen sharply in the second wave. India reported 1,761 deaths on Monday, taking the toll to over 180,000 since the pandemic began.\nCrematoriums have been running day and night in several cities, and people have to wait for hours to get the deceased cremated or buried.\nExperts say this shows that the actual number of deaths could be much higher. \nSanjeev Gupta, a photojournalist based in the central Indian city of Bhopal, reached one of the city's crematoriums for what he thought was a usual assignment last week. \nBhopal had reported only four Covid-related deaths on that day. But Mr Gupta was surprised to see dozens of funeral pyres burning. Additionally, several bodies were lined up to be cremated in the electric furnace. \nMr Gupta says he was moved when a young man asked him to photograph the smoke coming out from the chimney of the electric crematorium. \n\"He said the smoke represented his mother. It's the most heartbreaking thing I have ever heard.\"\nAnother photojournalist in Lucknow, which is the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, told the BBC that he counted nearly 100 funeral pyres burning at one of the city's crematoriums in the city on 14 April. The official death data for the whole state on that day was 85.\n\"The sky had turned orange near the crematorium. I still get chills thinking about it. We are definitely not getting the right death data from the government,\" he said.\nAnother photojournalist the BBC spoke to in Varanasi city in Uttar Pradesh state also talked about similar discrepancies in how deaths were being reported. \nExperts say there are several reasons for this. One of them is that many people are dying at home because they are not getting hospital beds or they are not being able to get tested for Covid. So, they don't find a place as a Covid patient in the database managed by different states. \nMr Bhan says testing facilities are still poor in smaller towns and even in some cities and \"it's possible we are missing many Covid-related deaths in these areas\".\nHe adds that there seems to be an issue with recording Covid deaths in some states. There have been reports about administrative oversight as well but officials deny the allegation. \n\"We need more transparency in numbers as it helps in managing the situation and also clearly tells you how severe the situation is,\" Mr Bhan adds. \nIndia on 25 March announced that a new variant of the coronavirus had been detected from samples collected from different states.\nVirologist Shahid Jameel explained that a \"double mutation in key areas of the virus's spike protein may make the virus more infectious and allow it to escape the immune system\".\nHe says the change in the virus is the only \"logical explanation\" behind the surge. Health officials in the UK are now investigating whether a double mutant spreads more easily and evades vaccines. \nAs things stand there is still not enough evidence to determine any causal relationship with India's deadly second wave, and the variant is not currently listed by Public Health England as a \"variant of concern\" - a term used to describe the UK, Brazilian and South African variants.\nDr Jameel adds that India started looking at mutations \"fairly late\". \"By December, India had done genome sequencing of only 5,000 samples. It wasn't a concentrated effort.\"\nIn January, India put together a group of labs to speed up sequencing and these labs started functioning in February. \"But unfortunately, the second wave started and the vision of sequencing roughly 5% of the total samples did not come through.\"\nSequencing becomes important in a pandemic as it allows scientists to monitor changes in the virus. \"If you can catch a more infectious variant early on in a region, you can quickly put in public health measures to stop it from spreading wider in the community,\" he explains.\nBut it's \"never too late\" to take measures. \"We need to strengthen safety protocols and rapidly vaccinate people, and also keep an eye on mutations. If we do all this, we could reduce numbers significantly.\""
