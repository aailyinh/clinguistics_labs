      "text": "Police Scotland has launched a formal investigation into the SNP's finances after receiving complaints about how donations to the party were used.\nQuestions had been raised about funds given to the party for use in a fresh independence referendum campaign.\nSeven people made complaints to the police, which has set up a probe following talks with prosecutors.\nFirst minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon had insisted that she was \"not concerned\" about the party's finances.\nShe said \"every penny\" of cash raised in online crowdfunding campaigns would be spent on the independence drive.\nIt came after MP Douglas Chapman quit as SNP treasurer, saying he had not been given enough financial information to do the job, and fellow MP Joanna Cherry quit the party's management board amid a row over \"transparency and scrutiny\".\nPolice Scotland had previously been assessing complaints made by a member of the public. The force says that a full inquiry has now been launched.\nA spokesman said: \"Police Scotland has now received seven complaints in relation to donations that were made to the Scottish National Party.\n\"After assessment and consultation with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, we will now carry out an investigation.\n\"Inquiries are continuing and anyone who has any information which may assist with this investigation is asked to contact police.\"\nThe SNP said it will \"cooperate fully with any investigation\".\nAccording to a recent statement, the SNP raised a total of \u00a3666,953 through referendum-related appeals between 2017 and 2020.\nThe party pledged to spend these funds on the independence campaign, but questions were raised after its accounts showed it had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\nTreasurer Colin Beattie - a former MSP who returned to the post after Mr Chapman's resignation - said the funds had been \"earmarked\" when they were donated, and that a matching amount would ultimately be spent on referendum campaigning.\nHe said: \"We will ensure that an amount equivalent to the sums raised from these appeals will go directly to our work to secure a referendum and win independence.\n\"We are taking a very strict approach to ensuring that this income supports expenditure directly related to the campaign for independence.\"\nThis echoed comments from Ms Sturgeon, who said the party runs its independently-audited budget on a \"cash flow\" basis and is under no obligation to keep funds in separate accounts.\nShe said: \"Every penny we raise to support the campaign for independence will be spent on the campaign for independence.\""

      "text": "People are continuing to leave messages of support and solidarity at the vandalised mural of Marcus Rashford. \nThe artwork in Withington, Manchester, was defaced following England's defeat by Italy in the Euro 2020 final.\nRashford said he was \"on the verge of tears\" when he saw the mural had been covered in supportive messages.\nThe street artist Akse, who created the portrait, has now repaired the damage but it has yet to be decided what will happen to the messages of support.\nThe mural was defaced with several swear words shortly after Rashford missed a penalty, along with Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka, in the 3-2 shootout loss.\nAll three players have since been targeted with racist abuse on social media.\nRashford said he was sorry for missing his penalty, adding that he \"wished it had gone differently\" but then paid tribute to those who added messages on the mural.\n\"The communities that always wrapped their arms around me continue to hold me up,\" the Manchester United forward tweeted.\n\"I'm Marcus Rashford, 23 years old, black man from Withington and Wythenshawe, South Manchester.\"\nGreater Manchester Police said an investigation had begun after it received a report of racially aggravated damage at the site at 02:50 BST on Monday.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to hold a meeting with social media firms regarding taking tougher action over racism.\nWithington Walls co-founder Ed Wellard, who commissioned the artwork, said those responsible for the vandalism should be educated rather than punished.\nHe said he hoped \"something positive might come of it\" as people were now \"talking about the issue of racism in this country\".\n\"There's a lot of solidarity to these players, they've been fine role models on and off the pitch,\" he said.\nA crowdfunding page for the mural has now raised more than \u00a330,000, which Mr Wellard said would be used to fund further artwork.\nThe mural, based on a photograph by Daniel Cheetham, is painted on the side of the Coffee House Cafe on Copson Street. \nPeter Doherty, 46, who has owned the cafe for 12 years, said of the abusive graffiti: \"It's not right. It's not the first time this has happened either.\n\"It takes such guts to get up and take a penalty. We need to take a look at ourselves as England fans.\n\"You'd think after the year we've had we'd be hugging each other, not hating each other.\"\nBrothers Ezra and Dylan are among those who added a message of support after being \"disgusted\" by the vandalism.\n\"He stood up for kids and he stood up for what he believes in and he has been a role model for my two boys and for a lot of people around the country,\" said their father Tom. \n\"It's a brave thing to do to step up and take a penalty under all that pressure and it's very easy to criticise someone from the sidelines. \n\"We felt awful about what happened. And if you can come and show your support then that's a little thing that you can do to make a difference.\"\nNine-year-olds Noor and Tarza are pupils at Old Moat Primary School - the same school Rashford attended - and said they came to show their support for him.\n\"We were really sad about [the graffiti] - he was trying his best,\" Tarza said.\n\"He's so strong and I think he loves love hearts, but if he doesn't then that's okay,\" she added.\n\"He is so kind,\" Noor added.\nNathalie, 45, from Manchester, brought her four-year-old son Charlie to the mural to \"show their love\". \n\"Racism won't win. No 23-year-old deserves this,\" she said.\nTheir handwritten note read: \"We stand with you. Love will always win. We are so proud of you.\"\nNine-year-old Jacob, from St Helens in Merseyside, also travelled to the mural to add a note which read: \"Thanks for everything. Keep up the good work. You are a hero and legend.\"\nEarlier this month, Rashford sent him a surprise present to thank him for his charity work.\nFollow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Durban,South Africa,Johannesburg,Jacob Zuma",
      "text": "The death toll in South Africa has risen to 72 as violence continues across the country following the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma.\nCrowds looting and setting alight shopping centres clashed with police in several cities on Tuesday.\nThe BBC filmed a baby being thrown from a building in Durban that was on fire after ground-floor shops were looted.\nA day earlier, 10 people were killed in a stampede during looting at a shopping centre in Soweto.\nThe military have been deployed to help police overstretched since the unrest began last week.\nSouth African police said in a statement they had identified 12 people suspected of provoking the riots, and that a total of 1,234 people had been arrested.\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has called it some of the worst violence witnessed in South Africa since the 1990s, before the end of apartheid, with fires started, highways blocked and businesses and warehouses looted in major cities and small towns in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces.\nMinisters have warned that if looting continues, there is a risk areas could run out of basic food supplies soon - but have ruled out declaring a state of emergency.\nThe child was caught by a crowd of people who rushed to help those trapped in the apartment block in the central business district of Durban, a coastal city in KwaZulu-Natal, on Tuesday afternoon.\nThose stealing from shops on the ground floor of Smith Street had started the fire which spread, affecting those living upstairs.\nThe BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Durban says that after catching the baby, the passers-by and neighbours rushed to get ladders to help other residents, including children, escape.\nThe mother was reunited with her baby, but was too emotional to talk. The rescue services arrived after about 20 minutes to help douse the fires.\nMore than 200 shopping malls had been looted by Monday afternoon, Bloomberg news agency quoted the chief executive officer of Business Leadership South Africa, Busisiwe Mavuso, as saying. \nSeveral shopping centres in Soweto - South Africa's largest township which was once home to Nelson Mandela - have been completely ransacked, with ATMs broken into, restaurants, stores selling alcohol and clothing shops all left in tatters.\nSoldiers working with the police managed to catch a few rioters; in total almost 800 have been arrested, but law enforcement remains heavily outnumbered, he reports.\nIn KwaZulu-Natal - where livestock has also been stolen - the unrest continues with ambulances coming under attack by rioters in some areas, South Africa's TimesLive news site reports. \nVideo footage shows that a blood bank was looted in Durban as Mr Ramaphosa addressed the nation on Monday night. \nBy Farouk Chothia, BBC News\nThe catalyst was the arrest last week of Zuma, with his supporters blockading major roads - the economic arteries of the nation - as they demanded the release of their political hero.\nLow income levels and unemployment - standing at a record high of 32.6% among the workforce and even higher at 46.3% among young people - are seen as the ticking bombs that have exploded.\nMany South Africans have been shaken by the riots that have swept through Zuma's political heartland of KwaZulu-Natal and the economic hub of Gauteng. \nAnd many feel that his successor as president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has failed to provide decisive leadership - either to calm anger over Zuma's imprisonment or to reassure South Africans that they will be safe.\nMr Ramaphosa was accused of belatedly deploying troops - and only 2,500 of them compared with the 8,000 he deployed to enforce a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 last year (and authorising the use of more than 70,000 members of the defence forces if need be).\nBut there is no agreement over the deployment - the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) opposition party has opposed it, saying the solution lies in \"political intervention and engagement with our people\".\nMany residents in affected areas have remained at home, and some have formed what local media call \"defence squads\" to protect their neighbourhoods and businesses as looting and burning continues.\nThere is no doubt that the unrest is the biggest security challenge that Mr Ramaphosa has faced since he became president in 2018 after ousting Zuma. It is bound to worsen the economic crisis, already hit by the pandemic, given the scale of destruction.\nHe was convicted of contempt of court last month after failing to attend an inquiry into corruption during his presidency.\nThe 79-year-old, who denies corruption, was given a 15-month prison sentence. He handed himself in to police last Wednesday. \nHe is hoping to get the sentence rescinded or reduced by the country's constitutional court. However, legal experts say his chances of success are slim.\nPolice Minister Bheki Cele has warned that \"no amount of unhappiness or personal circumstances from our people gives the right to anyone to loot, vandalise and do as they please and break the law\".\nThere has been some concern over fake news online fuelling the unrest, while the governing African National Congress (ANC) had already revealed it was looking into tweets sent by Zuma's daughter, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla.\nState Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo said officials were \"busy sorting fact from fiction\" after receiving information that former security agents linked to Zuma had instigated the violence. \nAre you in the affected regions?

      "tags": "Policing,Stalking,Women,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There has been a \"significant increase\" in stalking offences in England and Wales during the pandemic, police say.\nThe warning from the UK officer in charge of stalking issues comes as more than 80,000 incidents were recorded by forces last year.\nBut freedom of information requests by BBC News show arrests struggled to keep up - growing at half the rate of the rise in offences between 2019 and 2020.\nA government spokesperson says protecting women is \"a priority\".\nNational lockdowns have made it much easier for stalkers to target victims in their homes, especially during the first in March 2020 when restrictions on exercise and shopping were at their most stringent, says Rachel Horman-Brown, a lawyer and chair of the stalking advocacy charity, Paladin.\nChris, 32, from London, says for the last six years of her life she has been stalked by a man she met briefly in a team meeting at a previous job.\nDespite the fleeting acquaintance, she says he has inundated her with messages ever since and even contacted colleagues about her more than 2,000 times despite them both leaving the company.\nSome messages call her a sex worker or allege intimate relationships with people she has never even met, while others passionately declare his love for her.\nOne visit the man made to the offices of her current employer was captured on CCTV while colleagues have recorded obscene calls he has made asking to speak to her.\nDespite passing this evidence to the police and first reporting an offence six years ago, Chris says the man has never been charged over these incidents.\n\"The police will always tell me that they're going to arrest him\", she says. \"I could wait two to three days and literally my phone is in my hand waiting\". \nChris says one officer told her she should be \"flattered\" by the attention. Another told her that no officer wanted to take her case on.\nChris says that during the pandemic she has felt increasingly vulnerable and let down by the police. She says lockdowns led to a surge in the abuse without the security of being able to see her family. She says she has spoken to officers on at least 50 occasions.\n\"You're constantly blamed for it or you're constantly ignored\" she says. \"And you just think, well, what's the point? I'll just live with it\".\nThe Metropolitan Police said a man was arrested at his home address last year and subsequently bailed.\nIn a statement, it said: \"Since October 2020 a dedicated officer has progressed the investigation. The victim has been supported and updated throughout this investigation by the officer\".\nThe force said it understood \"the upset and distress\" stalking can have on a victim and said it has invested in training officers in how to respond to allegations.\nChris says she is not aware of an arrest relating to her experience and disputes that she has been provided with a dedicated officer.\nMore than 80,000 stalking offences were recorded in England and Wales in 2020, figures from the Office for National Statistics show.\nThis is a large increase on the 27,156 offences in 2019, although the years are not directly comparable because of a change in how crimes are recorded encouraging greater reporting of offences by ex-partners.\nBut separate freedom of Information requests received from 33 of 45 police forces indicate that arrests for stalking offences increased at less than half the rate of the rise in stalking incidents in 2020 compared with the year before in England, Wales and Scotland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland declined to provide figures.\n\"What we've seen, both in the pandemic and outside of it, is a significant increase in stalking cases,\" says Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead officer for stalking. \n\"What we're looking at in certain parts of the country [is] up to a 200% increase.\"\nMr Mills says the changes to how stalking crimes are recorded, an increase in online stalking and the pandemic itself are all factors in the rise in offences.\nHe says \"80,000 is a really easy number to talk about but each one of those people is actually a victim at the end of that\", adding: \"In each one of those cases, there is significant potential harm.\"\n\"We're now doing extensive work to try and increase the outcome rate for victims\", he says.\nRachel Horman-Brown, the lawyer at the stalking advocacy charity Paladin, says the lockdowns \"made victims feel much more vulnerable and it's been more difficult for them to get any kind of support\".\nIt has also \"made it much easier for stalkers who have had more time on their hands\".\nShe says while clients still tell her that they have not reported offences, those that do often say they are met with \"disbelief\" by police officers.\n\"It really adds to the trauma of the victim, this lack of assistance that they get from the criminal justice system, and they feel almost like they're having to fight the system as well as the stalker.\"\nThe FOI requests also showed that more than 2,000 reports of stalking were made by under 18-year-olds in 2020. Of the 28 forces who provided a response to this element of the request, 25 said a person aged 11-years-old or younger had complained of being stalked.\nIn 2020, new powers were introduced allowing police forces to ban offenders from making contact with victims on social media or coming within a certain distance of their home or workplace.\nIn June, BBC News revealed that there have been only 294 successful applications for the stalking protection orders, meaning they are only used in response to around 2% of stalking arrests.\nIn April, it was reported that there was support in government for a stalking register that would mean perpetrators are automatically monitored as part of a police database, as is the case with sex offenders.\nHowever, the government rejected including the measure in the Domestic Abuse Bill, arguing improving guidance would be more effective.\nA government spokesperson said: \"Stalking Protection Orders stop perpetrators in their tracks and prevent them contacting victims. We expect all police forces to make full use of them, and are working closely with the police to ensure that this happens.\"\n\"Protecting women and girls from violence and abuse is an absolute priority for the government and we are taking action across the whole system to tackle these horrendous crimes\", it added.\n\"We are working with law enforcement agencies, charities and women's groups to develop a new Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy to help us to better target perpetrators and support victims.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Long Covid,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Self-isolation,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nearly all remaining Covid restrictions are coming to an end. But with infection rates and hospital admissions already rising sharply, it is a significant gamble.\nOne expert likens what is being done to taking the \"control rods out of a nuclear reactor\".\n\"This is going to make things worse than they are now and we don't know when it will peak,\" says Loughborough University data analyst Dr Duncan Robertson.\nAnd that in many ways goes to the heart of the issue. \nThis is our first \"natural wave\" of Covid - all the others have been brought to an end through lockdown and restrictions. The plan is for this one to exhaust itself. So predicting what will happen is much more difficult. \nThe move has been given the personal backing of chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and a number of the scientists advising him. Infection rates were always going to rise at this stage of the roadmap - more mixing means it is easier for the virus to spread.\nBut with significant levels of immunity from vaccination and natural infection the hope is spread of the virus will be brought under control in the coming weeks.\nSome have suggested the government should wait longer before taking this step. But infections are already rising so that will not halt the rise.\nAnd, according to Prof Whitty, were we to wait any longer, there is a risk the peak of infections this summer wave could be pushed to the autumn, which could make things worse with flu and other viruses circulating.\nBut that does not mean government scientists do not have concerns. Behind the scenes, they have been questioning the policy on face masks, in particular, after ministers made big play of the fact mask-wearing would no longer be legally required. Not because it will dramatically alter the course of rising infections, but because of the message it sent out - that controlling infection no longer mattered.\nThis has led to a definite change of approach with ministers now stressing the need to keep wearing masks in crowded indoor places. \nThe reason is clear from the results of the latest modelling to be released. It looked at the impact of people returning almost immediately to normal behaviour, and compared it with a gradual resumption over months.\nThe results estimated the gradual approach could halve the summer peak and avoid what is called an overshoot - whereby the surge in cases means greater numbers become infected than need be, before this summer wave peaks. The modelling shows this is much more important in reducing the peak than simply delaying the lifting of restrictions.\nIt is why Prof Whitty has also referred to the importance of the public \"going slowly\" in the way they embrace new freedoms.\nProf Matt Keeling, a modeller at the University of Warwick, has gone even further. \"If there is one message - the public is going to control the trajectory we are on,\" he said.\nBut this is just one of many unknowns, which explains the huge range around the central estimate that hospital admissions will peak this summer at 1,000 to 2,000 a day. (The winter wave just gone hit 4,000 in comparison.)\nAnd if this does happen, it will come at a significant cost. While the vaccination programme has reduced the number of Covid deaths 10-fold, there could still be 100 to 200 deaths a day. About half of those are expected to be in unvaccinated people. It will also cause major disruption to the NHS. To put those summer figures into context, hospitals would expect to see about 1,000 admissions a day in the depths of winter, for all types of respiratory infections. \nWill 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire?\n\"We would get through it as we have before,\" says Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. \"But it would be at the expense of elective care and other treatments.\"\nAnother consequence will be more people struggling with long Covid either because it takes them time to recover after being hospitalised or from persistent symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, which for a small minority appear to happen after milder illness. \nBut, in the end, unless restrictions are re-introduced, this wave is only likely to come to an end when the wall of immunity - from vaccination and natural infection - is high enough. And when that happens, England could find itself in the very strong position, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, hinted  last week. He said we were reaching the level of immunity where \"big waves\" may be in the past.\nThis does not mean herd immunity - given how infectious the Delta variant is and the changing nature of the virus, many experts now question whether this will be possible. Covid, they believe, is going to be around forever.\nInstead, scientists expect some sort of equilibrium will be reached, whereby the R number, the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, will fluctuate around one.\nThis will see more manageable waves ebb and flow. And with vaccines offering good protection against serious illness, society will be more willing to tolerate the burden. \nAfter all, in the most recent bad winter - 2017-18 - there were 300 to 400 flu deaths a day at the peak, more than is being predicted for this summer's Covid peak.\nWill we get there in the coming months? It is, one of the key government modellers told me, really too close to call.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick\nAre you still shielding and are concerned that restrictions are lifting in England?

      "text": "Conservative MPs need to change their attitude and support footballers who take the knee, a senior figure on the right of the party has said.\nSteve Baker told the BBC players were not calling to \"defund the police\" or being \"anti-capitalist\" - they were saying \"we suffer racism\".\nLast month, Home Secretary Priti Patel dismissed taking the knee as \"gesture politics\".\nOther Tories have criticised players for making the protest before games.\nOn the eve of the Euro 2020 tournament, education minister Gillian Keegan said the Black Lives Matter campaign \"is really about defunding the police and the overthrow of capitalism\" - and taking the knee was \"creating division\".\nAsked in June if she would criticise fans who booed England players taking the knee Priti Patel said: \"That's a choice for them, quite frankly.\"\nBoris Johnson has said he wants fans to cheer their team, but has not explicitly condemned fans who booed, prompting criticism from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.\nOn Monday, the home secretary tweeted that she was \"disgusted\" by the online abuse directed at some England players, after the team lost to Italy on penalties in Sunday's Euro 2020 final.\nEngland footballer Tyrone Mings replied that she had \"stoked the fire\" through her stance on taking the knee. \nResponding to Mings, Conservative MP Johnny Mercer said: \"The painful truth is that this guy is completely right.\"\nHe added he was \"very uncomfortable with the position we Conservatives are needlessly forcing ourselves into\".\nSteve Baker, who chaired the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, said the controversy should serve as a \"wake-up call\" to the Conservative Party over how it is seen in the rest of the country.\nMr Baker said he would not take the knee himself, as its connection to BLM meant its symbolism was subject to \"multiple competing interpretations\". \nBut he added that he thought footballers were motivated by a desire to express their \"solidarity with those who suffer racism\".\n\"We just have to get alongside those players who are taking the knee, and understand they are not saying 'defund the police', they're not anti-capitalist,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nLabour will also urge the government to take stronger against racist abuse on social media at a Commons debate later. \nThe party wants tough sanctions for executives at companies that fail to enforce rules on online hate, and tweaks to legislation to allow courts to ban fans from football games for posting abuse online.\nMore than a million people have signed an online petition calling for tougher rules to ban abusers from attending games.\nThe government says its Online Safety Bill will do more to force social media companies to act on abuse online. \nAmerican footballer Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the pre-game national anthem in the NFL in 2016, in protest at police violence against African-Americans.\nMany figures in sport started taking the knee last year, when the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in the US.

      "text": "A city in the US state of Minnesota has urged residents not to release their unwanted pet fish into the wild after finding huge goldfish in a lake.\nThe common household pets can grow far bigger in the wild and cause major disruption to ecosystems.\nThe city of Burnsville shared images showing several monster goldfish caught during a survey of Keller Lake.\nIt said goldfish could contribute to poor water quality by disturbing sediment and uprooting plants.\n\"Please don't release your pet goldfish into ponds and lakes!\" the city wrote in a tweet.\nIn Minnesota, goldfish are a regulated invasive species, which means it is illegal to release them into public waters.\nA goldfish kept in a home aquarium typically grows to about 2in (5.1cm) in length.\nBut once they are established in public waters, wildlife officials say, goldfish can grow far larger and be difficult to remove - reproducing rapidly and dominating native species.\nIn its warning, the city of Burnsville advised pet owners to \"please consider other options for finding them a new home\".\nWildlife officials have been dealing with a similar problem in nearby Carver County, where 50,000 goldfish were removed from a creek in October last year.\nThe removal was part of a three-year plan to study and manage the species, which have caused problems across the US.\nBut the US isn't the only country to suffer from marauding goldfish.\nIn 2017, Munich city council in Germany said shoals of goldfish were starving out all rivals in local ponds and lakes. The problem got so bad, the council threatened to fine anyone caught releasing their pets into public waters.\nLarge goldfish have been found in the UK's wild waters as well. In 2010, a British teenager pulled a 5lb (2.2kg), 16in fish from a lake in Dorset."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Long Covid,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Self-isolation,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nearly all remaining Covid restrictions are coming to an end. But with infection rates and hospital admissions already rising sharply, it is a significant gamble.\nOne expert likens what is being done to taking the \"control rods out of a nuclear reactor\".\n\"This is going to make things worse than they are now and we don't know when it will peak,\" says Loughborough University data analyst Dr Duncan Robertson.\nAnd that in many ways goes to the heart of the issue. \nThis is our first \"natural wave\" of Covid - all the others have been brought to an end through lockdown and restrictions. The plan is for this one to exhaust itself. So predicting what will happen is much more difficult. \nThe move has been given the personal backing of chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and a number of the scientists advising him. Infection rates were always going to rise at this stage of the roadmap - more mixing means it is easier for the virus to spread.\nBut with significant levels of immunity from vaccination and natural infection the hope is spread of the virus will be brought under control in the coming weeks.\nSome have suggested the government should wait longer before taking this step. But infections are already rising so that will not halt the rise.\nAnd, according to Prof Whitty, were we to wait any longer, there is a risk the peak of infections this summer wave could be pushed to the autumn, which could make things worse with flu and other viruses circulating.\nBut that does not mean government scientists do not have concerns. Behind the scenes, they have been questioning the policy on face masks, in particular, after ministers made big play of the fact mask-wearing would no longer be legally required. Not because it will dramatically alter the course of rising infections, but because of the message it sent out - that controlling infection no longer mattered.\nThis has led to a definite change of approach with ministers now stressing the need to keep wearing masks in crowded indoor places. \nThe reason is clear from the results of the latest modelling to be released. It looked at the impact of people returning almost immediately to normal behaviour, and compared it with a gradual resumption over months.\nThe results estimated the gradual approach could halve the summer peak and avoid what is called an overshoot - whereby the surge in cases means greater numbers become infected than need be, before this summer wave peaks. The modelling shows this is much more important in reducing the peak than simply delaying the lifting of restrictions.\nIt is why Prof Whitty has also referred to the importance of the public \"going slowly\" in the way they embrace new freedoms.\nProf Matt Keeling, a modeller at the University of Warwick, has gone even further. \"If there is one message - the public is going to control the trajectory we are on,\" he said.\nBut this is just one of many unknowns, which explains the huge range around the central estimate that hospital admissions will peak this summer at 1,000 to 2,000 a day. (The winter wave just gone hit 4,000 in comparison.)\nAnd if this does happen, it will come at a significant cost. While the vaccination programme has reduced the number of Covid deaths 10-fold, there could still be 100 to 200 deaths a day. About half of those are expected to be in unvaccinated people. It will also cause major disruption to the NHS. To put those summer figures into context, hospitals would expect to see about 1,000 admissions a day in the depths of winter, for all types of respiratory infections. \nWill 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire?\n\"We would get through it as we have before,\" says Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. \"But it would be at the expense of elective care and other treatments.\"\nAnother consequence will be more people struggling with long Covid either because it takes them time to recover after being hospitalised or from persistent symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, which for a small minority appear to happen after milder illness. \nBut, in the end, unless restrictions are re-introduced, this wave is only likely to come to an end when the wall of immunity - from vaccination and natural infection - is high enough. And when that happens, England could find itself in the very strong position, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, hinted  last week. He said we were reaching the level of immunity where \"big waves\" may be in the past.\nThis does not mean herd immunity - given how infectious the Delta variant is and the changing nature of the virus, many experts now question whether this will be possible. Covid, they believe, is going to be around forever.\nInstead, scientists expect some sort of equilibrium will be reached, whereby the R number, the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, will fluctuate around one.\nThis will see more manageable waves ebb and flow. And with vaccines offering good protection against serious illness, society will be more willing to tolerate the burden. \nAfter all, in the most recent bad winter - 2017-18 - there were 300 to 400 flu deaths a day at the peak, more than is being predicted for this summer's Covid peak.\nWill we get there in the coming months? It is, one of the key government modellers told me, really too close to call.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick\nAre you still shielding and are concerned that restrictions are lifting in England?

      "tags": "Birmingham,Manchester",
      "text": "\"We have been a beacon of light to bring people together and the national team stands for everybody.\"\nAs England football manager Gareth Southgate suggests, his Euro 2020 team sparked a sense of national pride and unity that runs deeper than the temporary heartbreak caused by Sunday's failed penalty shootout.\nBut the racist abuse that followed has been depressing - particularly those who had fallen in love with the team for the first time.\n\"I never thought I'd be cheering on England, not ever. But here I am,\" Binta Williams tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nThe 22-year-old student from Manchester normally wouldn't care about English football - but says she felt \"so proud\" of the Euros squad that she's become \"somewhat patriotic\".\n\"The team come from so many backgrounds and a lot are people of colour, like Raheem Sterling. I'm Jamaican, he's Jamaican,\" she says.\n\"Watching him smash it for England, the feeling's just like - wow.\" \nMore than half of the 26 players in the Euro 2020 squad have at least one parent or grandparent born outside the UK, according to the Migration Museum.\nThat includes Bukayo Saka, whose parents are Nigerian, Jadon Sancho, whose mum and dad are from Trinidad and Tobago - and Marcus Rashford, whose grandma lived on the Caribbean island of St Kitts.\nAll three players received racist abuse on social media after not scoring their penalties in the shootout on Sunday.\n\"It's just embarrassing as a country that fans behave in that way,\" Binta says.\nShe feels it's driven a wedge in the national unity Southgate spoke of.\n\"You think we're making progress as a country all coming together - and then we lose and it's back to square one,\" she says.\nBinta says in the past she's not wanted to wave the England flag, because of its negative connotations.\nThe flag, which bears the cross of England's patron saint, St George, was adopted by far-right groups in the 1970s. It's since been associated with racial tension and white nationalism.\nSome 28% of white 18-24s and 25% of ethnic minority 18-24s say they see the flag as a negative symbol of nationalism, even during sporting tournaments, a 2021 survey by research group British Future found. These percentages are much lower among older people.\nBut Binta says the current England squad have helped change how she feels.\n\"For the first time, I'm proud of this country,\" she says.\nCameron Cole, 27, says the \"disgusting\" abuse of Saka, Sancho and Rashford shows there is \"still a very long way to go\" to tackle racism in football.\nBut having faced racist abuse himself, Cameron says the aftermath of Sunday's game means the team represents him \"now more than ever\".\n\"I've had experiences before where I've had to speak out about it and seeing these stars do the same thing, it qualifies me more to do it in any circumstance, in employment or anywhere else,\" he tells Newsbeat.\nThe Arsenal fan, from south London, says the fact many of Southgate's players are from similar neighbourhoods and ethnic minorities as him makes him feel \"a lot more comfortable\" cheering on nation than he used to do.\nRacism in football - and society, is nothing new. But it's a particularly sad end to the tournament given how vocal the team have been in their fight for equality - as shown by their joint decision to take the knee at the beginning of every game.\nDespite some critics, the team never wavered in their gesture, which has had Southgate's full support.\nIn a public letter to the nation published by the Players' Tribune in June, Southgate said his players have a \"duty\" to speak up on issues such as equality, inclusivity and racial injustice \"while using the power of their voices to help put debates on the table, raise awareness and educate\".\nSouthgate added that the pride each of his players have in representing their country \"cannot be questioned\".\nBut as suggested by Binta, national pride doesn't always come easily in England. \nSome 61% of people who describe themselves as white are proud to declare their English identity, but among ethnic minorities it is just 32%, according to a BBC survey from 2018.\nKhomal Aruje, 24, says part of the problem is that ethnic minorities are under-represented by national sports.\n\"I never saw anyone that looked like me playing football growing up - and that cements itself inside you,\" she tells Newsbeat.\nAruje - as she prefers to be known - volunteers for Saltley Stallions, a club in Birmingham that encourages Muslim women into the game.\nShe says it felt \"amazing\" to see a video on Twitter of Muslim boys celebrating Harry Kane's goal against Denmark, because it shows football is truly becoming a sport \"for everyone\".\nOther big social media moments from the tournament include when BBC Radio Leeds presenter Rima Ahmed shared a photo of herself in an England shirt.\nShe said she never thought she'd want to wear England kit- but that this tournament's players have changed her mind.\nAruje says Southgate's team shows the sport is \"moving in the right direction\".\n\"We've got the benefit of having hundreds of different cultures and ways of thinking and perspectives, and I think for us to fully commit to supporting an England team, it's nice to be able to have one that reflects the diversity of the country a little bit more accurately.\"\nBut the racism sparked on Sunday shows the ugly side of English football hasn't yet been beaten.\n\"This is just the reality of being a person of colour being brought to light,\" Aruje says.\n\"As a person of colour and as a woman I think there is a subconscious pressure to exceed in what you do to be recognised, respected or even feel like you belong.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Scotland is to move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for \"some time\".\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant.\nThe move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals.\nHowever, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the return of workers to offices is to be delayed.\nMs Sturgeon said \"sensible precautions\" had to be maintained while the vaccine programme continues.\nShe said she still hoped Scotland could move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions.\nMinisters also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point.\nMs Sturgeon said a decision would be made before the new academic term on whether or not school pupils who are the close contacts of positive cases will have to self-isolate.\nAnd fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as of Monday, as long as they take a test after arrival.\nHowever, the first minister told MSPs that mandatory precautions like the mandatory wearing of face coverings and guidance on ventilation and hand hygiene would remain in place \"for some time\".\nMs Sturgeon added: \"We must stick to a cautious approach. We are easing restrictions next week, but we are not abandoning them.\n\"And even when we move beyond level zero, we will continue to require some baseline measures such as face coverings.\"\nScotland has been hit by a record-breaking third wave of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, with the faster-spreading Delta variant putting pressure on health services.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs - who were recalled for a virtual session despite Holyrood being in recess - that the spike in infections had \"levelled off\", and that the vaccine programme was weakening the link between case number and severe illnesses.\nShe said \"a gradual approach\" to easing restrictions stood the best chance of being sustainable and of minimising loss of life.\nNicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said \"I will always err on the side of going more cautiously\". \nEngland is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. \nBut Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasis restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option \"for good headlines\".\nA statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.\nDespite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned.\nAn obvious point of divergence from England is face coverings.\nWhile laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (they'll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear they'll stay here \"for as long as necessary\". \nIt feels like they'll be one of the last measures to go.\nThe move to level zero means: \nPlans have, however, been modified in light of high case numbers:\nMs Sturgeon said the move was \"not a complete and wholesale lifting of all restrictions\", but it said it \"does restore yet more freedom to all of us\".\nBusiness groups broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers \"moving the goalposts\" at the last minute by altering their plans.\nThe Scottish Retail Consortium said firms \"will be reassured the sense of progress is being maintained, even if the pace has slowed\".\nThe Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant \"should hopefully generate some extra passing trade\", but said there was \"less good news\" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue.\nAnd the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was \"another encouraging milestone\", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be \"a bitter blow for employees and employers alike\".\nThe virtual session of parliament gave opposition politicians the chance to question the first minister about the plans.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said \"we can't continue asking the public to sacrifice so much of their lives\".\nHe said: \"The balance has to tilt further in favour of moving forward - we have to make progress back to normality. The public have done what was expected of them, now it's time for this SNP government to deliver.\"\nLabour's Anas Sarwar said the changes to restrictions were welcome, but said \"inconsistent decision making and communications\" was hitting the response to the pandemic.\nHe said: \"The high rate of cases is a cause for concern and I'm afraid what the first minister has presented today is not a clear strategy to cope with the new phase of the pandemic.\"\nScottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater said she had \"concerns about reducing restrictions while case numbers are so high\", voicing fears that it could lead to a vaccine-resistant variant emerging.\nAnd outgoing Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said changes to self-isolation rules must be made \"urgently\", with \"thousands of key workers\" having to quarantine despite testing negative."

      "text": "Three siblings are counting their lucky stars after they were hit by lightning.\nRachel, Isobel and Andrew Jobson were cycling when they took shelter under a tree close to Molesey Lock, near Hampton Court Palace in south-west London, during Monday's heavy rain. \nBut as they snapped a selfie, a lightning bolt struck the trio - with the moment captured on camera.\nThe three, from Maidenhead, were taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting with burns and discharged hours later.\nRachel, the eldest sibling at 26, said they had been on their way from their Berkshire home to see their aunt in Epsom, Surrey, when they decided to take a bathroom break, so stopping at the lock.\nWhen she returned from the loo, she saw her brother and sister under some trees during a thunderstorm. They decided to take some pictures before setting off again.\nPhD student Isobel, 23, said: \"The picture of us at the moment the lightning strike happened was at 17:05.\n\"I took a picture of us smiling and we then wanted a sad picture in the rain.\n\"All of a sudden I was on the ground and couldn't hear anything apart from this high-pitched buzzing. \n\"My whole right arm was numb and I couldn't move it.\"\nRachel added: \"We were taking the picture with our phone and then the next thing, I was on the ground. I felt disjointed. My sister and I were screaming.\n\"I got burnt on my thigh and stomach and it's left lightning-like marks behind on me and my sister. I couldn't feel my arm.\"\nThese patterns Rachel refers to are known as Lichtenberg figures. \nRachel added that all three were hurt, although brother Andrew was more stunned than anything else.\nThe siblings were helped to their feet by passers-by before paramedics turned up to take them to St George's Hospital in Tooting.\nThe family were told it was possible that a titanium plate in Isobel's arm following a cycling accident last year might have been what led to the lightning surging through their bodies.\nRachel said: \"My sister's arm was very hot, because of the plate. Everyone was amazed at what had happened to us.\"\nShe paid tribute to the medical staff who looked after them. \nTori Cooper, head of nursing for the Emergency Department at St George's Hospital, said she was \"delighted\" to hear they were happy with the care they received, and \"wished all three a speedy recovery\".\nMuch of the capital was affected by the thunderstorms, with parts of London receiving a month's worth of rain in one day, causing flash floods.\nOn Monday 47.8mm of rain fell in a 24-hour period in Kew, most of it in just one hour. The average monthly rainfall in July is 44.5mm.\nAccording to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, about 30 to 60 people are struck by lightning each year in the UK, with an average of three deaths.\nThe Jobson siblings were planning to return to the site on Tuesday to say thank you to Harriet, the owner of the H at Molesey Lock Cafe, for looking after them.\nThey have not yet decided whether to resume their cycling holiday, with Rachel adding: \"I still feel a bit light-headed, while my sister's wrist is quite sore.\"\nSource: Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents"

      "text": "MPs have approved compulsory vaccinations for care home staff in England, but a number of Conservatives rebels voiced anger at the plans.\nFrom October, anyone working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home in England must have two vaccine doses unless they have a medical exemption. \nThe House of Commons approved the regulations by 319 votes to 246.\nBut Tory MPs criticised the government for not publishing an impact assessment of the policy before the vote.\nHealth minister Helen Whately told MPs the \"impact assessment is being worked on\".\nAlmost 30,000 more care home residents in England and Wales died during the coronavirus outbreak than during the same period in 2019, ONS figures released this month showed.\nMinisters have previously expressed concern about the low take-up of the vaccine among some care home staff. \nConservative former minister Mark Harper, who chairs the lockdown sceptic Covid Recovery Group, said: \"If there's uncertainty, share the uncertainty with the House.\n\"It isn't good enough to expect us to vote on something that is difficult and controversial and complicated, and not share the information with the House that the minister has at her disposal. It is an abuse. It's not good enough.\"\nConservative MP William Wragg said he was \"in despair\", adding: \"The government is treating this House with utter contempt. Ninety minutes on a statutory instrument to fundamentally change the balance of human rights in this country is nothing short of a disgrace.\"\nMr Wragg went on to raise the case of a care worker who fears losing her job as a result of the policy, asking: \"Is that what we're prepared to do to our fellow citizens as a Conservative government?\nLabour's Rachael Maskell added: \"We're having to make a decision in the House this evening on the balance of risk and therefore we haven't been given the data because the impact assessment hasn't come forward.\"\nDeputy Speaker Nigel Evans said it was a \"totally unsatisfactory\" situation and he would raise the issue with the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle.\nCare minister Ms Whately said guidance would be forthcoming, but suggested managers could discuss the vaccine with staff or look at an alternative role for those who did not want to be vaccinated.\nBut she acknowledged there were not \"that many roles\" that did not involve being in the care home. \nShe said in that situation, if a staff member did not want to be vaccinated, then a notice period could follow with a \"fair process\".\nCare organisations have previously warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people.\nThe British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned compulsion was \"a blunt instrument that carries its own risks\".\nGovernments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have said they have no plans to make Covid jabs mandatory for care home staff.\nThe move to mandatory vaccinations for care home staff in England follows a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care, launched in April, two months after the government said it had met its target of offering all front-line care workers a first dose of a vaccine by mid-February.\nAt the time, it said 47% of English care homes for older people had more than a fifth of staff yet to take up the vaccine, despite staff at all eligible care homes having been offered vaccines, with the vast majority of homes having had repeat visits by vaccine teams.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported a further 36,660 cases and 50 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.

      "text": "Covid restrictions will not be abandoned \"wholesale\" when they are next reviewed on Wednesday, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said.\nWith cases on the increase, he said he was \"not persuaded that this is a moment for such an approach\".\nThe UK government has faced criticism from some scientists over its plans for a \"freedom day\" on 19 July.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford said the four nations were moving in \"broadly\" the same direction.\nThe comments in the Senedd came after Welsh government advisers warned of a risk of a wave of deaths despite vaccines \"holding up\" in the race against the Delta variant.\nMr Drakeford's cabinet will make the final decision on Wednesday morning, with a statement to the Welsh Parliament expected that afternoon.\nNearly all restrictions in England will be scrapped on 19 July, with no legal requirement for people to wear face masks and with limits on social distancing to end.\nPublic Health Wales reported that the case rate stood at 138.2 per 100,000 people on Tuesday, a slight rise.\nAlthough cases are still rising, the doubling time is now about 12 days, whereas cases were doubling every seven days towards the end of June.\nFace masks are expected to be kept in some settings in Wales and in Scotland - where Nicola Sturgeon has announced an easing of restrictions, with advice on working from home and rules on social distancing while outside staying in place.\nMr Drakeford told the Senedd he hoped he would be able to take steps towards moving \"beyond\" the Covid rules.\n\"What it will not be will be a wholesale abandonment of the collective actions that we have taken during the pandemic, and which continue to keep Wales safe.\"\n\"The mood of Welsh people is not a mood of thirsting for some spurious freedom day,\" he later added.\nThe Welsh government has already said face masks would continue to be required by law on public transport and in health and social care settings, but a decision on whether that will be the case in shops - as called for by Plaid Cymru and trade unions - is yet to be made.\nOn Wednesday ministers will announce whether restrictions can be eased to allow more to take place indoors, including whether the rules on social contact in people's private homes may be relaxed.\nThey are also expected to publish plans on how Wales will move to a new \"alert level zero\", where there will be fewer legal restrictions.\nFollowing a meeting with officials from the four UK governments, Mr Drakeford said: \"We may be doing it at slightly different speeds or in different ways, but the essential direction of travel is the same between us.\"\nHowever, he did accuse Boris Johnson of not making it clear enough that his announcement on Monday was only for England: \"It was disappointing again to find that the prime minister finds that such a difficult thing to do, because it would have helped with clarity.\"\nHe also said he agreed with the Senedd Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies in being opposed to \"the mandation of vaccine passports\".\nThat was despite comments in March when Mr Drakeford said there were \"prizes to be won through domestic vaccine certification\". \nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"Scotland has a plan, England has a plan, and for the sake of Welsh jobs and our economic recovery, it's now time Labour ministers published a detailed plan for the restoration of freedoms in Wales. \n\"We have to learn to live with the virus and with the summer kicking in, and the school term coming to its conclusion, many families, workers and businesses will be asking if not now, when?\"\nVaccines are \"holding up\" in the race against the Delta variant, which originated in India, but there is still a risk of a wave in hospital admissions and deaths as cases grow rapidly, Welsh government advisers have said.\nThe Technical Advisory Group (TAG) said the ratio of confirmed infections to hospital admissions was falling as fewer people have become seriously ill.\nTAG said this could be because the Delta variant was spreading among young people, who are less likely to end up in hospital, or it could be a result of the vaccine.\nModelling from Swansea University presents a range of scenarios, with the most pessimistic showing a peak in hospital admissions and deaths this summer similar to the second wave of the pandemic.\nBut other scenarios estimate a lower peak and the report suggests they are more likely.\nNew modelling from Warwick University also shows a lower peak, happening around March 2022.\nThe ratio of cases to deaths is falling in all age groups. Among the over-70s it fell from 24% in December to 2% on 1 July.\n\"This is likely due to the effects of the Covid-19 vaccines,\" the report says."

      "tags": "House of Commons,UK aid,International aid",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has defended the government's decision to cut foreign aid, saying this is needed during the \"economic hurricane\" caused by Covid.\nMPs are voting on whether to reverse the reduction on development spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, brought in earlier this year.\nOpening a Commons debate, the prime minister said this was a temporary cut made to help reduce public borrowing.\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"indefinite\".\nThe government has faced cross-party criticism over the reduction, which amounts to almost \u00a34bn.\nMany Conservative MPs have spoken out against the move, announced last November despite a commitment to spending 0.7% in the party's 2019 election manifesto.\nMeeting the 0.7% figure was made law in 2015, and it is an internationally recognised target, and charities such as Oxfam and ActionAid have warned that projects are being called off as a result of the cuts.\nIf MPs defeat the government in the vote, spending will revert to 0.7% of national income by January next year.\nIf the government wins, it will happen only when national debt is falling and borrowing is no longer used for day-to-day spending. \nLast month, 30 Conservative MPs supported an amendment to a parliamentary bill, aimed at forcing the government to meet the 0.7% target.\nIf they oppose the cut again later, another 14 or so Tories would have to join them to ensure a government defeat.\nMr Johnson told MPs ministers had spent \u00a3407bn during the pandemic to \"shelter our people from an economic hurricane never before experienced in living memory\".\nHe added: \"There must inevitably be consequences.\"\nThe prime minister said that this year national debt was expected to reach 100% of economic output, \"the highest for nearly six decades\".\nHe added that the reduction was temporary and the UK could \"take pride that the UK will still contribute at least \u00a310bn of our GDP\" to aid.\n\"This is not an argument about principle,\" Mr Johnson said. \"The only question is when we return to 0.7% and my purpose today is to describe how we propose to achieve this shared goal in an affordable way.\"\nGovernments only call votes if they think they can win. \nMinisters will hope the concession of a vote, the offer of clarity about when aid might increase and the lack of time their opponents have had to organise will give them an edge and soften the Tory rebellion. \nWhen it comes to whipping, the Treasury also has deep pockets and who knows what goodies might be on offer to dissident rebel MPs in the upcoming Spending Review? \nIf the government wins, there will be consequences. \nThe current status quo is that Downing Street is under political pressure to return aid spending to 0.7% of national income next year. \nBut if the Treasury wins today, that will not happen. Aid spending will be locked in for years. \nHow long will depend not just on the economy, but on Treasury's tax and spend decisions and its interpretation of some rather loose tests. \nBoth sides in this debate accept UK aid cuts have a material impact. \nIt is just a question of priorities - responsible belt-tightening at home or generosity abroad. But if the UK cuts aid by \u00a34bn every year, then millions overseas will suffer. \nBut Sir Keir, who confirmed Labour would vote against the government, said the cut was \"not in the national interest\", adding: \"Every member here was elected on a manifesto promise to retain the 0.7% target.\"\n\"Every living prime minister thinks this is wrong,\" he added. \"There is only one prime minister who is prepared to do this and he is sitting there.\"\nHe later added: \"Cutting aid will increase costs and have a big impact on our economy. Development aid reduces conflict. It reduces disease and people fleeing from their homes.\n\"It is a false economy to pretend that this is some sort of cut that doesn't have consequences.\"\nFormer Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, one of the Conservative MPs who have been highly critical of the cut, said she would also vote against the government, but \"with regret\".\n\"We made a promise to the poorest people in the world,\" she added. \"The government has broken that promise.\"\nAnd former Brexit Secretary David Davis called the cut to aid spending \"morally reprehensible\".\nOn Saturday, a group of philanthropists, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said they would provide \u00a393.5m emergency funding to cover some of the UK's reduction."

There was evidence of a pre-existing heart condition we were all unaware of.\n\"While still very painful, it is of some comfort that Sebastian died after having one of his favourite meals with one of his closest friends whilst doing his favourite thing at his favourite place in Dubai where he often went to swim. He was standing in the water close to shore watching the sunset at Cove Beach in Dubai.\n\"I am grateful that he was able to spend a few short and happy weeks with his son before his death.\"\nFigures from around the boxing world and beyond paid tribute to Sebastian, the middle child of Eubank's five children, following the news of his death.\nHis father called his son a \"deep thinker who liked to challenge accepted wisdom\" in an earlier tribute to him.\nEubank said the family was devastated at the loss of Sebastian, who grew up in Hove but had been living in Dubai, where he was \"a leader in the adoption of a healthy lifestyle and of alternative therapies\".\n\"He was loved and respected by all who knew him and will be forever in the thoughts of friends and family,\" he added.\nSebastian, who boxed using the name Alka Lion, made his debut in February 2018 against Polish fighter Kamil Kulczyk.\nHe made his MMA debut last year.\nHis brother, Chris Eubank Jr, also a professional boxer, said on Twitter: \"Rest easy little brother, I love you and you will be missed always.\""

      "text": "The prime minister must start delivering an ambitious levelling-up programme for the north of England \"at pace\", according to a group of 50 Conservative MPs.\nThe Northern Research Group is calling for an economic strategy focused on helping communities in the North rebuild after the pandemic.\nIt wants special grants for deprived areas outside London. \nMinisters say they are \"totally committed to levelling up\".\nThe NRG was founded by a number of Conservatives who won so-called red wall seats from Labour at the 2019 general election and want to push the government for greater investment for northern areas. \nThe pandemic has renewed attention on regional disparities.\nA recent study by the Northern Health Science Alliance found the North has been hit harder than the rest of England during coronavirus, \"exacerbating\" regional inequalities.\nAt the Queen's Speech in May, ministers said they would \"level-up opportunities across all parts of the United Kingdom as Britain recovers from the pandemic\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is also expected to deliver a speech shortly on the issue. \nNRG chairman Jake Berry told the BBC: \"We have been in lockdown longer than any other area of the country. \n\"It's time for the government to show the North some love with a summer of levelling up.\"\nHe said the prime minister relies for his majority in Parliament on votes in the North and there is now an opportunity to encourage investment, jobs and industry there. \nHe added: \"Since December 2019, we have heard a lot about plans to level up the North, now is the time to show how we can deliver.  \n\"No one in the North cares about internal governmental turf wars. \n\"They want real jobs, real change, and real opportunities.\n\"It's time to start delivering an ambitious programme at pace if we are going to see real progress this summer.\"\nThe group wants a recovery plan focused on infrastructure. \nIt is calling for automatic grants to help deprived areas outside London, the formation of a northern growth board and - as part of a plan for better transport - the abolition of road tax and fuel duty, to be replaced with a system under which revenue raised would be kept in the North.  \nA government spokesperson said: \"We're investing \u00a3100bn in infrastructure this year, as well as creating a new \u00a34.8bn Levelling Up Fund, establishing free ports across the UK and a new UK infrastructure bank in Leeds to harness private investment and fund new projects.\"\nThe spokesman said ministers will publish a Levelling Up White Paper later this year, which will set out plans to \"improve livelihoods across the country as we recover from the pandemic\".

That would be one of the largest ever judgements against an individual.\nLast year, other board members at Tesla settled a lawsuit over the deal for $60m. Those board members, who excluded Mr Musk, did not admit any wrongdoing.\nDan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that investors would be watching the case very closely. \nThe SolarCity deal has been a \"black eye\" for both Mr Musk and Tesla and a \"clear low light\" in the company's rise, he wrote in a note.\nDespite that, Tesla shares rose on Monday, closing more than 4% higher.\nThe trial is expected to last about two weeks. Randall Baron, the attorney for the shareholders, warned the entrepreneur that the case being heard in Delaware Chancery Court was \"going to be a grind\".\nGesturing to a thick folder of documents prepared by Mr Baron, Mr Musk replied: \"I can tell by the binder.\""

The investigation is continuing.\nTransactions made using cryptocurrencies can provide more anonymity to senders and recipients of money.\nThe Met did not say which cryptocurrencies they seized.\nCryptocurrencies are digital money that is not issued by a bank. You can trade and invest these currencies like any other - and there are virtually no barriers to entry.

But a spokesman said that \"the vast majority of people at Aviva want to work flexibly in future\" and employees will combine going into the office with working from home.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that final restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of Covid will be lifted in England from 19 July, including the guidance on office working.\nBut the government said that it \"would expect and recommend a gradual return\" of workers to offices \"over the summer\".\nDeloitte currently operates its offices at 30% capacity and employees have to book desks. A spokeswoman for the firm said it had always intended to take a \"gradual approach\" to moving staff back to its sites.\nIt estimates that it will take between six and eight weeks to prepare its offices to deal with 100% capacity which it expects to reach in September.\nNatWest said a \"very small number of people\" will be invited back to its offices in England from Monday for roles \"that can't really be done from home\". These include market traders as well as people who work in NatWest's treasury department and roles where employees need to meet clients.\nIt also said \"people who would rather work in the office for wellbeing reasons\" can return to its sites from Monday.\nAccountancy firm KPMG has allowed people to work from its offices if they made a request to their manager. \nFrom next week, they will no longer need permission to do so but the firm has also introduced a \"four-day fortnight\" hybrid model of working. It means that KPMG employees spend four days working in the office and the rest of the fortnight either at home or at client sites. \n\"It makes sense that the order to work from home if possible is removed at this stage,\" said Confederation of British Industry policy director, Michael Fell. \"The reality is that many firms are well-advanced in their plans and are proceeding with hybrid working models, just as the government advises. \nRoger Barker, policy director of the Institute of Directors (IoD) industry group, said: \"Businesses across the country will welcome the opportunity to begin to return to relative normality from next week.\"\nHowever, he criticised the government for failing to provide adequate guidance on areas such as wearing face masks which, from Monday, will cease to be mandatory but will be recommended.\nDr Barker said there has been \"real frustration about the mixed messages\" businesses have been receiving from the government. \n\"The latest guidance has shifted the responsibility from the government to businesses by removing mandatory rules on things like face masks and replacing them with voluntary recommendations,\" he said. \"Whilst it is right that companies should be allowed to take decisions based on their own unique circumstances, it is vital that government provides businesses with best practice in developing their own policies.\""

      "text": "People in England are no longer legally required to wear face masks in almost all public spaces, although they are still recommended in some settings. \nThe change is part of the government's decision to lift Plan B coronavirus measures in England.\nMasks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nFrom Thursday 27 January:\nWhat are the latest changes to the UK's Covid rules?\nFace mask changes: 'We hope customers aren't discouraged'\nIn Scotland, masks must be worn in most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising).\nThey must be worn in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, and in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. \nThey are compulsory for all school staff as well as secondary school pupils and are required in indoor public spaces in universities.\nLike England, under-12s are exempt.\nFrom Friday 28 January, adults running organised sessions with under-5s will no longer need to wear face coverings. \nIn Northern Ireland, post-primary pupils must wear face coverings inside school buildings, as must staff if they can't socially distance.\nMasks must also be worn on public transport, in shops and hospitality venues unless you're sitting down to eat or drink.\nMasks aren't required in gyms or other exercise venues.\nHowever, people no longer have to show proof of exemption if they're not wearing a mask.\nUnder-13s don't have to wear masks in public indoor places, and primary school pupils are exempt from the rules on public transport.\nPeople no longer have to wear face masks by law in cafes, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, but face coverings are required on public transport and  most public spaces, including shops.\nSecondary school pupils are being asked to wear masks in class until the end of half term. \nThe guidance in Wales applies to everyone aged 11 or over.\nIn England, Transport for London (TfL) officers and police can currently fine people \u00a3200 for their first offence. This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment. So, a second penalty would be \u00a3400, a third \u00a3800, up to a maximum of \u00a36,400. \nIn Wales, the penalty for a first offence is \u00a360, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of \u00a31,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work."

The procedure because of Covid-19, the government has to take care of the quarantine. \n\"She had to be in quarantine for 14 days, she finished the quarantine and now we are doing the procedure to remove the travel ban... so she will be able to leave the country as soon as possible.\n\"They [the authorities] are trying to let her leave before Eid, or maybe after Eid immediately. There is one more piece of paper... then they will remove the travel ban and she will be ready.\n\"She is safe, don't worry about her.\"\nMs Assayed's mother Helen Conibear, who lives in Barry, said: \"I'm so delighted. It's amazing news, I'm over the moon. I just don't know what to say, just that I'm so, so happy.\n\"I've just spoken to Sara too and she was so happy and shouting 'I'm free, I'm free!'

They're seen as people putting themselves out there to win followers and make money.\"\nAccording to Sheldon, who has more than 117,000 followers on Instagram, certain people are \"so angry at us for making money\".\nShe said her followers would be \"disgusted\" if she revealed the full extent of the abuse she received, particularly from middle-aged women.\nAppearing later on ITV News, she said her appearance before the DCMS committee had itself led to venomous messages.\nSheldon, who posts regularly about her lifestyle, said online threats were so severe she no longer felt safe enough to go out for a run by herself.\n\"People think they have a right to know where I live, who my friends and families are and so on,\" she went on. \"These dark forums need shutting down.\n\"I wish social media required some form of personal information, even for those who post anonymously. It would deter abusers and help the police.\"\nSheldon's comments follow widespread revulsion at the racist abuse directed at some of England's football players in the wake of their Euro final defeat.\nMarcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho were targeted after they missed penalties at the end of Sunday's match against Italy at Wembley.\nThe government's draft Online Safety Bill, announced in the Queen's Speech in May, places new duties on social media firms to remove harmful or illegal content.\nIt says social media firms will have to remove harmful content quickly or potentially face multi-billion-pound fines.\nYet singer Nicola Roberts has turned down a request to endorse it, saying it does not do enough to stop people who have been banned from setting up new accounts.\n\"I am unconcerned with chasing the rabbit,\" the Girls Aloud and Masked Singer star said in a statement. \"I would rather just fill the hole.\"\nRoberts suffered online abuse and stalking at the hands of an ex-boyfriend, who sent her 3,000 messages from 35 fake Twitter accounts after they split in 2008.\n\"If you block people they make 10 other accounts,\" said Sheldon, who claimed her abusers routinely complain to the ASA (Advertising Standards Authority) about her posts.\nInfluencers are required to make it clear to their followers when their posts are advertisements and can be sanctioned by the UK advertising watchdog if they do not.\nFormer model Katie Price has launched a petition calling for there to be a legal requirement that personal accounts on sites such as Facebook and Twitter are linked to a verified form of identification.\nLove Island presenter Laura Whitmore has urged her followers to add their names to it, saying it \"has never been right\" that \"anyone can say anything online without any accountability\".\nAccording to Dr Sobande, however, removing users' anonymity \"is not the magic solution people think it is\".\n\"For me the bigger issue is how these issues will be addressed when the abusers are identified,\" she told MPs.\nSheldon said that maintaining a social media presence was a \"24/7\" job and that she sometimes feels \"like a hamster on a wheel\".\n\"We don't have a union but we do help each other,\" she said of her fellow influencers, whom she said lacked the \"level of protection\" afforded to mainstream celebrities.\n\"They can be hurt emotionally but their businesses and careers are untouchable,\" she continued. \"It's not a level playing field.\"\n\"Being an influencer is not a job you can switch off from,\" said Dr Abidin, adding that those wishing to become one themselves should \"think about more than the glamour\".\nYet Sheldon said there were positive sides to the job, citing a recent visit to New York as an example of a \"really good and fulfilling\" experience.\n\"I like that I can give people escapism, especially during the pandemic,\" said the 27-year-old, who started out as a blogger in 2012.\nSnapchat is among many social media companies to have an anti-bullying policy, as well as an in-house app promoting good mental health.\nIt said its users' accounts were \"private by default\" and that the site had no public comments or open newsfeed where hate speech could be broadcast. \nFacebook and Instagram have similar policies including message controls and filters and direct people in need of crisis support to charities including The Samaritans and Beat.\nTik Tok and YouTube have also been contacted for comment.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is to confirm whether Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions can be eased as planned in the coming weeks.\nThe Scottish Parliament is to be recalled from recess for a statement from the first minister at 14:00.\nThe government had set a target of moving the whole country to level zero from 19 July, before lifting most legal restrictions from 9 August.\nHowever, the country has since been hit by a record-breaking wave of infections which has put pressure on NHS services.\nMinisters said they believed the peak of the latest wave had passed. Ms Sturgeon said she was hopeful that some changes could go ahead as planned.\nShe is meeting her cabinet to review the latest data on Tuesday morning before announcing the decision to MSPs in the afternoon.\nDifferent Covid-19 restrictions are in force across Scotland, with areas in the central belt including Glasgow and Edinburgh in level two and other areas like Aberdeenshire, Fife and the Highlands in level one.\nOrkney, Shetland and many island communities are already in level zero. Ms Sturgeon had set a target of moving the whole country to this level on 19 July - the same date as most restrictions will be lifted in England.\nThis would see the number of people who are allowed to meet up indoors public spaces such as bars and restaurants increased to 10 adults from four households, and to eight people from four households for private homes. \nPublic Health expert Prof Linda Bauld from Edinburgh University, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme she believed the planned easing would go ahead.\nShe said: \"What I am expecting to hear is that we will proceed to level 0 on 19 July. There are a basket of indicators the Scottish government will be looking at. \n\"Starting with cases we see a decline in the seven-day average - 2,650, down from 3,800 a week before that. We have got more people in hospital now -  just under 470 people - and we have three or four health board areas or hospitals that are definitely under strain, but others are coping . And the average deaths is about three or four a week which is regrettable. \n\"You can see that although the situation is still fragile it is showing some signs of being sustainable and we are able to cope with it.\"\nThe first minister said she wanted to move \"beyond level zero\" by scrapping the bulk of legal restrictions from 9 August, while maintaining some mitigations such as the use of face coverings in enclosed areas.\nShe warned that these dates were \"not set in stone\" after Scotland was hit by a wave of new infections which at one point saw the country have the worst daily case rates in Europe.\nA further 2,134 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Monday - down on figures from recent weeks, but still with 11% of tests coming back positive.\nHowever, the number of people in hospital has not risen as dramatically, with ministers saying the vaccine programme had \"weakened\" the link between catching the virus and becoming seriously ill.\nMs Sturgeon suggested that the plans could be modified, saying the government could potentially \"proceed with some planned changes but hold back on others\".\nThis led to claims that Scotland could be heading for a \"level 0.5\", with opposition leaders saying this would create uncertainty for people and businesses that had been making plans based on the current timetable.\nThe first minister said that \"this is a time for care and caution\", adding: \"Over the next few weeks as we complete the vaccination programme, it is really important that we don't let the virus outrun us.\"\nAnd she raised questions about the UK government's approach of lifting most restrictions from 19 July, saying this was \"something of an exception\" when viewed \"against the backdrop of sharply increasing case numbers\".\nThe Scottish Parliament is currently in recess for the summer break, but will be recalled for the virtual session at 14:00. It will give opposition leaders the chance to question the first minister on her plans.\nThe Scottish Conservatives want the government to press forward with plans for easing restrictions, saying the country must \"keep moving forward\".\nParty leader Douglas Ross said ministers had failed to boost the vaccine programme and the Test and Protect system, but said \"the public should not be punished\" for this.\nHe added: \"If Tuesday's statement does not deliver a plan of action for tackling the virus and a clear timetable for exiting restrictions, Nicola Sturgeon risks losing public buy-in. \"\nScottish Labour wants the time between vaccine doses cut to four weeks and extra resources directed to the contact tracing system.\nDeputy leader Jackie Baillie said the government had \"lost control of the pandemic\" and must take \"immediate action\".\nShe said: \"We are at a crucial moment in the pandemic - it's about time we showed the urgency and ambition that we need.\"\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Greens called for a cautious approach, with co-leader Lorna Slater saying the government should \"take a safer, more gradual approach until the vaccine programme is further on\".\nAnd Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon must set out \"concrete action and urgent changes around the rules and expectations for self-isolation\" amid concerns about staff shortages in hospitals.\nMs Sturgeon has said the government is reviewing rules for self-isolation and quarantine, although it is not known if a decision will be announced on Tuesday."

At the start of July, only 1.1% of Covid cases were admitted to hospital.\nThe Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called for a \"detailed plan for the restoration of freedoms in Wales\". \n\"Given the data trends, the Welsh Labour government now has the flexibility to provide families, workers and businesses with their plan for restoring all freedoms and releasing restrictions in Wales,\" he said.\nPlaid Cymru's deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth criticised the Welsh government's plans for a press conference on Wednesday evening, saying it would clash with a debate in the Senedd calling for a Wales-only public inquiry into ministers' handling of the Covid pandemic.\n\"Throughout the pandemic, we've seen announcement after announcement made by press release, rather than in our Parliament where proper scrutiny can take place. Sadly, here's another example of a government snub,\" he said.\nAlthough most businesses are now allowed to trade, under current restrictions they must do so under social-distancing laws.\nThese apply to pubs, cafes and restaurants and the sector has lobbied for them to be scrapped.\nNightclubs remain closed in Wales, while organisers of large events are waiting to find out if they can take place.\nLegal limits on numbers that can meet outdoors remain in Wales, while meetings in private homes are currently restricted to those who are in extended household groups."

This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

      "tags": "China,Inspiring stories",
      "text": "A Chinese man has been reunited with his son after a 24-year search that saw him travel over 500,000km (310,000 mi) on a motorbike across the country.\nGuo Gangtang's son had been snatched aged two by human traffickers in front of their home in the province of Shandong.\nHis son's disappearance actually inspired a movie in 2015, which starred Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau.\nChild abductions are a big problem in China, with thousands taken every year.\nAccording to China's Ministry of Public Security, the police were able to trace the son's identity using DNA testing. Two suspects were later tracked down and arrested, said a Global Times report. \nThe suspects, who were dating at the time, had planned to kidnap a child with the intention of selling him for money, said a report by China News. \nAfter spotting Mr Guo's son playing alone outside his home, the female suspect identified only by her surname Tang grabbed him and took him to the bus station, where her partner, named as Hu, was waiting. \nThe couple then took an intercity coach to neighbouring Henan province and sold the child there.\nLocal media reports say Mr Guo's son was found still living in the province. \nMr Guo and his wife cried and hugged their son when they were reunited in Liaocheng, Shandong, on Sunday, state media CCTV reported.\n\"My baby, you came back!\" said the mother, whose name was not released, in a video of the reunion.\n\"Now that the child has been found, everything can only be happy from now on,\" Mr Guo told reporters.\nMr Lau, who got to know Mr Guo while preparing to play him in the film Lost and Love, congratulated him. \n\"I'd like to say to Brother Guo that I admire your persistence,\" he said, according to the South China Morning Post.\nAfter his son was abducted in 1997, Mr Guo reportedly travelled to more than 20 provinces around the country on the back of a motorbike chasing tip-offs. \nIn the process, he broke bones in traffic accidents and even encountered highway robbers. Ten motorbikes were also damaged.\nCarrying around banners with his son's picture on them, he is said to have spent his life savings on his mission, sleeping under bridges and begging for money when he ran out of cash.\nHe also became a prominent member of missing-persons organisations in China, and helped at least seven other parents reunite with their abducted children.\nIn China, the abduction and trafficking of babies has been a problem for decades. \nIn 2015, it was estimated that 20,000 children were being abducted each year in China. Many of them are sold into adoption, both domestically and overseas.\nChild trafficking has been an enormous social problem in China with tens of thousands of unsolved cases remaining.\nIt appears to be so widespread that a few years ago, when the police introduced a phone app to report crime, \"child abduction\" had its own front-page category along with the likes of theft, drug dealing and murder.\nIt has clearly caused massive pain in the community, not the least of which because - in some cases - there appear to have been \"insiders\" like relatives or village neighbours who have assisted in the abductions.\nIn one particularly distressing example, children were kidnapped and made to work in a brick factory in a neighbouring province.\nThis year's big DNA drive by the police seems to be working in terms of finding some of those taken quite a while ago. But it would be hard to solve more recent cases in this way because the strategy relies on people coming forward for blood tests and children (who may not even know they had been abducted and sold to their current parents) are hardly going to be presenting themselves for blood tests.\nEither way, given the bleak nature of the situation and the desperate sadness of many who've lost their children, seeing Guo Gangtang reunited with his son after decades of perseverance has been both heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nFace coverings will still be \"recommended\" on public transport when restrictions in England are eased from next Monday, ministers say. But laws will be replaced by guidance, meaning people will no longer be fined for refusing to wear a mask. So bus and rail companies must decide whether or not to turn people away. Some are calling for clearer guidance.\nNicola Sturgeon will confirm whether Scotland's Covid-19 rules will be eased in the coming weeks. The first minister had planned to move the entire nation to the minimum level of restrictions from 19 July, lifting most legal limitations from 9 August. However, Scotland has since been hit by a record wave of infections. Ministers have said they believe the peak has passed but will discuss the data ahead of this afternoon's announcement.\nRetailers have just enjoyed the best three months on record, with High Street sales from April to June up 28.4% on 2020's figures and 10.4% higher than in 2019, the British Retail Consortium says. But  it warns many retailers still face \"strong headwinds\" as the UK economy recovers from the pandemic, with the shift to online shopping apparently here to stay.\nThe prime minister must start delivering an ambitious levelling-up programme for the north of England \"at pace\", with grants for deprived areas, say a group of 50 Conservative MPs. The Northern Research Group is calling for an economic strategy focused on helping communities rebuild after the pandemic. A recent study by the Northern Health Science Alliance found the area had been hit harder than the rest of England during coronavirus, \"exacerbating\" regional inequalities.\nThe UK's first testing \"mega lab\" has opened and is expected to be capable to processing hundreds of thousands of samples a day. The government says automation and robotics at the Rosalind Franklin laboratory in Leamington Spa will help increase the UK's daily coronavirus testing capacity. The centre is expected to create up to 1,500 jobs.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWondering whether you should wear a mask after Covid restrictions have been lifted?

      "tags": "Voting rights in the United States,Texas,United States",
      "text": "Democratic politicians in Texas have left their state en masse in an effort to prevent Republicans there from passing a law to tighten voting rules.\nThe move will temporarily paralyse the state's House of Representatives, which requires at least two-thirds of the 150 members be present for a vote. \nAt least 50 House Democrats boarded two private jets from Austin to Washington DC on Monday.\nThe move comes amid a wave of voting restrictions in Republican-led states.\nRepublicans argue the measures are essential for election security but Democrats see them as an attack on the right to vote. \nThe bill in Texas would ban 24-hour polling places and expand the authority of partisan poll watchers. A first vote is planned later this week.\nThe House lawmakers took off on Monday afternoon. When they landed in Washington DC, the Democrats said they would not return until the 30-day special session had ended next month.\nUnder Texas House rules, absent politicians can be arrested and returned to the house floor. But the authority responsible does not have jurisdiction outside Texas. \nIn response to the exodus, Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican, said the House would use \"every available resource\" to secure a quorum. \nTexas Democrats are again attempting to prevent state Republicans from passing new voting restrictions - and where they're going says everything about their ultimate objective.\nThis fight, in their view, will be won or lost in Washington DC - where Democrats have control - not in Texas, where Republicans call the shots. And not only could federal legislation override the proposed changes to Texas voting laws, it would also block enacted measures in Georgia, Arizona and other key presidential battleground states.\nThere has been concern among liberals that the Biden administration is not taking seriously the threat state-level voting laws pose to Democratic candidates in forthcoming elections - and has not shown a willingness to take aggressive action in Congress to push through new national rules. \nIt is, however, a symbolic move. It probably only delays the inevitable in Texas and is unlikely to change the dynamic in Washington, where the Republican Senate minority has more effective means to block the Democrats than simply leaving town."

I didn't know if he was released or remanded until I chased them, then I felt like a nuisance.\"\nShe has since been involved in focus groups with the force, to advise how they can improve services.\n\"I think it'll make a big difference, because if people feel sometimes the police can be a bit lax with updates and cases take a long time, they might be more hesitant to report a crime. \n\"There's quite a misconception that the police will do nothing because sometimes it can take a long time.\n\"But now they know there's a unit to provide support for victims all the way through, even if your case takes longer.\"\nGwent Police Chief Constable Pam Kelly said 19 specialist officers answering calls and keeping victims updated would remove about 12% of calls to the 101 service.\n\"It's a win-win,\" she said. \"It speeds up 101 for the public, but more importantly makes sure we have the right service at the right time for victims.\n\"Victims often feel the most vulnerable but actually they are the most powerful part of the criminal justice system - without them coming forward we will never be able to bring offenders to justice.\"\nEarlier this year victims' commissioner Dame Vera Baird warned the Commons Justice Select Committee that victims would drop out of the process because of delays in the courts.\nScott Bowen, a criminal solicitor in Newport, said a crime reported today might involve a 12 to 18-month delay before a decision is made to charge. It could then be another year before it comes to crown court.\n\"There's a huge impact not just on justice for victims of crime but also those accused of crime,\" he added.\n\"If you are a professional accused of a sexual offence, assault or dishonesty, you can often find yourself being suspended by your professional bodies until the conclusion of the case.\n\"This [unit] is a good thing, but this is really not addressing the core of the problem. \n\"This is addressing one of the consequences of the backlog and a lack of funding throughout the whole justice system.\"\nA Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \"Major challenges remain which is why we are investing hundreds of millions to further increase capacity, including the opening of a nightingale court in Swansea to deliver swifter justice and support victims.\"\nIf you have been affected by domestic abuse, help and support is available at BBC Action Line."

So no, because of the timing, I'm not feeling guilty about them losing anything,\" she added.\n\"I think it's been a hard year for everyone and I think it's something we've got to do, because the children are really looking forward to a nice family break. That's the decision we've done and we're happy with that decision.\"\nThe children's grandparents are looking after them ahead of a staycation next week and Heddwen said she knows of others taking similar steps.\n\"Some other parents have tried to reduce the risk by not taking them on the school bus, for example, just to get those bubbles down.\"\nFigures released on Thursday showed 549 cases in the preceding week were linked to schools - almost a fifth of all new Covid-19 cases in Wales.\nPositive cases in schools have led to thousands of children having to self-isolate. \nAt one point two weeks ago, all remaining pupils at Rhyl High School in Denbighshire were in isolation.\nWhile fines may be issued for unauthorised school absences, Welsh government guidance says: \"Punitive measures, including fines, would not be appropriate measures to take unless authorities deem it necessary to pursue a small number of cases relating to persistent absence, which are unrelated to the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\nMr Miles told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast school was where children got \"the best education and support\".\nHe added: \"I want to make sure that they have the opportunity to be in school to be able to build on what is needed after the last year.\"\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"We'll continue to work together to take further steps to make sure education continues for all children and young people, with as little disruption as possible.\""

The terrible consequences of the brutal rapes and murders of two innocent girls will forever darken the lives of the families concerned.\"\nPitchfork's release will be subject to strict licence conditions.\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"We are disappointed with this outcome given we felt there were grounds for the decision to be reconsidered, but respect the independent judge's decision.\n\"Our sympathies remain with the families of Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth but they can be reassured that Pitchfork will be subject to close probation supervision for life and faces an immediate return to prison if he fails to comply with his licence conditions.\n\"The Lord Chancellor has launched a Root and Branch review of the parole system, which will report back later this year, and we are changing the law so that child murderers such as Pitchfork face life in prison without the possibility of parole as the default sentence.\"\nOver the last two years there have been more than 250 challenges to Parole Board decisions - but whether they come from inmates wanting to get out, or the secretary of state trying to keep them in, very few lead to a fresh hearing because the legal test to overturn the detailed work of the Parole Board is very high. \nIn this case, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland had to convince a judge that the panel that authorised Pitchfork's release had acted irrationally - meaning no other panel could have reached the same conclusion on the evidence. \nNeither ministers nor offending behaviour experts have argued that Pitchfork needs to take part in more rehabilitation programmes or treatment - and so from the get-go it was looking like the challenge was not going to succeed. \nWhen Pitchfork was jailed in 1988, a minister set his minimum term - so if the government wanted him to be in jail forever, that was the time to make that order. The law of life sentences - set by MPs - allows prisoners to be released on licence at the end of their minimum term, if they can show they are no longer a danger. \nAnd so, there was always going to come a time when the Parole Board would have to consider whether Pitchfork was safe to leave jail.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

June saw the lowest monthly total since February 2015. \nRedundancy figures from the Office for National Statistics have shown a similar trend, a few months later.\n\"The data suggest that there is no spike in redundancies coming in July or August,\" says Xiaowei Xu, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \"The labour market is in a much better position than anyone expected at the start of the pandemic, and it shows how well the furlough scheme has worked,\" \nThe latest numbers are the lowest since the Insolvency Service tightened up reporting guidelines, according to Tony Wilson of the Institute for Employment Studies.  \nBefore that, it was more common for firms to fail to file the necessary paperwork when planning redundancies, leading to artificially lower figures, he says.  \nThe number of HR1 forms filed has also been falling this year, with 179 forms filed by 151 different employers. \nThat's the lowest number of forms since 2014, despite the winding down of the furlough scheme, where the government has supported jobs in the pandemic by paying wages when employers cannot.\nFrom July, employers will have to pay 10% of employees' wages, on top of pension contributions and employer's National Insurance. That rises to 20% in August, until the scheme finishes completely at the end of September.\n\"Anyone who has been on furlough this year has already cost their employers money - so their employers must be keen to keep them on. It's not surprising that they are not being made redundant in large numbers,\" says Ms Xu.\nA total of 11.6 million jobs have been furloughed during the pandemic, though only 2.4 million were still on furlough at the end of May.\nThe success of the furlough scheme and the vaccine programme have lead many economists to cut their forecasts of how many jobs would be lost in the pandemic.\n\"By the time the furlough scheme ends on 30 September, the economy is likely to be strong enough to support a level of employment not far off where it is now. In fact, there is evidence that firms are finding it increasingly difficult to hire workers, especially in industries such as transport and manufacturing,\" says Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\n\"I think it's likely that many firms have already made and communicated their plans and that with the easing of restrictions happening on schedule next week, we just won't see any significant increase in redundancy notifications over the next few months,\" says Mr Wilson.\nUntil recently, HR1 data were not routinely published, except for in Northern Ireland.  \nLast year the BBC began requesting these figures through the Freedom of Information Act, revealing the extraordinary increase in redundancy plans through the spring and summer of 2020. \nThis year, the Insolvency Service has started to publish these figures every month on its website. \nThe data only covers firms proposing 20 or more job cuts, so smaller firms are not picked up by these figures. Employers sometimes notify more redundancies than they eventually make.  \nThe figures are not classified as Official Statistics, which are subject to rigorous quality control procedures.  \nData for Northern Ireland is published by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency as part of its monthly Labour Market Report."

      "text": "Retail sales enjoyed a springtime bounceback, with growth in High Street sales from April to June making it the best three months on record, industry body figures indicate.\nSales in the period rose 28.4% from a year ago, and were up 10.4% from 2019.\nJune's sunny weather and the Euro 2020 tournament helped to boost trade, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.\nBut the BRC warned that many retailers still faced \"strong headwinds\" as the UK economy recovers from the pandemic.\nIn June, fashion and footwear did well during the brief burst of sunshine, while the start of the Euro 2020 football championship provided a boost for TVs, snack food and beer.\nHowever, online sales remained much higher than their pre-pandemic levels, suggesting the shift to online was \"here to stay\", the BRC-KPMG retail sales report found.\nThere were also signs of a dilution in retail consumer spending as the hospitality and leisure sectors reopened, leading to a \"fight for share of wallet\", it said.\n\"Retailers are facing challenges on a number of fronts, particularly convincing consumers that it's safe to shop in store as restrictions around mask wearing and social distancing come to an end,\" said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG. \nBut he added that High Street retailers were hoping for a \"summer boost\" with the lifting of Covid restrictions.\nBRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: \"The second quarter of 2021 saw exceptional growth as the gradual unlocking of the UK economy encouraged a release of pent-up demand built up over previous lockdowns. \n\"In June, while growth in food sales began to slow, non-food sales were bolstered by growing consumer confidence and the continued unleashing of consumer demand. \n\"With many people taking staycations, or cheaper UK-based holidays, many have found they have a little extra to spend at the shops, with strong growth in-store in June.\" \nMs Dickinson said \"consumer comfort with the next stage of the roadmap\" would be key.\nMany customers were looking forward to a return to a more normal shopping experience, while others might be discouraged by changes in face-covering rules, she added.\nShe said the government would need to reassure the public on safety, while pushing forward with its \"hugely successful\" vaccination programme. \n\"The public will also need to be understanding of one another during the easing of restrictions,\" she warned.\n\"There has been a big rise in violence and abuse against retail workers during the pandemic and colleagues cannot be put in the firing line because of this change in policy.\"\nNew data from Barclaycard indicates that consumer spending rose 11.1% in June compared with the same period in 2019, as warmer weather and the easing of pandemic restrictions led to an economic uplift.\nBarclaycard said spending on fuel, hotels, resorts and accommodation all grew for the first time since the pandemic began, as holidaymakers booked and embarked on UK breaks.\nFace-to-face retail grew 9.7%, the credit card firm said. However, there were signs that pent-up demand was easing off, as clothing and furniture stores recorded smaller increases than in May. "

His remarks earlier went viral.\nSpain's equality minister has now asked a prosecutor to investigate Darrechi.\nIrene Montero tweeted that she had asked the prosecutor to find out whether Darrechi had told the truth and, if so, to identify possible victims of his sexual deception, which would constitute sexual abuse under current Spanish law.\nA new bill defines unprotected sex without consent as an assault, she noted. \nThe social media furore was sparked by a video in which Darrechi told Spanish YouTuber Mostopapi: \"I find it difficult with a condom, so I never use one.\"\nDarrechi said that as none of his partners had got pregnant from unprotected sex with him \"I started thinking that I had a problem\". \"So I tell them 'relax, I'm sterile'. It's true.\" The interviewer laughed when he said that.\nOn Instagram later Darrechi said: \"I want to apologise, really. Sometimes I don't realise the responsibility that is mine... \n\"I made a comment that really is out of place and that is not right. Sometimes I say things and sometimes I exaggerate, but here it's just crazy what I said, I wish it had been cut at the edit and no one would ever have heard it.\"\nHe has not yet responded to a BBC request to comment on the controversy.\nParliament is to debate the new sexual consent law in September. Spain has had controversial court cases in which men were convicted of sexual abuse, rather than the more serious offence of sexual assault.\n\"To take off the condom or ejaculate during intercourse without consent is sexual abuse today and the 'only yes means yes' law will recognise it as assault,\" Ms Montero tweeted. \nShe said that \"to show off about such a thing in front of 26 million followers demonstrates the urgency of putting the consent issue centre stage\".\nSome of Darrechi's critics pointed to the risk of him passing on a sexually transmitted disease. \nIn May he caused a social media storm by denouncing abortion in a TikTok video. \nWATCH a report on Europe's controversial rape laws:"

      "text": "The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has used parliamentary privilege to identify a former soldier facing two murder charges over his actions on Bloody Sunday.\nThe Foyle MP named Soldier F during a debate in the House of Commons on the Armed Forces Bill on Tuesday afternoon. \nThe soldier is also facing five attempted murder charges.\nHe had been granted anonymity by the judge hearing the case. \nThe BBC is not naming Soldier F for legal reasons.\nThe ancient right of parliamentary privilege gives MPs unrestricted free speech in the Commons chamber allowing them to name names without the risk of legal action. \nColum Eastwood used that right of privilege to name Soldier F. \nAfter naming him, the Foyle MP said: \"For 50 years he has been granted anonymity and now the government want to grant him an amnesty. \n\"No one involved in murder during the Troubles should be granted an amnesty.\"\nSpeaking outside parliament, Mr Eastwood told the BBC: \"Over the past couple of weeks his name has been plastered on Free Derry Corner, it has gone viral on social media.\n\"The people of Derry know his name. There is no reason for him to be granted anonymity. \n\"No other perpetrator involved would be given anonymity, for some reason Soldier F is a protected species.\"\nSoldier F is facing two murder charges over the killings of William McKinney and James Wray and five attempted murder charges for his actions on Bloody Sunday in 1972 when 13 people were shot dead by paratroopers.\nHe was granted anonymity after the judge hearing the case concluded \"a real risk does exist\" to the life of Soldier F and he is right to \"feel genuine fear\".\nBut the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said it planned to withdraw the charges after reviewing the case and decided statements were no longer admissible evidence.\nThe case was due to be formally dismissed in court last week, but a legal challenge by a brother of William McKinney forced an adjournment. \nLeave has been granted for a judicial review into the PPS's decision not to proceed with the prosecution.  \nThe case is due to be heard in September. \nGregory Campbell from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) described Mr Eastwood's decision to identify Soldier F as \"reckless and downright dangerous\".\n\"I will be writing to the Speaker and the Commissioner for Standards. The Foyle MP's behaviour falls well below that expected of someone in his position, especially when the courts have made clear that to name this person could jeopardise life,\" the DUP MP said. \nMr Campbell, who represents the East Londonderry constituency, added: \"The DUP does not believe in an amnesty for anyone who perpetrated wrongful actions. \n\"Far too many terrorists have already been released early. Everyone must be equal under the law.\"\nFormer veterans' minister Johnny Mercer also said Mr Eastwood should be sanctioned for his \"unnecessary and dangerous\" move.\nIn a social media post he accused Mr Eastwood of \"mis-using parliamentary privilege\".\n\"I have never defended this man, but I will defend his right to a fair process,\" Mr Mercer said."

      "text": "Government guidance urging nightclubs to make their customers show Covid passports has been branded unfair and unworkable by those running them.\nVenues have been advised to ask for the NHS Covid pass or a negative test result when they reopen on 19 July.\nBut operators said not making the move mandatory was passing the buck.\nAnd the Night Time Industries Association called it \"disingenuous and unclear\", questioning how voluntary it really was.\nMichael Kill, who runs the association, told the BBC he had received inquiries from members seeking clarification.\nMr Kill said that although the policy was not mandatory at present, it could turn out that venues were \"in the hands of local public health directors\" who could force them to comply.\nThe government has also said it \"reserves the right\" to force venues to require people to show their Covid passport or proof of a negative Covid test in order to be allowed in.\nMr Kill said the government seemed to be \"gauging the public narrative\" before deciding how tough to be, adding that this was likely to cause \"some level of chaos\".\nHe accused the government of replacing the old clubland mantra of \"Rave, sleep, repeat\" with \"Leak, listen, then release\".\nThe government declined to comment on Mr Kill's remarks.\nOne major nightclub firm, Rekom UK, which owns 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, Eden and Fiction, said on Monday it would not be asking for Covid passports. \nIts chief executive, Peter Marks, told the Press Association news agency his clubs would be reopening \"at full capacity and without any requirement for a negative Covid test\".\nHowever, he declined to comment when contacted by the BBC on Tuesday.\nOther nightclub operators contacted by the BBC expressed frustration at what they saw as the government making them bear all the responsibility.\nTristan Moffat, operations director of the Piano Works, which has two London venues and will not be asking to see Covid passports, said: \"It's like we've been given a rope to hang ourselves with.\n\"If it all goes wrong, we'll be closed down again and the buck will be passed back to the operators.\"\nMr Moffat said the change of date for the lifting of restrictions, from 21 June to 19 July, had cost his firm \u00a3250,000 in lost profit and trading losses incurred, compared with the same four-week period in 2019.\nHe added that 90% of their customers were aged 20 to 35, precisely those who had not had the chance to be fully vaccinated.\n\"In an already nervous environment, this just adds another layer of fear and nervousness,\" he said.\n\"It's not fair - the government should either mandate something or not mandate it. \n\"They've been writing cheques of hope that we can't cash. Confidence is slipping away and we're the ones to suffer.\"\nAnother proprietor, pub owner Julie Spensley, whose son Stephen also owns a bar and a nightclub in Middlesbrough, said it would take up to 10 times longer to admit revellers if they had to show Covid passports.\nShe said: \"Unless it's mandatory, we will not be introducing it.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mrs Spensley, who co-owns the Dickens Inn with her husband Tony, said the advice was \"very unworkable for venues such as late bars and nightclubs\".\nHer son, Stephen Spensley, owns the TS One bar and Spensley's Emporium nightclub, also in Middlesbrough.\n\"Nightclubs and late bars have queues outside and that's the way they operate,\" she said.\nStaff already had to check customers' ID to make sure they were old enough to be let in, so imposing further checks would not be practical, she added.\n\"We've had it tough for the last 16 months,\" she said.\nShe stressed that she wanted people to stay safe, but questioned the wisdom of tighter restrictions on night-time venues when the government was easing the rules on social distancing and mask-wearing.\nPeople in England can do this by requesting an NHS Covid Pass via the NHS website or the NHS app.\nOnce logged in, an NHS Covid Pass can be requested. The system generates a QR code, which lasts for 28 days.\nAn NHS Covid Pass can be obtained two weeks after a second dose of the Covid vaccine, as long as both doses were given in England.\nA pass can be requested if you've had a negative PCR test or lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, which you have reported on the NHS website. These passes last 48 hours after the test result.\nAlternatively, a pass can be given following a positive PCR test result within the last six months, and when self-isolating has finished. The pass lasts for 180 days after the test result.\nPeople who have had both their jabs can also request an NHS Covid Pass letter by calling 119. This only shows vaccination status and has no expiry date.\nClick here to read more.\nAre you a nightclub owner? Are you confused by the guidance?

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: Sturgeon to announce decision on restrictions",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is to confirm whether Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions can be eased as planned in the coming weeks.\nThe Scottish Parliament is to be recalled from recess for a statement from the first minister at 14:00.\nThe government had set a target of moving the whole country to level zero from 19 July, before lifting most legal restrictions from 9 August.\nHowever, the country has since been hit by a record-breaking wave of infections which has put pressure on NHS services.\nMinisters said they believed the peak of the latest wave had passed. Ms Sturgeon said she was hopeful that some changes could go ahead as planned.\nShe is meeting her cabinet to review the latest data on Tuesday morning before announcing the decision to MSPs in the afternoon.\nDifferent Covid-19 restrictions are in force across Scotland, with areas in the central belt including Glasgow and Edinburgh in level two and other areas like Aberdeenshire, Fife and the Highlands in level one.\nOrkney, Shetland and many island communities are already in level zero. Ms Sturgeon had set a target of moving the whole country to this level on 19 July - the same date as most restrictions will be lifted in England.\nThis would see the number of people who are allowed to meet up indoors public spaces such as bars and restaurants increased to 10 adults from four households, and to eight people from four households for private homes. \nPublic Health expert Prof Linda Bauld from Edinburgh University, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme she believed the planned easing would go ahead.\nShe said: \"What I am expecting to hear is that we will proceed to level 0 on 19 July. There are a basket of indicators the Scottish government will be looking at. \n\"Starting with cases we see a decline in the seven-day average - 2,650, down from 3,800 a week before that. We have got more people in hospital now -  just under 470 people - and we have three or four health board areas or hospitals that are definitely under strain, but others are coping . And the average deaths is about three or four a week which is regrettable. \n\"You can see that although the situation is still fragile it is showing some signs of being sustainable and we are able to cope with it.\"\nThe first minister said she wanted to move \"beyond level zero\" by scrapping the bulk of legal restrictions from 9 August, while maintaining some mitigations such as the use of face coverings in enclosed areas.\nShe warned that these dates were \"not set in stone\" after Scotland was hit by a wave of new infections which at one point saw the country have the worst daily case rates in Europe.\nA further 2,134 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Monday - down on figures from recent weeks, but still with 11% of tests coming back positive.\nHowever, the number of people in hospital has not risen as dramatically, with ministers saying the vaccine programme had \"weakened\" the link between catching the virus and becoming seriously ill.\nMs Sturgeon suggested that the plans could be modified, saying the government could potentially \"proceed with some planned changes but hold back on others\".\nThis led to claims that Scotland could be heading for a \"level 0.5\", with opposition leaders saying this would create uncertainty for people and businesses that had been making plans based on the current timetable.\nThe first minister said that \"this is a time for care and caution\", adding: \"Over the next few weeks as we complete the vaccination programme, it is really important that we don't let the virus outrun us.\"\nAnd she raised questions about the UK government's approach of lifting most restrictions from 19 July, saying this was \"something of an exception\" when viewed \"against the backdrop of sharply increasing case numbers\".\nThe Scottish Parliament is currently in recess for the summer break, but will be recalled for the virtual session at 14:00. It will give opposition leaders the chance to question the first minister on her plans.\nThe Scottish Conservatives want the government to press forward with plans for easing restrictions, saying the country must \"keep moving forward\".\nParty leader Douglas Ross said ministers had failed to boost the vaccine programme and the Test and Protect system, but said \"the public should not be punished\" for this.\nHe added: \"If Tuesday's statement does not deliver a plan of action for tackling the virus and a clear timetable for exiting restrictions, Nicola Sturgeon risks losing public buy-in. \"\nScottish Labour wants the time between vaccine doses cut to four weeks and extra resources directed to the contact tracing system.\nDeputy leader Jackie Baillie said the government had \"lost control of the pandemic\" and must take \"immediate action\".\nShe said: \"We are at a crucial moment in the pandemic - it's about time we showed the urgency and ambition that we need.\"\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Greens called for a cautious approach, with co-leader Lorna Slater saying the government should \"take a safer, more gradual approach until the vaccine programme is further on\".\nAnd Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon must set out \"concrete action and urgent changes around the rules and expectations for self-isolation\" amid concerns about staff shortages in hospitals.\nMs Sturgeon has said the government is reviewing rules for self-isolation and quarantine, although it is not known if a decision will be announced on Tuesday."

      "text": "With the vaccination programme racing against the spread of new variants, rules around international travel are rapidly changing.\nAlthough different countries have their own entry rules, a digital \"passport\" which provides evidence of a person's vaccination status has been rolled out across Europe.\nSimilar apps have been rolled out in the UK and while Scots have had to request theirs by post, Nicola Sturgeon has announced a QR system will be launched on Friday.\nPeople in Scotland have been able to access their certificate since 19 May - which shows both the dates of Covid vaccination and the type of drug administered.\nThe Scottish government said the service was intended to allow people access to a certificate without asking their GP, thereby \"easing the burden\" on the NHS.\nWhile no countries required vaccination status to travel when the service launched, some countries now do - and destinations have different entry rules which can change at short notice.\nThe government has information which you can check before travelling.\nMore than 30 countries, including Greece and Spain, now accept the pass.\nOriginally people could download the document online, but on 22 May the site suffered a security glitch which enabled people to alter details on the document using popular software programmes.\nBBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters.\nA fix was implemented on 25 May, which meant people in Scotland could only request the document be sent to them by post.\nPeople can view their vaccine status through the NHS Inform patient portal. Users have to log in using a unique username printed on their Covid vaccination appointment letter.\nThose who are not online can request the certificate to be posted by phoning a freephone Covid status helpline on 0808 196 8565.\nScotland's reliance on a paper system was previously criticised by travel agents, who said travellers were being \"blindsided\". \nConcerns emerged that the paper system was causing airport queues and more interactions with staff and passengers.\nBy the end of July, the Scottish government had awarded a Danish firm a \u00a3600,000 contract to develop a vaccine passport similar to those already in use elsewhere in the UK and Europe.\nOn Tuesday during a Covid update to Parliament, Ms Sturgeon confirmed people could download their certificate in the form of a QR code from Friday.\nPaper copies will continue but will include a QR code on them.\nFurthermore, vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month.\nMs Sturgeon said the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme - although that decision would be kept under review.\nAnd there are no plans to include key services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services.\nAn EU vaccine \"passport\" has been introduced across all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.\nBecause the UK is no longer in the EU, the certificate is not available to most Britons, which has led to a number of problems.\nThe European system often requires people to present a QR code, however people in Scotland have been denied entry to certain places when they presented their paper certificate.\nFrance insists UK visitors are fully vaccinated before entry for non-essential travel. The country has also tightened its rules for any UK travellers who are not fully vaccinated, requiring them to have a negative test in the 24 hours before arrival, rather than the 48 hours allowed previously.\nThe country has also rolled out a new health pass which means people need proof of vaccination to enter places such as museums and cinemas.\nMeanwhile Norway initially only accepted Norwegian, Danish, Swedish or EU digital Covid certificates as proof of vaccination or previous illness.\nFrom 12 August it began to accept certificates from England and Wales as it was able to verify QR codes at the border.\nAgain this has caused problems for people in Scotland - including one man whose yacht has been stranded in Norway since last August.\nPeople in England can use the NHS app to either download their certificate or have it emailed to them. \nSimilar systems are in place in Wales and Northern Ireland, and while the NI system went offline following a data breach in early August, it is now up and running again.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced plans \"to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather\" by the end of September.\nUnder these new measures, people would show proof of vaccination by using the NHS Covid Pass app in England."

      "tags": "Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest,Amazon rainforest,COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Technology can help indigenous communities to significantly curb deforestation, according to a new study.  \nIndigenous people living in the Peruvian Amazon were equipped by conservation groups with satellite data and smartphones.\nThey were able to reduce tree losses by half in the first year of the project.\nReductions were greater in communities facing threats from illegal gold mining, logging and drugs. \nOver one-third of the Amazon rainforest lies within the territory of approximately 3,344 acknowledged indigenous communities. \nBut for decades, these areas have been under attack from outsiders who are determined to cut down trees for a range of purposes including mining, logging and the planting of illicit crops like the coca plants used to manufacture cocaine. \nOver the past 40 years, governments and environmentalists have invested heavily in the use of satellite technology to monitor the removal of trees. \nGovernments in Brazil, Peru and Colombia have put in place a system of high-resolution deforestation alerts, but there is little evidence that this information reaches the indigenous communities most affected. \nThis new research set out to see if putting information directly into the hands of forest communities would make a difference. \nIn this randomised, controlled study, the authors identified 76 remote villages in the Peruvian Amazon, with 36 randomly-assigned to participate in this new monitoring programme. \nThirty-seven other communities served as a control group and continued with their existing forest management practices.\nThree members of each selected community were trained in the use of technology and shown how to carry out patrols to verify deforestation. \nWhen satellite information showed suspected deforestation activity in an area, photos and GPS coordinates were loaded onto USB drives and carried up the Amazon river and delivered by couriers.\nThe information was then downloaded onto specialised smartphone apps which would guide the community monitors to the suspected locations. \nWhen the forest patrols confirmed any unauthorised deforestation, they would report back to a general assembly of community members to decide on the best approach. \nIn cases where drug dealers were involved, the community could decide to report the issue to law enforcement. \nIf the activity was perceived as less risky, community members could intervene directly and drive the offenders off their land. \nWhen the researchers examined the impact of the new approach, they found that deforestation dropped by 52% in the first year, and by 21% in the second. \n\"It's quite a sizeable impact,\" said Jacob Kopas, an independent researcher and an author on the paper. \n\"We saw evidence of fewer instances of tree cover loss in the programme communities compared with control communities.\"\n\"On average, those communities managed to avert 8.8 hectares of deforestation within the first year. But the communities that were most threatened, the ones that had more deforestation in the past were the ones pulling more weight and were reducing deforestation more than in others.\"\nIndigenous groups welcomed the research, saying it is among the first peer-reviewed studies to show the benefits of empowering local communities. \n\"The study provides evidence that supporting our communities with the latest technology and training can help reduce deforestation in our territories,\" said Jorge Perez Rubio, the president of the Loreto regional indigenous organization (ORPIO), where the study was carried out.\nThe scale of the problem of deforestation in indigenous areas is significant. Between 2000 and 2015, around 17% of tree loss in the Amazon occurred on nationally-protected or areas assigned to indigenous peoples. \nThis is expected to increase in the coming years.\n\"Over the next decade, if nothing changes, indigenous peoples in the Amazon Basin are projected to lose 4.4 million hectares of rainforest, mostly to outsiders who encroach on their territories to cut down trees,\" says Cameron Ellis, with the Rainforest Foundation US, who helped facilitate the study.\n\"But if the community-based forest monitoring methodology could be widely adopted and local governance strengthened, forest loss in the Amazon could be reduced by as much as 20% across all indigenous lands.\"\n\"If the approach were targeted to regions with high deforestation rates, forest loss in those areas could be cut by more than three quarters.\"\nThe study has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "The government has won a Commons vote to lock in cuts to spending on overseas aid, despite a rebellion by Tory MPs.\nMPs voted by a majority of 35 to keep the budget for international development at 0.5% of national income.\nBut 25 Conservatives joined Labour and other parties in an attempt to reinstate the 0.7% figure, which was in place until earlier this year.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the cut was needed to keep public debt down during the pandemic. \nThe government has faced cross-party criticism over the reduction - which amounts to almost \u00a34bn - including from all the UK's living former prime ministers. \nMany Conservative MPs have spoken out against the move, announced last November despite a commitment to spending 0.7% in the party's 2019 election manifesto. Meeting the figure was made law in 2015.\nCharities such as Oxfam and ActionAid have warned that projects are being called off as a result of the cuts.\nBut the government won by 333 votes to 298, following a three-hour debate.\nThe Conservative rebels included former Prime Minister Theresa May and ex-cabinet ministers Karen Bradley, Jeremy Hunt, David Davis, Stephen Crabb, Damian Green and Andrew Mitchell.\nOpening the debate, Boris Johnson said the government had spent \u00a3407bn during the pandemic to \"shelter our people from an economic hurricane never before experienced in living memory\".\nHe added: \"There must inevitably be consequences.\"\nThe prime minister added that the reduction was temporary and that people could \"take pride that the UK will still contribute at least \u00a310bn\" to aid.\n\"This is not an argument about principle,\" he said. \"The only question is when we return to 0.7% and my purpose today is to describe how we propose to achieve this shared goal in an affordable way.\"\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the cut was \"not in the national interest\", adding: \"Every member here was elected on a manifesto promise to retain the 0.7% target.\"\nHe added: \"Cutting aid will increase costs and have a big impact on our economy. Development aid reduces conflict. It reduces disease and people fleeing from their homes.\n\"It is a false economy to pretend that this is some sort of cut that doesn't have consequences.\"\nFollowing the result of the vote, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the \"temporary\" cut in aid spending would continue as planned.\nHe added: \"Whilst not every member felt able to vote for the government's compromise, the substantive matter of whether we remain committed to the 0.7% target - not just now, but for decades to come - is clearly a point of significant unity in this House.\"\nBut former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said: \"The government has blatantly broken its word and should be ashamed of its decision.\n\"It seems that we can afford a 'national yacht' than no-one either wants or needs, while cutting help to some of the most miserable and destitute people in the world.\"\nOxfam GB chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah described the vote as \"a disaster for the world's poorest people\".\nAnd Daniel Willis, of the campaign group Global Justice Now, said: \"When the inevitable death and suffering from aid cuts hits the news, each and every MP who has voted to sever the UK's 0.7% commitment should know that blood is on their hands.\"\nLast month, 30 Conservative MPs supported an amendment to a parliamentary bill, aimed at forcing the government to meet the 0.7% target.\nAnother 14 or so Tories would have had to join them in Tuesday's vote to ensure a government defeat."

      "tags": "Transport,COP26,Climate change,Environment,Grant Shapps",
      "text": "You can carry on flying, the government has told the British public, as it outlines its plan to reduce transport emissions to virtually zero by 2050.\nMinisters say new technology will allow domestic flights to be almost emissions-free by 2040, and international aviation to be near zero-carbon by mid-century.\nThe policy has been ridiculed by environmentalists, who say the government is putting far too much faith in innovation.\nThey say demand for flying and driving must be curbed if the UK is to meet its ambitious climate targets.\nThe comments on aviation form part of the government\u2019s Transport Decarbonisation Strategy, announced on Wednesday.\nTransport is responsible for 27% of the UK's emissions, making it the single biggest emitting sector. Before the pandemic, flying made up about 7% of overall emissions. \nThe government has pledged the entire economy will be virtually zero-carbon by mid-century and is relying on new technology to play a significant role in achieving that, especially in aviation. \n\"It's not about stopping people doing things: it's about doing the same things differently,\" said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\n\"We will still fly on holiday, but in more efficient aircraft, using sustainable fuel. We will still drive, but increasingly in zero-emission cars.\"\nHe told the BBC's Today Programme that progress towards low-carbon flying was further advanced than people realised.\n\"We already have electric aircraft, going up in the air, and in fact the UK has become the first country in the world to have a hydrogen aircraft flying as well,\" he said.\n\"In addition to those advanced technologies, we also have things like sustainable aviation fuel.\"\nMr Shapps said the government planned to use sustainable fuel to fly home some participants in November's COP26 conference.\nHowever, critics say reductions in emissions will not be achievable without reducing the amount we fly.\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas described the government's approach to aviation as \"a flight of fantasy\" that relied on technology that was still being developed. \n\"The government should not hoodwink us,\" she told the BBC.\nMr Shapps said a bigger problem was road transport, which contributes 90% of transport-related carbon emissions in the UK, but that he felt progress was being made.\n\"I think we're reaching that tipping point. When you switch on the television or or see an internet ad, you'll see that electric cars and hybrid cars are almost exclusively the ones being advertised right now,\" he said.\nThe government has already said that sales of new cars and vans powered solely by petrol or diesel will be banned in the UK from 2030.\nThe transport plan says all new lorries will be zero-carbon by 2040, running on batteries or hydrogen under a world-leading UK policy. \nA recent study showed that trucks accounted for 2% of vehicles in the EU, but 22% of road transport emissions.\nThe Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the government's proposals on lorries were speculative, unrealistic and potentially damaging to business.\n\"These alternative HGVs don't yet exist - we don't know when they will and what they will cost,\" said RHA chief executive Richard Burnett.\n\"For many haulage companies, there are fears around cost of new vehicles and a collapse in resale value of existing lorries. The problem is even worse for coaches, which are more expensive to buy and have longer lifecycles.\"\nThe government's transport decarbonisation plan also says:\nHowever, critics said the plans did not go far enough.\nKerry McCarthy MP, Labour\u2019s shadow transport minister, said: \u201cThis plan has been a long time coming, but it was barely worth the wait.\n\"The government is still stalling when it comes to the tough decisions needed,\" she added, citing the rise in rail fares and the cut in plug-in car grants. \n\u201cAt a time when we should be showing global leadership and pressing ahead with this agenda, it's clear ministers still have a long way to go.\u201d\nThe Green Party's Ms Lucas said that it was \"a missed opportunity to really rethink how we organise how we travel\".\nGreen groups said problem areas remained such as:\nThe government has been discussing a proposal to work with employers on \u201cCommute Zero\u201d - a project that could encourage more lift-sharing and working from home.\nMinisters have also agreed that the whole central government fleet of 40,000 cars and vans should be fully zero-emission by 2027.\nHowever, the Treasury will face difficult choices, as revenue streams shift as a result of the zero-carbon strategy.\nCurrently, the Treasury receives more than \u00a330bn a year from fuel taxes on conventional cars. \nOne alternative could be a pay-as-you-drive tax, but a government spokeswoman told BBC News there were no plans at present to introduce road pricing.\nShe also said there were no plans for a frequent flyer levy. \nWhere transport policy is devolved, the plan applies just to England only. Where policy is reserved, this will apply to the UK as a whole and the UK government will consult with the UK nations."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Scotland is to move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for \"some time\".\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant.\nThe move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals.\nHowever, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the return of workers to offices is to be delayed.\nMs Sturgeon said \"sensible precautions\" had to be maintained while the vaccine programme continues.\nShe said she still hoped Scotland could move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions.\nMinisters also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point.\nMs Sturgeon said a decision would be made before the new academic term on whether or not school pupils who are the close contacts of positive cases will have to self-isolate.\nAnd fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as of Monday, as long as they take a test after arrival.\nHowever, the first minister told MSPs that mandatory precautions like the mandatory wearing of face coverings and guidance on ventilation and hand hygiene would remain in place \"for some time\".\nMs Sturgeon added: \"We must stick to a cautious approach. We are easing restrictions next week, but we are not abandoning them.\n\"And even when we move beyond level zero, we will continue to require some baseline measures such as face coverings.\"\nScotland has been hit by a record-breaking third wave of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, with the faster-spreading Delta variant putting pressure on health services.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs - who were recalled for a virtual session despite Holyrood being in recess - that the spike in infections had \"levelled off\", and that the vaccine programme was weakening the link between case number and severe illnesses.\nShe said \"a gradual approach\" to easing restrictions stood the best chance of being sustainable and of minimising loss of life.\nNicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said \"I will always err on the side of going more cautiously\". \nEngland is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. \nBut Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasis restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option \"for good headlines\".\nA statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.\nDespite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned.\nAn obvious point of divergence from England is face coverings.\nWhile laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (they'll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear they'll stay here \"for as long as necessary\". \nIt feels like they'll be one of the last measures to go.\nThe move to level zero means: \nPlans have, however, been modified in light of high case numbers:\nMs Sturgeon said the move was \"not a complete and wholesale lifting of all restrictions\", but it said it \"does restore yet more freedom to all of us\".\nBusiness groups broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers \"moving the goalposts\" at the last minute by altering their plans.\nThe Scottish Retail Consortium said firms \"will be reassured the sense of progress is being maintained, even if the pace has slowed\".\nThe Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant \"should hopefully generate some extra passing trade\", but said there was \"less good news\" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue.\nAnd the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was \"another encouraging milestone\", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be \"a bitter blow for employees and employers alike\".\nThe virtual session of parliament gave opposition politicians the chance to question the first minister about the plans.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said \"we can't continue asking the public to sacrifice so much of their lives\".\nHe said: \"The balance has to tilt further in favour of moving forward - we have to make progress back to normality. The public have done what was expected of them, now it's time for this SNP government to deliver.\"\nLabour's Anas Sarwar said the changes to restrictions were welcome, but said \"inconsistent decision making and communications\" was hitting the response to the pandemic.\nHe said: \"The high rate of cases is a cause for concern and I'm afraid what the first minister has presented today is not a clear strategy to cope with the new phase of the pandemic.\"\nScottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater said she had \"concerns about reducing restrictions while case numbers are so high\", voicing fears that it could lead to a vaccine-resistant variant emerging.\nAnd outgoing Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said changes to self-isolation rules must be made \"urgently\", with \"thousands of key workers\" having to quarantine despite testing negative."

      "text": "Wales should now lift all Covid restrictions, a leading expert on infectious diseases has said. \nThe success of vaccinations and immunity levels meant it was safe to end lockdown, said Welsh and UK government advisor Prof John Watkins.\nHe said the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths had \"definitely\" been broken.\nSenior Welsh officials have said while the link is weaker, it has not been eradicated.\nThere are also concerns young people are not coming forward for vaccines as the rollout continues. \nOn Monday Boris Johnson announced almost all legal Covid-19 restrictions would end in England on 19 July, meaning those across the border will no longer be required by law to social distance or wear face masks.\nWelsh ministers will announce any changes to Covid rules in Wales at their next review on Wednesday.\nDr Ami Jones, a critical care consultant at the Aneurin Bevan health board, said the changes in England were a \"slap in the face for the whole population\" as case rates continued to rise.\n\"I think most healthcare providers will not be throwing their masks in the bin, and going to crowded places\u2026 because we know what's coming,\" she said.\nLatest data from Public Health Wales shows the Covid case rate in Wales is 136.1 per 100,000 people - below other UK nations and all English regions.\nOn Monday, 1,190 new cases were announced, taking the total since the start of the pandemic to 225,691. \nThe number of people admitted to hospital with Covid remains close to record low levels, with the number of those in critical care also very low.\nConsultant epidemiologist Prof Watkins, of Cardiff University, said vaccinations had been extremely effective in preventing serious illness, including against the Delta variant.\n\"We've got a considerable amount of the adult population now vaccinated and we know that vaccination reduces transmission as well as reduces adverse events,\" he said.\n\"And we know that in young people, where the bulk of infections are occurring at the moment, that actually they have got far less chances of adverse events, so I think we're at a reasonably good place to start opening up society.\nDespite a recent rise in the number of cases, Prof Watkins said the latest health modelling suggested Wales was following a \"positive trajectory\".\n\"It's always going to be a balance of risk, and I think we've protected the most vulnerable to this virus, and we've got good evidence that a significant proportion of the UK population has been exposed to the virus, or has antibodies to the virus... so actually we have a population that is reasonably well protected,\" he said.\nHe added: \"There comes a point where we have to start living with the viral transmission, and I think now is the time to do that.\"\nProf Watkins added: \"In Wales, the numbers of deaths from people testing positive for the last 28 days have been no more than one or two a day, and many days without any [deaths] at all. Our hospitals are in a good place in terms of cases.\n\"Over the next couple of weeks, as we start to open up and this current surge of cases passes through, we'll see whether we're on the right course - but all the data suggests that we are.\"\nAlmost 92% of adults in Wales - including two-thirds of young people under 25 - now have antibodies to help protect them against Covid-19, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates.\nDr Watkins said the concept of herd immunity should not be discounted as a \"dirty word\", adding: \"once you've got a certain level of protection within the population, the virus doesn't have very many places to go.\"\nDr Jones said she feared what might happen if Welsh ministers did not act cautiously.\n\"I'm worried about how the next few weeks are going to go, if the restrictions do lift\u2026 it's going to be a Delta Covid fiesta, it's going to spread like wildfire,\" she said.\n\"Who knows what that's going to mean for the hospitals, which ultimately is going to impact on hundreds of thousands of people lives.\"\nWelsh government Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan has already said the country is going to have to \"learn to live with\" coronavirus as ministers consider their next move.\nSenior advisers did not say how ministers may relax decide to relax restrictions when they took a Welsh government Covid briefing on Monday.\nBut they reiterated their view that the link between cases and serious illness was weaker, but had not gone completely.\nDeputy chief medical officer for vaccines Dr Gill Richardson said: \"We can confidently say that vaccines have weakened the link between infections, serious illness and hospitalisations and deaths.\n\"But they have not broken the link.\"\nDr Richardson told the press conference hospital admissions were not at the same levels as they were during the winter.\nBut she added: \"We can expect hospital admissions to rise, especially among young people, or the unvaccinated and those who haven't completed their course.\"\nChief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said he did not know if there would ever be a point where the link between cases and serious illness was \"completely broken\".\nHe said cases were doubling approximately every six-and-a-half days, with every person who is infected \"going on to infect almost another two people\".\nHe added that in this third wave of the epidemic, there were far fewer infections in the older age groups.\nDr Richardson was also concerned that some younger adults were not coming forward for vaccination. \nFor those aged 18 to 39, 26% have not yet taken up a first dose - nearly 234,500 people.\n\"One in four in this age group are still not protected,\" Dr Richardson said.\n\"These young adults are vulnerable to infection, serious illness and life-changing long Covid, as well as loss of earnings if they have to self-isolate as cases of the Delta variant are increasing in this age group.\" \nShe added: \"Health boards are running walk-in Pfizer clinics to make it as easy as possible for this age group to get vaccinated.\""

Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland will move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but the mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for \"some time\". She says the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant. We already know England will remove nearly all Covid restrictions on 19 July - our health correspondent Nick Triggle considers whether the unlocking will pay off or backfire with infection rates and hospital admissions already rising sharply.\nAlmost 1.5m pupils were absent from classes in England's primary and secondary schools last week, a snapshot of one day's official data shows. The weekly Department for Education figures show about 840,000 were off for Covid-related reasons and a further 630,000 were absent for other reasons. Meanwhile, BBC Wales has spoken to a family who are keeping their children off school so they can avoid self-isolating ahead of their summer holiday.\nThe nightclub industry has been reacting to the UK government's guidance that venues in England should ask for the NHS Covid pass or a negative test result when they reopen on 19 July. Michael Kill, who runs the Night Time Industries Association says the guidance is \"disingenuous and unclear\" and says his members have asked him whether the policy is really voluntary. At present, organisers are not legally required to follow the guidance but the government says it \"reserves the right\" to force venues to require people to show their Covid passport or proof of a negative Covid test.\nThe UK government has fended off an attempt by MPs to force it to reverse its cut to spending on overseas aid, with Boris Johnson saying it is needed during the \"economic hurricane\" caused by the coronavirus pandemic. MPs voted to keep the budget for international development at 0.5% of national income. Several Tory MPs had joined Labour and other parties in an attempt to reinstate the 0.7% figure, in place until earlier this year.\nIt's been a hard 15 months for residents who have been unable to leave their care home since the start of the pandemic. The Knightwood home in Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, has so far avoided any cases of Covid-19 but says residents have found the lack of contact with family and friends tough. In this video we hear from residents who have enjoyed their first trip out since the pandemic began.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWith restrictions easing across the UK this summer, here's a reminder of what measures are in place and where.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Rules on wearing face coverings in Scotland could remain in place until Christmas, the deputy first minister has said.\nJohn Swinney told BBC Scotland it was \"perfectly conceivable\" that masks could still be mandatory in December. \nOn Tuesday, the first minister confirmed mask-wearing would remain for \"some time\" as she announced the move to level zero of Covid restrictions.\nNicola Sturgeon modified planned easing due to the spread of the Delta variant.\nScotland will move to level zero on 19 July which means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals.\nHowever, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained and the return of workers to offices will also be delayed.\nIn an interview on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime, Mr Swinney was asked if he could envisaged face coverings being mandatory until Christmas.\nHe said: \"I think that's perfectly conceivable. I think that we should recognise that we have got to take a careful and cautious approach to the suppression of Covid.\n\"We know the virus is going to be with us for a long time so the more that we can do, a gradual elementary level to provide obstacles and barriers to the circulation of this virus, the more we should do that.\"\nMr Swinney also revealed Scottish government modelling predicts that Scotland could record between 2,500 and 10,500 new Covid cases on the day restrictions move to level zero.\nHe added: \"I think it is likely to be much closer to that lower end of the spectrum than the higher end.\"\nHe said the impact of the virus was \"moving in the right direction - which means that we can afford some of the relaxation\".\nDevi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she was \"really happy\" to see a continued requirement for face masks.\n\"I know people say it should be 'my choice', but I don't wear a face mask to protect myself, I wear it to protect others,\" she told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme.\n\"If I'm in a shop there could be someone who is immuno-compromised, who is asthmatic, who is elderly - and they will feel safer in that setting if I wear my mask.\"\nProf Sridhar said case numbers in Scotland needed to come down from their current high levels before the wearing of face masks could be dropped.\n\"We're not asking people to wear masks on beaches like in Portugal or outside in parks, like in parts of the United States,\" she told BBC Scotland.\n\"It's really just in workplaces, indoor settings, transport, shops, and it's seen as proportionate to the risks of transmission in those settings.\"\nIt is still hoped that Scotland will move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions. A decision on this will be taken next month. \nAmong other announcements in Ms Sturgeon's statement to Holyrood were plans to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate, as long as they have had two doses of vaccine. \nIn addition, fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as long as they take a test after arrival.\nBusiness groups have broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers \"moving the goalposts\" at the last minute by altering plans, such as hospitality venues now being required to close at midnight.\nStephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, said: \"The midnight curfew is just a made-up time with no evidence to justify it. \n\"It's like Groundhog Day with our warnings about driving people into house parties and other uncontrolled spaces that lack all the precautions you find in responsible pubs, restaurants and hotels.\" \nThe Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant \"should hopefully generate some extra passing trade\", but said there was \"less good news\" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue.\nThe Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was \"another encouraging milestone\", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be \"a bitter blow for employees and employers alike\".\nThe continued wearing of facemasks won the backing of shop worker union Usdaw.\nTracy Gilbert, the union's regional secretary for Scotland, said: \"We ask the public to show their support and respect for shop workers by following the law.\n\"Wearing a face covering in a shop is an important measure to help protect workers who have no option but to interact with large numbers of people as a part of their job.\""

      "text": "Some Hungary fans booed as England players took the knee ahead of Tuesday's World Cup qualifier at Wembley.\nAbout 1,000 supporters clashed with police, and one fan was arrested. Fifa \"strongly condemned\" the incident. \nTaking the knee has spread across the sporting world as a statement against racism, but has proved controversial. \nThe practice of taking the knee before football matches became widespread in 2020, following the murder of George Floyd in the US.\nBefore Euro 2020 competition began, the England manager Gareth Southgate said his players would take the knee throughout the tournament.\nA number of other teams also took the knee before some or all of their matches, including Scotland, Wales, Belgium, Portugal and Switzerland.\nIn advance of the competition, Home Secretary Priti Patel said that she did not support \"people participating in that type of gesture politics\". Asked if she would criticise fans who booed England players taking the knee, she said: \"That's a choice for them, quite frankly\".\nAfter they missed penalties in the final, which England lost, Marcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho were racially abused.\nMs Patel tweeted that she was disgusted they had been subjected to \"vile racist abuse\".\nBut England football player Tyrone Mings accused the home secretary of hypocrisy on Twitter. \nSeveral Conservative politicians have said they oppose kneeling because they see it as a political statement.\nThen Education Minister Gillian Keegan said taking the knee was \"creating division\".\nRather than demonstrating opposition to racism and support for the Black Lives Matter movement, it has been argued that kneeling actually shows support for a campaigning organisation also called Black Lives Matter.\nBut Gareth Southgate said the England team's actions were not in support of the Black Lives Matter organisation. He said: \"We have got a situation where some people seem to think it is a political stand that they don't agree with. That is not the reason the players are doing it. We are supporting each other.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said people should be \"free to show... how much they condemn racism in any way they choose\". But he was criticised by Labour for stopping short of condemning fans who booed the England team.\nAmerican footballer Colin Kaepernick took the knee during the national anthem before a match in 2016. He said he could not stand to show pride in the flag of a country that oppressed black people.\nThe anti-racist statement has since become a prominent symbol in sport and during protests. \nIt has also been a feature of Black Lives Matter protests, including those following the murder of George Floyd.\nThe IOC - which organises the Games - initially banned competitors from taking the knee. It said Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter forbids any kind of \"demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda\".\nBut it then decided to lift the ban, allowing athletes to \"express their views\" before and after competing. This meant they could take the knee before an event.\nHowever, they could not express their views during events and victory ceremonies, or at the Olympic Village. Any protest should not be \"disruptive\", including unfurling a flag or banner during \"the introduction of another athlete or team\".\nTeam GB's women's football players took the knee before every match during the Olympics to highlight the racial abuse directed at England's men's team after the Euro 2020 competition. \nFemale footballers from Chile and Japan also took the knee, as did Costa Rican gymnast Luciana Alvarado.

      "text": "At least 92 people have died after a fire in a Covid isolation ward at a hospital in the Iraqi city of Nasiriya.\nMuch of Iraq's healthcare system is in poor condition after years of conflict and angry relatives of the victims have been protesting outside the facility.\nPolice say the fire at al-Hussein hospital started when sparks from faulty wiring spread to an oxygen tank, causing it to explode.\nArrest warrants have been issued against 13 people, local media report.\nPrivately owned news site Shafaq News reports that the list, issued by the Dhi Qar Integrity Investigation Court, includes the province's health chief Saddam Sahib al-Taweel.\nPM Mustafa al-Kadhimi earlier ordered the arrest of the head of the hospital, and said the fire was \"a deep wound in the conscience of all Iraqis\".\nHealth officials say more than 100 people were injured in the blaze.\nThe new ward had space for 70 beds and was built just three months ago, medical officials told the Associated Press news agency. \nIt was the second hospital fire in Iraq in three months. In April, a fire at a hospital in Baghdad killed more than 80 people.\nOday al-Jabri, who lost four family members and two neighbours in the fire, told AFP news agency he was frustrated and angry.\n\"I don't know whether to console my family, my neighbours or my relatives,\" he said.\nAnother relative, Abu Nour al-Shawi, told the agency: \"A patient infected with coronavirus is brought here to be treated, but is returned in a coffin along with his family and children. Where [else] would such a thing happen?\"\nA medic at the hospital, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the building had lacked even basic safety measures.\n\"The hospital lacks a fire sprinkler system or even a simple fire alarm,\" he said. \n\"We complained many times over the past three months that a tragedy could happen any moment from a cigarette stub, but every time we get the same answer from health officials: 'We don't have enough money'.\"\nAfter April's deadly fire in the capital, started by an oxygen tank, Health Minister Hassan al-Tamimi resigned.\nThe pandemic has severely strained Iraq's health service, already suffering after years of war, neglect and corruption.\nIraq has reported more than 17,000 deaths and recorded 1.4 million infections from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nThe country has given at least one dose of a vaccine against Covid to just over one million of its roughly 40 million citizens, the World Health Organization says."

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Developers are \"working at pace\" to deliver NI's full Covid-19 vaccine certification system by next week.\nDr Eddie O'Neill, from the Department of Health, said staff had been working \"non stop\" to deliver the interim paper-based solution.\nSo far, 3,175 certificates have been issued, with about 1,000 currently being processed for people travelling up to 19 July.\nThe scheme allows people to show they have had two doses of a Covid vaccine.\nRegarding its delivery, Dr O'Neill, who is solutions director of the Covid Certification Service at the department, said they were \"still on target\" for 19 July.\nThe interim scheme was introduced to accommodate those planning to visit countries which require proof of two Covid-19 vaccinations.\nThe full certificate will incorporate counterfeit protection measures, requiring a specialised printing process.\n\"In terms of the technical solution, what we were hoping to do with say a fully-automated and planned solution was already quite a feat to deliver by next week,\" Dr O'Neill told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.\n\"For instance the app we are planning to stand up was due to be delivered by mid-August, we are now trying to deliver that next week.\n\"And we are starting testing of the solution tomorrow.\n\"Fingers crossed we have got teams standing up through the weekend, private developers and contractors - they are going to work through the weekend to try and deliver that for next week.\"\nDr O'Neill said the department was also \"hoping to stand up a non-digital route as well which will involve people being able to phone a helpline and printed certificates being sent out\".\n\"The printed certificates - there is a lead time of about 10 days or so because it depends on the post and things getting to you. \n\"So we are going to try and put some detailed instructions up so that as we transition from the interim solution they will understand what they need to do in order to get certification.\"\nPeople travelling before July 19 can still apply for a paper certificate via the NI Direct website.\nMeanwhile, the EU's Digital Covid certificate (DCC) is due to come into effect in the Republic of Ireland on Monday, 19 July.\nThe DCC allows more un-restricted international travel.\nFully vaccinated people, those who can show they have recovered from Covid-19 in the last six months, and those with negative PCR tests taken within 72 hours of departure can avail of it.\nIreland is the last EU country to implement the DCC which came into operation earlier this month.\nThis week, fully vaccinated people in the Republic are being sent by email and post documents with QR codes as proof of their vaccination status.\nThe correspondence amounts to the Irish Digital Covid Certificate and can be used for indoor hospitality when it reopens later this month.\nThe Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin and senior ministers have said that Irish passport holders in Northern Ireland will be able to access the DCC, but they have yet to indicate how they will be able to do so.\nMinisters have said that official proof of vaccination in Northern Ireland will be acceptable for indoor hospitality in the Republic, but it is advisable to have other official proof of identity with a photograph such as a driving licence as a support document for indoor service in pubs and restaurants.\nT\u00e1naiste (deputy PM) Leo Varadkar has said it is hoped new laws, which will allow indoor hospitality to reopen will take effect next week, but not later than 26 July.\nThose vaccinated in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the United States are to be permitted entry to bars and restaurants if they have verifiable proof of vaccination.\nMr Varadkar cautioned that nightclubs can operate as licensed venues with table service, but will not be allowed to operate in their traditional form for \"quite some time\".\nTourism Minister Catherine Martin said there would be fines of up to \u20ac2,500 (\u00a32,125) for the use of forged documents to gain entry to venues.\nThe announcement had been expected and was welcomed by the Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI) which said a mammoth amount of work had happened behind the scenes to draft the legislation.\nThe EU's digital Covid certificate is being rolled out across all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.\nEU citizens (and those of Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), can download it or obtain a paper copy - at no cost."

      "tags": "Cuba",
      "text": "Dozens of people have been arrested in Cuba after thousands joined the biggest protests for decades against the island's Communist government, media and opposition sources say.\nUnauthorised public gatherings are illegal in Cuba and protests are rare.\nImages on social media showed what appeared to be security forces detaining, beating and pepper-spraying some of the protesters. \nCuba's president labelled those protesting \"mercenaries\".\nIn a four-hour-long televised address President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel slammed protestors as \"counter-revolutionaries\" while his foreign minister alleged the demonstrations had been financed and instigated by the United States. \nBut those who took to the streets said they were angry about the collapse of the economy, food and medicine shortages, price hikes and the government's handling of Covid-19.\nThe government's response to the demonstrations was swift. Figures compiled by legal help centre Cubalex suggest around 100 people were arrested on Sunday.\nAmong those detained is journalist Camila Acosta who was covering the protests for Spanish newspaper ABC. Spanish Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares demanded her immediate release.\nA young man who only gave his name as Carlos Alberto told BBC News Mundo he was hiding at his girlfriend's home after taking part in a demonstration.\n\"A colleague of mine was arrested, they came to look for him at his home. I'm afraid the same thing could happen to me,\" he said.\n\"We weren't doing anything bad, we're just asking for freedom and with this attitude they're showing what they are: a dictatorship,\" he told BBC Mundo's Lioman Lima over the phone. \nThere were reports of internet blackouts across the island. Access to mobile internet was rolled out in December 2018 in Cuba but is controlled by the state-owned telecommunications company Etecsa. \nInternet monitoring site Netblocks said access to WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Telegram had been restricted by Etecsa's servers. \nMobile internet is the main way for Cubans to access independent news and many said the blackouts had increased the sense of ominous unease following the protests.\nThere also appeared to be a heightened presence of security forces with one Havana resident reporting that \"the streets are full of police\".\n\"There are police at every corner and practically all you see going past is police patrols.\"\nWith messaging services down and dozens of people arrested, relatives of some of those detained gathered in front of police stations for news of their loved ones. \nAriel Gonz\u00e1lez told BBC News Mundo he had been to his local police station twice to enquire about his son, a 21-year-old student who was arrested during the protests. \n\"I knew he got roughed up because some of his friends who were with him told me. At the police station they told me they couldn't tell me where he is because he was taken by another 'institution',\" he said referring to the presence of plainclothes officers at the protests.\nMany of those attending the protests on Sunday complained about shortages\n\"There is no food, no medicine, there is no freedom. They do not let us live,\" one man named only as Alejandro said.\nProtesters also shouted \"freedom\" and \"down with the dictatorship\".\nPresident Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel blamed the US sanctions on Cuba - which have been in place in various forms since 1962 - for the shortages, calling them a \"policy of economic suffocation\".\nThe US - which has a decades-old history of hostilities with Cuba - has said it stands with Cubans, and called on those in government to refrain from violence and listen to its people.\n\"The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,\" US President Joe Biden said.\nThe anti-government protests began with a demonstration in the city of San Antonio de los Ba\u00f1os, south-west of Havana, but soon spread throughout the country.\nMany were broadcast live on social networks. Posts on social media showed people overturning police cars and looting some state-owned shops which price their goods in foreign currencies. For many Cubans, these shops are the only way they can buy basic necessities but prices are high.\nCuba's economy is struggling. Tourism, one of the most important sectors, has been devastated by the restrictions on travel during the Covid pandemic. \nSugar, which is mostly exported, is another key earner for Cuba. But this year's harvest has been much worse than expected. \nAs a result, the government's reserves of foreign currency are depleted, meaning it cannot buy in imported goods to supplement shortages, as it would normally do. \nAre you taking part in the protests?

He died on 9 March 2021, aged 67. \nHis colleagues thought highly of him, saying: \"We have many happy memories of shifts together, laughs, nights out, and listening to all his stories of his many holidays abroad. We will miss him.\"\nBernadette White, his sister, said he was a caring, gentle and loving man with a wicked sense of humour. \nShe added: \"The last seven years, I would say, is when David started to live his life, doing the things that made him happy without having to worry about anyone else.\"\nStephen Stewart met his future wife, Heather, at a youth club when he was just 14. They got engaged on his 17th birthday and he had just turned 20 when they married. \nThe couple, who lived in Motherwell, came from \"very different\" backgrounds but they grew up together during their 25-year marriage while raising their only child. \nStephen took pride in his work for concrete manufacturer FP McCann, latterly as a lab technician working out what strength the concrete needed to be for certain projects. \nOutside work, he loved fishing, computer games, gadgets and during the first lockdown he managed to build a hot tub shelter with the help of a series of YouTube videos. \nHe died of Covid pneumonia at University Hospital Wishaw on 19 February 2021, aged 45.\nFamily of 45-year-old Covid victim warn of dangers\nNan Douglas worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. \nShe was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. \nAfter losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. \nFollowing a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a \"living wake\" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. \nShe lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she picked up Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. \nGraeme McGrath's greatest passions were rowing and the River Clyde. \nOn the day of his funeral, fellow rowers held oars in a guard of honour at Glasgow Green in a tribute appreciated by his wife Anne and their three sons.\nFor 40 years Graeme volunteered with the Glasgow Humane Society and was often called on to row rescue boats on the Clyde, or to help evacuate families during floods. \nAfter undergoing a kidney transplant in his 50s, he was unable to get out on the river as much. He retired from his job as a Thomas Cook travel agent and moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire. \nBut he still felt the pull of the Clyde and regularly returned to the city to meet friends and row safety boats at regattas. \nHe died with Covid on 15 February 2021 at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, aged 66, after being admitted for an infection affecting his heart. \nTommy Morrow spent most of his life in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, where he met his partner Jackie and raised their children, Demi and Mark. \nHis family described him as a character and not a day went by without them laughing at his jokes. \nHe loved camping and fishing in places like Stornoway with his friends but the most important people in his life were his family, including grandchildren, Lacey and Louden. \nDuring his career he worked in various well-known hotels and restaurants in Glasgow but he had not worked for some years due to poor health, including COPD. \nHe died with Covid on 15 February 2021, aged 53. \"It was so cruel - he was so close to getting the vaccine,\" his family said. \nTommy Rooney was a bus driver for 36 years and hugely popular with colleagues at First Bus in Larbert. \nOn the day of his funeral they were among dozens of people who lined the streets and applauded as his cortege passed the depot. \nFirst Bus operations manager Jason Hackett told the Falkirk Herald that Tommy was the \"heart and soul\" of the Larbert station. \nMarried to Margaret, the Bonnybridge man had two daughters and a granddaughter who described him as a \"humble but proud family man who put everyone else's needs before his own\". \nAn avid Celtic fan, he spent much of the pandemic driving key workers to their essential duties.

      "text": "Face coverings must be worn on London's transport network despite restrictions easing on 19 July, London's mayor says.\nSadiq Khan said he was not prepared to put Tube, bus and other transport users at risk by relaxing the rules on face coverings.\nFace masks have been mandatory on public transport for the past year to reduce the spread of the virus.\nBut those rules will be replaced with government guidance advising passengers to wear masks only on busy services.\nEngland is removing most of its Covid restrictions next Monday, and while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he expects masks to be worn in crowded places, such as on a busy Tube train, their use will no longer be compulsory.\nLondon was the first English city to insist on face coverings after Covid restrictions ease. \nOther metro mayors have also joined calls for masks to be worn on public transport.\nIn Scotland, the mandatory use of face coverings will remain in place for \"some time\", First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said, even after the country eases most of its other restrictions on 19 July.  \nThe rules for masks apply in shops and public transport - as well as pubs and restaurants when not seated.\nIn Wales, masks will continue to be required by law in some settings. The Welsh government has said face coverings would still be mandatory on public transport and in health and social care settings.\nMr Khan has made face masks a condition of carriage for the Tube, bus, tram, DLR, Overground and TfL Rail. \nThis means that, despite the easing of restrictions on 19 July, it will be listed as a condition in a legal agreement between Transport for London (TfL) and its customers.\nFace coverings will also be required in taxis and private hire vehicles by both drivers and passengers unless they are exempt.\nMr Khan said: \"We know from the government's own advisors and from the World Health Organisation, that wearing a face covering indoors does reduce transmissions.\n\"It leads to greater public safety and greater public confidence as well.\n\"As long as the virus is still with us, and as long as we're still concerned about the virus being transmitted, we will make it compulsory.\"\nHe said he was \"confident you will see from Monday high levels of the rules being followed just like there have been since last June\".\nTfL's 400 enforcement officers will deny those without a face covering from using London transport, under the plan.\nTfL staff and bus drivers will continue to remind passengers that masks are a requirement, Mr Khan said. \nGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has said he will not '\"rule out\" mandating face masks on public transport.\nMr Burnham told the BBC he had not yet taken the decision to mandate masks on trams in Manchester and wanted to avoid adding to people's confusion.\nThe reaction from commuters has been pretty unanimous - the message over masks is mixed and confusing. \nNow, for example, at many merged stations in London - like Barking, Richmond, Wimbledon & Shepherd's Bush - you could go from a rail service where masks are personal choice, to a TfL service where they are a condition of carriage. \nSometimes different services even use the same the platform. \nSo you'll have to become very adept at differentiating a TfL rail service from a national rail one. \nFor an industry that is trying to become more uniform, standardised and is meant to be about making fares and interchanges easier, it's a complete mess. \nThe rail industry says masks will put people off using public transport - polling in London says the opposite. \nThe question now is, will other mayors and train operators follow London's example? \nOr could a simple single rule for all public transport emerge, even at this late stage?\nA poll from the travel watchdog TransportFocus found 56% of Londoners said say they will not use public transport \"unless passengers are required to wear a face covering\".\nThe legal requirement to wear a face covering in shops, public transport and other enclosed public spaces will end on 19 July. It will be replaced with government guidance. \nA government spokeswoman stressed there would be a shift from \"universal government diktat to relying on people's personal responsibility\".\n\"The guidance is clear that people are expected and recommended to wear a mask when they come into contact with people they don't normally meet in enclosed and crowded spaces,\" she said.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the rules were \"just common sense when you think about it\" as \"you would be in a crowded area\" on London transport.\nLabour has said it is \"irresponsible\" to drop the legal requirement to wear masks.\nThe move has been welcomed by the RMT union, which represents rail workers. It said the approach was consistent with the rules that are currently in place in Scotland, Wales and on Eurostar services to the continent.\nHowever, it said: \"We now have the ludicrous position where a passenger travelling through London will have different rules on the Tube and the mainline services.\"\nMr Shapps said: \"We've seen lots of these rules being different in different parts of the UK.\n\"The same way you can't drink alcohol on London transport systems, but you can on some long distance journeys.\"\nFrom 2 May to 29 May 2021, 86% of TfL customers said they were wearing face coverings at all times on public transport. \nOf the 14% not wearing a face covering at all times or not at all, almost three-quarters (74%) claim to have an exemption or good reason under the current regulations for not doing so, TfL research shows.\nAndy Byford, London's Transport Commissioner, said: \"The transport network is cleaner than ever, with an enhanced cleaning regime, hospital grade cleaning products, widely-available hand sanitizer and UV light fittings on escalator handrails to kill viruses. \n\"It is great news that regular independent testing for the virus by Imperial College has found no trace on our services, and we are now ready to safely welcome back more and more customers from 19 July as people head out to enjoy all that the capital has to offer.\""

      "text": "Parts of London received a month's worth of rain in one day, causing flash floods.\nOn Monday 47.8mm of rain fell in a 24-hour period in Kew, most of it in just one hour. The average monthly rainfall in July is 44.5mm.\nResidents were evacuated from their homes and train services cancelled, while cars were submerged in water.\nLondon Fire Brigade said it had taken more than 1,000 calls related to flooding.\nA spokesperson for the service said: \"We're asking people not to walk through or drive through the floodwater. Floodwater can be contaminated and vehicles can become unstable.\"\nThames Water said it received more than 2,500 calls in five hours on Monday as sewers filled up and flooded.\n\"While our pipes are designed to cope with most storms, yesterday's rainfall was so severe the system filled up very quickly,\" a spokesperson said.\nAmong those to suffer was Queen guitarist Brian May, who lives in Kensington.\nThe rock star said he was \"angry\" after a number of his \"precious\" belongings were ruined during the flooding.\nIn a post on Instagram, he wrote: \"The whole bottom floor had been inundated with a sewage overflow - which has covered our carpets, rugs and all kinds of precious (to us) things in a stinking sludge.\n\"It's disgusting, and actually quite heart-breaking,\" the We Will Rock You writer added. \"It feels like we have been invaded, desecrated.\"\nDaisy King, from Holland Park, described how she came home to find more than two feet of water in her flat. \nShe said: \"It was up to my knees and all my stuff was floating about in it.\n\"The fridge and oven were half-filled with water and books and records were ruined.\" \nThe owner of vintage record shop, Audio Gold, in Muswell Hill said \"tens of thousands of pounds-worth\" of his stock has been ruined in the floods.\n\"The two main things that were damaged were our records and the vintage wooden loud-speakers\", said Ben Shallcross.\nThe businessman, who has owned the shop for 20 years, explained: \"Much of the shop's stock is stacked on the floor and the water has swelled up around the beautiful old speakers and ruined the veneer.\"\nOne resident in Maida Vale said his basement was \"under at least a foot of water, and it was black, so it is sewage water\".\nShane, who lives on Shirland Road, said \"everything was wrecked\" by the floods which \"subsided quickly\" when the rain stopped. \nKensington and Chelsea Council said 120 people were put up in hotels on Monday night due to flooding in the area.\nOne video posted on Twitter shows water pouring in down the stairs at Sloane Square Tube station.\nPutney Village in Wandsworth and Chipstead in Surrey both recorded more than 31mm of rain in one hour.\nThe rainfall recorded in Kew Gardens on Monday made it the wettest day there since 6 July 1983 and the third wettest day on record.\nGareth Furby, who lives in Barnes, south-west London, described \"bailing out\" water from a neighbour's front garden.\n\"I helped another neighbour by building a dam at her front gate,\" he said.\n\"A theory locally is that the rain came precisely at high tide on the Thames which meant any sewers which flow into the river backed up.\"\nUnderground stations, including Chalk Farm, Hampstead and Wimbledon, were closed due to the flooding.\nLines at Euston station had to be shut down after the intense downpours.\nThe train routes which were affected by floods included:\nA lightning strike also damaged signalling at Epsom, affecting trains between London Waterloo and Dorking.\nOperators have said trains could be cancelled or delayed with commuters advised to check before they travel.\nDo you live in an area affected by flooding?

      "text": "England footballer Tyrone Mings has accused the home secretary of pretending to be disgusted by racist abuse, after she previously described taking the knee as \"gesture politics\".  \nMarcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho were targeted after they missed penalties in the Euro 2020 final.\nPriti Patel said she was \"disgusted\" by the online abuse directed at the trio.\nMings said she had \"stoked the fire\" by refusing to criticise fans who booed the England team for taking the knee. \nMs Patel declined to comment on his tweet, but Downing Street said the home secretary was \"working every day to clamp down on hate crime, racism and violence\".\nMings, who was a member of the England Euros squad, was angered by a perceived lack of action by the government when some fans booed the players taking the knee before the tournament.\nThe act of taking the knee has become a prominent symbol in sport and during anti-racist protests in recent years, and England players have been adopting the stance at the start of their matches. \nSpeaking to GB News about the England players' protest in June, Ms Patel said she did not support \"people participating in that type of gesture politics\".\nAsked if she would criticise fans who booed England players taking the knee she said: \"That's a choice for them, quite frankly.\"\nWriting on Twitter on Monday evening, Mings said: \"You don't get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as 'Gesture Politics' and then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we're campaigning against, happens.\".\nAsked if Ms Patel was wrong to call taking the knee \"gesture politics\", Treasury minister Stephen Barclay told BBC Breakfast: \"We need to respect people making their points in different ways.\"\nDefending the home secretary, Downing Street added: \"There is no place for racism in this country and she is backing the police to hold those responsible for this abuse accountable.\"\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said he had \"full respect\" for players who took the knee, adding that everyone should show respect to those who did so.\nHe said: \"I think it's a perfectly acceptable way to show that solidarity. I wish more people would show respect in that way.\" \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is due to hold a meeting with social media companies including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and Snapchat later to discuss online abuse.\nBut former Premier League footballer Anton Ferdinand, himself a victim of racist abuse during his career, told the government to \"sort your own house out\" before going after social media platforms.\nHe said there was no point in the government talking about what it was planning to do when, as \"the people that run this country\", they are \"not condemning\" those that boo players taking the knee.\nHe added: \"How can you not condemn that, but then come out and say it's about social media?\"\nRashford apologised for the missed penalty in a statement posted on Twitter on Monday, but added: \"I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from.\"\nA mural of Rashford in his hometown of Withington was defaced after his penalty miss - but it was later covered in messages of support and solidarity.\nRashford said he was \"on the verge of tears\" when he saw the supportive messages.\nThe mural has since been repaired.\nWithington Walls co-founder Ed Wellard, who commissioned the artwork, said the people responsible for defacing it should be educated not punished.\nEngland captain Harry Kane said Rashford, Saka and Sancho \"deserve support and backing, not the vile racist abuse they've had\".\n\"If you abuse anyone on social media you're not an England fan and we don't want you,\" he added.\nEarlier on Monday, England boss Gareth Southgate said the racist abuse issued after the defeat was \"unforgivable\". The Football Association also condemned it.\nThe Metropolitan Police is investigating the abuse and said \"it will not be tolerated\", while the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) has also launched an investigation.\nMings's intervention comes after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of having \"failed the test of leadership\" by not condemning fans who booed England players taking the knee.\nAhead of Euro 2020, after England's final warm-up game, Downing Street stopped short of condemning fans who had booed players who took part in the anti-racism protest.\nBut later that week, Mr Johnson said he wanted supporters to be \"cheering and not booing\" the England players. \nAfter Sunday's match, Mr Johnson praised the England football team, who he said had \"played like heroes\" and \"brought joy to this country\". \nAddressing those who sent abuse, the prime minister said: \"Shame on you - I hope you will crawl back under the rock from which you emerged.\"\nSir Keir said Mr Johnson's comments had come too late, adding: \"The actions and inactions of leaders have consequences, so I'm afraid the prime minister's words today ring hollow.\"\nThe home secretary was also criticised by Baroness Sayeeda Warsi - a former Conservative minister - who said: \"If we 'whistle' and the 'dog' reacts we can't be shocked if it barks and bites. It's time to stop the culture wars that are feeding division. Dog whistles win votes but destroy nations.\"\nHowever, another Conservative MP Fay Jones told the BBC she supported players trying to fight racism but added that taking the knee \"is a political symbol and I think that's the problem that certain people have had with it\".\nThe abuse received in the aftermath of the match has also raised questions about the role of social media companies.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Ms Patel said social media companies could \"no longer ignore some of the appalling, vile, racist, violent and hateful content that appears on their platforms\".\n\"We have been clear that if they do not stamp this out we will take action against them in the Online Safety Bill,\" she added.\nThe proposed legislation is yet to be published but it could give the media watchdog Ofcom powers to fine social media companies up to \u00a318m if they fail in their \"duty of care\".\nThe Football Association has also urged social media companies to ban abusers from their platforms, as well as gathering evidence to make prosecutions easier.\nIn a statement, Facebook said it had \"quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England's footballers\"."

      "text": "Large businesses have said they will maintain a cautious approach to bringing staff back to the office despite the lifting of final Covid restrictions in England on Monday.\nThe government announced yesterday that it will no longer instruct people to work at home from 19 July.\nBut firms spoken to by the BBC said they did not plan to bring all staff back to the office.\nMany businesses said they will opt for a staggered approach for employees. \nDeloitte said it will increase the number of staff allowed to work in its offices to 50% capacity from next week.\nBut the accountancy firm expects that level to stay in place until September.\nNatWest said that it will bring staff back to the office from 19 July but it will only be a small number of \"priority workers\".\nInsurance group Aviva said it expects \"to see more of our people returning\". But a spokesman said that \"the vast majority of people at Aviva want to work flexibly in future\" and employees will combine going into the office with working from home.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that final restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of Covid will be lifted in England from 19 July, including the guidance on office working.\nBut the government said that it \"would expect and recommend a gradual return\" of workers to offices \"over the summer\".\nDeloitte currently operates its offices at 30% capacity and employees have to book desks. A spokeswoman for the firm said it had always intended to take a \"gradual approach\" to moving staff back to its sites.\nIt estimates that it will take between six and eight weeks to prepare its offices to deal with 100% capacity which it expects to reach in September.\nNatWest said a \"very small number of people\" will be invited back to its offices in England from Monday for roles \"that can't really be done from home\". These include market traders as well as people who work in NatWest's treasury department and roles where employees need to meet clients.\nIt also said \"people who would rather work in the office for wellbeing reasons\" can return to its sites from Monday.\nAccountancy firm KPMG has allowed people to work from its offices if they made a request to their manager. \nFrom next week, they will no longer need permission to do so but the firm has also introduced a \"four-day fortnight\" hybrid model of working. It means that KPMG employees spend four days working in the office and the rest of the fortnight either at home or at client sites. \n\"It makes sense that the order to work from home if possible is removed at this stage,\" said Confederation of British Industry policy director, Michael Fell. \"The reality is that many firms are well-advanced in their plans and are proceeding with hybrid working models, just as the government advises. \nRoger Barker, policy director of the Institute of Directors (IoD) industry group, said: \"Businesses across the country will welcome the opportunity to begin to return to relative normality from next week.\"\nHowever, he criticised the government for failing to provide adequate guidance on areas such as wearing face masks which, from Monday, will cease to be mandatory but will be recommended.\nDr Barker said there has been \"real frustration about the mixed messages\" businesses have been receiving from the government. \n\"The latest guidance has shifted the responsibility from the government to businesses by removing mandatory rules on things like face masks and replacing them with voluntary recommendations,\" he said. \"Whilst it is right that companies should be allowed to take decisions based on their own unique circumstances, it is vital that government provides businesses with best practice in developing their own policies.\""
