      "text": "Boris Johnson is prepared \"to throw farmers and crofters under the Brexit bus\" in his bid to secure a trade deal with Australia, the SNP's leader in Westminster has said.\nIan Blackford urged the PM to rule out giving Australia tariff - or tax-free - access for its lamb and beef products.\nMr Johnson replied that an agreement with Australia would be a \"massive opportunity\" for UK farmers.\nThe Scottish government has written to the trade secretary about its concerns.\nRural affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon wrote: \"A trade deal that liberalises tariffs for Australian farmers, to put it bluntly, will put UK farmers out of business.\"\nThere are also reported tensions among ministers over the proposed trade pact.\nCurrently imports from Australia face tariffs, making their products more expensive to buy in the UK.\nAustralia is one of a number of countries the UK is negotiating with to remove or lower tariffs, following its departure from the EU.\nThe BBC has been told that Environment Secretary George Eustice has raised a number of concerns with the prime minister and senior cabinet ministers about the deal trading away farmers' interests. \nAnd the Financial Times reported that Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is also concerned, while International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost are more keen to grant tariff-free access to Australian goods.\nSpeaking to MPs on Wednesday, Ms Truss said she was confident British farmers would \"thrive\" under a deal with Australia, adding it would have \"benefits for all nations and regions\" of the UK.\nNegotiators from both sides are \"currently in a sprint with a view to getting to agreement in principle by early June,\" she added.\nOne compromise Mr Eustice has suggested is to negotiate quotas on Australian meat imports - so that only a limited amount could be tariff-free.\nLabour first minister of Wales Mark Drakeford will raise concerns about the impact of a deal on Welsh farmers in a meeting with Mr Gove later. \nSenior UK cabinet ministers are expected to meet on Thursday morning to discuss how the agreement could impact farming.\nThe subject was raised at Prime Minister's Questions, where Mr Blackford - himself a crofter - said a tariff-free deal with Australia \"would be the final nail in the coffin for many Scottish crofters and farmers\".\nHe added it would \"end a way of life that has endured for generations\" and that \"families would be driven off the land\". \nHe urged Mr Johnson to \"permanently\" rule out signing up to an agreement that would guarantee tariff-free access for Australian imports of lamb and beef. \nThe prime minister did not give the guarantee, instead accusing Mr Blackford of \"grossly underestimating\" UK farmers' ability to \"make the most of free trade\". \nAnd he said the SNP MP was \"frightened of free trade\". \nThe prime minister also face criticism from Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams who said Mr Johnson was backing Australian instead of UK farmers. \nMr Johnson said the MP had \"no ambition for Welsh farmers\" and that it was \"a disgrace that not a single morsel of Welsh lamb had passed the lips of Americans in the last 20 years\". \nMinette Batters, the president of the National Farmers' Union, said: \"We know that if we're to open up the opportunities of new markets overseas for UK farmers, we will have to offer greater access to our own markets in return.\n\"However, this trade-off needs to be balanced, and we need to make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly.\n\"There is a very real risk that, if we get it wrong, UK farming will suffer irreversible damage rather than flourish in the way we all desire, to the detriment of our environment, our food security and our rural communities.\"\nThe government says our ability to do trade deals around the world is one of the big benefits of Brexit.\nThey've been trumpeting all sorts of deals over the last year but those deals are basically roll-overs of what we had before as members of the EU. \nThe deal with Australia would be the first big deal to expand markets, so it is politically and symbolically important but at what price?\nAustralia wants tax-free access to our markets for their big industrial farms so they can export lamb and sheep more cheaply.\nBut famers here are saying we wouldn't be able to survive that competition unless we are protected by tariffs.\nThey say a free trade deal would only add a tiny bit to the size of the British economy so is it really worth threatening famers for that.\nThey also say there is also a precedent being set. \nAustralia may be a relatively small market - but if they get a complete tariff-free access then what will the Americans or Brazilians want to have?"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Three \"extremely rare\" deaths in Scotland have been linked to adverse effects from Covid-19 vaccines.\nNational Records of Scotland (NRS) said the effects had been recorded as the \"underlying cause\" in each of the three deaths, which were before 30 April.\nMore than 2.8 million people had received at least a first dose of the vaccine by that date.\nPublic health expert Prof Linda Bauld said the \"vast, vast majority\" of Covid vaccine side effects were very mild.\nThe professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh told BBC Scotland that serious adverse effects from any vaccine were extremely unusual.\n\"The vast, vast majority of side effects from the Covid vaccines are very mild. You do have severe cases, but only very rarely,\" she said.\n\"We have been aware of the rare blood clots that we think are linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine... but it's not always possible to say the vaccine caused it. There may be other contributory factors.\"\nThe Scottish government said it was \"important to be cautious\" when drawing conclusions from associations between vaccinations and deaths.\n\"All medicines, including vaccinations, can have side effects but serious adverse events and deaths are very rare with Covid vaccines,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"Over three million first doses of Covid vaccines have been administered in Scotland, and only a very small number of people are thought to have died. However, our thoughts and sympathies are always with those few affected, and their families.\"\nThe spokesperson added that vaccines remained the \"best way\" to protect people from Covid-19 and had already saved thousands of lives.\nThree Covid-19 vaccines - Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna - are currently being used in the UK. All have been authorised for supply by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nThe vaccines are known to cause a number of mild side effects like a sore arm or headache.\nIn April, the MHPRA confirmed that seven people had died from unusual blood clots after getting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, but it was not clear if this was a coincidence or side effect from the vaccine.\nIn total, 30 people out of 18 million vaccinated in the UK by 24 March had these clots and the regulator said the benefits of the vaccine continued to outweigh the risks.\nThe latest monthly figures from the NRS reported that 10,109 deaths have been registered where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate.\nSix deaths were registered between 10 May and 16 May, a decrease of one death from the previous week.\nThe figures also show that post Covid-19 conditions - including \"long Covid\" - were mentioned on 11 death certificates in the period from March 2020 to April 2021.\nPete Whitehouse, the NRS director of statistical services, said: \"Last week there were no registered Covid-19 deaths in 29 of Scotland's 32 council areas. Across Scotland, six Covid-19 deaths were registered which is the lowest number since early September last year.\n\"The report also shows that deaths from Covid-19 continues to have a greater impact on people living in Scotland's more deprived communities.\n\"Over the course of the pandemic, people living in these most deprived areas are 2.4 times as likely to die with Covid-19 than those living in the least deprived areas after adjusting for age.\"\nIn the week up to 16 May, one Covid death was of someone aged 75 or over, while the other five deaths were of people aged under 65.\nFour deaths occurred in hospitals, one death occurred in a care home, and one was in a home or other non-institutional setting."

      "text": "EU ambassadors have backed proposals to reopen borders for non-essential travel from countries with low infection rates, with a list to be agreed this week.\nDiplomats in Brussels said visitors should be allowed to come from countries with an incidence rate of below 75 cases per 100,000 people.\nA \"safe list\" is still to be decided.\nUnder those terms UK travellers would be eligible, but there are concerns about the Indian Covid-19 variant.\nAccording to BBC Europe correspondent Jean Mackenzie, there is some hesitation to add the UK to the safe list as some EU countries want to see how the surge of cases related to the Indian variant plays out.\nEU envoys have also recommended that non-essential travel should be allowed from outside the EU for people who have been fully vaccinated. However, they say it should be up to member states to decide on measures they impose, such as Covid tests or quarantine. \nTheir recommendations are expected to be adopted soon by the EU Council of member states.\nWelcoming the move, European Commission spokesman Christian Wigand told reporters: \"This will help improve international inbound travel and it's possible to do so safely while at the same time ensuring quick action to counter the spread of new virus variants.\"\nIf the UK is added to the EU's \"safe list\", anyone will be allowed to visit if they have the necessary documentation, not just people who have been fully vaccinated. The ambassadors have also recommended that an emergency brake be agreed for Covid variants of concern.\nHowever, the terms of the planned EU-wide digital green certificate are yet to be signed off. The certificate would include either a negative test, proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid.\nThe EU currently only recommends non-essential travel from a small number of third countries, including Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand and Israel.\nPortugal, Italy and Greece have already dropped quarantine restrictions for British travellers and Spain is expected to make an announcement in the coming days.\nPortugal is the only country currently on the UK's own green list, allowing travellers to return without going into quarantine.

      "tags": "Royal College reports,Freedom of Information,NHS",
      "text": "Serious patient safety issues are being buried in confidential hospital reports, BBC Panorama has found.\nFreedom of Information requests revealed 111 reports, written by medical royal colleges, which NHS trusts have a duty to share.\nEighty reports were given to the BBC but only 26 had been shared in full with regulators, and 16 published.\nThe Department of Health would not comment on whether it might change the law to ensure publication. \nSince the 2015 Morecambe Bay maternity scandal in which 11 babies and a mother died, NHS Trusts are supposed to publish summaries of external reviews, and share them with the regulator. \nAn earlier review into the hospital had previously identified concerns but had not been made public. \nDr Bill Kirkup, who led a 2015 investigation into the Morecambe Bay scandal, said Panorama's findings were a \"great disappointment\". \n\"People should know that there is something that is important enough to be looked at and they should know what the results of that scrutiny are. \n\"I can't understand what the rationale would be for withholding the existence of a report or the findings of the report. These are important matters of accountability in the public service.\"  \nJames Titcombe, who became a patient safety campaigner after his baby son Joshua died due to failures of care at Morecambe Bay, said by not publishing reports \"there are possibly risks out there that the regulator is unaware of, and ultimately those risks can have tragic consequences\".\nFreedom of Information (FoI) requests were sent to all NHS Trusts in the UK requesting any Royal College reviews of services in the last five years.\nThe colleges set standards of care and can be commissioned to review how a health care provider is performing.\nOf the 80 reports released to the BBC, just 16 are in the public domain, and only 26 were shared in full with the regulators. \nIn another 22 cases the regulator was only aware of the review or had only seen part of it. Sixty-five of the 80 contained potential or actual patient safety concerns.\nThough the BBC had been told about 111 reports, the Royal Colleges told Panorama they had carried out about 260 reviews in the same period.  \nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said she was \"dismayed\" summaries of reports were not being made public, and it had published guidance in 2016 saying reports dealing with safety or care concerns should be made public. \n\"If things are not being shared, and if that has implications for patient safety, that must be put right. The fact that a review is done should never be secret and indeed a summary of the findings should always be published\".\nThe vasculitis department at the Royal Liverpool Hospital treats people with a disease affecting the blood vessels. \nIn 2015, after concerns were raised by other clinicians, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) was called in.\nThe college recommended there should be an audit of patients treated during the previous two years \"without delay\" to ensure they were on the correct treatment. \nFoI requests reveal there were 400 patients under the care of the unit at that point.\nBut 18 months after the review, less than a quarter had been checked.\nOut of a group of 26 who were on powerful medications, two were found to have been given them \"inappropriately\", four were given \"possibly excessive\" doses and three had died while suffering side effects from the drugs. \nBBC Panorama has seen emails from the RCP threatening to tell the regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), if the audit wasn't completed, but it did not follow through.  \nIn addition, the CQC was never told by the hospital or the college about the concerns or given the full report. Instead it was only told a review had happened.\nThe CQC said if it had known an audit was required, it would have monitored the outcomes.\nAnd the RCP said it was \"satisfied that the trust made reasonable attempts to complete the audits\" but was \"very disappointed with the speed of response and progress\", adding that the trust \"had a clear obligation to share serious ongoing concerns with patients and the regulator\".\nThe Royal Liverpool Hospital said it was \"committed to providing safe and excellent care\" and that the recommendations identified within the RCP's 2015 report have since been \"successfully implemented, or are part of longer-term actions currently in progress\".\nThe CQC does not currently have the legal power to compel trusts to share the reports or make the trust implement recommendations.\nProf Ted Baker, the CQC's chief inspector of hospitals, said: \"Both hospital trusts and the professional bodies undertaking invited reviews have a responsibility to ensure that any serious patient safety issues raised in an invited review are shared with CQC.\n\"It is extremely disappointing that despite this very clear expectation, we continue to see examples of a lack of transparency.\"\nDr Kirkup said a legal duty may have to be placed on trusts compelling them to disclose royal college reviews.\nNHS England and NHS Improvement said there are \"robust and transparent systems to ensure hospitals and other care providers learn and improve services\". \nIt said \"all independent reviews should be made available\" to health commissioners and regulators and it \"expects trusts to take prompt action to address recommendations made\". \nOut of 111 reports the BBC was made aware of, 100 came from NHS trusts in England.\nThe NHS in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all emphasised the usefulness of the Royal College review system and stressed the importance of openness and transparency in healthcare.\nBBC News asked the Department of Health whether they would consider a change in the law to enforce publication and sharing with regulators but they declined to comment.\nYou can watch Panorama: Hospital Secrets Uncovered on BBC One at 19:30 BST or afterwards on BBC iPlayer."

      "title": "UK inflation rate more than doubles in April",
      "tags": "Economics,Inflation,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The annual UK inflation rate more than doubled in April, as a rise in energy and clothing costs drove prices higher.\nThe jump to 1.5% in April from 0.7% in March, means consumer prices are rising at their fastest rate since March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic.\nThe sharp increase largely reflected a jump in prices from low levels a year ago at the start of the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics said.\nHigher oil prices also pushed up petrol prices, it added.\nAccording to the ONS, inflation climbed as lockdown restrictions were eased and shops reopened on 12 April. The rise in clothing and footwear prices reversed an unusual fall in February.\nMeanwhile, gas and electricity prices rose sharply after the default tariff cap was increased compared with a cut a year earlier.\nHannah Audino, economist at PwC, said she expected inflation to continue to rise as lockdown restrictions eased and the economy continued to reopen \"allowing consumers to unleash some of their excess savings\". \n\"Recent survey evidence suggests that the share of households who plan to spend some of their savings has increased in recent months, as the vaccine rollout boosts confidence,\" she added.\nApril's inflation rise had been predicted by economists, but there are concerns that soaring inflation this year as the global economy recovers from the pandemic could push central banks to raise interest rates.\nInflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. \nIt's one of the key measures of financial well-being because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. \nIt's expressed as a percentage increase or decrease in prices over time. For example, if the inflation rate for the cost of a litre of petrol is 2% a year, motorists need to spend 2% more at the pump than 12 months earlier.\nAnd if wages don't keep up with inflation, purchasing power and the standard of living falls.\nA little inflation, however, typically encourages people to buy products sooner and makes it easier for companies to put up wages. And both of those things boost economic growth. \nThat's why most countries' central banks have an inflation target of between 2% and 2.5%. \nIn the UK, the government has set the Bank of England an inflation target of 2%.\nRead more here.\nEarlier in May, fears about rising inflation in the US hit financial markets after consumer prices recorded their biggest annual jump since 2008. \nHigh government spending on Covid support programmes, coupled with a build-up in consumer savings, have driven prices higher, says experts. \nLiz Martins, senior economist at HSBC, said that it looked like UK inflation would go above the Bank of England's 2% target, although this was \"not too much of a worry for the Bank\".\n\"Their view is that they need to keep inflation sustainably around 2% two to three years out from now, so the short term overshoot won't worry them too much, if it does prove temporary - and that's where opinions really seem to diverge,\" she told the BBC.\nMany central bank governors, particularly in the US, are saying that the rise is due to bottlenecks in the aftermath of the pandemic which will go away, Ms Martins said.\nBut some people, including Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, say higher prices could stunt the recovery and that the Bank may need to raise interest rates to cool things down.\nLaith Khalaf, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said that the rise in prices was \"in key areas where it's hard for consumers to control spending, namely transport, clothing, and household energy\".\n\"At current levels, inflation is nothing to fret about, but there is rising concern that the fiscal and monetary response to the pandemic has sown the seeds of an inflationary scare further down the road,\" he said.\nHe said the Bank of England has made it clear it will tolerate inflation above its 2% target without \"pulling the trigger\" on interest rate rises.\n\"However, if inflation looks like it's going to get a significant foothold, markets will take matters into their own hands and raise borrowing costs across the economy,\" he said.\nTwo weeks ago the Bank of England said that UK inflation is heading above its 2% target and is expected to hit 2.5% at the end of 2021.\nThat is due to a rise in global oil prices and the expiry in September of Covid emergency cuts to value added tax (VAT) in the hospitality sector, as well as comparisons with the pandemic slump of 2020.\nThe Bank thinks inflation will then slip back to 2% in 2022 and 2023.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday that so far there was no strong evidence that higher prices paid by manufacturers were feeding through to consumer prices.\nHowever, he said the Bank \"will be watching this extremely carefully\" and would take action if necessary.\nLockdowns are deflationary; because they forcibly stop us shopping, travelling and mixing they reduce demand for everything from consumer goods and energy.\nSo a return to more normal levels of inflation was always likely as the global economy slowly started to re-open.\nClothes prices, for example, contributed to the rising cost of living not because they were rising by much but because they were no longer falling. \nWhat's spooked markets recently is the risk of inflation coming down the pipeline.\nIn a literal sense it already is: the price of oil has been rising in anticipation of a global recovery, pushing up petrol and household bills.\nLast week, markets took a knock fearing that the rising cost of raw materials would force the Bank of England to raise interest rates from their rock bottom official level of 0.1% sooner than anticipated to stop inflation getting out of control.\nThe Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has twice spoken publicly to play down that anxiety, saying on Tuesday that he had not yet seen strong evidence of those rising costs being passed through to consumers.\nBut Wednesday's figures for what manufacturers are paying for raw materials show a rise in input prices - what manufacturers pay for raw materials - of 9.9%.\nThat's the fastest rise in four years and faster than most economists expected."

      "tags": "Tourism,Travel,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Surge testing and jabs will be expanded to six new areas of concern in England to combat the spread of the Indian Covid variant, Matt Hancock has said.\nThe areas were identified using new techniques, including analysing wastewater and travel patterns, he told a Downing Street briefing.\nThe government is also supporting Scotland in rolling out more tests and vaccinations in Glasgow and Moray.\nSome 2,967 cases of the Indian variant have now been identified in the UK.\nThis is up from about 2,300 on Monday.\nMr Hancock said early evidence suggested that this variant - B.1.617.2 - passes on more easily from person to person than the one first discovered in Kent, adding that it was now \"even more important that people get vaccinated\".\nBut he said ministers were \"determined to do all that we can to ensure this new variant doesn't put our recovery at risk\".\nFurther surge testing and vaccinations will now be introduced in:\nThe health secretary said these were selected via \"an incredibly sensitive biosecurity surveillance system\", which spotted cases in earlier variant hotspots Bolton and Blackburn.\nMonitoring travel patterns, along with analysis of wastewater - or sewage - in 70% of the country had helped identify where variants were and also where they were at risk of spreading to, he said.\nOutlining the spread of the Indian variant, he added: \"The weekly case data in Bolton is now 283 per 100,000 and it doubled in the last week.\n\"There are now 25 people in Bolton Hospital with Covid - the majority are unvaccinated, nearly 90% have not yet had two vaccines.\n\"This shows the importance of getting vaccinated, not once but twice.\"\nScientists will know more about the transmissibility of the new Indian variant by \"some time next week\", England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said.\nOverall, a further three deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been recorded in the UK, and there have been 2,696 more cases overall. \nAnother 174,100 people have been given a first dose of a vaccine, and 324,001 more have received their second dose.\nThe spread of the Indian variant has cast doubt on plans to ease remaining restrictions in England next month.\nThe number of cases of Indian variant is climbing, but what this means remains to be seen.\nThe variant should soon be dominant - it is clearly more infectious than the UK variant which emerged last year.\nScientists are busy studying it to work out just how much more transmissible it is.\nThat means unpicking to what extent the rise is being driven by the sudden importation of the variant from abroad and the environmental factors in the communities where it is spreading. \nIn densely-populated housing conditions it's easier for the virus to be passed on - rather than because of an inherent biological advantage.\nScientists believe it could be anything between 10% to 50% more infectious depending on what influence each of those factors have.\nIf it's nearer 50%, that could drive a surge in cases that could spill over into significant hospital admissions even with the vaccine rollout.\nAt the lower end, the impact will be more muted and the full lifting of restrictions on 21 June could still be on.\nThere are some early signs it could be at the lower end, but it will be a week or two before we know that with any confidence.\nAt the briefing, Mr Hancock praised the UK's development of the AstraZeneca vaccine made by Oxford University, highlighting the worldwide benefits it had brought. He said:\n\"It is something every British taxpayer has had a part supporting and everyone in this United Kingdom should be incredibly proud of it,\" Mr Hancock said.\nMeanwhile, Prof Van-Tam told the news conference that scientists were sure the Indian variant was more transmissible but the \"million dollar question\" was how much more transmissible.\n\"We have a credible range that goes from a few per cent more transmissible through to 50% more transmissible - I think most people feel it is going to be somewhere in the middle... but it is just too early,\" he said.\nHowever, he said transmission of the new variant was \"not inevitable\" and it could be slowed down through \"cautious behaviour\".\n\"I think I've said 'don't tear the pants out of it' once before from this or a similar podium, but frankly we're back to that again now,\" he said.\nHe urged those living in hotspots to think carefully about their new freedoms and try to stick to outdoor activities in small groups.\nEarlier, at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said there was \"increasing confidence\" that Covid-19 vaccines were effective against all variants, including the Indian one.\nBut his official spokesman said ministers would want to see more information before making decisions on the next steps toward lifting lockdown.\nAt PMQs, Mr Johnson also repeated his warning that people should not be holidaying in amber list countries. This includes France, Spain and Greece.\nVisits to those countries should only be made in \"extreme\" circumstances such as a family illness, he said.\nEU ambassadors are recommending that restrictions on travel into the EU should be relaxed for fully vaccinated people, and those from countries with low infection rates. \nA decision on whether the UK will be included on a so-called \"white list\" will be made on Friday.\nPortugal, Italy and Greece have already dropped quarantine restrictions for British travellers and Spain is expected to make an announcement in the coming days.\nPortugal is the only EU country currently on the UK's own green list, allowing travellers to return without going into quarantine."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe government did not plan enough for a \"threat\" on the scale of coronavirus, its spending watchdog has found. The National Audit Office said when the pandemic hit the UK last year, the government lacked plans for many areas of its response in England, however, it had enjoyed some success in their efforts to deal with the crisis. The government says it \"acted quickly and decisively\" as new evidence emerged.\nLee and Louise Chambers know they'll be taking their two children on holiday this summer. What they don't know is where they'll go - it might be Norfolk or it might be their preference - Fuerteventura. They booked both in case Covid restrictions prevented them from going to the Canary Islands. They're not the only ones double-booking holidays to make sure they don't miss out but UK resorts fear they could be facing a rush of cancellations.\nPeople should not be holidaying in the amber list countries, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, after confusion arose about where holidaymakers could and couldn't go. His warning came after Environment Secretary George Eustice said people could go to those countries if they quarantined when they returned. If people do have to go to countries on the amber list for \"some pressing family or urgent business reason\", they will have to self-isolate, take tests and do passenger locator forms, Mr Johnson said.\nArt fairs and other \"bloated, money-drenched\" parts of the art world might not return after the pandemic, according to Grayson Perry. The Turner Prize winner caused a stir in November when he said Covid could clear some \"dead wood\" from the arts. \"I thought things like art fairs might go down the pan. That was what I meant at the time,\" he said.\nMan alive it's number five, cup of tea it's number three - yes, that's right, bingo halls have reopened in the latest easing of restrictions.

      "title": "Covid-19: Nothing conclusive on changing roadmap, Boris Johnson says",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is \"nothing conclusive\" in the data that means England \"would have to deviate from the roadmap\" out of lockdown, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe government plans to end remaining legal limits on social contact from 21 June, but there is increasing concern about the Indian variant.\nThe situation, including data from hotspots such as Bolton, was \"under close review\", the prime minister said.\nMinisters will \"let people know in a few days' time\" after data is studied.\nSpeaking on a visit to a vaccination centre in London, Mr Johnson continued to urge people to be cautious.\nHe said the situation with the Indian variant was \"under very careful, close review\", saying: \"We're looking at all the data as it comes in from places like Bolton, Blackburn, Bedford, Sefton.\"\nMr Johnson said they were trying to understand if the Indian variant was more transmissible and \"to what extent our vaccine programme has sufficiently fortified us\".\n\"We've got a few more days of looking at that data,\" he said.\nIt comes as the UK recorded another seven deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 2,412 new cases. \nOn Monday the government said 86 local councils in England had five or more cases of the variant first discovered in India, which is thought to be more transmissible. \nIn Bolton, a new vaccine centre has opened up and ministers have been stepping up calls for people to book vaccinations as soon as they are offered appointments.\nElsewhere, regional public health directors are concerned about rising cases of the variant in London. Cases have spread across a number of boroughs, although currently most are linked to foreign travel. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said that while the government was not ruling out measures such as local lockdowns at this stage, it was \"too early to speculate\" on what future measures it may need to take.\nAsked if a decision was expected sooner than 14 June on progressing to the final step of England's roadmap, the spokesman said that in relation to certification and social distancing, ministers \"do want to update pubs and businesses, if possible, before 14 June\".\nBut he added they needed to \"allow the experts to do their work\" and \"couldn't be more specific on timings\".\nDay by day the scientists are learning more about the Indian variant - and the implications for the UK.\nOn Friday it was reported the variant could be 50% more transmissible than the UK variant, which was responsible for the deadly winter wave.\nBut confidence in that figure was always a little shaky. In the past few days there are some tentative signs its advantage over the UK variant may not be so great.\nThat's important. There's estimated to be an eight-fold difference between the impact in terms of hospital admissions a variant with a 20% advantage will have compared to one with a 50% advantage.\nThat clearly has a major implication for what restrictions are needed while the vaccination programme continues to be rolled out.\nThe next significant update is expected on Thursday. It will be too soon for a definitive answer, but it should help us understand more about what the variant means for the UK.\nRead more from Nick\nThe government has already warned its next review of social distancing rules - set to take place by the end of May - may be delayed because of concern over the variant.\nOn Monday millions of people were able to enjoy new freedoms - such as drinking indoors in pubs, hugs with loved ones and foreign holidays - for the first time in months, under the latest relaxation of rules across England, Wales and most of Scotland.\nHowever, Labour has accused the government of \"giving out conflicting and confused advice\" about travel to countries on the amber travel list, where people must quarantine for up to 10 days on their return to the UK. \nGovernment guidance states people should not travel to amber list countries. \nBut earlier Environment Secretary George Eustice suggested in a BBC interview that people could travel to such destinations if they \"feel the need\" to visit family or friends. \nAsked about the issue, Mr Johnson said it was \"very important people grasp what the amber list is - not somewhere to go on holiday\".\nHe said travellers should only go to these countries for \"pressing family or business reasons\". Those who break their self-isolation period on returning to the UK from these destinations face \u00a310,000 fines, he added. \nYvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the current traffic light system was \"very messy\" and \"clearly isn't working\", adding that it should be linked to legal restrictions. \n\"We all seem to be in a position where the government has opened up to summer holiday travel by accident, by making it possible, but at the same time, a day later, saying 'no, people should not be travelling to amber countries,'\" the Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.\nMeanwhile, Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine, has said it feels \"morally wrong\" that children in some richer countries are being offered a Covid-19 jab before some high-risk people in poorer countries.\nHe told the All Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus: \"There are many unvaccinated people in the world whilst people whose risk is extremely low are being vaccinated, including children who have near to zero the risk of severe disease or death.\n\"That inequity is absolutely plain to see at this moment in a very troubling way.\""

      "tags": "Environment",
      "text": "Older farmers in England will be paid to retire under a UK government scheme to bring new blood into the trade.\nThe average farmer could receive a lump sum payment of \u00a350,000 - capped at \u00a3100,000 for farmers with most land.\nIt is part of a massive overhaul of farm grants, incentivising farmers to protect the environment.\nSome older farmers are resistant to new \"green\" methods, Environment Secretary George Eustice believes, and he wants them to move on.\nNext steps in England's rural revolution unveiled\n\u2018Radical\u2019 changes to farming in post-Brexit plan\nUK farmers to need 'thousands of foreign workers'\nCurrently, under the old EU system, farmers receive grants based largely on the amount of land they farm.\nThe average farmer currently receives about \u00a321,000 in grants - although those who own large amounts of land, such as the Queen, have been receiving more than half a million pounds each year.\nFarmers in Wales are expected to be able to benefit from a similar scheme to the England plans announced by Mr Eustice. Plans in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be different.\nMr Eustice says the EU's grants system encourages some farmers \"to coast, to take no risks\" and hold on to their land in order to collect the subsidy.\nHence the need for help for older farmers to move on.\nAt the Oxford Farming Conference earlier this year, Mr Eustice said some veteran farmers were \"standing in the way of change\" and coasting along on state subsidies. \nHe said: \"I understand the burden of expectation that can exist to loyally continue the family tradition (of farming) and how this sometimes stands in the way of change.\"\nBut, he said: \"A fresh perspective can make a world of difference. New entrants are the lifeblood of any vibrant industry and farming is no exception.\"\nA spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), told BBC News: \"There's evidence that farmers who wish to leave farming can find it difficult to generate capital to do so.  \n\"So, a lump sum payment could help contribute to the costs of moving somewhere new or moving into an alternative sector.\"\nNearly four in 10 UK farmers are over the age of 65, with an average age of 59.\nThe Tenant Farmers' Association sought the views of 360 farmers and reported that three-quarters of them were seriously interested in the proposed retirement scheme, which is launched in a consultation today.\nThe organisation's chief executive, George Dunn, told BBC News he supported the plan for a lump sum for farmers based on the grants they would have received if they'd stayed in business.\nBut he warned: \"The government have got to make it easy enough for people to take up the scheme - not drown them in bureaucracy.\n\"The payments on their own won't be enough - but when you tie in other factors such as selling livestock, some farmers will want to take it up.\n\"For people on larger holdings, it won't be very attractive - but a lot of owner-occupiers might find it attractive.\"\nAt the launch of today's consultation, Mr Eustice explained: \"We need to address the twin challenges of helping new entrants fulfil their dream and gain access to land, while also helping an older generation retire with dignity.  \n\"Our exit scheme will offer farmers real incentive to confront what can often be a difficult decision and will help them clear bills and settle debts.\"\nA spokesperson for the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said: \"As our agricultural support is overhauled, farm businesses across the country will be making life-changing decisions about the future of their farm.\"\nThey added: \"We want to see a fair transition which allows farmers who are considering leaving the industry to have sufficient time and information to make those life-changing decisions.\"\nAbout \u00a33bn of state subsidy is paid to UK farmers each year, but this will be phased out. An estimated 61% of farm income comes from subsidy.\nUnder the new post-Brexit scheme, grants will be used to incentivise so-called \"public goods\", such as protecting water supplies; holding floodwater on land; capturing carbon in soil and trees, and increasing wildlife.\nThe government believes that younger farmers will be more open to new nature-friendly ideas and more inclined to seek income by diversifying into businesses such as camping or glamping.\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "text": "The majority of new coronavirus cases in the UK are the so-called Indian variant - named the Delta variant by the World Health Organization.\nThis version - or mutation - was first spotted in India last October.\nViruses mutate all the time. Most variants are insignificant, but some can make a virus more contagious. \nUK scientists say the Delta variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is spreading more quickly than the Kent or Alpha variant, which was behind a surge in cases over the winter.\nThere have been almost 18,000 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant in England, just under 3,000 in Scotland, 189 in Wales and 37 in Northern Ireland. \nThe latest Public Health England figures up to 2 June showed the worst-hit areas were:\nHowever, just because it's the most common strain doesn't always mean there's lots of it about. \nIn West Lancashire and East Hertfordshire, for example, in the two weeks to 29 May the variant accounted for 100% of the cases analysed for variants. But this amounted to only nine individual infections each.\nNot all cases are analysed and a higher proportion are in areas with lots of the Delta variant, potentially skewing the figures. \nBut random swabbing carried out by the Office for National Statistics, which is not skewed in this way, also found a growing proportion of cases looked like they were the Delta variant. \nIt does appear to spread more easily than the Kent variant (B.1.1.7). \nTransmission rates for the Indian strain have been put at anywhere between 30 and 100% higher than for the Kent or Alpha variant. \nRoughly 12% of contacts of people with the Indian variant went on to develop coronavirus, compared with 8% of those who had the so-called Kent variant, according to Public Health England analysis - suggesting it is roughly 50% more transmissible. \nBut some of that could be the behaviour of humans, rather than the virus itself. \nWhen a variant spreads faster than others, it could be driven by the strain being more infectious, by differences in how close people get, or by different vaccination rates. \nFor instance, it's been pointed out some of the worst-affected areas have very low proportions of residents working from home.\nDespite fears over the Indian variant, most of the UK went ahead with easing restrictions on 17 May.\nHowever, the government has issued new guidance for people in eight areas of England with high numbers of cases\nPeople have been advised to minimise travelling in and out of Kirklees, Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside.\nIn addition, residents have been advised - wherever possible - to meet people outside, maintain social distancing of 2m (6ft) from people not in their household and work from home if they can. \nIt is not clear whether the next stage of easing in England will happen on 21 June, as was set out in the government's roadmap. \nThe prime minister and health secretary have indicated they will wait for another week's data before making a decision.\nMany countries already have bans on people from the UK and elsewhere entering. \nFrance has brought a ban on non-essential travel from the UK back into force in direct response to the spread of the India variant.

      "text": "Police searching for a suspected victim of serial killer Fred West have begun excavation work at a cafe.\nTeenager Mary Bastholm, who worked at the Pop-In Cafe in Gloucester, went missing in 1968. \nEarlier this month, a TV production company filming at the site - now called The Clean Plate - reported finding blue material buried.\nGloucestershire Police said experts are focusing on six areas underneath a toilet floor. \nOfficers arrived at about 08:00 BST to start the excavation work, which a senior officer said would be carried out \"carefully and painstakingly\" and could take at least two weeks to complete.\nThe discovery of blue material, spotted after the production company inserted a camera in a hole they had drilled, prompted police to carry out their own surveys of the cellar.\nThe 15-year-old was wearing a blue jacket, blue and white dress and was carrying a blue bag when she went missing in January 1968.\nDet Ch Insp John Turner said Gloucestershire Police had carried out their own analysis and discovered six \"voids or anomalies\" which were at a maximum of half a metre under the toilet floor.\nArchaeologists and anthropologists are involved in the search and would work on each anomaly in turn, he added. \nThe last sighting of Miss Bastholm was as she waited to catch a bus on Bristol Road.\nNo trace of her has ever been found, but West's son Stephen told police his father admitted to killing her.\nWest, who took his own life in 1995 before he could stand trial for the murders of 12 women and girls, was a regular at the cafeteria.\nDet Ch Insp Turner said it had become part of Gloucester folklore that Miss Bastholm was buried in the cafe, but that his job was to \"search for the truth\".\nHe said: \"That's why we're here now, on behalf of Mary's family, to look in the basement and find out what is in there.\"\nAfter standing undisturbed for several days there has now been signs that work here inside the white tent in front of the cafe is under way.  \nTwo vans arrived this morning and police officers in face masks carried bags inside. \nIt's been 10 days since the tent first appeared here but now police say this search could take several weeks more, as forensic archaeologists explore voids detected below the cellar floor and a piece of blue material photographed inside - the same colour as the coat Mary was wearing when she disappeared. \nThe name of Fred West is now back on everyone's mind in Gloucester.\nMembers of the public are stopping to look at the tent as they pass by - many of whom say they remember the initial investigation into the West's crimes when his murders were first uncovered in the 1990s.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

I will admit that I wasn't comfortable seeing money go out the door to people like this.\n\"But it was the right thing to do for the country,\" he added.\nThe US government has recommended in the past that companies do not pay criminals over ransomware attacks, in case they invite further hacks in the future.\nColonial Pipeline took itself offline on Friday 7 May after the cyber-attack.  \nIn return for the Bitcoin payment, the company received a decryption tool so it could unlock the systems compromised by the hackers - although that was not enough to restart systems immediately, according to the newspaper.\nOperations resumed on the pipeline last week, although petrol shortages seen across states such as North Carolina and Georgia have persisted, according to data tracking firm Gas Buddy.\nMr Blount added that it would take months before some other business systems are recovered, and estimated that the attack would ultimately cost the company tens of millions of dollars. \nHe also regrets that the company has lost some degree of anonymity, having led the firm since 2017.\n\"We were perfectly happy having no one know who Colonial Pipeline was, and unfortunately that's not the case any more,\" he said. \"Everybody in the world knows.\"\nAt the time of the hack, the DarkSide criminal gang acknowledged the incident in a public statement.\n\"Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society,\" DarkSide wrote on its website.\n\"We do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for... our motives,\" the group added."

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

Mr French said his team had arrived at the site at about 10:00 GMT, four hours after the crash, and worked there for three days and three nights.\nHe added that the braking applied by the driver was \"insufficient\" to slow to a safe speed and said that if the curve of the track had been \"more gentle\" the tram would not have overturned.\nMr French said: \"Witnesses spoke of it like being inside a washing machine, being thrown, it was a very sudden event. \n\"Speaking\u00a0for myself I do find\u00a0that quite shocking. It is fast and quite violent, it takes place in a matter of seconds.\"\nThe normal speed for the curve out of the tunnel at Sandilands in south London, where the tram derailed, was 50km/h (31mph) - with a speed limit of 20km/h (12.5mph) at the bend, the inquest jury was told.\nThe passengers who were killed had all been thrown or partially thrown from the tram after the glass in the windows and doors had shattered.\nIn addition to the six men and one woman who died, 51 passengers were taken to hospital, eight with life-changing injuries.\nCroydon tram crash: Who were the victims?\nMr French also told the inquest jury there were apparent \"culture issues\" at Tram Operations Ltd (TOL) that meant drivers were unwilling to admit to speeding or other errors.\n\"If you reported speeding there was an automatic move to a disciplinary procedure,\" he added.\nThere was a previous incident 10 days before the crash when a driver hit the same bend at 45km/h (27mph) and very nearly overturned the tram, but the matter was insufficiently investigated, the jury heard.\nThe hearing is expected to last 13 weeks."

But I move forward with the commitment that I wasn't going forward as first minister... if in the future members think it would work better with me as first minister, then we will have that discussion. But for this time, I don't have any interest or intent to do that.\"\nMr Poots also signalled he has no intention of collapsing Stormont over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which places a border in the Irish Sea. \nHe said Stormont is an asset in making the arguments against the protocol. \n\"It gives us authority to make arguments. It takes us right to the centre of government in the United Kingdom and I have made these arguments.\"\nHe said the arguments would be put forward forcibly and that legally, every course that can be taken to tackle the protocol will be taken. \n\"We will take every reasonable exercise that we can to ensure that we can inflict damage to the protocol,\" he said. \nMr Poots has said he is keen to ensure a smooth transition when Mrs Foster steps down. \nHe has been holding individual meetings with DUP assembly members, seeking their views before beginning any shake-up.\nHis plans are thought to include changing the ministerial team, as well as the DUP chairs and vice-chairs of Stormont's committees.\nHe also met Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis on Tuesday."

      "tags": "Medical devices,Breast implants",
      "text": "Thousands of women who were victims of the PIP breast implant scandal should receive compensation, a French appeal court has decided.\nWomen involved in the case say they are elated and exhausted after 10 years of fighting for justice.\nThe court also upheld an earlier judgement finding German safety body TUV Rheinland negligent.\nTUV said it had acted \"diligently\", and that women must prove they had a PIP implant to be entitled to compensation.\nIt awarded safety certificates for faulty breast implants made by French company Poly Implant Proth\u00e8se (PIP).\nThe court decision could have far-reaching implications for thousands of other victims around the world.\nJan Spivey, one of 540 British women involved in the case, was given PIP implants after she had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. \nAfter hearing the decision, she said she was \"elated and exhausted\".\n\"It's been a very long journey,\" she said.\n\"We've been in and out of court, and that's been really difficult for women. We've got health issues and we've got lots of other responsibilities too - PIP has had an impact on the whole of our lives.\n\"It's been an inescapable issue.\"\nJan developed aching joints, pain and fatigue after having the implants, and once they were removed it was clear they had been leaking silicone into her body.\n\"My PIP implants from 20 years ago are still impacting on my life and my health and my wellbeing, even today,\" Jan said.\n\"I think I've been angry every single day for the 20 years I've been affected by PIP.\"\nOlivier Auma\u00eetre, the lawyer representing Jan Spivey and around 2,700 others in the current case, said it was an historic day for the victims and for women's rights. He said the company would now have to fully compensate all the women judged to be victims.  \n\"I'm very happy for all the women I represent who have waited for such a long time for this decision and suffered for such long periods,\" he said. \nBut many hundreds of women in the UK are still waiting for legal decisions on their cases and their right to compensation.\nOliver Thorn, lawyer with Slee Blackwell Solicitors, represents 500 women. He said many still had their breast implants in place because they did not have the money to get them replaced, and that was why they needed compensation. \n\"The cosmetic surgery industry as a whole needs to sit up and see what has gone on here and it's time things were changed,\" he said.\nThe president of The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Mary O'Brien said the UK medicines' regulator, the MHRA, had an important role in ensuring a similar scandal over implants never happened again.\n\"The human cost and distress to many women and their families following surgery involving PIP implants is sobering,\" she said.\nPlastic surgeons supported the setting up of a breast implant registry to improve patient safety. \nThey advise patients to consult their surgeon if concerned about symptoms related to their implants and read all reliable sources of information before undergoing breast implant surgery for any reason.\nAnother woman affected by the case, Nicola Mason - who had breast implants which then ruptured - said the court decision was \"a victory, it's amazing\".\n\"We've waited a long time for this,\" she told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.\nNicola first found out about the rupture when she was pregnant, after noticing a large lump under her arm. \nShe said it was \"quite traumatic and there was absolutely nothing I could do\".\nEventually, the implants were removed but she says she has been left with a massive lump of silicone under her arm which still flares up.\n\"I don't think anyone knows the long-term effects,\" she says. \nBetween 2001 and 2010 the substandard implants were manufactured by the French company Poly Implant Proth\u00e8se or PIP.\nIt was liquidated in 2010 and its founder was later given a prison sentence after it emerged the implants were filled with cheap, industrial-grade silicone which was not cleared for human use. \nIt is estimated up to 400,000 women worldwide have received the illegal implants. \nLatin America was worst hit, in particular Colombia, where there are estimated to be 60,000 victims. In the UK it is thought 47,000 women are affected.\nThe case, known as TUV1, was the first to be brought, a decade ago, against TUV Rheinland which issued European safety certificates for the PIP implants.\nLawyers for the German company said they disagreed with the French court's decision for holding the company liable, \"even partly\".\n\"The evidence in this case clearly shows that T\u00dcV Rheinland acted diligently, in compliance with applicable regulations,\" they said.\nAt no time, the company said, had it been aware that breast implants manufactured by PIP were not compliant.\nThe ruling is expected to have wider implications for almost 20,000 other women, half of whom are British, who are taking similar legal action in France.\nAlifie Jones is recovering at home after having her faulty PIP breast implants removed last month. \nShe was finally convinced by a friend to take them out after suffering years of extreme exhaustion and debilitating pain.\nShe says the worst thing about it was wondering why she felt so ill all the time: \"Not knowing what it was, the mysterious illnesses, not being able to exercise. Not being vibrant, having my life, sort of stolen from me in a way.\" \nThe surgeon was shocked by what he found when he removed one of the implants. It had broken into multiple pieces inside her - exposing her body to an industrial-grade silicone gel.\n\"I can't believe they were allowed to be implanted in me. I don't know how they got through regulations.\n\"But I feel guilty that I messed about with my body and I put them in in the first place. But I'm angry that a human being can do that to another human being.\"\nDid you receive a PIP implant?

      "title": "UK inflation rate more than doubles in April",
      "tags": "Economics,Inflation,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The annual UK inflation rate more than doubled in April, as a rise in energy and clothing costs drove prices higher.\nThe jump to 1.5% in April from 0.7% in March, means consumer prices are rising at their fastest rate since March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic.\nThe sharp increase largely reflected a jump in prices from low levels a year ago at the start of the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics said.\nHigher oil prices also pushed up petrol prices, it added.\nAccording to the ONS, inflation climbed as lockdown restrictions were eased and shops reopened on 12 April. The rise in clothing and footwear prices reversed an unusual fall in February.\nMeanwhile, gas and electricity prices rose sharply after the default tariff cap was increased compared with a cut a year earlier.\nHannah Audino, economist at PwC, said she expected inflation to continue to rise as lockdown restrictions eased and the economy continued to reopen \"allowing consumers to unleash some of their excess savings\". \n\"Recent survey evidence suggests that the share of households who plan to spend some of their savings has increased in recent months, as the vaccine rollout boosts confidence,\" she added.\nApril's inflation rise had been predicted by economists, but there are concerns that soaring inflation this year as the global economy recovers from the pandemic could push central banks to raise interest rates.\nInflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. \nIt's one of the key measures of financial well-being because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. \nIt's expressed as a percentage increase or decrease in prices over time. For example, if the inflation rate for the cost of a litre of petrol is 2% a year, motorists need to spend 2% more at the pump than 12 months earlier.\nAnd if wages don't keep up with inflation, purchasing power and the standard of living falls.\nA little inflation, however, typically encourages people to buy products sooner and makes it easier for companies to put up wages. And both of those things boost economic growth. \nThat's why most countries' central banks have an inflation target of between 2% and 2.5%. \nIn the UK, the government has set the Bank of England an inflation target of 2%.\nRead more here.\nEarlier in May, fears about rising inflation in the US hit financial markets after consumer prices recorded their biggest annual jump since 2008. \nHigh government spending on Covid support programmes, coupled with a build-up in consumer savings, have driven prices higher, says experts. \nLiz Martins, senior economist at HSBC, said that it looked like UK inflation would go above the Bank of England's 2% target, although this was \"not too much of a worry for the Bank\".\n\"Their view is that they need to keep inflation sustainably around 2% two to three years out from now, so the short term overshoot won't worry them too much, if it does prove temporary - and that's where opinions really seem to diverge,\" she told the BBC.\nMany central bank governors, particularly in the US, are saying that the rise is due to bottlenecks in the aftermath of the pandemic which will go away, Ms Martins said.\nBut some people, including Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, say higher prices could stunt the recovery and that the Bank may need to raise interest rates to cool things down.\nLaith Khalaf, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said that the rise in prices was \"in key areas where it's hard for consumers to control spending, namely transport, clothing, and household energy\".\n\"At current levels, inflation is nothing to fret about, but there is rising concern that the fiscal and monetary response to the pandemic has sown the seeds of an inflationary scare further down the road,\" he said.\nHe said the Bank of England has made it clear it will tolerate inflation above its 2% target without \"pulling the trigger\" on interest rate rises.\n\"However, if inflation looks like it's going to get a significant foothold, markets will take matters into their own hands and raise borrowing costs across the economy,\" he said.\nTwo weeks ago the Bank of England said that UK inflation is heading above its 2% target and is expected to hit 2.5% at the end of 2021.\nThat is due to a rise in global oil prices and the expiry in September of Covid emergency cuts to value added tax (VAT) in the hospitality sector, as well as comparisons with the pandemic slump of 2020.\nThe Bank thinks inflation will then slip back to 2% in 2022 and 2023.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday that so far there was no strong evidence that higher prices paid by manufacturers were feeding through to consumer prices.\nHowever, he said the Bank \"will be watching this extremely carefully\" and would take action if necessary.\nLockdowns are deflationary; because they forcibly stop us shopping, travelling and mixing they reduce demand for everything from consumer goods and energy.\nSo a return to more normal levels of inflation was always likely as the global economy slowly started to re-open.\nClothes prices, for example, contributed to the rising cost of living not because they were rising by much but because they were no longer falling. \nWhat's spooked markets recently is the risk of inflation coming down the pipeline.\nIn a literal sense it already is: the price of oil has been rising in anticipation of a global recovery, pushing up petrol and household bills.\nLast week, markets took a knock fearing that the rising cost of raw materials would force the Bank of England to raise interest rates from their rock bottom official level of 0.1% sooner than anticipated to stop inflation getting out of control.\nThe Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has twice spoken publicly to play down that anxiety, saying on Tuesday that he had not yet seen strong evidence of those rising costs being passed through to consumers.\nBut Wednesday's figures for what manufacturers are paying for raw materials show a rise in input prices - what manufacturers pay for raw materials - of 9.9%.\nThat's the fastest rise in four years and faster than most economists expected."

      "title": "Trump's legal battles: How six cases may play out",
      "tags": "Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "As president of the United States, Donald Trump enjoyed unique protection from legal action, be it criminal or civil. \nNow, after losing the 2020 presidential election, Mr Trump will soon become a private citizen again.\nThat means he will lose his presidential privileges, putting him in the crosshairs of litigators and prosecutors.\n\"Once he is out of office, the atmosphere will change,\" Daniel R Alonso, a former US federal and New York state prosecutor, told the BBC. \"He will no longer have the reality or the threat of presidential power to thwart investigations.\"\nA wide-ranging criminal investigation in New York is the most serious legal concern for Mr Trump and his real-estate company, the Trump Organization.\nOn top of that, there is an array of lawsuits ranging from allegations of fraud by a family member to sexual harassment by an advice columnist.\nA legal storm is brewing. Here, we consider how the six biggest legal battles may develop.\nWhat we know: Playboy model Karen McDougal, adult film actress Stormy Daniels and claims of a conspiracy of silence.\nThis was the gist of the so-called hush-money scandal. Both women said they had had sexual relationships with Mr Trump and had received payments to keep them quiet, ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nWhen they spoke out in 2018, they threw political dynamite under Mr Trump's presidency, lighting the fuse of two criminal investigations.\nThe first focused on violations of federal, or national, laws and the role of Michael Cohen, Mr Trump's former personal lawyer and \"fixer\". \nUnder investigation, Cohen admitted to arranging payments to the two women. The payments were prosecuted as campaign-finance violations and Cohen was sentenced to three years in jail in 2018.\nCohen alleged that Mr Trump had \"directed\" him to make the payments, yet no charges were brought against the president. Why?\nFirstly, to charge Mr Trump, prosecutors would have needed to prove that he had indeed directed Cohen to make those payments. Secondly, even if prosecutors did have sufficient evidence, it is against US government policy to indict a sitting president on federal criminal charges, legal experts say.\nCase closed, right? Well, not exactly. This is where it gets technical.\nPut simply, a second criminal investigation into the payments is still under way in New York.\nWe know that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is examining whether the Trump Organization falsified business records related to the payoffs.\nWhat we don't know is whether Mr Vance has any evidence to file criminal charges. That matters.\nWhat might happen next: Falsifying business records is a misdemeanour under New York law. A misdemeanour is a minor crime that can be punishable by a jail term of up to a year.\nNow, here's the tricky part for Mr Vance.\nThere is a two-year time limit for filing criminal charges for a misdemeanour in New York.\n\"So, because those payments happened over two years ago, it looks like [prosecutors] are out of luck,\" Mr Alonso said.\nThat said, there are other possibilities. \nIn New York, falsifying business records can be charged as a felony if it is done to conceal other crimes, such as tax fraud.\nFelonies are more serious crimes that can be prosecuted over a longer period and are punishable by tougher jail sentences.\nStill, the route to prosecution is uncertain. It is not clear if Mr Trump can be prosecuted under New York law for campaign-finance violations - the federal crime Cohen was jailed for.\nThis is where the other strands of Mr Vance's investigation come in.\nWhat we know: It's a \"political hit job\", a Trump Organization lawyer said of Mr Vance's inquiry in August 2019. \nThe lawyer's statement was seething.\nMr Vance had just issued a request for documents, known as a subpoena. He demanded to see years of financial records, including the Holy Grail - Mr Trump's tax returns, eight years of them.\nSince then, Mr Trump has tried to block the subpoena, arguing in courts that it amounts to political harassment. In October, a federal appeals court disagreed, putting his tax returns within touching distance of prosecutors.\nIndeed, Mr Vance has stressed the significance of Mr Trump's tax returns in court papers.\nWhen requesting the returns in August, Mr Vance referred to \"public reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization\", including allegations of possible insurance and bank fraud. Another court filing in September mentioned tax fraud as a hypothetical crime that could be established, should evidence be found to support it. \nIn New York, some types of tax fraud can be charged as felonies, which can carry lengthy prison sentences. At the moment, though, the \"public reports\" of possible crimes cited by Mr Vance's office are merely grounds for investigation, nothing else.\nWhat might happen next: Mr Trump is expected to appeal against the demand to hand over his tax returns in the Supreme Court. There, the matter may be settled.\nFor Mr Trump, the stakes are high.\n\"The most significant criminal investigations are those exploring his tax and bank filings,\" Jonathan Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University, told the BBC. \"But whether there's a criminal case has yet to become evident.\"\nIf Mr Vance does obtain Mr Trump's tax returns, a criminal case may or may not become evident. Either way, Mr Vance needs those tax returns to move his investigation forward.\nWhat we know: New York Attorney General Letitia James has been another thorn in Mr Trump's side.\nSince March 2019, Ms James has been leading a civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization committed real-estate fraud.\nAgain, the roots of this investigation lead back to Cohen who, in February 2019, told Congress that Mr Trump had inflated the value of his property assets to secure loans and understated them to reduce his taxes.\nCohen's testimony gave Ms James grounds to seek information about Mr Trump's property empire. Like Mr Vance, Ms James has had to fight for that information in the courts.\nEric Trump, the executive vice-president of the Trump Organization and the president's son, has accused her of waging a \"political vendetta\". Despite this, he complied with a request to sit for testimony with her office in October.\nWhat might happen next: Ms James needs more testimony and information to take the investigation forward.\nIn office, Mr Trump argued that he was too busy to deal with lawsuits. Now, he cannot use that excuse.\nMs James can treat Mr Trump with less deference, pressing him to sit for questioning under oath, just like his son.\n\"Most courts would be very indulgent with a president-defendant on things like scheduling, for instance. Not so with a private citizen,\" Mr Alonso said.\nCivil investigations like this can result in financial penalties, if evidence of wrongdoing is found. If it is, another criminal inquiry cannot be ruled out.\nWhat we know: Emolument is an archaic word that is seldom used today, except in legal contexts. The definition is contested, but it is generally understood to mean gain, profit or advantage from employment or holding public office.\nSo what does this have to do with Mr Trump? \nHe has been accused of breaking rules against \"emoluments\" during his presidency. These rules, known as the emoluments clauses, were written into the country's bedrock legal text, the US Constitution.\nOne clause requires all federal officials, including the president, to seek the consent of Congress before accepting any benefits from foreign states.\nThree separate civil lawsuits alleged that Mr Trump had not sought that consent. One cited the hosting of foreign officials at the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC as a possible violation.\nMr Trump has derided \"this phony emoluments clause\", suggesting other sitting presidents have made money.\nWhat might happen next: Regardless, the emoluments lawsuits will probably be dismissed or dropped, legal experts say. One brought by congressional Democrats has already been rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\"Emoluments are not likely to be the basis of any criminal action,\" said Mr Turley, an expert on constitutional law.\n\"The emoluments cases relate to Trump holding office, so once he leaves office, the controversy becomes largely academic.\"\nWhat we know: Mr Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women whose allegations span decades. Mr Trump has denied all the allegations, dismissing them as \"fake news\", political smears and conspiracies.\nMany of the accusers came forward ahead of Mr Trump's election win in 2016. Mr Trump vowed to sue them all but, as yet, has not done so.\nInstead, some of the accusers have sued Mr Trump. Two of those women have filed defamation lawsuits against Mr Trump for calling them liars.\nE Jean Carroll, a long-time columnist for Elle magazine, is one of them. She has accused Mr Trump of raping her in a dressing room at a luxury Manhattan department store in the 1990s. Mr Trump denies it and is contesting the defamation claim.\nIn her lawsuit, Ms Carroll argues Mr Trump defamed her by saying he could not have raped her because \"she's not my type\". Her lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and a retraction of Mr Trump's statements.\nMs Carroll v Mr Trump seemed straightforward enough until September, when the US Department of Justice weighed in.\nThe department took the unusual step of trying to replace Mr Trump with the United States as a defendant in the case.\nIn the end, a federal judge ruled against the department's intervention, arguing \"the allegations have no relationship to the official business of the United States\".\nWhat might happen next: The case can now proceed, allowing Ms Carroll's lawyers to gather evidence. \nFor example, they could press on by attempting to verify if Mr Trump's DNA is on a dress Ms Carroll says she was wearing at the time of the alleged assault. For that, they would need a DNA sample from Mr Trump.\nA similar but separate defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Mr Trump's television show The Apprentice, may go the same way.\nMs Zervos alleged that Mr Trump had sexually assaulted her during a meeting to discuss job opportunities at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007.\nMr Trump dismissed the allegation as \"phony\", accusing Ms Zervos of fabricating it for fame. Ms Zervos then sued him for defamation in 2017, seeking damages of at least $3,000.\nMr Trump tried to get the case dismissed during his presidency. His lawyers suggested that, as president, he should be immune to lawsuits in state courts.\n\"That argument completely evaporates on 20 January,\" Barbara L McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan, told the BBC. \"Once that happens, we move to the discovery phase of the case and there could be some movement there.\"\nWhat we know: \"Fraud was not just the family business - it was a way of life,\" reads the first line of Mary Trump's lawsuit against her uncle Donald.\nAs an opening salvo, it could hardly be more contemptuous.\nIt mirrors the animosity of Ms Trump's newly released memoir, in which she chastises her uncle as a \"narcissist\" who threatens the life of every American.\nThe family beef is as personal as it gets and Ms Trump's lawsuit, filed in September, reflects that acrimony.\nIn it, she accuses Mr Trump and two of his siblings of cheating her out of an inheritance while pressuring her to give up interests in the family business.\nMs Trump inherited valuable interests in the family business when Fred Trump Jr - her father and the president's older brother - died in 1981 at the age of 42. Ms Trump was 16 at the time.\nMr Trump and his siblings \"committed to watch over\" Ms Trump's interests, the lawsuit says. \n\"They lied,\" the lawsuit says. \"Rather than protect Mary's interests, they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift [fraud], and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited.\"\nThe lawsuit seeks at least $500,000 in damages.\nWhat might happen next: The White House said Ms Trump's book was full of \"falsehoods\", but Mr Trump is yet to reply to the lawsuit. \nIf requests for documents and testimony come, Mr Trump cannot cite his presidential duties as a reason to deny them.\nNo American citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the law."

      "text": "The body of a man found on a South Australian beach more than 70 years ago has been exhumed in the hope of solving one of the country's most intriguing mysteries. \nThe identity and cause of death of the so-called Somerton man remain unknown. \nOver the years many theories have swirled as to his identity, from Cold War spy to rejected lover. \nNow, Australian police say advances in DNA technology make exhumation worthwhile. \nThe man's body was found on 1 December 1948 on Somerton beach in the South Australian city of Adelaide. He was slumped against a seawall, dressed in a suit and tie.\nHis pockets contained nothing to identify him. \nInitial investigations and a coronial inquest left the case unsolved. He was put to rest in an Adelaide cemetery under a headstone reading only \"the unknown man\". \nBut a number of curious items found on the body encouraged ongoing speculation. They included a suitcase, items of clothing with their labels removed and incoherent writings believed to be a code. He also held a torn scrap of paper with the Farsi words Tamam Shud, or \"it's finished\" printed on it. \nThe case has drawn international interest and attracted plenty of sleuths online. \n\"For more than 70 years, people have speculated who this man was and how he died,\" South Australia Attorney General Vickie Chapman said.\nLast month Ms Chapman said the decision to exhume the body followed \"intense public interest\" in the case.\nOn Wednesday, crews began digging at the gravesite, with local media outlet Nine News reporting initial efforts had moved more slowly than expected due to dense clay and uncertainty as to whether the man had been buried in a coffin.\nAccording to ABC News, a wooden spatula and a brush were used to carefully exhume the remains, which were then placed in a new coffin before being taken away to a forensic science centre.\nAccessing the man's remains may be a first step in a process to build a DNA profile and uncover answers in one of the country's most famous cold cases. \nAuthorities said if sufficient DNA evidence can be obtained, they will attempt to identify the man and where he came from. \n\"The technology available to us now is clearly light years ahead of the techniques available when this body was discovered in the late 1940s,\" Forensic Science South Australia's Assistant Director of Operations, Dr Anne Coxon, said.\nDr Coxon said tests of this kind were highly complex but investigators would use \"every method at our disposal to try and bring closure to this enduring mystery\". \nThe case is part of Operation Persevere, which seeks to put a name to all unidentified remains in South Australia. \n\"It's an story that has captured the imagination of people across the state, and, indeed, across the world  - but I believe that, finally, we may uncover some answers,\" South Australian Attorney General Ms Chapman said.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Ballymurphy inquest",
      "text": "The prime minister has publicly apologised to the families of the 10 people killed in Ballymurphy in 1971\nBoris Johnson began prime minister's questions on Wednesday by reading the names of the victims.\nHe went on to say that he was sorry for how the investigations were handled and for the pain endured by the families.\nLast week an inquest found that the victims, who were shot during an Army operation in Belfast, were \"entirely innocent\".\nMr Johnson told the House of Commons: \"No apology can lessen their lasting pain, I hope they may take some comfort in the answers they have secured and in knowing this has renewed the government's determination to ensure in future that other families can find answers without distress and delay.\" \nJohn Teggart, whose father Daniel was one of those killed in Ballymurphy, has called Boris Johnson's apology \"totally unacceptable\" and said he \"personally rejects it\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Mr Teggart labelled Mr Johnson's apology \"totally insincere\" and said it \"again has caused annoyance to the families\".\nMr Teggart ruled out ever meeting the prime minister and said he \"wouldn't waste a minute of his time with him\". \n\"I won't be letting him annoy me anymore, I have no time for him and his feeble attempts to apologise,\" Mr Teggart said. \nHe said Mr Johnson's apology should have focused on \"our loved ones who were murdered\" and not how the investigation was handled. \nMary Kate Quinn, whose uncle John Laverty was killed in Ballymurphy, said the Balllymurphy families \"were not informed\" that Mr Johnson was making a statement on Wednesday in the House of Commons. \nIn a tweet, Ms Quinn said: \"We found out from journalists. Yet again, that was not an apology. Boris did not apologise for the killings of our loved ones.\"\nAmong the victims were a priest who was trying to help the wounded and a mother of eight.\nNine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said.\nHowever, Mrs Justice Keegan said she could not definitively rule who shot the tenth victim, former World War Two soldier John McKerr.\nFamilies of the victims received a written apology from Mr Johnson last week, which they said had angered them. \nThey said the letter was received minutes before Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis apologised in Parliament for \"the events at Ballymurphy\" in 1971.\nMr Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened.\nMr Johnson also told Parliament that the UK government was committed to introducing legislation in the current session to address the legacy of the Troubles.\n\"And to introduce a fair package for veterans as well, to protect them from unfair, vexatious litigation where no new evidence has been brought forward,\" Mr Johnson said. \nThe government is to bring forward legislation in the course of the next year to deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles.\nBased on details of the plan leaked in recent weeks, it is proposed that all prosecutions prior to 1998 and related to the Troubles will, in future, be banned under a statute of limitations.\nSinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald said Mr Johnson had added \"insult to injury\". \n\"I don't think that he has delivered anything that approximates a sincere or complete apology,\" Ms McDonald said. \n\"The bigger problem beyond that is that Boris Johnson and his government are determined to deliver an amnesty for British soldiers.\"\nSDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said Mr Johnson's apology was \"too little, too late\".\n\"I don't know why he couldn't make a proper apology to the families last week when he had many, many opportunities,\" Mr Eastwood said. \n\"He didn't actually apologise for their loved ones being killed by British soldiers. I just think it was frankly insulting to the victims.\"\nMr Eastwood said the prime minister should have met the families in Belfast. \nSimon Hoare, Northern Ireland Affairs Committee chair, said he had hoped the prime minister would give an apology and he was pleased that he had now done so. \n\"I think it was the right thing for the prime minister to do,\" Mr Hoare said.

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,Palestinian territories,Gaza,Hamas,West Bank,UN Security Council,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has told Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu he expects a \"significant de-escalation\" in the Gaza conflict on Wednesday.\nMr Biden wanted a \"path to ceasefire\", the White House said.\nThe US is a staunch ally of Israel and has so far opposed a joint UN Security Council statement on the conflict.\nIn response Mr Netanyahu said he was \"determined to carry on\" until \"calm and security are restored to Israeli citizens\", according to Israeli media.\nThe conflict is in its 10th day, with a continuing exchange of rocket fire from Palestinian militants into Israel and Israeli air strikes on Gaza.\nOn Wednesday, four rockets were also fired from Lebanon into Israel and Israel's military responded by firing artillery shells at \"a number of targets in Lebanese territory\". It was not immediately clear whether this would prove to be a significant escalation.\nThe Gaza fighting began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, which controls Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.\nAt least 227 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters.\nIn Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza.\nOn Wednesday morning, Mr Biden held his fourth call with Mr Netanyahu since the conflict started.\nA statement released by the White House said: \"The president conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire.\"\nThe US has called before for a truce but has held up any joint UN statement, saying it would not help with de-escalation.\nThe Palestinian representative at the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the Security Council's failure to express a unified position \"shameful\".\nThe latest bid for a council resolution calling for a ceasefire, launched by France, failed on Wednesday when the US said it could \"undermine efforts to de-escalate\".\nOne Israeli military source told Reuters that Israel was assessing whether conditions were right for a truce.\nThe Ynet news website said that the Israelis were talking with Egyptian mediators. It quoted sources in the Israeli cabinet as saying Israel could achieve its objectives and end the fighting \"within days\".\nA Hamas leader said that efforts by mediators were \"serious and continuous\" but that Palestinian demands had to be met.\nEarlier on Wednesday Mr Netanyahu did not appear ready to begin a truce.\nHe said there were \"only two ways that you can deal with\" Hamas. \"You can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility, or you can deter them, and we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence, but I have to say we don't rule out anything.\"\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there had been renewed rocket fire from Gaza on Wednesday and that its fighter jets had attacked military infrastructure, including tunnels, and the homes of Hamas commanders.\nThe BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza said two Palestinian militants were killed in Gaza City, as dozens of strikes targeted both it and the southern city of Khan Younis. \nGaza City mother of seven Randa Abu Sultan, 45, told AFP news agency: \"My four-year-old son tells me he's scared that if he falls asleep, he'll wake up to find us dead.\"\nIDF spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman said Israel had tried to assassinate Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.\nMohammed Deif has survived repeated attempts on his life, including in the last major conflict in 2014. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown.\nSirens sounded across much of south and central Israel on Wednesday.\nHamas also targeted an Israeli air base overnight but the IDF said no bases were hit.\nOf the 3,750 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since the fighting began, 550 have fallen short in Gaza, according to the IDF. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system has intercepted about 90% of the rockets that have crossed into Israeli territory, it says.\nThe IDF estimated that at the start of the conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main groups in Gaza, had an arsenal of about 12,000 rockets or mortars.\nMr Netanyahu said the Israeli operation had \"set Hamas back by many years\".\nThere has also been unrest within Israel and in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinians took part in a general strike on Tuesday. There were clashes in several locations.\nSeparately on Wednesday, Turkey rejected US accusations that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had made anti-Semitic remarks about Israel. \nHe had accused Israel of \"terrorism\" against the Palestinians and recently said: \"It is in their nature\".\nState department spokesman Ned Price said the US found the remarks \"reprehensible\".\nOmer Celik, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan's party, said the president had given very strong messages against anti-Semitism, adding: \"Accusing our president of anti-Semitism is an illogical and untrue approach.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Healthcare,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A nurse who cared for Boris Johnson when he was in intensive care with Covid has quit the NHS and criticised the government's handling of the pandemic and nurses' pay.\nJenny McGee said she was \"taking a step back\" from the NHS after her \"toughest year\" in the job, but hoped to return.\nShe told a Channel 4 documentary that nurses were not getting \"the respect and now pay\" they deserve.\nThe government has recommended a 1% pay rise for NHS staff this year.\nMs McGee also told the programme, The Year Britain Stopped, that \"a lot of nurses\" felt the government \"hadn't led very effectively\" and that there had been \"indecisiveness\" and \"so many mixed messages\".\nShe said it had been \"very upsetting\".\nMs McGee, originally from New Zealand, now plans to work abroad and spend time in her home country.\nShe told the documentary: \"Yes, we have put ourselves on the line and we have worked so incredibly hard, and there's a lot of talk about how we're all heroes and all that sort of stuff.\n\"But at the same time, I'm just not sure if I can do it. I don't know how much more I've got to give to the NHS.\n\"We're not getting the respect and now pay that we deserve. I'm just sick of it. So I've handed in my resignation.\"\nShe gave the comments to the programme recently and a spokeswoman for the hospital confirmed she has now left.\nIn a statement released through Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Ms McGee said: \"After the toughest year of my nursing career, I'm taking a step back from the NHS but hope to return in the future.\n\"I'm excited to start a nursing contract in the Caribbean, before a holiday back home in New Zealand later in the year.\n\"I'm so proud to have worked at St Thomas' Hospital and to have been part of such a fantastic team.\"\nMs McGee also told the documentary, being broadcast on 24 May, that Mr Johnson was surrounded by sick patients, \"some of whom were dying\", when he was admitted to hospital in April last year.   \n\"I remember seeing him and thinking he looked very, very unwell,\" she said. \"He was a different colour really.\"\nShe described it as a \"surreal\" time, and added that as Covid patients are complicated to look after, \"we just didn't know what was going to happen\". \nAfter his release from hospital, Mr Johnson gave a statement in which he praised Ms McGee and fellow nurse Luis Pitarma for staying by his bedside all night. \nShe was invited to Downing Street in July for a garden party to celebrate 72 years of the NHS. In the documentary, the nurse said she was asked to take part in the clap for carers alongside the prime minister. \nIt would have been a \"good photo opportunity\" but she said she wanted to \"stay out of it\", adding: \"Lots of nurses felt that the government hadn't led very effectively - the indecisiveness, so many mixed messages.\"\nDowning Street said in a statement: \"Our NHS staff have gone above and beyond over the past year and this government will do everything in our power to support them.\n\"We are extremely grateful for the care NHS staff have provided throughout the pandemic in particular.\"\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the nurse's decision to leave the NHS was a \"devastating indictment of Boris Johnson's approach to the people who put their lives on the line for him and our whole country\". \nPat Cullen, acting general secretary and chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said it was warning of \"an exodus\" from the profession. She said the government should \"demonstrate its respect by giving nurses a fair pay rise for the skilled work they do\". \nSara Gorton, head of health at the Unison union, said many more staff could quit \"unless the prime minister sees sense over pay\".

      "tags": "Elon Musk,Bitcoin,Tesla,China,Cryptocurrency",
      "text": "The price of Bitcoin fell below $34,000 (\u00a324,030) for the first time in three months on Wednesday, after China imposed fresh curbs on crypto-currencies.\nBeijing banned banks and payment firms from providing services related to crypto-currency transactions.\nIt also warned investors against speculative crypto trading on Tuesday.\nIt follows falls in Bitcoin of more than 10% last week after Tesla said it would no longer accept the currency.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin recovered some ground, although it was still down -10.4% at $38,131.\nMeanwhile, other digital currencies such as Ether, which acts as the fuel for the Ethereum blockchain network, and Dogecoin lost as much as 22% and 24% respectively.\nAt the same time, Tesla shares fell more than 3% on Wall Street, possibly because of the electric carmaker's exposure to Bitcoin.\nThe firm, owned by Elon Musk, still holds around $1.5bn worth of the crypto-currency.\nCrypto-currency trading has been illegal in China since 2019 in order to curb money-laundering. But people are still able to trade in currencies such as Bitcoin online, which has concerned Beijing. \nOn Tuesday, three state-backed organisations, including the National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association and the Payment and Clearing Association of China issued a warning on social media.\nThey said consumers would have no protection if they were to incur any losses from crypto-currency investment transactions.\nThey added that recent wild swings in crypto-currency prices \"seriously violate people's asset safety\" and are disrupting the \"normal economic and financial order\".\nNeil Wilson of Markets.com said: \"China has for some time been putting pressure on the crypto space, but this marks an intensification - other countries might follow now as central banks make strides towards their own digital currencies.\n\"Until now, Western regulators have been pretty relaxed about Bitcoin, but this might change soon.\"\nIn March, Tesla boss Elon Musk announced unexpectedly that the electric carmaker would allow customers to buy cars using Bitcoin.\nBut last week, he did a U-turn and suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin because of environmental concerns.\nHis fears centre on Bitcoin mining - the energy-intensive process through which the digital currency is generated, using high-powered computers. It often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal.\n\"We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,\" Mr Musk wrote.\n\"Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.\"\nHe said the electric carmaker did not intend to sell any of its Bitcoin and intended to reinstate crypto-currency transactions once mining shifted to using more sustainable energy sources.\nAlthough the digital currency cannot be traded in China, more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world is done in China.\nFor anyone who has followed the crypto-currency scene for a while, the events of recent weeks are a familiar story. \nSome random event - say, a tweet from Elon Musk announcing Tesla will accept crypto-currency payments - sends Bitcoin to new highs, and people begin to say it's winning mainstream acceptance.\nThen another random event happens, perhaps a change of course from the Tesla tycoon. It comes tumbling down again, and talk of it going mainstream fades into the background.\nLast month, in a chatroom on Clubhouse (another phenomenon that seems to be swinging from boom to bust) I expressed some scepticism about crypto-currencies. \nUp popped a senior figure from London's thriving fintech scene: \"Rory, Rory,\" he chided me, \"crypto is becoming an accepted asset class.\"\nWith big City institutions taking an interest, that had a ring of truth - back in April, at least. \nBut this week, the weather had changed, with the Financial Times reporting \"new doubts among institutional fund managers over the future of crypto-currencies as an asset class\".\nMy mind went back to 2013, when I had first taken an interest in Bitcoin. In a report for Radio 4's PM programme, I had bought a pizza for 0.5 BTC, a tortuous process which had not seemed worth the \u00a330 it cost back then - of course, at today's exchange rate, that was a \u00a314,000 pizza.\nI had also written a blog post headlined \"The Bitcoin Bubble\", in which I tried to mine some lessons from a period when the price of the cryptocurrency shot up from $15 to $276 and then hurtled lower again. \nI ended a piece  in which I compared the cryptocurrency with 17th-Century Dutch tulips or London houses in the 1980s with this thought: \"Unless and until Bitcoin can be used to buy a sandwich, or be accepted by your friends when you pay them back for a restaurant meal, then it is likely to remain just a playground for geeks and gamblers.\"\nEight years on, it is still virtually impossible to buy a sandwich with Bitcoin.\nAnd why would you want to, when there's a good chance you'll be mocked a few years later - as I've been for my transaction - for giving away an asset that goes on to soar in value?"

      "tags": "Schools,Exams,Psychology",
      "text": "Teachers' grades could be biased towards students with more \"agreeable\" personalities - rather than actual ability, claim psychologists.\nAn international study found a 10% advantage in teachers' grades for those seen as being likeable, compared with results in anonymous exams.\nUniversity researchers warned students should not be \"penalised\" because of negative expectations about them.\nTeachers' grades will be used this year for cancelled exams across the UK.\nThe international psychology study looked at how personality could influence perceptions of ability.\nIt did not draw on the replacement exam systems being used in the UK, but head teachers' leader Geoff Barton rejected the idea of teachers being unfairly swayed.\n\"Teachers are highly trained professionals who are well aware of the importance of assessing all their students fairly and without any form of favouritism or bias,\" he said.\nThe psychology study, from researchers at Queen's University Belfast and Goldsmiths, University of London, analysed how the personalities of students compared with grades awarded by teachers and then their written exam results.\nIt was based on a sample of 1,200 students in Russia, whose psychological profiles had been mapped against their academic record.\nIt found that those with personality traits seen as more positive - such as more sociable, well-behaved and \"agreeable\" - received a boost in teachers' grades, which were not then borne out by performance in anonymous exams.\nTeachers also seemed to be more sympathetic in grading towards students who were stressed or anxious, showing more \"leniency\" in grades for those seen as more \"emotionally fragile\".\nThis pattern worked against those who were perceived as having more negative, anti-social or annoying traits.\n\"It seems teachers awarded higher grades to pupils who were more agreeable and marked them down if they were less likeable,\" said Kostas Papageorgiou from Queen's University Belfast.\n\"But we shouldn't penalise students for these characteristics,\" said Dr Papageorgiou.\nThe study, also involving academics in Russia and Italy, found no clear pattern between personality types and actual performance in exams.\nBut the evidence suggested \"teacher ratings might reflect some conscious or unconscious biases\", said the psychologist Dr Papageorgiou.\nThis is a higher profile issue in the UK this summer - with teachers' grades playing an important part, along with other assessments, in deciding results for exams cancelled by the pandemic.\nThe findings, although based on a sample of 14 to 18 year olds in Russia, have a relevance in all education systems, says Dr Papageorgiou.\n\"Bias is universal, it's part of all of us,\" warned Dr Papageorgiou. \"I don't see any reason why this sort of bias wouldn't apply here.\"\nThe study did not look at bias in terms of gender or ethnicity, but researchers said the findings revealed how much perceptions of academic ability could be influenced by other factors, in this case students' personalities.\nDr Papageorgiou says that a variation of 10% in grading might not seem high, but it could mean a significant difference in an academic setting.\nHe said it showed that \"bias can operate on many levels\".\nBut the psychologist said that: \"Marking exams blindly and having a moderation system in place will definitely reduce the negative impact of this bias.\"\nMr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said teachers' professionalism would prevent favouritism and measures were in place to ensure fairness in this year's results.\n\"They are following detailed guidance from the exam boards and the exam regulator Ofqual, and schools and colleges are operating quality assurance processes to ensure fairness and consistency. \n\"Teachers and leaders are working incredibly hard to carry out these assessments following the government's decision to cancel public exams this summer. \n\"They are utterly committed to making sure that their students receive fair and accurate grades in GCSEs, A-levels and other important qualifications,\" said the heads' leader."

      "tags": "Tourism,Travel,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Surge testing and jabs will be expanded to six new areas of concern in England to combat the spread of the Indian Covid variant, Matt Hancock has said.\nThe areas were identified using new techniques, including analysing wastewater and travel patterns, he told a Downing Street briefing.\nThe government is also supporting Scotland in rolling out more tests and vaccinations in Glasgow and Moray.\nSome 2,967 cases of the Indian variant have now been identified in the UK.\nThis is up from about 2,300 on Monday.\nMr Hancock said early evidence suggested that this variant - B.1.617.2 - passes on more easily from person to person than the one first discovered in Kent, adding that it was now \"even more important that people get vaccinated\".\nBut he said ministers were \"determined to do all that we can to ensure this new variant doesn't put our recovery at risk\".\nFurther surge testing and vaccinations will now be introduced in:\nThe health secretary said these were selected via \"an incredibly sensitive biosecurity surveillance system\", which spotted cases in earlier variant hotspots Bolton and Blackburn.\nMonitoring travel patterns, along with analysis of wastewater - or sewage - in 70% of the country had helped identify where variants were and also where they were at risk of spreading to, he said.\nOutlining the spread of the Indian variant, he added: \"The weekly case data in Bolton is now 283 per 100,000 and it doubled in the last week.\n\"There are now 25 people in Bolton Hospital with Covid - the majority are unvaccinated, nearly 90% have not yet had two vaccines.\n\"This shows the importance of getting vaccinated, not once but twice.\"\nScientists will know more about the transmissibility of the new Indian variant by \"some time next week\", England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said.\nOverall, a further three deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been recorded in the UK, and there have been 2,696 more cases overall. \nAnother 174,100 people have been given a first dose of a vaccine, and 324,001 more have received their second dose.\nThe spread of the Indian variant has cast doubt on plans to ease remaining restrictions in England next month.\nThe number of cases of Indian variant is climbing, but what this means remains to be seen.\nThe variant should soon be dominant - it is clearly more infectious than the UK variant which emerged last year.\nScientists are busy studying it to work out just how much more transmissible it is.\nThat means unpicking to what extent the rise is being driven by the sudden importation of the variant from abroad and the environmental factors in the communities where it is spreading. \nIn densely-populated housing conditions it's easier for the virus to be passed on - rather than because of an inherent biological advantage.\nScientists believe it could be anything between 10% to 50% more infectious depending on what influence each of those factors have.\nIf it's nearer 50%, that could drive a surge in cases that could spill over into significant hospital admissions even with the vaccine rollout.\nAt the lower end, the impact will be more muted and the full lifting of restrictions on 21 June could still be on.\nThere are some early signs it could be at the lower end, but it will be a week or two before we know that with any confidence.\nAt the briefing, Mr Hancock praised the UK's development of the AstraZeneca vaccine made by Oxford University, highlighting the worldwide benefits it had brought. He said:\n\"It is something every British taxpayer has had a part supporting and everyone in this United Kingdom should be incredibly proud of it,\" Mr Hancock said.\nMeanwhile, Prof Van-Tam told the news conference that scientists were sure the Indian variant was more transmissible but the \"million dollar question\" was how much more transmissible.\n\"We have a credible range that goes from a few per cent more transmissible through to 50% more transmissible - I think most people feel it is going to be somewhere in the middle... but it is just too early,\" he said.\nHowever, he said transmission of the new variant was \"not inevitable\" and it could be slowed down through \"cautious behaviour\".\n\"I think I've said 'don't tear the pants out of it' once before from this or a similar podium, but frankly we're back to that again now,\" he said.\nHe urged those living in hotspots to think carefully about their new freedoms and try to stick to outdoor activities in small groups.\nEarlier, at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said there was \"increasing confidence\" that Covid-19 vaccines were effective against all variants, including the Indian one.\nBut his official spokesman said ministers would want to see more information before making decisions on the next steps toward lifting lockdown.\nAt PMQs, Mr Johnson also repeated his warning that people should not be holidaying in amber list countries. This includes France, Spain and Greece.\nVisits to those countries should only be made in \"extreme\" circumstances such as a family illness, he said.\nEU ambassadors are recommending that restrictions on travel into the EU should be relaxed for fully vaccinated people, and those from countries with low infection rates. \nA decision on whether the UK will be included on a so-called \"white list\" will be made on Friday.\nPortugal, Italy and Greece have already dropped quarantine restrictions for British travellers and Spain is expected to make an announcement in the coming days.\nPortugal is the only EU country currently on the UK's own green list, allowing travellers to return without going into quarantine."

      "text": "Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found.\nThis is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage.\nIncreased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in very specific locations - local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets.\nSome of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not have Covid symptoms.\nThe testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.\nSurge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.\nEast\nNorth West\nWest Midlands\nSouth East\nSurge testing is also currently being carried out in specific and targeted locations within the following local authority areas:\nLondon\nSouth East\nNorth West\nYorkshire and the Humber\nTargeted community testing is also taking place in various health board areas across Scotland. \nScientists have identified a number of \"variants of concern\" - these are  newly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. \nAlso, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines.\nThe Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). \nThe variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming system which uses Greek letters instead. \nThe PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test \nPeople tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. \nThis involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.\nIt is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result.\nThe lateral flow test \nThis also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes.\nWherever you are in the UK, if you have symptoms you should book a free test online. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home. \nIf you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland. \nAnyone in England can now get free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms. These can be ordered online, by calling 119, or can be collected from test centres and pharmacies. \nAnyone in Scotland can also order free lateral flow tests online, or collect them from test centres.\nAnyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.\nSelf-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials.\nPeople in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nAnyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a \u00a3500 payment."

      "text": "Calls to expand the Senedd have been endorsed by the first minister, who says there is a \"significant tide\" across Cardiff Bay parties in favour.\nMark Drakeford said there was \"growing enthusiasm\" for a Welsh Parliament \"fit to discharge its responsibilities\". \nLast year, a report by Labour and Plaid members on a Senedd committee concluded the institution should expand to up to 90 politicians, from the current 60.\nThe committee was boycotted by the Conservatives and the Brexit Party.\nIncreasing the Senedd to 90 members would make it the same size as the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Scottish Parliament has 129 MSPs.\nBoth Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats back having a bigger Senedd, but want that to be accompanied by changes to the electoral system to better reflect the share of the vote parties receive.\nHowever, the Tories say the new Welsh Parliament should focus \"solely on Wales' recovery from coronavirus\", not creating more Cardiff Bay politicians. \nAny changes would require the backing of at least 40 Senedd members, a so-called \"super majority\".\nIt has been estimated an additional 30 Senedd members would cost around an extra \u00a312m per year.\nWelsh Labour leader Mr Drakeford was talking to BBC Wales ahead of the parliament meeting on Wednesday for its first session since he was renominated as first minister, after his party matched its best previous election performances and won 30 seats on 6 May.\nPlaid Cymru was the only large party to officially back last September's electoral reform committee report, Senedd reform: the next steps.\nThat review also called for a more proportional system to be used at the next Senedd election, due in 2026.\nThe report warned that if the changes were to take effect at that election, consensus on them must be established \"very early\" in the new Senedd term.\nMr Drakeford said it would be \"for the Labour Party to take a view\" but added: \"I think there is a significant tide across parties in the Senedd to grasp this difficult issue of making the Senedd fit for the responsibilities it now discharges.\n\"It's a very, very different body to the one that was formed in 1999\", he said, referring to the then Welsh Assembly's lack of primary law-making and tax-raising powers.\n\"Ivor Richard said in his report in 2003 that the Senedd needed more members to do the job that it's asked to do for Wales,\" he said.\n\"Now I think we need just to make sure the practicalities of that are properly understood and, if there is a momentum for it, it's not for the government to take this forward, it is for the Senedd itself.\"\nThe first minister said there was \"an enthusiasm amongst a growing number of members\" for change.\nAsked if he shared that enthusiasm, Mr Drakeford said: \"Yes, I want to see the Senedd properly fit to discharge its responsibilities.\"\nHe said the chances of a bigger Senedd at the next poll \"have improved as a result of the election, and it's a matter not just of numbers but it's a matter of method of election as well, which is a thorny issue, on which there are many views\".\n\"So there are still significant practical issues to work through. I hope the Senedd will get on with it.\"\nThe Conservatives won 16 seats at this month's election, their highest total, having pledged not to expand the Welsh Parliament.\nResponding to the first minister's comments, Tory Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Mr Drakeford was \"badly mistaken\" in his views as \"only Labour and Plaid Cymru have an appetite to create more politicians in Cardiff Bay\". \n\"Welsh Conservatives have been clear that this parliamentary term should be focused solely on Wales' recovery from coronavirus, not increasing the size of the Senedd,\" he said.\n\"It's regrettable that just a couple weeks after polling day this is featuring on the political agenda when all energies should be directed at saving jobs, tackling waiting lists and ensuring our children catch up on their missed education over the past year.\" \nPlaid Cymru took 13 Senedd seats in May's poll, which combined with the 30 Labour politicians in the chamber would reach the 40 seat threshold needed to expand the parliament.\nPlaid leader Adam Price said: \"We've long known that the Senedd is currently too small to fulfil its role of holding the government of the day to account. \n\"Plaid Cymru supports delivering the democratic representation Wales deserves - and needs - and ensuring that our Senedd and wider democracy reflects our modern nation in all its diversity along with all the voices and aspirations of Wales' citizens.\n\"That means urgently demanding more powers to a larger and stronger Senedd and implementing a fairer voting system in the form of STV.\"\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats have just one seat in Cardiff Bay, as they did after the 2016 poll, now held by their leader Jane Dodds, who called Mr Drakeford's comments \"encouraging\".\n\"Welsh Liberal Democrats are prepared to work with other parties in order to increase the number of Senedd Members by 20-30 in line with the 2017 McAllister Review,\" she said.\n\"This option should be made cost neutral by the planned reduction in the number of Westminster MPs by the UK government.\"\n\"Any change to the number of MSs [members of the Senedd] should also go hand in hand with the introduction of a proportional voting system for Senedd elections, to make sure that every vote counts and every member elected is elected by the majority of voters.\"\nJess Blair, director of the Electoral Reform Society Cymru, said the comments \"represent a big step forward to address the democratic deficit in Wales\".\n\"In the two decades since devolution the powers and responsibilities in Cardiff Bay have grown, yet the size of the Senedd has not, remaining the same size as Pembrokeshire County Council,\" she said.\nThere are two main difficulties with proposals to increase the size of the Senedd.\nThe first is that creating more politicians is hard to sell to voters - but boundary changes for Westminster elections are coming, and bringing with them a reduction in the number of Welsh MPs, perhaps this could provide some cover for introducing changes to the Senedd?  \nThe second is that it would mean changing the voting system itself - this would be a chance to adopt a fully proportional system for Senedd elections.\nSome in Welsh Labour are concerned that could undermine their current dominance, and so far the party has been reluctant to commit to change, even though many of their elected Senedd members support it.\nBut after his recent electoral success, Welsh party leader Mark Drakeford has momentum behind him as well as a departure date in front of him. \nHe says he'll stand down during this term - could this be a legacy project?\nOne thing is for sure, if he can get his party on board, Plaid Cymru and Lib Dem support mean the votes are there to get this through."

      "text": "US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for a diplomatic boycott of next year's Winter Olympics in Beijing due to concerns over human rights abuses.\nWhile athletes would still participate, Ms Pelosi said heads of state should not attend. \nMs Pelosi said the US could not proceed as if nothing was wrong with the Olympics being held in China. \nShe is the latest American politician to call for a boycott over the treatment of Uyghur Muslims.\nChina is believed to have detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, a large region in north-western China. \nMost of those detained in Xinjiang are sent to \"re-education\" facilities - prison-like camps where they are held for indeterminate periods of time without charge.\nMs Pelosi, a Democrat, told a bipartisan congressional hearing on the issue that heads of state around the world should boycott the Winter Olympics, which are to take place in February.\n\"Let's not honour the Chinese government by having heads of state go to China,\" she said. \n\"For heads of state to go to China in light of a genocide that is ongoing - while you're sitting there in your seat - really begs the question, what moral authority do you have to speak again about human rights any place in the world?\" she said.\nIn response, Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, was scathing of Ms Pelosi's proposal. \n\"I wonder what makes some US politicians think they actually have the so-called 'moral authority'? On human rights issues, they are in no position, either historically or currently, to make wanton groundless criticism against China,\" Mr Liu told the Reuters news agency. \nThe Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families.\nThe country initially denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism. It has denied allegations of human rights abuses."

      "text": "People whose properties were badly damaged by flooding after a mine shaft \"blew out\" have said they are in constant fear of another flood.\nAbout 80 people were evacuated because of flooding related to mine works in January in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot.\nMany residents are months away from returning to their homes, while other said trying to get help from the Coal Authority is a \"nightmare.\"\nThe Coal Authority said it should have completed its work on site by August.\nMeanwhile, a campaign led by Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock is being launched on Thursday to ensure \"not a single victim of the awful flooding in Skewen is left out of pocket\".\nEmma Jones, 42, lives on Skewen's worst hit street, Goshen Park, where the blow out happened.\n\"It feels like an absolute living nightmare. Absolute nightmare,\" she said. \n\"I think because it was about five months ago, people have forgotten and think 'oh they must be all right now', but we're not, it's continuing.\"\nHer two daughters were rescued from the family home by firefighters while she was at work.\nInitially, she said families like hers who were made homeless overnight were offered lots of support, but feels things have changed.\n\"We did have a lot of help,\" said Mrs Jones.\n\"But it seems like that help has really faded now and people are feeling really angry because we are not being given answers, we are not being kept up to date with information of the work that's going on by our houses.\"\nAsked whether she feels the Coal Authority are helping enough, she said: \"Absolutely not.\"\n\"It would just be nice to know what their plan is for today, tomorrow, next week. Up-to-date information, that's what we would really like to have.\"\nMrs Jones said there is constant anxiety that homes could flood again due to the damage done to the drainage system in the area.\n\"When there's heavy rain there's a lot of standing water around here,\" she added. \n\"Water is managing to get back into people's houses, not a great deal but still, once your house is dry you don't want to see more water getting in, and the thought of it happening again is giving everybody great anxiety.\"\nBBC Wales understands the Coal Authority has had to buy at least one home in order to install a new water management system.\nNatasha and Karl Jones live with their two children at the bottom of Goshen Park. Mrs Jones, her daughter and the family cat were also rescued by the fire service. \nThe incident has left her seven-year-old \"traumatised\" and having to \"go through counselling\".\nAlthough they've recently returned home, the scars remain.\n\"It's been awful,\" she said. \"Obviously we're living in a building site at the moment because everyone is having so much work done, and we understand that, but every bang you hear you think 'oh my gosh has it happened again?'\n\"When you hear running water, you think 'has the water come back? It is unsettling.\"\nThe family is one of many locked in a battle with their insurance companies and the Coal Authority.\nThe Authority is not accepting liability for the damage caused by the flood and its \u00a3500 offer to reinstate ruined gardens was branded \"disgusting\". It has since increased the offer to \u00a32,000 but that has been described as \"not on\".\n\"People just want to go back home,\" Mrs Jones added. \"They just want their homes to be as they were, and why should we be fighting and trying to chase around everyone, just trying to get everything as was?\"\n\"It's just like living through hell, for us and our neighbours, it's a daily battle trying to get everything sorted. Nothing is easy.\"\nResidents also fear the drainage system is so badly damaged there could be another flood.\nTheresa Dalling's bungalow on Dynevor Road escaped the water by inches.\nBut since January, water has been seeping through the retaining wall next to her drive, and a large volume of water is constantly gushing through the drain in her back garden, even during dry weather.\n\"We don't know where it's coming from, we've had no answers,\" she said. \nthey don't know where it's coming from. Welsh Water say it's not theirs, the Coal Authority say it's not theirs, well who's is it then?\" \n\"It wasn't there before. In the 22 years that we've had this bungalow we've never had water on the drive. Where's it coming from?\"\nShe added her mental health, with which she was already suffering, has deteriorated badly.\nThe Coal Authority said its \"sympathy remains\" with those affected by the flooding on 21 January.\n\"Whilst the Coal Authority are not liable for the flooding we recognise that it has had a significant impact on many homes and developed the Skewen support policy to offer whatever practical help and support we can within the bounds of the legislation and guidance we have to operate within,\" a spokesman said.\n\"We have just completed a general clean-up of garden areas and our teams are now scheduling outdoor remediation works with each resident as we agree the full schedule with them.\n\"We expect that work on site will be completed by the end of August and we have ensured that residents have access to their homes since 6 February 2021 to allow repairs to be undertaken by their insurers in as timely a fashion as possible.\""

      "tags": "New York,Donald Trump,US politics,United States",
      "text": "Former US President Donald Trump has lashed out after the New York attorney general said her inquiry into the Trump Organisation was now a criminal probe.\nLetitia James, the state's top prosecutor, has been scrutinising the ex-Republican president's financial dealings before he took office.\nA spokesperson for Ms James said the inquiry into Mr Trump's property company was \"no longer purely civil\".\nMr Trump on Wednesday said she was \"in desperate search of a crime\".\nMs James' spokesman, Fabien Levy, told the BBC on Tuesday: \"We have informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the Organization is no longer purely civil in nature.\n\"We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity, along with the Manhattan DA. We have no additional comment.\"\nThe offices of the state attorney general and city district attorney are separate and, according to National Public Radio (NPR), have historically been rivals. The fact that they are now co-ordinating their efforts underscores the high profile of their investigation.\nThe two prosecutors are combing through millions of pages of financial information in a search for evidence, reports NPR.\nThe statement did not say what turned the inquiry from civil to criminal in nature, or whether the former president himself might be personally implicated in any allegations.\nMr Trump accused Ms James and District Attorney Cyrus Vance, both Democrats, of being \"possessed\" by their political vendettas against him.\nA statement from his office rebuked the investigation as \"a continuation of the greatest political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States\".\n\"After prosecutorial efforts the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, they failed to stop me in Washington, so they turned it over to New York to do their dirty work. This is what I have been going through for years,\" he wrote.\nThe former president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, condemned the inquiry as \"flagrant abuse of political office\". On Twitter, he shared an old video of Ms James promising to pursue all legal options against Mr Trump while she was still campaigning for the attorney general role.\nThe video drew fiery comments from other top Trump allies, like senior advisor Stephen Miller, who said the US system of law was being turned into \"a weapon of vengeance not an instrument of justice\". \nCivil cases usually have to do with injury to individuals or other private parties, including businesses; criminal law applies in cases where the damage is thought to affect society at large, including the state.  \nMs James launched a civil inquiry in March 2019 into claims that Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans, and understated them to lower his taxes.\nHer office has also been seeking documents on four Trump Organization properties in Manhattan, upstate New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr said in court documents last August that his office was investigating alleged \"protracted criminal conduct\" at the Trump Organization.\nMr Vance's legal filing cited newspaper articles about purported bank and insurance fraud at the company. \nThe Manhattan district attorney has also been investigating whether any of Mr Trump's financial records were doctored to cover up hush-money payments to two women in 2016 who say they had affairs with him. \nMr Vance's office said in February it had obtained Mr Trump's tax returns as part of the investigation, after a long legal battle.\nThroughout his presidency, Mr Trump resolutely refused to reveal his tax returns, despite coming under great pressure to do so.\nAllen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and members of his family have been the focus of the investigators.\nThe clock is ticking. Mr Vance leaves office in December, and he would be expected file any criminal complaint by the end of the year. \nWill Grant, BBC News, Washington DC\nThroughout his time in office, Donald Trump dismissed any probe into his financial dealings or those of his organisation as a politically-motivated \"witch hunt\" led by Democrats desperate to see him forced from power. \nYet now that he no longer enjoys protection from prosecution, this latest development will trouble him. That a former US president is facing not one but two criminal investigations is a significant development, one which could have repercussions for his political future. \nThe New York State Attorney General, Letitia James, clearly believes that there is enough at play to warrant moving the investigation from a civil to a criminal one. When combined with the ongoing examination of the former president's tax returns by the Manhattan District Attorney, Cy Vance, Mr Trump is looking at a complex and tangled legal battle ahead \u2014 one which he remains adamant he shouldn't have to face but which he now almost certainly cannot avoid.

      "tags": "Bereavement",
      "text": "The government must urgently act on its pledge to extend bereavement payments to co-habiting couples, a cross-party group of MPs has said.\nThe group wants ministers to comply within three months of court rulings that say limiting the benefits to married couples breached human rights.\nA Labour MP behind the move said current rules \"punished\" the children of unmarried parents. \nBoris Johnson vowed last year to \"remedy\" the \"injustice\". \nCampaigners said around 2,000 co-habiting families a year lose out on the payments, made to individuals whose husband, wife or civil partner has died.\nMinisters pledged in July last year to extend the payments to cover co-habiting couples with children, but are yet to bring forward proposals.\nThe Department of Work and Pensions said it was \"carefully considering\" how to implement the change.  \nBereavement Support Payment is a benefit paid to families for 18 months if a husband, wife or civil partner dies - but unmarried partners are ineligible. \nIt is awarded at different levels according to individual circumstances, but can rise to almost \u00a310,000 if a couple receives child benefit.\nIn February 2020, the High Court found denying co-habiting parents the payments was against their human rights. \nIt followed a similar judgment at the Supreme Court in 2018.\nMPs and child poverty campaigners have been lobbying ministers since then to update the legislation to reflect the ruling. \nSuch a law was not included in last week's Queen's Speech - when the government set out its legislative programme for the coming year. \nOn Wednesday, a group of 54 MPs signed a symbolic amendment to the programme, calling on ministers to \"fully remedy\" the situation by complying with the rulings within three months. \nIt was later defeated by 366 votes to 265.\nOne of the MPs to sign the amendment, Labour's Stella Creasy, said it would support \"some of the most vulnerable people in our communities\".\nShe added that figures from the Child Bereavement Network showed \"every 22 minutes in this country, a child loses a mother or a father\" and risked losing their home or their family circumstances as a result. \nMs Creasy said: \"It's estimated 2,000 families a year who find themselves in that horrific situation - many more who will have done because of Covid - are then not eligible for financial support.\n\"The reason they are not eligible is something very simple. Because the state has decided that because their parents are not married those children must be pushed in to poverty.\"\nShe added: \"The government knows it has to remedy this situation, because otherwise we are punishing children for the decisions that their parents have made.\"\nA spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said it was committed to extending the payments to co-habiting couples, adding: \"We understand how vital this support is to families.\n\"We are carefully considering the detail and implementation which we will outline in due course.\""

      "tags": "Spain,Morocco,Migration",
      "text": "Spain has deployed troops after record numbers of migrants entered its north African enclave of Ceuta from Morocco.\nSome 8,000 people have reached Ceuta in two days, Spanish officials say.\nThey say the migrants - who include about 1,500 minors - either swam around the border fences that jut out into the sea or walked across at low tide.\nSpain's Prime Minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez has vowed to restore order. Spain says around half of the migrants have been sent back to Morocco.\nBy Tuesday evening, footage of the beach showed that nearly all migrants had been cleared.\nMr S\u00e1nchez travelled to Ceuta and Melilla to deal with the crisis, which exacerbated diplomatic tensions with Morocco.\nMorocco withdrew its ambassador for consultations after Spain's foreign minister told the envoy of her \"disgust\" at what had happened.\nMost of the migrants are said to be from Morocco. The Spanish troops have been deployed to the beach to help border police at Ceuta's main entry point - Tarajal, on the enclave's south side. \nDramatic scenes were captured offshore as families waded through the water and officers from Spain's Guardia Civil went into the sea to rescue young children.\nInterior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said 200 troops, plus 200 extra police were going to assist Ceuta's normal 1,100-strong border force. The enclave has some 80,000 residents. \nBy evening reports said the number of people trying to enter by sea had decreased. Some migrants were voluntarily returning to Morocco while others could be seen being carried away by soldiers. \nSpain's Ceuta and Melilla enclaves have become magnets for African migrants trying to reach Europe.\nAlso on Tuesday, Moroccan security forces at Fnideq, the adjacent town to Ceuta, fired tear gas to disperse a large crowd of migrants at the border fence, AFP news agency reported. \nMr S\u00e1nchez has received support from senior EU officials, with European Council President Charles Michel tweeting: \"Spain's borders are the European Union's borders.\"\nEU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson described the number of arrivals in Ceuta as \"unprecedented\" and \"worrying\", noting that \"a big number of them [are] children\".\nAt the other enclave, Melilla, 86 sub-Saharan Africans entered on Tuesday via its southern jetty.\nMelilla has a formidable border fence, and several hundred more migrants were blocked by security forces, Spain's Efe news agency reports.\nSpanish officials quoted by Efe said Moroccan guards had helped the Spanish forces in Melilla. \nSpanish media said it was different in Ceuta, where Moroccan border guards stood by and watched as migrants took to the sea to try to reach the enclave.\nMost of the migrants were said to be young men, but there were also several families. Many had used inflatable rings and rubber dinghies. \nThey started arriving in Ceuta in the early hours of Monday. At least one died during the crossing.\nLast month, more than 100 migrants arrived at Ceuta's Tarajal entry point. Most were sent back, except about 30 minors whose ages were confirmed by medical tests.\nSince the 17th Century Ceuta and Melilla have been under Spanish rule, though they are long claimed by Morocco. They have semi-autonomous status, like some regions of mainland Spain.\nThe influx comes amid renewed tension over Western Sahara, a territory occupied by Spain until 1975, when Morocco annexed it. Since then it has been disputed between Morocco and the indigenous Sahrawi people, led by the Polisario Front.\nIn April, Spain allowed Sahrawi leader Brahim Ghali, 73, to be treated in hospital for Covid-19, reportedly in Logro\u00f1o. He leads the Polisario Front, fighting for Western Saharan sovereignty against the claims of Morocco. The Moroccan government responded angrily and warned Spain that harbouring Mr Ghali would bring \"consequences\".\nSpanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez said she was not aware of Morocco using the border issue to exert political pressure. But many see Monday's events, when Moroccan border guards appeared not to stop migrants from crossing, as evidence of a reprisal.\nSuch difficulties are likely to complicate the two neighbours' normally tight co-operation on the migrant issue. However, Spain says it has already repatriated about half of the migrants, following talks with Morocco. \nThe vast majority of those who reached Ceuta were Moroccan. Local police have clamped down on sub-Saharan migrants in northern Morocco in recent years, meaning they have sought other routes to Spain, such as across the Atlantic to the Canary Islands.\nThe EU border force Frontex reports that illegal migration to Spain's Canary Islands - off the Moroccan coast - has surged this year.\nHowever, the overall number of undocumented migrants reaching Europe so far this year remains far below the levels seen in 2015-2016.\nRead more on migrants reaching Spain:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is \"nothing conclusive\" in the data that means England \"would have to deviate from the roadmap\" out of lockdown, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe government plans to end remaining legal limits on social contact from 21 June, but there is increasing concern about the Indian variant.\nThe situation, including data from hotspots such as Bolton, was \"under close review\", the prime minister said.\nMinisters will \"let people know in a few days' time\" after data is studied.\nSpeaking on a visit to a vaccination centre in London, Mr Johnson continued to urge people to be cautious.\nHe said the situation with the Indian variant was \"under very careful, close review\", saying: \"We're looking at all the data as it comes in from places like Bolton, Blackburn, Bedford, Sefton.\"\nMr Johnson said they were trying to understand if the Indian variant was more transmissible and \"to what extent our vaccine programme has sufficiently fortified us\".\n\"We've got a few more days of looking at that data,\" he said.\nIt comes as the UK recorded another seven deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 2,412 new cases. \nOn Monday the government said 86 local councils in England had five or more cases of the variant first discovered in India, which is thought to be more transmissible. \nIn Bolton, a new vaccine centre has opened up and ministers have been stepping up calls for people to book vaccinations as soon as they are offered appointments.\nElsewhere, regional public health directors are concerned about rising cases of the variant in London. Cases have spread across a number of boroughs, although currently most are linked to foreign travel. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said that while the government was not ruling out measures such as local lockdowns at this stage, it was \"too early to speculate\" on what future measures it may need to take.\nAsked if a decision was expected sooner than 14 June on progressing to the final step of England's roadmap, the spokesman said that in relation to certification and social distancing, ministers \"do want to update pubs and businesses, if possible, before 14 June\".\nBut he added they needed to \"allow the experts to do their work\" and \"couldn't be more specific on timings\".\nDay by day the scientists are learning more about the Indian variant - and the implications for the UK.\nOn Friday it was reported the variant could be 50% more transmissible than the UK variant, which was responsible for the deadly winter wave.\nBut confidence in that figure was always a little shaky. In the past few days there are some tentative signs its advantage over the UK variant may not be so great.\nThat's important. There's estimated to be an eight-fold difference between the impact in terms of hospital admissions a variant with a 20% advantage will have compared to one with a 50% advantage.\nThat clearly has a major implication for what restrictions are needed while the vaccination programme continues to be rolled out.\nThe next significant update is expected on Thursday. It will be too soon for a definitive answer, but it should help us understand more about what the variant means for the UK.\nRead more from Nick\nThe government has already warned its next review of social distancing rules - set to take place by the end of May - may be delayed because of concern over the variant.\nOn Monday millions of people were able to enjoy new freedoms - such as drinking indoors in pubs, hugs with loved ones and foreign holidays - for the first time in months, under the latest relaxation of rules across England, Wales and most of Scotland.\nHowever, Labour has accused the government of \"giving out conflicting and confused advice\" about travel to countries on the amber travel list, where people must quarantine for up to 10 days on their return to the UK. \nGovernment guidance states people should not travel to amber list countries. \nBut earlier Environment Secretary George Eustice suggested in a BBC interview that people could travel to such destinations if they \"feel the need\" to visit family or friends. \nAsked about the issue, Mr Johnson said it was \"very important people grasp what the amber list is - not somewhere to go on holiday\".\nHe said travellers should only go to these countries for \"pressing family or business reasons\". Those who break their self-isolation period on returning to the UK from these destinations face \u00a310,000 fines, he added. \nYvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the current traffic light system was \"very messy\" and \"clearly isn't working\", adding that it should be linked to legal restrictions. \n\"We all seem to be in a position where the government has opened up to summer holiday travel by accident, by making it possible, but at the same time, a day later, saying 'no, people should not be travelling to amber countries,'\" the Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.\nMeanwhile, Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine, has said it feels \"morally wrong\" that children in some richer countries are being offered a Covid-19 jab before some high-risk people in poorer countries.\nHe told the All Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus: \"There are many unvaccinated people in the world whilst people whose risk is extremely low are being vaccinated, including children who have near to zero the risk of severe disease or death.\n\"That inequity is absolutely plain to see at this moment in a very troubling way.\""

      "tags": "Tourism,Hospitality industry,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lee and Louise know they'll be taking their two children on holiday this summer.\nWhat they don't know is where they'll go. It might be Norfolk or it might be their preference - Fuerteventura.\nThey booked both in case Covid restrictions prevented them from going to the Canary Islands.\nAnd because they're not the only ones doing this, some UK resorts fear they could be facing a rush of cancellations.\nLow and no-deposit bookings have been offered by lots of companies this summer to allow extra flexibility because of the Covid pandemic.\nWhile that's led to record bookings for lots of UK resorts, plenty of customers have taken advantage by booking not one, but two holidays for the same time slot, knowing they'll not lose any money at all. \nI spoke to Lee and Louise under a gazebo in their garden, in the pouring rain, in Lancashire, so it's no surprise that they are holding onto a dream of basking in the sunshine.\nThey've booked time off work and are determined to get away somewhere. When they splashed out on a holiday to the Canary islands they weren't sure if travel there would be allowed, so they booked a reserve option too. \nThey're keeping both bookings and hedging their bets a little longer, in the hopes of guaranteed heat, while ensuring themselves a get-away somewhere.\nAlthough they love Cromer in Norfolk, there is no hesitation when I ask which holiday they'd rather go on. \"Fuerteventura, fingers-crossed\", says Louise.\nShe says: \"In this country it can be a bit more difficult to find things to do if the weather is not great.\"\nLee says the family all get so excited about the prospect of a holiday, that after a tough year, they are determined to make sure they have a great summer.  \n\"You start planning, you start preparing, and if that's suddenly taken away it can actually impact our mental well-being,\" explains Lee. That's why they are keeping the Norfolk booking and will decide nearer the time. \nAnd it seems Lee, Louise and their children may not be alone. \nThe peak for holiday bookings came early on in the year, before the government issued its rules on travel. Plenty of people are still hoping for some amendments before the summer holiday season begins, so some industry insiders reckon they may have doubled-booked in order to keep their options open. \nAvvio provides the software behind 500 of the UK's top hotels. They say bookings are very high but cancellation rates at the moment are running at just 4%, far below the usual 30% levels. \nChief commercial officer Michael De Jongh says this is because of double-bookings, although concrete evidence of the phenomenon won't kick in until later this summer, when consumers actually start cancelling UK trips in favour of European ones or vice versa. \nHe says cancellations would cause problems for hotels, in the same way as multiple restaurant bookings did during the Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Eat Out To Help Out scheme.\n\"There's a growing trend to book rooms at multiple hotels, with a view to cancelling all but one at the last minute. This causes so many problems for hotels, in the same way as multiple restaurant bookings did during Eat Out To Help Out.\n\"If someone does have to cancel,\" he says, \"I'd urge them to always give the hotel as much notice as possible or better still modify the booking to an alternative date.\"\nHipping Hall, like most venues, has kept its bookings policy as flexible as possible to allow people to book without fear of losing money.  \nIt's a small boutique hotel in Kirkby Lonsdale, part-way between the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales. It's only been able to open its doors to guests again this week, and its 15 rooms are fully booked for months to come. \nGeneral manager George Norrie says if people cancel with enough notice, the hotel should be able to fill the slot, because on some nights it even has a waiting list. \nHe thinks the bigger challenge for them is giving first-time staycation holidaymakers a brilliant experience so that they come back again next year. \n\"When our guests get here we're going to do our best to make sure they get the best experience they possibly can. Next year they might go abroad, but they might come and see us for a two-day stay as well.\"\nLee and Louise say they'll make sure they give enough notice for either of their chosen destinations to fill the slot, and the flexible booking they were given means they won't lose any money. For them it's a win-win. \nWhile a late flurry of cancellations may cause headaches for UK hoteliers, there is good news for disorganised holidaymakers. There'll be plenty of last-minute bargains for UK holidays, whatever the weather.  "

      "title": "Indian variant: Why is UK taking a risk with the variant?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A Covid variant first identified in India and spreading in parts of the UK, has threatened to derail Britain's plans for a return to normality. In allowing the latest lockdown easing, the government stands accused of recklessness. So why has it taken the risk?\nLast Thursday 39 of the country's leading scientists and health experts gathered - via video conference - to discuss the escalating situation. \nAt the Sage meeting they were presented with a paper by the government's modelling committee, that made alarming reading. \nThere was, the document said, a \"realistic possibility\" that the Indian variant was 50% more transmissible than the UK variant which had been responsible for the deadly winter wave.\nIf this was the case, the modellers said, there was the potential for a summer wave that would be even worse. It could not have been more alarming. \nOne of those present, Sir Jeremy Farrar, said they faced the \"hardest policy decision\" of the pandemic - but in the end moving ahead with the roadmap was a reasonable call considering the context.\nDig beneath the headlines and a more complex picture emerges than the 50% figure which grabbed headlines. The term \"realistic possibility\" is actually a defined phrase, one of several on a sliding scale used by these committees.\nIt means there is basically a 50:50 chance the modellers are right about the variant being as much as 50% more infectious. \nAlong with the modelling presented on Thursday, several other pieces of evidence were looked at. Public Health England (PHE) had been gathering data on what had been happening on the ground as part of the test-and-trace programme. It cast doubt on the 50% figure.\nA number of things did not add up to its analysts. \nSome of the data on \"secondary attack rates\" - the chances of an infected individual passing the virus on to someone - suggested the variant may be much less infectious than feared.\nAnd it did not seem to be behaving in the same way in every region. A significant cluster has been found in London, but that had not risen at the same speed as it had in Bolton. \nThe degree of extra transmissibility makes a big difference. A variant that is 20% more transmissible has a much smaller impact on hospital cases.\nThe sheer volume of imported cases from travellers returning from India - it was argued - could have caused a spike, and explain a big chunk of what appeared to be the extra infectiousness.\nOne of the problems in nailing how infectious a variant is, is the lag between getting a positive diagnosis from a patient and establishing which variant of the virus caused it. It takes about a week.\nSo the picture we are looking at is, in fact, out of date.\nAnother sign being analysed is the latest raw infection rates in hotspot areas - before samples are sequenced. There are now some tentative signs the rapid rises may have started slowing, offering support to the hope the 50% extra transmissibility figure is too high.\nWhat is more, some at the meeting believe the models were too pessimistic - suggesting the vaccination programme will stem the rise in infections or at least limit the scale of serious illness more than the modellers predicted.\n\"There is a huge degree of uncertainty with this - we have spotted this early and we are still trying to work out what exactly is going on with this variant,\" said one of those working on analysing it.\nNaturally with so much unknown, there was much debate both at Sage and in other meetings that took place on Friday, about how to respond. \nThe nuclear option of delaying indoor mixing, due to re-start on 17 May, was discussed. Doing so could buy more time to study the emerging data on the Indian variant, while allowing for more vaccine rollout. \nBut the government was already committed - it had been confirmed last Monday - and so it was ruled out, although in Scotland extra restrictions have stayed in place in Glasgow and Moray. \n\"It was agonising. There was just not enough evidence there to justify the move,\" said one of the people close to the decision-making. \"But keeping restrictions comes with a cost too.\"\nThere have been plenty of experts questioning whether Monday's unlocking was worth the risk, including members of Independent Sage and the British Medical Association.\nBut it is worth noting that these are the same critics who warned against the full re-opening of schools in March, saying it would lead to a surge. They also said the January lockdown was not tough enough to bring cases of the UK variant down and objected to delaying the gap between vaccine doses to 12 weeks with the BMA calling for the gap to halved.\n\"We know if it goes wrong the critics will say 'we told you so'. But... those people criticising now have been wrong before,\" another of those involved in the meetings last week said. \nThat, of course, is the price that comes with power - and if cases and, crucially, hospitalisations do take off it will look like a mistake. \nBut this is unlikely to be the last time the UK is faced with such a situation. \nMuch has been made, understandably, of the decision not to put India on the red list sooner. But this is not just a UK problem - the Indian variant has been found in 50 countries across the world, including Australia. \nYes, the UK has identified the most cases after India, but it does do nearly half the world's genomic sequencing. Another of the scientists who took part in the Sage meeting last week, Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has said the spread of the variant could not have been stopped, only delayed \"a little bit\".\nProf Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases, at Edinburgh University, agrees. \"This situation was entirely expected. In six months time I'm sure we will be talking about another variant,\" he says.\nHe is more worried about the South Africa variant given it seems more able to escape some of the effect of the vaccines - although the evidence is pointing to a rather more limited escape than was originally feared.\nVariants, unfortunately, will be a fact of life in this pandemic until the virus is brought under control across the world. But that does not mean there is no way out or that the UK, with its progress with vaccination, cannot keep moving towards a more normal way of life."

      "tags": "Social mobility,Social class,Accents,Civil Service",
      "text": "Top Whitehall civil servants are even posher today than in the 1960s, says the Social Mobility Commission (SMC). \nHidden rules favour those with the \"right accent\", a report - Navigating the Labyrinth - claims. \nAlmost three-quarters (72%) of those in senior posts are from privileged homes, up from two-thirds (67%) in 1967.\nThe survey of more than 300,000 civil servants found a \"behavioural code\" that makes it harder for people from working-class homes to get promoted. \nOnly 18% of senior civil servants are from a low socio-economic background, says the SMC, the body appointed by government to advise on social mobility, \nMost of the 445,000 civil servants are employed by government departments.\nJobs range from administrative and operational roles such as prison officers and tax collectors, up to permanent secretaries, the most senior grade, who work with ministers to run their departments.  \nAmong those top Whitehall mandarins, 59% attended a private school - three times the rate among the wider population.\nThe permanent secretary at the Department for Transport who leads on social mobility, Bernadette Kelly, has welcomed the report.  \n\"It chimes with much of my experience in talking to colleagues right across the civil service, and at all grades, about social mobility,\" she says.\n\"The sense that there is a hidden route to the top that those from more privileged backgrounds find easier to navigate.\"\nThose from advantaged backgrounds are defined as having parents in professional or managerial occupations. \nThe parents of those defined as coming from disadvantaged backgrounds had either never worked, or had jobs such as drivers, cleaners, receptionists or mechanics. \nThere is a culture that favours polish over performance, creating a \"class ceiling\" that prevents people from poorer backgrounds getting the top jobs, the report finds.\nOne civil servant told researchers how senior staff would sometimes break into Latin.  \n\"I know that is a bit of a stereotype, but it is so real,\" Kristine says. \n\"You'll be in a ministerial meeting and they'll sort of talk in Latin, but they're making what you'll realise later is a sort of joke about Brussels that everyone sort of understands, and laughs.\"  \nThe report identifies how \"cosy fireside chats\" conducted in a neutral received pronunciation accent help those with the right background navigate the \"velvet drainpipe\" of recruitment. \n\"There is a definite style of speaking,\" one interviewee tells researchers in the report. \nAnother civil servant says people with working-class accents tend to fare less well: \"I used to put on a bit of an accent or try to enunciate a little bit better,\" Pauline says. \"Ridiculous and humiliating, when I look back on it.\"\nThe report finds those from advantaged backgrounds are much more likely to work in policy jobs in Whitehall, benefiting from \"the propulsive power of being in London\". \nTwo-thirds of civil servants in the capital come from privileged backgrounds, compared with 41% in north-east England.  \nThe government has plans to reform the civil service, initiated by the prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings, but this has been delayed by the pandemic. \nMr Cummings said he wanted to encourage \"weirdos and misfits with odd skills\" to work in government.\nOne ambition is to move more officials out of London, but the Social Mobility Commission warns the proposal to relocate 22,000 civil servants away from the capital risks increasing the concentration of civil servants from advantaged backgrounds still further. \n\"The civil service should be a role model for fair recruitment and career progression,\" says the report. \nThe authors accept that the civil service is acutely aware it needs to do better, and has made progress on diversity and inclusion.   \nHowever, getting in is not enough and more action is needed to nurture career progression, the report says. \n\"When I get feedback, one of the things [staff from disadvantaged backgrounds] raise is the degree to which the conversation is all about politics and about people on Twitter that everyone's following,\" civil servant Alistair tells the researchers.  \n\"You know, the majority of the country are not reading these tweets. Probably the entire audience for this tweet that we're discussing at the moment is in this room!\" "

      "text": "Charles Grodin, an American actor whose comic roles in films such as Midnight Run and Beethoven brought smiles to faces for decades, has died at 86.\nGrodin died at his home in Wilton, Connecticut on Tuesday, the New York Times newspaper reported.\nThe actor's son, Nicholas, told the newspaper his cause of death was bone marrow cancer.\nKnown for his dry wit, Grodin was a familiar face in Hollywood comedies and prime-time talk shows in the US.\nTributes have been made on social media, including a tweet from fellow American actor Steve Martin, who described Grodin as \"one of the funniest people I ever met\".\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Grodin dropped his studies at the University of Miami to launch a career in acting. \nIt was a decision that paid off in the 1960s, when he started to land parts in plays on Broadway, including his debut in a production of Tchin-Tchin, which starred Anthony Quinn. \nHe soon moved to TV and film, building his profile with a small role in Rosemary's Baby, a 1968 psychological horror film written and directed by Roman Polanski.\nBut the 1970s was the decade Grodin's career really took off. A series of roles in films including Catch-22 in 1970 and The Heartbreak Kid in 1972 cemented his status as one of Hollywood's go-to comedy actors.\nFor his role in The Heartbreak Kid - in which he plays an unlucky-in-love sporting goods salesman - he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best actor.\nThe fact he didn't win the award may not have bothered him too much.\n\"I never complain about anything, because I'm aware of what's going on around me, and I'm also aware that there are a lot of very gifted people that never even get a job in show business,\" Grodin told the AV Club website in a 2009 interview. \"It's just because they can't handle the rejection, and I can handle it, and I'm used to it.\"\nGrodin had his share of success as well. He won best actor at the 1988 Valladolid International Film Festival for his role in Midnight Run. In that film, a 1988 action-comedy, he co-starred with Robert De Niro as an accountant who embezzled millions from a mob boss.\nGrodin also won an Emmy as a co-writer on a 1977 Paul Simon TV special, hosted his own 1990s chat show, and was a regular fixture on shows hosted by Johnny Carson, David Letterman and Jay Leno.\nOne of Grodin's most well-known roles was in the popular family film Beethoven in 1992. He plays a short-tempered dad who, to his fury, is bedevilled by a slobbering, accident-prone dog."

      "text": "Rail passengers have been promised a better and more efficient service under the biggest shake-up in decades.\nA new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would replace an \"overcomplicated and fragmented\" system.\nHe told the BBC the changes did not mean fares would inevitably rise, but could not give guarantees.\nAsked on Today if the changes meant rising ticket prices, Mr Shapps said: \"No, is the answer\". But he added: \"I'm not here to give guarantees for years to come.\"\nLabour said there was \"little substance\" behind the plans. \nThe government says a more unified rail system will lead to more \"high-quality, consistent services\" from 2023 onwards, plus better connections. \nThere will also be changes to make travel smoother, including:\nThe flexible season tickets will offer savings on certain routes for people who do not travel to work every day, reflecting the expected changes to commuting patterns after the pandemic.\nThey are due to go on sale on 21 June for use seven days later, and will allow passengers to travel on any eight days in a 28-day period. \nDarshita Rajani, who lives in Wellingborough but works in London, welcomes the idea of a flexible season ticket. \nCurrently a season ticket for her journey costs just under \u00a38,000. But she will only be doing three days a week when she goes back to the office so that would be prohibitively expensive.\n\"If things don't change I will still have to buy a season ticket, which is a waste of money, but a day ticket costs \u00a3116,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"It's insane how much they charge for a 50-minute train journey. I hope there will be two-days-a-week, three-days-a-week flexi tickets.\"\nThe reforms follow the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018 and years of complaints about the \"fragmented\" franchising system, which has been scrapped.\nGBR will replace the current track operator, Network Rail, in 2023 and the government says the new system will look more like Transport for London, with multiple operators under one brand.\nThe systems will differ slightly in Scotland and Wales, where transport is devolved, but GBR will still operate in those nations.\nThe Department for Transport said in Scotland and Wales will continue to exercise their current powers and be accountable for them, but the government will explore options to ensure all nations benefit from the reforms.\nGBR will continue to own the infrastructure in Scotland and Wales (other than some of the South Wales Valley Lines), as Network Rail does now.\nRail in Northern Ireland is devolved and not linked to the wider UK network. \nMr Shapps said the ultimate aim was to create \"one guiding mind\" overseeing the UK rail system, so there was there is more accountability when things went wrong.\nMost rail services will still be run by the private sector, but under new \"passenger contracts\" they will be expected to meet targets on punctuality and efficiency for the first time.\nKeith Williams, the former boss of British Airways who led the review into the reforms, told the BBC's Today programme: \"What we've done here is listen to what customers want out of rail and react to that.\n\"And that really is a more reliable punctual service and better opportunities [when] buying tickets. \n\"There is an enormous opportunity here not only to simplify the way that people buy tickets, but also to benefit from a retail environment which gives greater flexibility in the way that fares are operated in the future.\"\nMr Shapps, who also worked on the review, said the the new reforms would give the railways \"solid and stable foundations for the future\" after \"years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication.\"\nOn possible fare rises, he pointed out that the taxpayer had plugged a \u00a312bn hole during the coronavirus crisis to keep the railways operating and fares were subsidised. \nBut he said there was no \"hidden agenda\". \n\"Of course any government in the future will have to weigh those things up,\" he said. \nIf the plan is followed through and properly implemented, it should see an end to the squabbling over who is to blame when the trains are late, dirty or overcrowded. Everything will be the problem of a single body.\nThat concentration of power will also be a potential Achilles' heel. One of the successes of the privatisation was the freedom for train companies to do new things - a freedom that was a partial factor in the remarkable revival in passenger numbers in the past two decades. \nIf that spirit of innovation is lost - and if civil servants and politicians endlessly interfere in the working of the new authority - the railways risk sliding into stagnation. \nThe fear among railway executives is that the Treasury, having had to pay dearly to support services during the pandemic, will seek to claw back spending, leading to cuts in services. \nAnthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said passengers would welcome a move \"towards a more accountable and joined-up railway\".\n\"Ultimately what they will care about is whether rail is the best option for them, if it is reliable, efficient and good value,\" he said. \nBut Labour's shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said the the reforms were unlikely to work. \n\"With fare hikes, \u00a31bn cuts to Network Rail and broken promises to communities across the country, it's yet another example of ministers talking a good game, with very little substance underneath.\"\nHenri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, welcomed the plan in principle saying the old franchise model \"was broken\".  \nBut he called for more to be done on lowering fares in the North.\n\"Although more pay-as-you-go ticketing is welcome, the lack of greater progress in fares reform means that there is less incentive for people to stop using their cars to travel around the North.\"\nMeanwhile, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the proposals could deliver \"the biggest changes in a generation\".\nDirector general Andy Bagnall said: \"Train operators called for a guiding mind and Great British Railways will help to bring the whole industry together.\n\"To deliver for passengers and freight customers, it must have the independence to hold the operators of both tracks and trains to account equally. Crucially, it needs to allow operators to put their customers at the absolute forefront of decision-making,\" he added.\nThe publication of the plan comes eight months after the government scrapped the system of rail franchising, which had been in force since privatisation, and unveiled plans to extend support for train firms.\nAfter a drop in passenger numbers during the pandemic as more people worked from home, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Gaza,West Bank",
      "text": "Israel's nine-day bombardment of Gaza has \"set Hamas back by many years\", Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said.\nIsrael and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza again exchanged fire overnight into the early hours of Wednesday.\nDiplomatic efforts to end the violence have met with little success. \nFrance has filed a draft resolution with the UN Security Council, in co-ordination with Egypt and Jordan, calling for a ceasefire.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Israel briefly opened a border crossing into Gaza to allow a convoy of aid to enter. However, the crossing was closed again after it came under fire from Palestinian mortars and rockets. \nHamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, had been dealt \"unexpected blows\" and operations would \"continue for as long as it takes to restore calm\" for all Israeli citizens, he said.  \nAt least 215 people, including almost 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its health ministry.\nIn Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says.\nOn Tuesday Israel said at least 150 militants were among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters.\nIsrael estimated that at the start of the conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main groups in Gaza, had an arsenal of about 12,000 rockets or mortars.\nAs of 15:00 GMT on Tuesday, militants had fired some 3,300 rockets at Israel, of which 450 to 500 fell short, causing casualties in Gaza, an Israeli military spokesman said. \nSirens sounded in southern and central Israel in response to the latest barrage of Palestinian rockets.  \nIsraeli aircraft carried out dozens of raids, many of them on the city of Khan Younis.\nTwo Palestinian militants were killed in an Israeli air raid targeting an apartment in a building in central Gaza City on Wednesday morning, the BBC's Rushdi Abualouf reports.\nMany Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem took part in a general strike to protest at the  bombing of Gaza. Areas inside Israel with an Israeli Arab majority, such as Haifa, also joined the strike. \nPublic services, schools and many businesses were closed. \nThere were clashes in several locations. In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli police said they were fired on during a \"violent riot\" and returned fire. \nThree Palestinians in the area were killed, the health ministry said. Another Palestinian was killed after he attempted to attack soldiers in Hebron, the Israeli army said. \nEarlier on Tuesday, Israel opened the Kerem Shalom crossing to allow aid into Gaza, but closed it again after Palestinian militants fired mortars at the area. \nTwo Thai nationals working on a farm 14km (nine miles) from the border were killed. \nMeanwhile at the Rafah crossing with Egypt, the only entry point to Gaza not controlled by Israel, a convoy of 15 lorries carrying fuel and 18 loaded with food and medicine entered the territory. \nThe UN humanitarian agency Ocha said 52,000 people in Gaza had been displaced, of whom 47,000 had fled to UN schools. \nIn New York, the latest meeting of the UN Security Council again failed to reach agreement on a response.\nFrance said its draft resolution was compiled during a video-conference with Egypt's leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan's King Abdullah II.\nThe US has blocked previous attempts to issue a joint Security Council statement calling for an immediate ceasefire.\nThe US, the EU and other powers have called for an end to the conflict. Egypt has been seeking to mediate between Israel and Hamas. \nHowever, Israel has said it will continue its offensive for now, in an effort to destroy the capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. \nThe Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the Security Council's failure to express a unified position \"shameful\".\nMeanwhile, the US has accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of making \"anti-Semitic\" remarks about Israel. \nHe accused Israel of \"terrorism\" against the Palestinians and recently said: \"It is in their nature\". He then called Israel \"murderers\" and used terminology widely seen as promoting anti-Semitic stereotypes.  \n\"The United States strongly condemns President Erdogan's recent anti-Semitic comments regarding the Jewish people and finds them reprehensible,\" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.\n\"We urge President Erdogan and other Turkish leaders to refrain from incendiary remarks, which could incite further violence,\" he said.\nThe fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. \nThe site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded.\nPalestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since mid-April.\nIt was further fuelled by Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day.\nThe fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. \nPalestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own."

      "tags": "Home Office,Metropolitan Police Service,Priti Patel,Sydenham,Daniel Morgan",
      "text": "The family of Daniel Morgan has criticised a Home Office decision to review a report into his unsolved murder before it can be made public.\nThe private investigator was killed with an axe in a pub car park in south London in 1987.\nThe panel investigating the case was due to publish its report on Monday, but government lawyers will now examine it first, due to \"national security\".\nMr Morgan's family called the delay \"an outrage\" and a \"kick in the teeth\".\nThe panel chairperson, Baroness O'Loan, said the Home Office review was \"unnecessary and not consistent with the panel's independence\". \nA Home Office spokesperson said the home secretary had a duty to ensure the report complied with \"human rights and national security considerations\".\n\"This has nothing to do with the independence of the report and the Home Office is not seeking to make edits to it,\" the spokesperson added.\nMr Morgan, from Monmouthshire, was found dead in Sydenham in March 1987.\nHis family has always maintained he was on the cusp of exposing police corruption.\nAlthough he had not been stripped of his valuables, notes he was earlier seen writing in the pub had been ripped from his trouser pocket.\nThere have been five separate failed investigations into Mr Morgan's murder - all plagued by allegations of police corruption and links between police, private investigators and tabloid journalists.\nIn 2011 a trial was abandoned, and two years later the government commissioned an inquiry into the murder.\nThen Home Secretary Theresa May, who set up the inquiry panel, described Mr Morgan's death as \"one of the country's most notorious unsolved murders\".\nThe panel's remit was to \"shine a light on the circumstances of Daniel Morgan's murder, its background and the handling of the case over the whole period since March 1987\".\nMr Morgan's family criticised Home Secretary Priti Patel's \"unnecessary\" decision to delay publication.\nBy BBC's Home Affairs correspondent Tom Symonds\nThis report won't be able to tell us who the murderers were - but it might be able to shed light, finally, on why the case hasn't been solved.  \nFor Daniel's family, in particular his brother Alastair, that is crucial and the potential this report has to embarrass the Met Police is very real. \nThe Home Office says it has a duty to check the report will not breach anyone's human rights, or put national security at risk.\nWhat's not clear is why the government left it until the very last minute to intervene, given the impact that would inevitably have on Daniel's family.  \nIt has said it is not \"seeking\" to edit the report, but could redact it, leaving passages of black which raise new questions rather than finally settling old ones. \nThat appears to have frustrated the panel - which has a robust view of its own independence.  \nWith the end in sight, it has infuriated Daniel's family.  \nIn a statement, it said of the intervention: \"It is an outrage which betrays her ignorance - and the ignorance of those advising her - with regard to her powers in law and the panel's terms of reference.\n\"It also reveals a disturbing disregard for the public interest in safeguarding the independence of the panel and its report.\"\nThe statement added: \"For us, as the family of Daniel Morgan, the home secretary's belated and unwarranted interference in this process is simply unacceptable.\"\nThe family called on Ms Patel to \"try to understand... the need for sensitivity and basic human decency in the exercise of her powers, mindful of the unending distress she is causing to each and every member of our family\".\nThe family's lawyer Raju Bhatt said the family had \"every reason to be suspicious about the motives behind this very belated and completely unwarranted intervention\".\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added that there was \"every reason to believe that police corruption was at the heart of this ordeal the family have faced\".\nMr Morgan's brother Alastair said the family was looking to the panel to defend itself from Home Office interference.\nHe wrote on Twitter: \"We're now looking to the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel to defend their independence and fend off this unwarranted intervention from the home secretary.\n\"We're very hopeful that they will.\" \nOn Tuesday, the panel released a statement saying in the subsequent eight years there had been \"no mention\" of any need to review the report before publication. \nIt also provided details of how both national security and human rights legislation had been adhered to during the investigation.\nThe panel was originally told the home secretary would be unable to table the report in Parliament on 17 May, as planned, because of delays caused by the Duke of Edinburgh's death and local elections.\nA new date of 24 May was set, but the Home Office has said before a publication date can be agreed checks must be made.\nA spokesperson said: \"Under the terms it was commissioned in 2013, it is for the home secretary to publish the report which she hopes to do as soon as possible. \n\"The home secretary also has an obligation to make sure the report complies with human rights and national security considerations. \n\"As soon as we receive the report, we can begin those checks and agree a publication date.\"\nThe spokesperson added Ms Patel hoped to meet Mr Morgan's family to \"discuss the report and its findings in person\".

There will also be a control group, who will be given a dummy vaccine.\nEven though the study is using current vaccines, rather than vaccines which have been updated to target new variants, scientists say they expect a boost in antibodies which could be enough to protect against all circulating forms of the virus.\nDr Matthew Snape, associate professor of paediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said the study was a world-first and there would be global interest in the results.\nAnother study, called ComCov, which is testing using different doses of vaccines for the first and second doses found that mixing doses increased mild-to-moderate symptoms after vaccination.\nThe Cov-Boost study, which costs \u00a319.3 million, is being funded by the government and led by the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, as part of the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium (NISEC).

If not, better learn now that the government has screwed up again than when 'variant escapes' news breaks.\" \nHe also called for a review of contingency plans to prepare for \"more dangerous things than Covid\" in the future.\nOn a visit to a vaccination centre in London, Mr Johnson said there was \"nothing conclusive\" in the available data which might change plans to end restrictions on 21 June.\nBut information from Indian variant hotspots, including Bolton, and elsewhere was being analysed, meaning the situation would remain \"under close review\".\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said the government's \"approach to the pandemic throughout\" had been \"guided by the best scientific data\".\nThis had \"allowed us to secure early development of vaccines, allowing us to move through\" the easing of restrictions, he added.\nAsked about what Mr Cummings might tell MPs next week, the spokesman also said he would \"not speculate about what individuals may have and may or may not decide to present\".\nScotland and Wales, like England, eased Covid restrictions on Monday, while Northern Ireland is set to do so next Monday.\nThese changes will be subject to review."

      "text": "There must be a sustained focus on Northern Ireland's \"dreadful\" hospital waiting lists, a leading academic has said.\nNorthern Ireland has the worst waiting lists in the UK.\nIn April, the Department of Health estimated it could take up to 10 years to tackle the current lists.\nProf Deirdre Heenan, co-author of the Change or Collapse review of how to improve NI's health service, said a plan was needed to address the issue.\n\"I think we need to be honest with the public, to say we've lost control of this,\" she said.\nProf Heenan said she would like an assurance that there would be a dedicated full-time team putting an \"unrelenting focus\" on waiting lists.\nProf Heenan, a senior associate for the independent health think-tank Nuffield Trust in London, added that there appeared to be no accountability when health and care trusts missed their targets. \n\"I would really like to see a group of people managing a regional waiting list coming and telling the public what they're doing, setting targets, telling us what the plans are.\" \nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, she said many people in Northern Ireland had been waiting years for treatment for conditions such as hip replacements and cataract surgery.\nEileen Wilson, a  47-year-old mother of six, has been waiting for four years for a neurology appointment. \nIt is suspected she may have MS and can choke on food and has motor skill and bladder issues. \nShe said she hasn't heard from her hospital in four years.\n\"Every day is like living a battle really. I think if I had medication the symptoms would be under more control.\n\"I think to the NHS I'm just a name on a list, they don't see the people trying to live their lives.\n\"I feel my life's on hold. I have a granddaughter who's two and a half and I can't enjoy her, I just don't feel well enough.\"\nKevin McIvor, 36, suffers from scoliosis, a condition that causes the spine to curve abnormally and can crush internal organs.\nHe went to Turkey for a consultation after learning he faced \"years\" on the waiting list in Northern Ireland.\nMr McIvor is fundraising for surgery in Turkey.\n\"I received more care there [in Turkey] in that one day I was in that hospital. \n\"I was told I had three herniated discs, I was never told that before.\" \nMr McIvor said he had spent eight or nine hours in Antrim Hospital last year before being sent home. \n\"If they had picked up the severity of the scoliosis back then maybe I would be in a different place.\n\"I feel let down, the fact of the matter is that I require emergency surgery.\"\nMary Anderson, 65, is living with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia.\nShe was told she needed surgery on her ankle in June 2019, but needed a three-month review, due to her rheumatoid arthritis medication, before going onto the waiting list. \nThat review didn't happen until March 2020, and by then it was too late - a proper assessment could not be done due to the pandemic. She said she was now in \"limbo\".\n\"There's just that overwhelming sense of powerlessness. I'm stuck in constant pain,\" she said.\n\"It's very wearing in every sense.\n\"Some days I wake up and try to walk and it's very painful and other days it's not too bad but I never know day to day.\n\"It just becomes something that gnaws you down and leaves you feeling lost in the system.\"\nRoisin Curran is a 55-year-old mother of two.\nShe has been on tablets for a stomach complaint for two years, but has been advised to have a scope test to try to find the underlying problem. \nShe said she was shocked to be told she will wait at least two and a half years for the test.\n\"It would mean it would be five years since I'd been told I need to go on medication because of it. \n\" I just think it's too long to be waiting.\n\"The health service we have here, it's a disgrace.\"\nIt is not the first time we have heard from people facing long waits on waiting lists. \nPatients sound weary and demoralised. It is not just a case of their physical health, their mental health is affected as well. \nThe figures have been horrendous for a decade, if not more. We've had seven major health reports and six health ministers in that time, and very little has changed. \nIf you're told you are waiting six or seven years - what really does that mean? \nIt is a sign that the system is broken, so what are we going to do about it? \nThe pandemic has shone a light on the fact that when hospitals need to change, they can. Some of our hospitals and systems changed in a matter of weeks. Look at what happened with the Nightingale Hospital. \nUnfortunately, there doesn't seem to be the same agility, or the same desire, to change systems when it comes to other specialities across the system.\nBBC News NI asked the Department of Health to comment on the current waiting list difficulties and was referred to a ministerial statement, given by Health Minister Robin Swann, in the assembly on 13 April.\nMr Swann said he was \"absolutely determined to put this [waiting lists] right\" but described it as a \"long-term task\" that needed \"long-term, recurrent funding.\"\nHe told MLAs the pandemic had had a significant impact on \"our already appalling waiting lists\".\nIn March, the department's figures showed that almost all of NI's cancer waiting time targets were missed in the last quarter.\nIn December 2020, 792 people began treatment, 93.4% of them within 31 days, missing the 95% target.\nThere was also a breach in the target to see all urgent breast cancer referrals within 14 days.\nThe Department of Health has been asked for comment."

Two years later, Companies House issued its first notice warning of a compulsory strike-off.\nShe objected and submitted abridged accounts for 2019 last July, but a first notice was once again issued in April for the 2020 accounts filing.\nThe dissolution of Goop Inc Ltd has once again been temporarily put on hold, giving the firm more time to submit its accounts.\nShould Goop fail to do so, the firm will be struck off the register and all property and rights will belong to the Crown. \nThe lifestyle and beauty brand, reportedly worth \u00a3190m ($250m), has attracted controversy over its wellness tips and therapies that some critics call \"pseudoscience\".\nIn January, the NHS criticised Ms Paltrow's six-part Netflix series The Goop Lab, which saw doctors, researchers and alternative health practitioners investigate practices ranging from \"energy exorcisms\" to the use of psychedelic drugs in the treatment of mental-health disorders."

Of the 10 people killed in Israel, two children are among the dead, the country's medical service says.\nHere are the stories of some of the children who have been killed.\nWhen an Israeli strike hit al-Wihda street in central Gaza City early on Sunday, at least 13 members of the extended al-Kawalek family are believed to have been killed, buried in the rubble of their own home.\nMany of the victims were children, with one said to be as young as six months.\n\"We saw nothing but smoke,\" one of the surviving members of the family, Sanaa al-Kawalek, told Felesteen Online. \"I couldn't see my son next to me and I was hugging him, but I could see nothing.\"\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the bombing as \"abnormal\" and said the civilian casualties were unintended. A spokesman said air strikes had caused a tunnel to collapse, bringing houses down with it.\nAmong those killed were sisters Yara, 9, and Rula, 5. Both had been receiving treatment for trauma from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\nThe al-Kawaleks were polite girls who always did their homework on time, one of their teachers, who did not want be named, told the BBC.\nA picture circulating online is said to show 10-year-old Aziz al-Kawalek, the only surviving member of his direct family, sitting by his mother's body.\nThe youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot.\nIdo was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an \"incredibly rare\" incident.\nHis mother grabbed him and took him to the fortified room when incoming rocket sirens sounded on Wednesday evening in Sderot, the Times of Israel reports. \nRocket shrapnel pierced the protective metal plating used to cover the window of the room he was in, also injuring his mother and seven-year-old sister. He died of his injuries several hours later.\n\"It was a piece of the rocket that came in at a very specific angle, at a very specific speed and at a very specific point,\" IDF spokesman Hidai Zilberman said of the incident.\n\"We were at home and the kids were a little bored, so my wife Shani went with them to her sister's house two buildings over,\" Ido's father, Asaf Avigal, told Channel 13.\n\"I'm sorry I did not take the shrapnel in your place,\" Mr Avigal said at his son's funeral. \"A few days ago, you asked me: 'Dad, what will happen if the siren goes off while we are outdoors?' I told you that so long as you were with me you would be protected. I lied.\"\nA few months ago, Mr Avigal and his wife had spoken about what an especially bright child Ido was, as if he was a 50-year-old in the body of a five-year-old.  He would often urge his father to leave the computer and spend more time with him. \"Enough with the screens - be with me,\" he would say. \nIdo's mother remains in hospital.\nNadine Awad, a 16-year-old Arab-Israeli schoolgirl, was with her 52-year-old father in the early hours of last Wednesday, when a rocket struck their car and home, killing them both. Her mother, who was also in the car, was seriously injured, medics said.\nNadine's cousin, Ahmad Ismail, says he heard the sound of a rocket hitting from inside the family home, in the city of Lod, close to Tel Aviv, where Arab and Jewish Israelis live together.\n\"It happened so quickly,\" he told the public broadcaster Kan. \"Even if we had wanted to run somewhere, we don't have a safe room.\"\nNadine was a \"very special girl\" in her first year of high school, who dreamed of becoming a doctor, those who knew her said. \nHer school principal said she \"had dreams of changing the world\".\n\"She was such a special girl, such a talented girl. She wanted to conquer the world,\" Shirin Natur Hafi told local radio, the Times of Israel reports.\nNadine had been involved in a number of science-related and social projects with Jewish schools in the area, and she had planned to participate in a biomedical studies programme, Ms Hafi said.\nOn Friday, Muhammad al-Hadidi's four children - Suhayb, 13, Yahya, 11, Abderrahman, eight, and Osama, six - put on their finest clothes and went to visit their cousins nearby, in the Shati refugee camp outside Gaza City, to celebrate Eid, which marks the end of Ramadan.\n\"The kids put on their Eid clothes, took their toys and headed off to their uncle's house to celebrate,\" their 37-year-old father told reporters.\n\"They called in the evening to beg to stay the night and I said OK.\"\nThe next day, the building where they had been staying was hit. Only their five-month-old baby brother, Omar, survived, after being dragged from the rubble where he lay next to his dead mother.\n\"They were safe in their homes, they did not carry weapons, they did not fire rockets,\" Mr Hadidi said of his children. \"What did they do to deserve this? We're civilians.\" \nAmid the wreckage were children's toys, a Monopoly board game and, sitting on the kitchen counter, unfinished plates of food from the holiday gathering.\n\"When my children went to sleep, they were hoping that when they woke up it would all be over. But they are gone now. I have only their memory, and the scent of them in my home,\" Mr Hadidi told The Times newspaper in London.\nIbrahim al-Masry was playing with his siblings in the front yard of their home in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza last week, when a strike hit, according to reports.\nIbrahim and his brother Marwan, and several other relatives, were instantly killed.\n\"Every day in Ramadan they play in the street at this time before Iftar,\" their father, Youssef al-Masri, told The Independent.\n\"We didn't see it coming, we just heard two big explosions... Everyone was running in the street, children were bleeding, mothers were crying, blood was everywhere.\"\nTheir brother, also called Ibrahim, said they had been filling sacks of straw to sell at a local market.\n\"We were laughing and having fun, when suddenly they began to bomb us, everything around us caught fire,\" he told the AFP news agency.\n\"I saw my cousins set alight, and torn into pieces.\"\nHamza Nassar had left his home in Gaza last Wednesday evening to get some vegetables so his mother could prepare a meal to break the Ramadan fast, according to reports. He never made it home.\nIsraeli strikes started near the Abu al-Kas cemetery and killed him, Al Jazeera reported.\nHamza was a nice kid and an excellent student, his father told Al Jazeera.\nThe same strike that hit the al-Kawaleks' home also took the life of their 13-year-old neighbour, Tala Abu al-Ouf, and her 17-year-old brother Tawfik. \nTheir father, Dr Ayman Abu al-Ouf, was also killed in the attack. He was the head of internal medicine at Gaza City's al-Shifa hospital, where he was in charge of its coronavirus response. \nIn the days before the attack, Dr Abu al-Ouf had been working longer and longer hours at the hospital, family friends told the BBC.\nTala's teacher, who did not want to be named, described her as an \"excellent student\" in seventh grade.\nTala was \"interested in religious classes and she liked to read and memorise the Quran,\" the teacher told the BBC, adding that she was always ready for exams.\nShe had also been taking part in the NRC's programme to help children deal with trauma.\n\"They had already suffered a lot,\" Hozayfa Yazji, the refugee council's area field manager, told the BBC. \n\"This madness should stop... the violence should stop, in order to give these kids a future.\"\nAdditional reporting by the BBC's Ahmed Nour, Tala Halawa, Dana Doulah and Joana Saba"

      "text": "Wales has been urged to delay giving children a Covid jab and instead donate the vaccines to low-income countries. \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said on Tuesday it was likely the Welsh government would want to roll out jabs for children later this year if licences were granted. \nBut the World Health Organization (WHO) said children were very low risk unless they have underlying health conditions. \nThe Welsh government said it awaited advice from the UK advisory group.\nPfizer has had its jab authorised for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, and it is applying to do the same in the UK.\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said enough Pfizer vaccine had been bought to vaccinate all children aged over 12 and clinical studies showed the vaccine was safe and effective among 12 to 18-year-olds.\nThe WHO said it would ultimately be \"wanting to vaccinate all people in our populations\" and added it was \"good news\" vaccines were safe to use for children.\n\"But we're saying at the moment they're a very low-risk group, unless they have underlying diseases or they're vulnerable,\" WHO spokesperson Dr Margaret Harris told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"There is such a shortage of supply in the world.\n\"We are 190 million doses short of what we predicted for June - so we're saying, just wait... if you've got such surplus that you can now go to that group, look to donating doses, so that you can stop the pandemic that's just raging in so many countries.\"\n\"The most self-interested thing you could do at the moment is ensure that the whole world is getting vaccinated.\n\"We have got many countries where even the healthcare workers have not been vaccinated, and we're now seeing in a country like India, where the vaccination had only reached one to 2% of people, what that means.\n\"So we really, really need to step up the vaccination around the world.\"\nIt comes as cases of an Indian variant of Covid-19 more than doubled in under a week in Wales as Public Health Wales (PHW) urged people \"not to become complacent\".\nMore than two million people have received their first Covid vaccine in Wales.\nA children's trial for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab was launched in February, with 300 volunteers taking part.\nProf Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus that offering children in some richer countries a vaccine before high-risk people in poorer ones was \"morally wrong\".\nPlaid MP Dwyfor Meirionnydd Liz Saville Roberts, who sits on the group, told BBC Radio Wales she agreed with Prof Pollard. \n\"I do think it's morally wrong,\" she said.\n\"It's being driven in many cases and many countries in the world by political considerations.\n\"Politicians like to say that they are vaccinating people, they like to say that families will be able to hug each other\u2026 but it is morally wrong when there's nine doses for every adult in Britain compared to countries where there's nothing\u2026 \n\"Then there's the practical issue\u2026 nobody's family is safe while the virus can still lurk in corners of the world - nobody's family is safe until everyone's family is safe.\" \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said they would have to \"think through\" the advice from WHO on child vaccines.\n\"For under-18s, there is no vaccine as yet licensed, and we won't be vaccinating people under 18 until there is a licence for it\", he told the Welsh Parliament, in response to a question from Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price.\n\"That may be available in the autumn, and then we will need to weigh up the case for doing so. \n\"We've talked a lot on the floor of the Senedd in the previous term about the need to make sure that our children, teaching staff and other staff members are properly protected against the virus, and there will undoubtedly be a strong case to consider for vaccinating children from the age of 12 upwards.\n\"I've seen the WHO advice, and of course we will think that through as well.\"\nThe Welsh government also said it was \"awaiting advice from the JCVI regarding vaccination of children of secondary school age\".\n\"Vaccine supply is procured on a UK-wide basis and the UK is one of the largest donors in the in the Covax initiative which is helping to ensure a fair distribution of Covid vaccines to other countries,\" a spokesman added."

We're able to move out of this very awkward time and plan to be back in fields again and to be watching live music and camping for five days outside with 200,000 other people.\n\"That is now a possibility and it's looking highly likely that that will happen next year.\n\"So we're booking bands for that [now].

It's time.\"\nPorter made his name on Broadway, winning a Tony Award for his role in the musical Kinky Boots in 2013.\nHe won an Emmy in 2019 for playing Pray Tell, an MC on the 1980s New York ballroom scene, in Ryan Murphy's acclaimed TV drama Pose. He earned Golden Globes nominations for best TV drama actor in both 2019 and 2020.\n\"I was the generation that was supposed to know better, and it happened anyway,\" he said of contracting HIV.\n\"The shame of that time compounded with the shame that had already [accumulated] in my life silenced me, and I have lived with that shame in silence for 14 years. HIV-positive, where I come from, growing up in the Pentecostal church with a very religious family, is God's punishment.\"\nHe said he told \"everybody who needed to know\", explaining: \"I was trying to have a life and a career, and I wasn't certain I could if the wrong people knew.\n\"It would just be another way for people to discriminate against me in an already discriminatory profession. So I tried to think about it as little as I could. I tried to block it out.\"\nHe said he was making it public now because \"it's time to grow up and move on because shame is destructive - and if not dealt with, it can destroy everything in its path\".\nHe did not even tell his mother until recently, he said. \"I was embarrassed. I was ashamed. I was the statistic that everybody said I would be.\n\"So I'd made a pact with myself that I would let her die before I told her. That's what I was waiting for, if I'm being honest. When we moved her into the Actors Fund Nursing Home, I was like, 'She's not going to be here long, and then I'll write my book and come out and she won't have to live with the embarrassment of having an HIV-positive child.'\n\"That was five years ago. She ain't going anywhere.\"\nHe and his sister made a plan to visit her to break the news, but he decided to do so over the phone on the last day of filming Pose, he said.\n\"Not two minutes into the conversation, she's like, 'What's wrong?' I said, 'Nothing.' She's like, 'Son, please tell me what's wrong.'\n\"So I ripped the Band-Aid off and I told her. She said, 'You've been carrying this around for 14 years? Don't ever do this again. I'm your mother, I love you no matter what. And I know I didn't understand how to do that early on, but it's been decades now.'\n\"And it's all true. It's my own shame. Years of trauma makes a human being skittish. But the truth shall set you free. I feel my heart releasing.\"\nModern treatments mean people can live long and healthy lives with HIV. \"This is what HIV-positive looks like now,\" Porter said.\n\"I'm going to die from something else before I die from that. My T-cell levels are twice yours because of this medication.\""

      "text": "An 81-year-old man who hoped it was fourth time lucky for a Spanish holiday got all the way to the check-in desk to find he was barred from flying.\nPeople in Wales have been able to go on trips abroad to some countries since Monday after Covid rules lifted.\nHowever Garry Tate was told he could not get on his Malaga flight from Cardiff Airport as Spain's borders are shut to UK tourists.\nThe airport said travellers must check Covid rules before booking flights.\nMr Tate, who lives alone in Cardiff, said he had been \"excited\" to travel after re-booking the trip three times.\nHe said he wants people to be aware they need to check the rules in the destination country even if the UK's traffic light travel permit system indicates it is legal to travel.\n\"I'm listening every day, listening to all the news from Boris, from the Welsh government, and there was nothing at all,\" said Mr Tate.\nVueling, the airline he booked with, has been asked to comment.\nSpain remains on the UK government's amber list, which means people are strongly advised not to travel there apart from for essential reasons, but to do so is not illegal.\nHowever, all but Spanish nationals and residents have been banned from entering Spain since 22 December, after concerns about the Kent strain of Covid-19.\nMr Tate, whose wife died many years ago, said he had arrived at the airport at 07:30 BST for the 09:30 flight, and saw only six people waiting to board.\nBut it soon became clear he might not get to go on holiday when he saw the man in front of him in the queue \"arguing like mad\" with Vueling staff at the check-in desk.\nMr Tate said he had spent \u00a3680 on the apartment he was due to stay in for 16 days, about \u00a3150 for return flights and \u00a3160 for PCR tests required before and after he travelled.\nHe was also more than happy to self-isolate for 10 days after he returned. \n\"I got the test, my daughter did all the paperwork for me. They didn't want to know that,\" he said.\n\"What I found so funny is that the plane taking off to Malaga had no-one on it - I'm sure it was just the pilots and staff.\"\nMr Tate added: \"I was very excited. I just wanted to go on holiday. I'm nearly 82, I'm pretty active and I love to go away.\"\nAlthough he is hoping to travel in September, he is not sure whether he can re-book or get his money back.\nFlights with Vueling from Cardiff have been operating to Alicante since 25 March and to Malaga since 1 May, in order for people to travel for essential reasons, such as to provide care, to work, education, or for health reasons.\nWales has adopted a traffic light-system similar to that in England and Scotland, placing countries on green, amber, and red lists, depending on Covid rates, with people urged to check the rules of the country of destination before booking.\nWhile it is no longer illegal to travel abroad to go on holiday, Wales' First Minister Drakeford has said people should not jet off anywhere amid concerns about new variants of Covid.\nCardiff Airport CEO Spencer Birns said: \"Cardiff Airport has remained open throughout the pandemic to support essential flights such as cargo, maintenance flights, elite sports team travel and passenger flights to facilitate essential travel, in line with UK and Welsh Government regulations.\n\"Airlines are reviewing their flying programmes on a global basis, and we advise all customers to check with their airline or tour operator for the latest updates on their trip. \n\"We continue to advise our customers to check the relevant government guidance on travelling to and from Wales, and to also check the restrictions of the country that they are travelling to.\"\nMr Birns said further information can be found on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office website, on the airport's website and on the websites of airlines and tour operators.\nMr Drakeford admitted his advice against foreign travel was not a rule because it would be \"unenforceable\", with many people from Wales flying from Manchester, Bristol and London airports.\nBut he urged caution against \"importing\" coronavirus from other parts of the world, and stressed people should \"think of their own safety and the safety of others\".\nThousands of Wales football fans are hoping to watch their team in the Euros next month as Wales play Switzerland and Turkey in Baku before facing Italy in Rome.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people not to travel to amber list countries on holiday.\nDespite it now being legal to travel for leisure to countries on the amber list, official advice is to only to do so for essential reasons like work and or caring for a relative.\n\"If people do go to an amber list country, they absolutely have to for some pressing family or urgent business reason, then please bear in mind that you will have to self-isolate, you'll have to take tests and do your passenger locator form and all the rest of it,\" Mr Johnson said."

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people should not be holidaying in amber list countries, after a minister said people could go and visit friends.\nThe confusion arose after Environment Secretary George Eustice said people could go to those countries if they quarantined when they returned.\nIt comes after news that some holiday companies are refusing refunds to such destinations.\nThat is because it is now legal to travel to countries on the amber list.\nMr Johnson said: \"I think it's very important for people to grasp what an amber list country is: it is not somewhere where you should be going on holiday, let me be very clear about that.\n\"And if people do go to an amber list country, they absolutely have to for some pressing family or urgent business reason, then please bear in mind that you will have to self-isolate, you'll have to take tests and do your passenger locator form and all the rest of it.\"\nThe warning came amid reports that thousands of people had headed for destinations such as France, Greece, Spain and the US, with more than 150 flights reported to have departed on Monday.\nMeanwhile the European Union is expected to relax its travel rules for British holidaymakers. \nEU ambassadors are meeting on Wednesday to discuss whether to allow people who have been fully vaccinated to visit countries in the bloc without any restrictions. \nThey are also considering whether or not to lift the current ban on non-essential travel from the UK to Europe. \nAfter the legal ban on foreign holidays ended on Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said that people could go to those countries if they quarantined when they returned.\n\"We don't want to stop travel altogether and the reason, as [Health Secretary] Matt Hancock set out, that we have the amber list is there will be reasons why people feel they need to travel, either to visit family or indeed to visit friends,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\n\"They can travel to those countries but they then have to observe quarantine when they return and have two tests after returning.\n\"So people can travel to those areas, yes, but they will then have to subject themselves to the quarantine requirements on return.\"\nBut the prime minister's spokesman insisted travel to amber list destinations was only allowed for a strictly limited number of reasons.\nHe said people should not be going to those countries for holidays or leisure.\n\"The position remains that people should not travel to amber list countries and that is to protect public health,\" the spokesman said.\n\"There are some limited reasons why it might be acceptable to travel - for work purposes, protecting essential services or compassionate reasons such as a funeral or care of a family member - but otherwise people should not be travelling to these countries.\"\nHe said holidays and leisure travel should be restricted to the short \"green list\" of destinations such as Portugal.\n\"We are working with the travel industry and others on this. All of us have a personal responsibility to protect one another as we cautiously reopen international travel,\" the spokesman said.\n\"We are moving to a situation where the public can take responsibility for their actions. I think it is important to stress that, by and large, that is what we are seeing.\n\"Obviously we will keep this under review, we are keeping a careful eye on this and we will take further action if necessary.\"\nA health minister, Lord Bethell, advised people not to take a foreign holiday this year. \nAsked about reports that passengers at Heathrow had been forced to stand next to people arriving from red list countries, the minister told the House of Lords that \"segregation is unbelievably difficult during travel\". \nAnd he said that was why travelling was dangerous.\nHe told peers: \"The ultimate sanction here is that, particularly as we go into the summer, we tell people: travelling is not for this year. Please stay in this country.\"\nChief executive of Airlines UK Tim Alderslade accused the government of causing confusion. \n\"People should not travel to red countries, we know that, but to generalise against perfectly legal travel even to green countries is deeply unhelpful,\" he said. \nThe government's traffic light system is guidance rather than a legal requirement, and some travel companies have opted to still offer holidays to amber destinations so long as the Foreign Office has not advised against all but essential travel there.\nThat means some travel companies are refusing refunds for holidays booked last year for summer 2021, or that were moved from 2020 by tour operators - or even to defer the bookings.\nThe UK's largest tour operator, Tui, is currently offering holidays to amber countries such as Cuba, Barbados and Antigua and to some Greek and Spanish islands.\nThe company is offering customers free changes to holiday bookings if they don't want to travel, but they will be required to pay any price difference for the new dates, which can be more expensive because demand is high.\nFlying to an amber list country for a holiday isn't illegal - but it remains deeply frowned upon.\nUntil Monday, travelling without good reason was illegal - and you could be fined a great deal of money for doing it.\nNow, although you're technically allowed to travel, the government doesn't want you to - unless you go to a green list country.\nIf you find all this confusing, you're not alone, and reports suggest there are plenty of people for whom \"not illegal\" is a big green light for a holiday in France, Greece or the US.\nWith some travel companies refusing to refund would-be holidaymakers who pre-booked trips to countries which are now on the amber list, it's clear that in many cases there's a powerful incentive to disregard official advice.\nBut passengers should be clear about what they're letting themselves in for: mandatory self-isolation on their return, with possible fines if they don't; and the risk that if anything goes wrong, their insurance might not pay out."

      "text": "The price of Bitcoin fell below $34,000 (\u00a324,030) for the first time in three months on Wednesday, after China imposed fresh curbs on crypto-currencies.\nBeijing banned banks and payment firms from providing services related to crypto-currency transactions.\nIt also warned investors against speculative crypto trading on Tuesday.\nIt follows falls in Bitcoin of more than 10% last week after Tesla said it would no longer accept the currency.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin recovered some ground, although it was still down -10.4% at $38,131.\nMeanwhile, other digital currencies such as Ether, which acts as the fuel for the Ethereum blockchain network, and Dogecoin lost as much as 22% and 24% respectively.\nAt the same time, Tesla shares fell more than 3% on Wall Street, possibly because of the electric carmaker's exposure to Bitcoin.\nThe firm, owned by Elon Musk, still holds around $1.5bn worth of the crypto-currency.\nCrypto-currency trading has been illegal in China since 2019 in order to curb money-laundering. But people are still able to trade in currencies such as Bitcoin online, which has concerned Beijing. \nOn Tuesday, three state-backed organisations, including the National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association and the Payment and Clearing Association of China issued a warning on social media.\nThey said consumers would have no protection if they were to incur any losses from crypto-currency investment transactions.\nThey added that recent wild swings in crypto-currency prices \"seriously violate people's asset safety\" and are disrupting the \"normal economic and financial order\".\nNeil Wilson of Markets.com said: \"China has for some time been putting pressure on the crypto space, but this marks an intensification - other countries might follow now as central banks make strides towards their own digital currencies.\n\"Until now, Western regulators have been pretty relaxed about Bitcoin, but this might change soon.\"\nIn March, Tesla boss Elon Musk announced unexpectedly that the electric carmaker would allow customers to buy cars using Bitcoin.\nBut last week, he did a U-turn and suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin because of environmental concerns.\nHis fears centre on Bitcoin mining - the energy-intensive process through which the digital currency is generated, using high-powered computers. It often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal.\n\"We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,\" Mr Musk wrote.\n\"Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.\"\nHe said the electric carmaker did not intend to sell any of its Bitcoin and intended to reinstate crypto-currency transactions once mining shifted to using more sustainable energy sources.\nAlthough the digital currency cannot be traded in China, more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world is done in China.\nFor anyone who has followed the crypto-currency scene for a while, the events of recent weeks are a familiar story. \nSome random event - say, a tweet from Elon Musk announcing Tesla will accept crypto-currency payments - sends Bitcoin to new highs, and people begin to say it's winning mainstream acceptance.\nThen another random event happens, perhaps a change of course from the Tesla tycoon. It comes tumbling down again, and talk of it going mainstream fades into the background.\nLast month, in a chatroom on Clubhouse (another phenomenon that seems to be swinging from boom to bust) I expressed some scepticism about crypto-currencies. \nUp popped a senior figure from London's thriving fintech scene: \"Rory, Rory,\" he chided me, \"crypto is becoming an accepted asset class.\"\nWith big City institutions taking an interest, that had a ring of truth - back in April, at least. \nBut this week, the weather had changed, with the Financial Times reporting \"new doubts among institutional fund managers over the future of crypto-currencies as an asset class\".\nMy mind went back to 2013, when I had first taken an interest in Bitcoin. In a report for Radio 4's PM programme, I had bought a pizza for 0.5 BTC, a tortuous process which had not seemed worth the \u00a330 it cost back then - of course, at today's exchange rate, that was a \u00a314,000 pizza.\nI had also written a blog post headlined \"The Bitcoin Bubble\", in which I tried to mine some lessons from a period when the price of the cryptocurrency shot up from $15 to $276 and then hurtled lower again. \nI ended a piece  in which I compared the cryptocurrency with 17th-Century Dutch tulips or London houses in the 1980s with this thought: \"Unless and until Bitcoin can be used to buy a sandwich, or be accepted by your friends when you pay them back for a restaurant meal, then it is likely to remain just a playground for geeks and gamblers.\"\nEight years on, it is still virtually impossible to buy a sandwich with Bitcoin.\nAnd why would you want to, when there's a good chance you'll be mocked a few years later - as I've been for my transaction - for giving away an asset that goes on to soar in value?"

      "tags": "Criminal justice system",
      "text": "Rape victims in England and Wales should be able to pre-record evidence and cross-examinations so that they do not have to face perpetrators in court, the victims' commissioner has said.\nIn a new report, Dame Vera Baird has called for the practice to be rolled out \"as soon as practically possible\". \nIt would also reduce stressful waits in the run-up to trials, she told the BBC.\nThe BBC understands the government is considering the move, but it is not clear how it would be implemented.\nA plan will be laid out in a government review due to be published next month.\nIn a review of the provision for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses in courts, Dame Vera said pre-recording interviews would relieve unnecessary stress for those who had experienced sexual assault.\n\"We've found that almost everybody who was asked had heard victims say how frightened they were to come to court,\" she said.\nThey did not want to come face-to-face with the defendant or their \"supporters\", she said, nor did they want people in the public gallery.\nShe also said the practice would reduce the wait between the witness giving initial evidence to police and being cross-examined in court, which can sometimes be two years because of backlogs made worse by the pandemic.\nInstead, the evidence and cross-examination could both be filmed soon after the alleged offence, and played to a jury in court once the case reached trial, without any further involvement from the victim. \nDame Vera said this would mean the complainant could give their account \"whilst their memory is good\" then move on - and, if they choose, get therapy without fear that their notes could then be used by the defence.\nShe said asking people alleging rape to wait for years before being cross-examined \"preserves the traumatisation\" and can lead to them withdrawing from prosecution altogether.\nAround 43% of rape complainants dropped out of prosecutions in the nine months to December 2020, according to Home Office figures.\nThose who do proceed can give up if their case is listed for a certain date but cancelled last minute, Dame Vera said, adding: \"It's a torture you don't have to put anyone through.\"\nThe law in England and Wales says that under \"special measures\", witnesses who are classed as vulnerable or intimidated are eligible to pre-record their initial evidence and cross-examination.\nThis practice was rolled out for all vulnerable witnesses - which includes all children - last year. However, it is not currently used for intimidated witnesses, which includes those who allege sexual offences.\nA pilot was introduced in three courts September 2019 and an evaluation has not yet been published.\nThe victims' commissioner's report found that the guilty plea rate was \"notably higher\" when evidence was pre-recorded and the process was less traumatic for witnesses.\nIt also said, more broadly, that too often \"special measures\" - designed to help witnesses give evidence and relieve stress - were not being offered to those who were entitled to them. \nThese measures include the provision of screens to shield witnesses from the defendant in court, and the option to appear in court from a separate room via television link. \nAmong its recommendations is a call for the government to make sure that separate entrances and waiting rooms are available for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, and to make greater use of remote centres where witnesses can give evidence without attending court.\nThe BBC understands that a government review to be published next month will also include plans to ask judges to bar the public from courts more often and to ensure mobile phones are returned to victims within 24 hours.\nKatie Russell, spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales,  told the BBC that these measures, as well as pre-recording evidence, would have the \"potential to improve the unacceptably low levels of criminal justice\" that rape and sexual violence complainants receive.\n\"All sexual violence and abuse victims and survivors have been subjected to trauma and deserve trauma-informed and sensitive treatment,\" she said.\nShe also said the \"significant length of time\" that mobile phones were kept for had been \"a cause for concern for some time\".\n\"Being disconnected from friends, family and support networks at such a difficult and stressful time can undoubtedly be distressing,\" she said.\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: \"We understand how traumatic the court process can be and despite the pandemic we are continuing to improve the support provided for victims.\"\n\"This includes protective screens and video links in every criminal court, more separate waiting rooms as well as piloting the pre-recording of cross-examination for rape victims to help further reduce the stress of attending court,\" it added.\n\"At the same time, a new Victims' Bill - set out in the Queen's Speech - will strengthen the rights of victims at every stage of the justice system.\"\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this video, you can find help and support from BBC Action Line."

However, they say it should be up to member states to decide on measures they impose, such as Covid tests or quarantine. \nTheir recommendations are expected to be adopted soon by the EU Council of member states.\nWelcoming the move, European Commission spokesman Christian Wigand told reporters: \"This will help improve international inbound travel and it's possible to do so safely while at the same time ensuring quick action to counter the spread of new virus variants.\"\nIf the UK is added to the EU's \"safe list\", anyone will be allowed to visit if they have the necessary documentation, not just people who have been fully vaccinated. The ambassadors have also recommended that an emergency brake be agreed for Covid variants of concern.\nHowever, the terms of the planned EU-wide digital green certificate are yet to be signed off. The certificate would include either a negative test, proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid.\nThe EU currently only recommends non-essential travel from a small number of third countries, including Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand and Israel.\nPortugal, Italy and Greece have already dropped quarantine restrictions for British travellers and Spain is expected to make an announcement in the coming days.\nPortugal is the only country currently on the UK's own green list, allowing travellers to return without going into quarantine.

      "text": "People in Scotland travelling to a foreign country will now be able to access a vaccine certificate, the Scottish government has confirmed.\nOnly those travelling to destinations which require a record of vaccination status should download their certificate from an NHS portal.\nIt can also be requested in the post via a Freephone Covid Status Helpline.\nThere are currently no countries requiring vaccination status to travel but restrictions can change quickly.\nPublic health officials previously said this digital scheme would mean Scotland was \"ready to join\" an international vaccination passport programme.\nThe Scottish government said the service was intended to allow people access to the certificate without asking their GP, thereby \"easing the burden\" on the NHS.\nPeople have been advised to request the document if they are due to travel in the next 21 days.\nAs more people are vaccinated, the system will be replaced by digital Covid status certificates - which will include vaccination and testing data to be used for outbound international travel.\nThe system differs from that being used in England where an NHS app - separate from its contact tracing app -  can show vaccine status if enabled by a GP. \nChief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said people should continue to limit their travel abroad, \"play it safe\" and instead go on a staycation this summer.\nHe said: \"Given the risk of returning with infection, and especially of introducing new variants of the virus, we continue to be highly cautious about international travel.\n\"For those that do need it, this new service will provide people with a record of their vaccination status for outbound international travel.\n\"They should only access their record if they are planning to travel within 21 days and it is a requirement of their destination.\"\nA traffic lights system for foreign travel came into effect in Scotland on Monday - meaning people travelling to \"green list\" countries do not need to quarantine on their return.\nCovid status certificates have been trialled in England since mid April.\nThe UK government previously said such a scheme could have an important role to play both domestically and internationally and is \"likely to become a feature of our lives until the pandemic recedes\"."

      "text": "More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the latest government figures.  \nThat is about 69% of the adult population.  \nPatricia Donnelly, who leads NI's Covid vaccination programme, said she was \"determined to maintain momentum\".\nIt is almost six months since the first vaccine was administered to Sister Joanna Sloan at the Royal Victoria Hospital last December.\nThe 28-year-old County Down woman was applauded by colleagues after being given the Pfizer/BioNTech jab.\nMuch has happened since then.\nPatricia Donnelly said health officials \"will keep vaccinating people as quickly as supplies allow\".\n\"As we have stated, supplies are limited at present, but we expect that to improve in June. \n\"I would once again ask people waiting their turn to be patient. Keep checking the online booking portal as new appointment slots are being opened up on a regular basis.\"\nSeven vaccination centres were set up across Northern Ireland, while the SSE Arena in Belfast opened its doors as a regional centre on 29 March.\nGPs have also administered about 666,000 AstraZeneca vaccines, while the 350 community pharmacies have given out 47,000 of the jabs.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann received his first dose at his local pharmacy in Ballymena, County Antrim, in March.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Swann said he could not praise the programme \"too highly\", adding it was a \"massive logistical undertaking\".\n\"I have seen up close the dedication and the long hours that have been invested in making it work,\" he said.\n\"Vaccination saves lives. It is vital to our hopes of a better summer and of continuing progress against the virus. It has been central to the progress we have made.\n\"I would again urge everyone to get their first and second jabs when their turn comes. I am certainly looking forward to getting my second AstraZeneca jab in the coming weeks.\"\nUptake of the vaccine has been high in Northern Ireland, especially among older groups with 100% of those aged 80 and over having received it.\nIn the 70-79 age group about 96% have been inoculated while almost three-quarters (74.8%) of people aged 50 to 59 have received a jab.\nEarly booking for 30 to 39-year-olds opened this month and to date about 52% have had a vaccine.\nAlthough uptake has been high, it has slowed.\nIt is not clear whether this is to do with supplies or a reluctance among some people to get the vaccine."

      "text": "Boris Johnson is prepared \"to throw farmers and crofters under the Brexit bus\" in his bid to secure a trade deal with Australia, the SNP's leader in Westminster has said.\nIan Blackford urged the PM to rule out giving Australia tariff - or tax-free - access for its lamb and beef products.\nMr Johnson replied that an agreement with Australia would be a \"massive opportunity\" for UK farmers.\nThe Scottish government has written to the trade secretary about its concerns.\nRural affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon wrote: \"A trade deal that liberalises tariffs for Australian farmers, to put it bluntly, will put UK farmers out of business.\"\nThere are also reported tensions among ministers over the proposed trade pact.\nCurrently imports from Australia face tariffs, making their products more expensive to buy in the UK.\nAustralia is one of a number of countries the UK is negotiating with to remove or lower tariffs, following its departure from the EU.\nThe BBC has been told that Environment Secretary George Eustice has raised a number of concerns with the prime minister and senior cabinet ministers about the deal trading away farmers' interests. \nAnd the Financial Times reported that Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is also concerned, while International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost are more keen to grant tariff-free access to Australian goods.\nSpeaking to MPs on Wednesday, Ms Truss said she was confident British farmers would \"thrive\" under a deal with Australia, adding it would have \"benefits for all nations and regions\" of the UK.\nNegotiators from both sides are \"currently in a sprint with a view to getting to agreement in principle by early June,\" she added.\nOne compromise Mr Eustice has suggested is to negotiate quotas on Australian meat imports - so that only a limited amount could be tariff-free.\nLabour first minister of Wales Mark Drakeford will raise concerns about the impact of a deal on Welsh farmers in a meeting with Mr Gove later. \nSenior UK cabinet ministers are expected to meet on Thursday morning to discuss how the agreement could impact farming.\nThe subject was raised at Prime Minister's Questions, where Mr Blackford - himself a crofter - said a tariff-free deal with Australia \"would be the final nail in the coffin for many Scottish crofters and farmers\".\nHe added it would \"end a way of life that has endured for generations\" and that \"families would be driven off the land\". \nHe urged Mr Johnson to \"permanently\" rule out signing up to an agreement that would guarantee tariff-free access for Australian imports of lamb and beef. \nThe prime minister did not give the guarantee, instead accusing Mr Blackford of \"grossly underestimating\" UK farmers' ability to \"make the most of free trade\". \nAnd he said the SNP MP was \"frightened of free trade\". \nThe prime minister also face criticism from Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams who said Mr Johnson was backing Australian instead of UK farmers. \nMr Johnson said the MP had \"no ambition for Welsh farmers\" and that it was \"a disgrace that not a single morsel of Welsh lamb had passed the lips of Americans in the last 20 years\". \nMinette Batters, the president of the National Farmers' Union, said: \"We know that if we're to open up the opportunities of new markets overseas for UK farmers, we will have to offer greater access to our own markets in return.\n\"However, this trade-off needs to be balanced, and we need to make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly.\n\"There is a very real risk that, if we get it wrong, UK farming will suffer irreversible damage rather than flourish in the way we all desire, to the detriment of our environment, our food security and our rural communities.\"\nThe government says our ability to do trade deals around the world is one of the big benefits of Brexit.\nThey've been trumpeting all sorts of deals over the last year but those deals are basically roll-overs of what we had before as members of the EU. \nThe deal with Australia would be the first big deal to expand markets, so it is politically and symbolically important but at what price?\nAustralia wants tax-free access to our markets for their big industrial farms so they can export lamb and sheep more cheaply.\nBut famers here are saying we wouldn't be able to survive that competition unless we are protected by tariffs.\nThey say a free trade deal would only add a tiny bit to the size of the British economy so is it really worth threatening famers for that.\nThey also say there is also a precedent being set. \nAustralia may be a relatively small market - but if they get a complete tariff-free access then what will the Americans or Brazilians want to have?"

      "text": "The ex-girlfriend of Babes in the Wood murderer Russell Bishop has been jailed after being found guilty of lying at his original trial in 1987.\nJennifer Johnson \"significantly undermined\" the prosecution's case against Bishop, who was cleared of killing nine-year-olds Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows in Brighton.\nHe was eventually convicted in 2018.\nMr Justice Fraser sentenced Johnson, who did not attend the hearing, to six years in prison. \nSentencing Johnson at Lewes Crown Court, the judge described her offences as being \"at the most serious end of the scale\". \nHe said he did not accept that pressure or coercion caused her to help Bishop saying \"you were a willing participant in his dishonest offence\".\nHe called Johnson \"an accomplished liar\", who \"lied and lied again to the jury and to the court\".\n\"In my judgement your prime motivation was that you could simply not face life without him... You wanted Bishop home with you, not in prison.\"\nThe families of the two girls had campaigned for decades for justice.\nMichelle Hadaway, Karen's mother, said Johnson's \"web of lies\" in 1987 left her \"completely numb to the core\".\nSpeaking after the hearing, she said: \"I don't know if any sentence would have been good enough for her. \n\"But she will have to sit behind bars for the next three years and think about the awful lies she's told, the suffering she's been a part of causing - and think 'was it worth it?'.\"\n\"The pain I have had to endure over the loss of my beautiful daughter Karen over the last 30 years has been unbearable,\" she added.\nSpeaking of Johnson's refusal to leave her cell for the sentencing, the judge called it an example of her \"refusal to accept responsibility\" for her actions, and Ms Hadaway said it was \"the coward's way out\".\nChris Henley QC, for the defence, said Johnson had been \"a vulnerable young mother in 1987\" and was \"in a relationship with a violent, abusive and coercive man\".\nShe denied recognising a sweatshirt belonging to Bishop found in wasteland near where Karen and Nicola were found sexually-assaulted and strangled in Wild Park.\nShe claimed she had no choice to lie after being threatened by her partner, but was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice earlier this week.\nDuring Johnson's month-long trial, the jury was told she had lied \"prolifically\" and \"significantly undermined\" the original trial.\nLibby Clark, senior crown prosecutor at the CPS, said the sweatshirt had been a \"key part in the prosecution's case\" in 1987.\n\"Johnson's actions played a part in the families of Nicola and Karen living in decades of despair as to whether anyone would ever be convicted of the killings of their little girls,\" Ms Clark said.\nThree years after Bishop was acquitted, he struck again, leaving a seven-year-old for dead at Devil's Dyke, near Brighton. He was jailed for life. \nIn 2014, after advances in DNA testing technology, the sweatshirt was re-examined and evidence was found linking it to Bishop's home and the girls. \n\"Double jeopardy\" laws in the UK were scrapped in 2005, meaning Bishop's acquittal could be quashed and he was finally convicted of the murders 32 years after the girls died. \nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nSurge testing and jabs will be expanded to six new areas of concern in England to combat the spread of the Indian Covid variant, the health secretary has said. They are Bedford, Burnley, Hounslow, Kirklees, Leicester and North Tyneside. The Scottish authorities are taking similar action in Glasgow and Moray. There have now been 2,967 cases of the variant identified in the UK, Matt Hancock said - up from about 2,300 on Monday. He added that of 25 people in hospital in Bolton with Covid, the majority are totally unvaccinated and 90% have not yet had two vaccine doses. Earlier, the prime minister said there was \"increasing confidence\" that Covid-19 vaccines are effective against all variants, including the Indian.\nThe public is being urged to take part in trials to find out whether a third dose of Covid vaccine could protect against new variants. All seven vaccines the UK has ordered will be tested on working-age people and over-75s as part of a randomised trial, with data gathered on side-effects and immune responses. The findings will help advisers decide if re-vaccinating some people in the autumn is necessary. Mr Hancock said it would be the first clinical study in the world to look at the impact of a booster jab.\nEU ambassadors have backed proposals to reopen borders for non-essential travel from countries with low infection rates. A \"safe list\" of countries will be agreed this week. But BBC Europe correspondent Jean Mackenzie says there's some hesitation to include the UK, as some EU countries want to see how the surge of cases related to the Indian variant plays out. Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock have both said that people from the UK should only holiday in \"green list\" countries - and not amber ones.\nHealth authorities in Malawi have incinerated 19,610 expired doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying it will reassure the public that any vaccines they do get are safe. The country received 102,000 doses from the African Union on 26 March and used almost 80% - but the expiry date on the labels was 13 April, so vials were taken out of the cold chain. \"If we don't burn them, people will think that we are using expired vaccines in our facilities,\" Dr Charles Mwansambo, Malawi's principal health secretary told the BBC. \"And if they don't come, Covid-19 will hit them hard.\"\nIceland's Eurovision act won't be performing in this year's Eurovision live shows after a band member tested positive for coronavirus. The act, Da\u00f0i og Gagnamagni\u00f0, will stay in the competition, but won't perform live at Wednesday's rehearsal, Thursday's semi-final or the final on Saturday. Instead, the competition will use footage recorded during a recent rehearsal. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nCan two households travel in one car?

      "text": "Health authorities in Malawi have incinerated 19,610 expired doses of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, saying it will reassure the public that any vaccines they do get are safe. \nIt is the first African country to publicly do this.\nThe World Health Organization initially urged countries not to destroy expired doses but has now changed its advice.\nUptake of the vaccine in Malawi has been low and health workers hope the move will increase public confidence.\nOut of a population of about 18 million people, the country has recorded 34,232 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,153 deaths.\nMalawi received 102,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine it acquired from the African Union on 26 March and used almost 80% of them.\nBut the expiry date on the labels was 13 April and officials say this wasn't enough time to use them all.\nSo in a 30-minute process, officials destroyed thousands of Covid-19 vaccines, leaving behind just broken pieces of the vials holding the liquid.\nMalawi's principal health secretary told the BBC that it was unfortunate they had to destroy the vaccines but the benefits outweighed the risks.\n\"When news spread that we had out-of-date vaccines, we noticed that people were not coming to our clinics to get immunised,\" said Dr Charles Mwansambo.\n\"If we don't burn them, people will think that we are using expired vaccines in our facilities and if they don't come, Covid-19 will hit them hard.\"\nThe government says it has adequate stocks of vaccines and has urged everyone over 18 years old to get a jab.\nIn addition to the 102,000 from the African Union, it has received 300,000 doses under the Covax vaccine-sharing facility and 50,000 sourced direct from India.\nHowever, future supplies could be threatened by India's decision to halt exports.\nOn the streets of the capital Lilongwe, some people are worried about the safety of the vaccine.\n\"I would like to get vaccinated but how sure am I if I go to the hospital I won't be given the expired vaccines?\" shopkeeper Jack Chitete told the BBC.\n\"I have heard a lot of stories about people getting blood clots and some even dying after getting immunised. Are those people telling lies? If it is the truth, why are we being given the same vaccines?\" asked another shopkeeper, Mphatso Chipenda.\nThe link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots is not yet proven, and health experts say the risk from Covid-19 is far higher. They advise people to get vaccinated if they can.\nMalawi is not the only country in Africa to have expired vaccines. The WHO initially asked affected countries to hold onto the vaccines until it could establish whether they could still be used.\nBut it now says vaccines already sent out by the manufacturer with a set expiry date should be destroyed.\n\"While discarding vaccines is deeply regrettable in the context of any immunisation programme, WHO recommends that these expired doses should be removed from the distribution chain and safely disposed of,\" it said in a statement on 17 May.\nOther vaccines that are currently in use have a shelf life of up to 36 months. The challenge with Covid-19 vaccines is that they have been in use for less than a year and there is no substantive data around their effectiveness after long periods."

There was no respect given to us as a family, nor to my mother. \n\"That's quite hard, that's difficult to accept.\n\"I just dwell on the facts. I don't know when she died, how she died and was anyone with her. I don't know anything.\n\"The impact is so emotional. Was my mum alone, was somebody with her? It's playing on our minds.\n\"I'm just thinking if they'd provided a Covid treatment maybe she would have had more time to spend with her family.\n\"Would she have been here today?\"\nGreg Dix, director of nursing and patient care at Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board said: \"While we are unable to comment on the circumstances of individual cases, losing a loved one is devastating for any family and our thoughts and sympathies are with them.\n\"We take the quality of care and treatment provided to our patients extremely seriously and apologise to anyone who feels let down by our health board or where the level of care has fallen short. \n\"We remain committed to learning lessons from the pandemic as well as the experiences of any patients or families who raise concerns with us so we can continually work to improve our standards of care.\""
