      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid infection rates in East Renfrewshire are now higher than Glasgow, figures show.\nThe weekly case rate on 17 May reached 118.3, with Glasgow on 112.1, according to Public Health Scotland.\nThe rate is a key indicator of which restriction level an area should be in, with 50 cases per 100,000 set as the threshold for level three. \nGlasgow is currently in level three, but East Renfrewshire went down to level two on Monday.\nIn Moray - the other level three area - the rate is continuing to fall and on 17 May was 36.5 cases per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government is expected to review the levels assigned to each local authority on Friday.\nThe weekly case rate is one factor that will be considered, but others include the ability of the local NHS to cope.\nTony Buchanan, leader of East Renfrewshire Council, told the BBC: \"Cases are rising and we are more than aware of that - they are concerning, I don't think there is any doubt looking at these numbers.\n\"Within that, though, we are looking at a lot of household transmission, as opposed to wider community transmission.\"\nEverywhere in Scotland apart from Moray and Glasgow dropped down to lower levels of restrictions on Monday, with the rest of the mainland and Skye at level two, and some islands now at level one.\nThe level two restrictions allow pubs and restaurants to serve alcohol inside until 22:30, and limited numbers of people can socialise indoors.\nSocial distancing during meetings indoors or in private gardens is also no longer required in levels one and two.\nMr Buchanan said he had a \"lot of sympathy\" for businesses in East Renfrewshire who were now facing the possibility of the local authority being moved back to up level three.\n\"Obviously they have operated this week. All measures are in place to try and avoid transmission and we are not aware of any transmission occurring in any of our local businesses.\n\"It is a concern - we fully understand the position that they are in, but equally we have our public health message and we need to be concerned and ultimately save lives hopefully.\"\nCovid cases across Scotland have been rising over the last few weeks, with fears the surge in Glasgow is being driven by the Indian variant.\nThe strain is thought to spread more easily and has been found in pockets across the UK.\nScotland's interim deputy chief medical officer, Dave Caesar, said \"small numbers\" of the Indian variant had also been found outside Glasgow in other areas of the central belt.\nDr Caesar told BBC Scotland's The Nine that health officials were keeping a \"very close eye\" on the cases.\nHe also said that the Scottish government was \"watchful without being alarmed\" about the recent increase in infections in Glasgow and East Renfrewshire.\n\"It's not surprising that with a relaxation in the measures...that with increasing travel locally, with increasing mixing, with increasing reasons for us to go out and about, that we might see more transmission between people,\" he said.\n\"We're really keen to try to make sure we do all we can as soon as we see any signals that might suggest that transmission is creeping up.\""

      "text": "Rail passengers have been promised a better and more efficient service under the biggest shake-up in decades.\nA new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would replace an \"overcomplicated and fragmented\" system.\nHe told the BBC the changes did not mean fares would inevitably rise, but could not give guarantees.\nAsked on Today if the changes meant rising ticket prices, Mr Shapps said: \"No, is the answer\". But he added: \"I'm not here to give guarantees for years to come.\"\nLabour said there was \"little substance\" behind the plans. \nThe government says a more unified rail system will lead to more \"high-quality, consistent services\" from 2023 onwards, plus better connections. \nThere will also be changes to make travel smoother, including:\nThe flexible season tickets will offer savings on certain routes for people who do not travel to work every day, reflecting the expected changes to commuting patterns after the pandemic.\nThey are due to go on sale on 21 June for use seven days later, and will allow passengers to travel on any eight days in a 28-day period. \nDarshita Rajani, who lives in Wellingborough but works in London, welcomes the idea of a flexible season ticket. \nCurrently a season ticket for her journey costs just under \u00a38,000. But she will only be doing three days a week when she goes back to the office so that would be prohibitively expensive.\n\"If things don't change I will still have to buy a season ticket, which is a waste of money, but a day ticket costs \u00a3116,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"It's insane how much they charge for a 50-minute train journey. I hope there will be two-days-a-week, three-days-a-week flexi tickets.\"\nThe reforms follow the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018 and years of complaints about the \"fragmented\" franchising system, which has been scrapped.\nGBR will replace the current track operator, Network Rail, in 2023 and the government says the new system will look more like Transport for London, with multiple operators under one brand.\nThe systems will differ slightly in Scotland and Wales, where transport is devolved, but GBR will still operate in those nations.\nThe Department for Transport said in Scotland and Wales will continue to exercise their current powers and be accountable for them, but the government will explore options to ensure all nations benefit from the reforms.\nGBR will continue to own the infrastructure in Scotland and Wales (other than some of the South Wales Valley Lines), as Network Rail does now.\nRail in Northern Ireland is devolved and not linked to the wider UK network. \nMr Shapps said the ultimate aim was to create \"one guiding mind\" overseeing the UK rail system, so there was there is more accountability when things went wrong.\nMost rail services will still be run by the private sector, but under new \"passenger contracts\" they will be expected to meet targets on punctuality and efficiency for the first time.\nKeith Williams, the former boss of British Airways who led the review into the reforms, told the BBC's Today programme: \"What we've done here is listen to what customers want out of rail and react to that.\n\"And that really is a more reliable punctual service and better opportunities [when] buying tickets. \n\"There is an enormous opportunity here not only to simplify the way that people buy tickets, but also to benefit from a retail environment which gives greater flexibility in the way that fares are operated in the future.\"\nMr Shapps, who also worked on the review, said the the new reforms would give the railways \"solid and stable foundations for the future\" after \"years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication.\"\nOn possible fare rises, he pointed out that the taxpayer had plugged a \u00a312bn hole during the coronavirus crisis to keep the railways operating and fares were subsidised. \nBut he said there was no \"hidden agenda\". \n\"Of course any government in the future will have to weigh those things up,\" he said. \nIf the plan is followed through and properly implemented, it should see an end to the squabbling over who is to blame when the trains are late, dirty or overcrowded. Everything will be the problem of a single body.\nThat concentration of power will also be a potential Achilles' heel. One of the successes of the privatisation was the freedom for train companies to do new things - a freedom that was a partial factor in the remarkable revival in passenger numbers in the past two decades. \nIf that spirit of innovation is lost - and if civil servants and politicians endlessly interfere in the working of the new authority - the railways risk sliding into stagnation. \nThe fear among railway executives is that the Treasury, having had to pay dearly to support services during the pandemic, will seek to claw back spending, leading to cuts in services. \nAnthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said passengers would welcome a move \"towards a more accountable and joined-up railway\".\n\"Ultimately what they will care about is whether rail is the best option for them, if it is reliable, efficient and good value,\" he said. \nBut Labour's shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said the the reforms were unlikely to work. \n\"With fare hikes, \u00a31bn cuts to Network Rail and broken promises to communities across the country, it's yet another example of ministers talking a good game, with very little substance underneath.\"\nHenri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, welcomed the plan in principle saying the old franchise model \"was broken\".  \nBut he called for more to be done on lowering fares in the North.\n\"Although more pay-as-you-go ticketing is welcome, the lack of greater progress in fares reform means that there is less incentive for people to stop using their cars to travel around the North.\"\nMeanwhile, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the proposals could deliver \"the biggest changes in a generation\".\nDirector general Andy Bagnall said: \"Train operators called for a guiding mind and Great British Railways will help to bring the whole industry together.\n\"To deliver for passengers and freight customers, it must have the independence to hold the operators of both tracks and trains to account equally. Crucially, it needs to allow operators to put their customers at the absolute forefront of decision-making,\" he added.\nThe publication of the plan comes eight months after the government scrapped the system of rail franchising, which had been in force since privatisation, and unveiled plans to extend support for train firms.\nAfter a drop in passenger numbers during the pandemic as more people worked from home, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Network Rail,National Rail,Transport,Rail travel,Southeastern,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Rail firms are reassuring travellers major efforts have been taken to ensure their safety as services increase.\nTrains in England, Wales and Scotland were up to 90% of normal levels by Monday as schools reopen and people are encouraged to return to work.\nRail firms said anecdotal evidence suggested a slight increase in numbers but it was too soon for exact figures.\nWest Midlands Trains' Francis Thomas said there were \"big changes\", such as sanitising gel and one-way systems.\n\"If you haven't been to the railway station in the last couple of months you might find there's a one-way system at your local station, there's hand gel available and we've invested in anti-fogging machines that can spread an anti-viral on trains,\" he told the BBC.\n\"And there's plenty of space. We reckon we can carry about 40% of normal loads before we start to breach social distancing.\" \nOne passenger told the BBC: \"I think you just have to get out\u2026 and then once you get out you kind of get rid of your fears.\" \nAnother reported there was plenty of space: \"I come in on the Chiltern Railways line into Marylebone and the trains were a lot, lot longer, and they've, barriered off certain seats. It wasn't too packed.\"\nJacqueline Starr, head of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said rail services were \"doing everything they can\" to reassure people travel was safe. \nThe group said no service was reported as \"close to social distancing capacity\". \nTrain operators across the country have designed the new timetable, taking into consideration potentially busy stations and parts of routes that will experience higher demand for travel by schoolchildren.\nWhere possible, more frequent services will be put on or extra carriages added to create more room.\nStaff will also be on hand to explain the rules on wearing face coverings and maintaining social distancing to older children.\n\"Some train times will change so we're asking people to check before they travel and plan their journeys for quieter times if possible,\" said Ms Starr. \nOver the coming weeks, rail bosses have a delicate balance to strike. \nThey want more passengers back on the network, but they don't want a flood of commuters crowding trains and stations. \nUp to now, passenger numbers have remained low - on average, about a third of what it was before the pandemic. \nThe railways are not going back to where they were before the pandemic. Some services won't return. But in places, at certain times, more capacity will be created. \nDuring the pandemic, the government has been covering the huge cost of running the railways without passengers. \nSo there is also a financial incentive for ministers that passengers return.\nTrain companies are now working to manage passenger flows by warning people if a particular service is busy.\nSome modern trains, like those running on Southeastern and on Govia Thameslink, can monitor the weight load in carriages, allowing them to estimate the number of people on board.\nSoutheastern plans to share the data with passengers so they can avoid a specific train.\nThe Rail Delivery Group said that reducing the timetable during the coronavirus lockdown and then gradually increasing services again in phases had led to improvements in punctuality. \nIn particular, train operators and Network Rail had learned lessons about the effects of \"wear and tear\" on railway infrastructure, the effects \"knock-on delays\" caused to intensely-used routes, and the time trains take at each station.\n\"Before Covid one train was leaving a station at every second - we were congested. Obviously what this has allowed us to do is to look at the timetable and its resilience and to see where we can improve and increase punctuality and build and maintain that as we build back up the timetable,\" Robert Nisbet, regional director at the Rail Delivery Group, told the BBC.\nMr Nisbet added that the crisis had prompted another look at the way fares are structured: \"The need for reform has never been stronger, specifically when it comes to fares.\" \nHe said the regulations that governed fares needed changing and that talks were being held with government on this issue - including changes to make season tickets more flexible. \nAt the end of August, the government launched an advertising campaign encouraging people to go back to the workplace. \nBusiness leaders have warned of damage being done to city centres as people stay away from offices.\nHowever, many employers have no plans to return workers to the office. \nThe BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office.\nOne of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place."

      "text": "Wales' new health minister says she faces \"a gargantuan task\" to tackle \"record high\" NHS waiting lists caused by the Covid pandemic.\nEluned Morgan has announced an initial \u00a3100m to deal with the record backlog.\nLatest Welsh government figures show more people than ever - the equivalent of 18% of the Welsh population - are waiting for planned treatments. \nThere were 568,367 people on waiting lists in March, up 24.4% on the same time last year.  \nAll health boards will get a share of the funding for new equipment, staff and promoting \"new ways of working\".\nMs Morgan told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: \"I'm very aware of the gargantuan task ahead of me as health minister, and really confronting the NHS.\n\"We've got to understand that we're in a very unique situation, the pandemic has meant that obviously those waiting lists have really hit record highs and I think we've got to be aware that those people on the front line, the NHS staff, have worked tirelessly through the pandemic and so they're going to need a little bit of time and support to recover.\n\"I am very aware that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people across Wales who are suffering and are in pain and it is our responsibility to move as fast as we can to try and relieve that suffering.\n\"But it is going to be, I'm afraid, a task that is going to take a substantial amount of time.\"\nGaye Moran, from Llandudno in Conwy, has been waiting for hip surgery, despite being on a priority list since December 2018. \nShe told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: \"Sometimes I swear a lot because it hurts so much, sometimes I sit and have a cry.\n\"But generally I just have to live with it because the only painkillers I can take make me sleep and I really don't want to spend my life sleeping all the time.\" \nCancer charities have concerns about the impact of the pandemic on waiting times for both patients and staff.\nRichard Pugh, head of Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, told BBC Wales: \"The backlog is a worry because people are coming in to the system. \n\"These incredible staff are fatigued. We weren't in the best place with cancer before this. The complications are that more people are coming in and the system can't cope. \n\"We warned about this months ago. The key thing is supporting the staff but our worry is the new numbers coming in.\"\nVice President for the Royal College of Physicians in Wales Dr Olwen Williams also said she was concerned about staff.\nShe said: \"I think this isn't necessarily about the money... we welcome this investment, it's about the fact that, firstly, we're not out to the pandemic. \n\"We've had an incredibly difficult year for all our staff across the NHS and they're really fatigued, so it's about actually thinking around how we deal with delivering services in that context.\"\nShe said a lot of jobs had not been filled before the pandemic, adding: \"It's really urgent that those jobs are filled, because actually our clinicians do need to actually be able to work in an environment where they've got safe rotas.\" \nMr Richard Johnson, director in Wales of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), said it was important to remember that behind the statistics were ordinary \"people waiting in pain and suffering for an operation\".  \nHe said the waiting list had to be a priority for the new health minister and Covid-light sites should be introduced across Wales, to ensure patients without the virus could be safely treated.\n\"This is the best way we can keep treating people who need operations, regardless of future pandemics and winter pressures.  However, it requires being open to doing things differently,\" he said.Tackling NHS waiting lists 'a gargantuan task'\nHe added: \"Although we welcome the additional funding announced, we won't be able to deal with the backlog overnight. It will take many years to achieve, and we need to see sustained investment to increase overall capacity. \n\"Furthermore, significant changes will be required to how we deliver services in Wales.\"\nThe initial \u00a3100m funding was announced in March by Vaughan Gething, the previous health minister, ahead of the Senedd election.\nDuring the subsequent election campaign, Labour promised \u00a31bn would be spent over a number of years on an NHS recovery plan.\nNHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall had previously warned staff were \"exhausted\" and said tackling the NHS could take \"years to recover\".\nOf the 568,367 on the list in March, 216,418 had been waiting more than 36 weeks - 38% of the total number waiting, more than seven times more than during the same period last year.\nHowever there has been slight improvement in the number of patients waiting the longest, with 1,237 fewer patients having waited more 36 weeks for treatment in March compared to February."

I will admit that I wasn't comfortable seeing money go out the door to people like this.\n\"But it was the right thing to do for the country,\" he added.\nThe US government has recommended in the past that companies do not pay criminals over ransomware attacks, in case they invite further hacks in the future.\nColonial Pipeline took itself offline on Friday 7 May after the cyber-attack.  \nIn return for the Bitcoin payment, the company received a decryption tool so it could unlock the systems compromised by the hackers - although that was not enough to restart systems immediately, according to the newspaper.\nOperations resumed on the pipeline last week, although petrol shortages seen across states such as North Carolina and Georgia have persisted, according to data tracking firm Gas Buddy.\nMr Blount added that it would take months before some other business systems are recovered, and estimated that the attack would ultimately cost the company tens of millions of dollars. \nHe also regrets that the company has lost some degree of anonymity, having led the firm since 2017.\n\"We were perfectly happy having no one know who Colonial Pipeline was, and unfortunately that's not the case any more,\" he said. \"Everybody in the world knows.\"\nAt the time of the hack, the DarkSide criminal gang acknowledged the incident in a public statement.\n\"Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society,\" DarkSide wrote on its website.\n\"We do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for... our motives,\" the group added."

      "text": "The number of people using public transport is far lower than before the pandemic, but it's rising steadily. \nWhat are the risks of catching Covid for those who need to travel? \nA lot depends on how crowded a bus or train is, and how much distance you can keep from other people.\nScientists recognised these potential dangers early in the pandemic.\nDr Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at the University of Leicester, says a key concern is sharing enclosed airspace, because coronavirus particles linger in the air. \n\"If you're close enough to smell someone's garlic breath on public transport,\" he says, \"then you're also potentially inhaling any virus that's carried with it.\"\nWearing a mask can lessen the risk, as can keeping windows open to encourage air flow.\nThe chance of picking up the virus from contaminated surfaces is now believed to be far lower than previously thought.\nThe main US health agency, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), says the chance of catching Covid via contaminated surfaces is less than one in 10,000.\nA study by Imperial College London for Transport for London in February tested samples from escalators, buttons and handles and found no traces of the virus.\nAs numbers increase, rail companies are increasing capacity, to enable social distancing and prevent packed trains. \nThe Rail Delivery Group says more than 1,000 weekday services have been added since mid-February, with more planned in May. \nThere will also be longer trains, to make it easier for people to socially distance.\nAs well as more hand sanitiser at stations, there will be enhanced train-cleaning too. \nTransport for London says trains, trams, buses and stations on its network will continue to be treated with hospital-grade cleaning substances that kill viruses and bacteria.\nIt also says capacity limits will remain in place on all buses, with the exception of dedicated school services.\nThe biggest Covid risk for people travelling by plane is where they go and what they do either side of the journey. \nThe risk on a plane is relatively low because of how often the air inside the cabin is circulated.\nMost planes have something called a high-efficiency particulate air filter (Hepa). This can capture smaller particles than ordinary air-conditioning systems, including some viruses.\nIt mixes fresh air from outside the plane with air already in the cabin. \n\"Planes are probably the safest environments on the planet because they have this massive air change rate of 20-30 air changes per hour,\" said Dr Tang. \nThat compares to about two to four air changes per hour in a typical office, and four to six per hour in common areas in hospitals.\nBut it may be harder to socially distance from others on a plane, so wearing a mask remains important.\nMore than 37 million people in the UK have now been vaccinated. \nThis is a significant number of people who are less likely to become seriously ill if they catch coronavirus. There's also increasing evidence vaccinated people are less likely to pass the virus on. \nHowever, that still means many people are susceptible, so travellers need to continue following Covid guidelines.\n\"Some measures should be maintained for a while,\" says Dr Shengjie Lai, a senior research fellow at the University of Southampton.\n\"Face coverings and hand sanitiser on public transport and in substantially enclosed public areas of transport hubs are still very important.\"\nIt depends on how much risk people want to live with, according to Dr Tang.\n\"Going forward, people may choose to wear a mask - without any fear or stigma - on public transport, like you've seen in south-east Asia after the Sars outbreak in 2003.\""

      "text": "The UK government has published its long-awaited plans for an overhaul of the rail network, placing control of infrastructure and services under the new arm's-length public body. How will the changes affect rail travel in Scotland?\nThe ScotRail franchise operates about 2,400 train services a day, and covers all passenger services in Scotland except those run by other operators which cross the border.\nAbellio currently runs the franchise but from spring next year the Scottish government will essentially step into the shoes of the Dutch firm. It is using a \"break clause\" in the franchise contract to end it three years early.\nThis is all taking place under the current rail framework and should not be affected by the changes announced by the UK government on Thursday, which don't look set to take effect until 2023.\nEven then it looks likely that the new ScotRail arrangement set up by the Scottish government could operate as they have planned, as the UK government wants to maintain a system where different bodies run the trains and the tracks.\nUnder the UK government plans, the rail industry will be rebranded as Great British Railways (GBR). \nGBR will run and plan the network, as well as providing online tickets, information and compensation for passengers nationwide.\nIt will streamline and simplify fares, including extending contactless and pay-as-you-go systems to more parts of the country.\nIt looks like that means passengers in Scotland will have ScotRail (a Scottish government-owned public body) running the trains, GBR (UK government-owned public body) running the tracks and infrastructure and GBR selling the tickets. Although the fare structure will still be set by the Scottish government.\nThe new GBR is set to run the infrastructure here in Scotland - because it essentially takes over the role of Network Rail. \nNetwork Rail is owned by the UK government and managed from Milton Keynes. \nBut it currently has a much closer working relationship with ScotRail than it does with the English rail operators. \nAnd this is likely to be the model for the future in England. For example, rail operators are much more able to specify how and when repair work on the lines are carried out so their services aren't disrupted. \nThey seem to be following Scotland's lead. \nIn Scotland, much of the Network Rail's functions are already managed from Scotland.\nIn fact the head of ScotRail, Alex Hynes, has day-to-day control of Network Rail's activities in Scotland - the maintenance and infrastructure work. \nThe sore point for the SNP is that Network Rail is not fully devolved - so it is not answerable to the Scottish Parliament and controlled by the Scottish government.\nThat tension looks set to continue. \nAnd the lack of progress on this issue, combined with the change of name to \"GREAT BRITISH RAILWAYS\" will be seen as deliberately provocative by Nationalists here.

But the fighting has gone on for decades.\nBritain took control of the area known as Palestine after the ruler of that part of the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in World War One. \nThe land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority. \nTensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave Britain the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. \nFor Jews it was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe and seeking a homeland after the Holocaust of World War Two.\nViolence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also grew.\nIn 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. \nThat plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.\nIn 1948, unable to solve the problem, British rulers left and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the state of Israel.\nMany Palestinians objected and a war followed. Troops from neighbouring Arab countries invaded.\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\".\nBy the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. \nJordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. \nJerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.\nBecause there was never a peace agreement - with each side blaming the other - there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.\nIn another war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.\nMost Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\nNeither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.\nIsrael still occupies the West Bank, and although it pulled out of Gaza the UN still regards that piece of land as occupied territory. \nIsrael claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.\nIn the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in these areas, where more than 600,000 Jews now live.\nPalestinians say these are illegal under international law and are obstacles to peace, but Israel denies this.\nTensions are often high between Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. \nGaza is ruled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has fought Israel many times. Israel and Egypt tightly control Gaza's borders to stop weapons getting to Hamas. \nPalestinians in Gaza and the West Bank say they are suffering because of Israeli actions and restrictions. Israel says it is only acting to protect itself from Palestinian violence.\nThe threatened eviction of some Palestinian families in East Jerusalem has also caused rising anger.\nThere are a number of issues which Israel and the Palestinians cannot agree on. \nThese include: what should happen to Palestinian refugees; whether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removed; whether the two sides should share Jerusalem; and - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside Israel. \nPeace talks have been taking place on and off for more than 25 years, but so far have not solved the conflict.\nIn short, the situation isn't going to be sorted out any time soon.\nThe most recent peace plan, prepared by the United States when Donald Trump was president, was called \"the deal of the century\" by Israel's then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But it was been dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.\nAny future peace deal will need both sides to agree to resolve complex issues.\nThe BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, says the latest round of violence in May was the fourth big war between Hamas and Israel since 2008.\nHe's seen previous wars end like this before: \"Similar things have been said by both sides in claiming victory and then essentially the seeds of the next conflict are sown.\n\"I can tell you one thing for certain - that if the status quo does not change favourably, there will be another round of this.\"\nCorrection 21st June 2021: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the US as recognising Israel's claim to the whole of Jerusalem and this has been amended to instead explain that the US recognises the city as Israel's capital.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,House of Lords",
      "text": "The PM's \"levelling up\" plans need to be more targeted to prevent deprived areas being \"short-changed\", say peers.\nBoris Johnson has made the pledge a central part of his election campaigns, promising to invest in \"every part of the UK\". \nBut the Lords Public Services Committee said inequality would grow if money for the NHS, schools and councils was not protected.\nA government spokesman said its plans would have \"a real impact\" on lives. \nThey also said a white paper would be published later this year to set out \"bold new policy interventions\".\nBut the committee said it needed to be released urgently to avoid the suggestion money is being channelled into Conservative seats - something the government denies.\nThe report added: \"Without full transparency and political accountability, local areas will continue to question why they have missed out on 'levelling up' funding while others have benefited.\" \nThe Conservatives first promised to \"level up\" the country in their 2019 election manifesto, and have used the phrase multiple times since Mr Johnson moved into No 10. \nThe plan involves investing in transport, skills and businesses in multiple places, from cities to rural and coastal areas, to address regional disparities in the UK.\nEarlier this week, the government announced the latest raft of \"levelling up\" schemes, including an \u00a318m extension to its Opportunity Areas programme - helping young people make up lost learning time from the pandemic - and moving more civil servants out of Whitehall to work in different towns and cities.\nBut writing to the prime minister with its report, the committee pointed to accusations the government had favoured \"prosperous rural areas with funds ahead of deprived communities\", and said its strategy \"does not recognise high levels of deprivation in many parts of the country, including parts of London\".\nLabour peer Baroness Armstrong, who chairs the group, said the plan would need to be more \"holistic\" to work.\nShe added: \"A white paper - which should be published urgently - is welcome, but it's unclear exactly what the government wants to level up, how much its strategy will cost, how long it will take and how it plans to achieve its goals. \n\"The strategy will require a major change of direction if it's to achieve its admirable ambition for people in 'left-behind' areas to have the same opportunities as elsewhere in the country.\"\nThe committee also called on the government to work with local services and their users to set targets for improving things like life expectancy, employment, literacy and numeracy of children starting school, and the number of entrants to higher education. \nBaroness Armstrong added: \"Not only places but the people who live in them should be at the heart of 'levelling up'. \n\"Social infrastructure and support provided by public services is at least as critical to communities as investment in roads and bridges.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"We're supporting all areas of the country to level up by providing billions of pounds of new funding that will have a real impact on people's daily lives and improve their services - from health and social care to education. \n\"We will publish a levelling up white paper later this year, setting out bold new policy interventions to help improve livelihoods, spread opportunity and drive economic growth - all as part of our efforts to build back better from the pandemic.\"    "

      "text": "A statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes will not be taken down, an Oxford University college has said.\nCalls to remove the memorial at Oriel College were reignited after a statue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down in Bristol.\nA commission set up to examine the figure's future said the \"majority\" of its members supported its removal.\nBut Oriel College said it would not seek to move the statue due to costs and \"complex\" planning processes.\nCampaigners say Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa, represented white supremacy and was steeped in colonialism and racism.\nHe had been a student at Oriel and left \u00a3100,000 - about \u00a312.5m in today's money - to the college through his will in 1902. About \u00a3200,000 still remains, the commission's report found.\nOriel's governing body said in June last year it wished to remove the statue, a decision it said was \"backed\" by the independent commission appointed to examine its future and Rhodes' legacy.\nHowever, the college said after considering \"regulatory and financial challenges\" it had decided not to begin the legal process to move it.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson tweeted the decision by the college was \"sensible and balanced\".\nHe added: \"We should learn from our past, rather than censoring history, and continue focussing on reducing inequality.\"\nThe college said the \"challenges and costs\" of removing the statue in terms of heritage and planning consent could run into years with no certainty of the outcome.\n\"In light of the considerable obstacles to removal, Oriel's governing body has decided not to begin the legal process for relocation of the memorials,\" a statement added.\n\"Instead, it is determined to focus its time and resources on delivering the report's recommendations around the contextualisation of the college's relationship with Rhodes, as well as improving educational equality, diversity and inclusion amongst its student cohort and academic community.\"\nAny decision to move the statue would require planning permission from Oxford City Council, Historic England and the secretary of state for local government, Robert Jenrick.\nThe city council's leader Susan Brown previously urged the college to apply for planning permission, but the commission noted any application would pose \"complex challenges\" since the government's policy over controversial historical figures is that they should be be \"retained and explained\".\nMs Brown said she was \"deeply disappointed\" the college had decided to \"backtrack\" on its decision to remove the statue.\n\"For people in our city this was the most important action that Oriel College could have taken to show an acknowledgement of the discrimination of the past and they have failed to act,\" she said.\nThe council leader said she feared the measures taken by the college would \"not be enough to inspire confidence without this important symbolic step\" and added it was \"well past time for all institutions to tackle the difficult issues of colonialism and discrimination\".\nLord Mendoza, provost of Oriel College, said the college was \"fully aware of the impact our decision is likely to have in the UK and further afield\".\n\"We understand this nuanced conclusion will be disappointing to some, but we are now focused on the delivery of practical actions aimed at improving outreach and the day-to-day experience of BME students,\" he added.\nThe college said the majority of submissions to the inquiry backed the retention of the statue but the commission still decided to recommend its removal.\nIt said it would accept a number of the report's recommendations immediately.\nThese would include a new tutor for \"equality, diversity and inclusion\" and additional training for academic and non-academic staff in race awareness.\nThe governing body said it agreed to a virtual exhibition to \"provide an arena for contextualisation and explanation of the Rhodes legacy\".\nThe statue sits above a doorway on the front of the college's Rhodes Building, which faces Oxford's High Street.\nThe commission was set up after thousands of people protested to demand the statue's removal in June last year.\nIt led to the governors of Oriel College voting to take the Grade II*-listed figure down and the King Edward Street plaque to Rhodes, reversing the decision they made in 2016.\nA report had been due to be published in January but it was delayed twice due to a \"considerable volume of submissions\".\nThe Rhodes Must Fall campaign began in South Africa, where a Rhodes statue was removed, and was adopted in Oxford by campaigners who argued his views were incompatible with an \"inclusive culture\" at the university.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "title": "Rail franchises axed as help for train firms extended",
      "tags": "Companies,Rail travel",
      "text": "The government has scrapped rail franchising and announced plans to extend support for train firms.\nAfter passenger numbers fell during lockdown, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues.\nSo far, the bill has run to more than \u00a33.5bn and the Department for Transport has said \"significant\" support will still be needed.\nAlthough passenger numbers have edged up since lockdown, they are still less than half pre-pandemic levels. \nAs a result, emergency measures to cover the losses of train firms have been extended by 18 months. They reduce the fees that can be earned by the companies but will mean that trains are still able to run, even with fewer passengers.\nThroughout that period ministers hope to carry out broader reforms to Britain's railways.  \nThey will consider adopting a concessions-based system in the longer term, whereby train companies are paid a fixed fee to run services. \nIt marks the end of rail franchises, which have been in place since the 1990s. \nIn a statement, Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps said: \"The model of privatisation adopted 25 years ago has seen significant rises in passenger numbers, but this pandemic has proven that it is no longer working.\"\nHe said the move to a new system would end \"uncertainty and confusion about whether you are using the right ticket or the right train company\".\nThe government and the train companies are painting this as a good deal. But in reality, because of Covid, it's a fairly unsatisfactory scenario for all those concerned. \nThe taxpayer will be liable for the losses on the railways for a much longer period of time. And with the virus spreading, passenger levels might remain suppressed - so the losses could continue for some time to come. \nMeanwhile, train companies who operated franchises that were losing money before the pandemic, still owe money to the Department for Transport from those contracts. Although that thorny issue has been kicked down the road and the negotiations over past payments now need to be resolved by December. \nPrivate train companies have no easy option. \nThe emergency deals keep them in the game but they're a metaphorical straitjacket, which make them commercially un-enticing. \nFor now, no train company has \"handed back the keys\", which would force the government to take on the running of a route. Doing so carries financial penalties and does nothing for a firm's reputation. \nInstead, all of them have, in the short-term, opted for the least bad option there is. \nAnd there is still no consensus within government over what the railways will look like after the pandemic so the detail on that is pretty thin.\nTrain companies have welcomed the plans to replace Britain's often-criticised system of rail franchising.\nPaul Plummer, the boss of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train firms, called for a simpler-to-use fare system.\nHe said: \"These transitional contracts should be a stepping-stone to a better railway.\"\nBut rail expert Sir Michael Holden, who used to run South West Trains, said: The big issue is, what is that something else to look like?\"\nHe told the BBC's Today programme that the current emergency measures were \"the worst possible arrangement to run the railways\".\n\"We've got the dead hand of the government on the helm... controlling all of the detailed decisions of the railway.\"\n\"And yet, they're still paying for public sector operators to run the railway for them.\"\nLabour said the government was trying to \"paper over the cracks of a broken rail system\".\nShadow rail minister Tan Dhesi said: \"Today's agreements mean taxpayers are set to continue paying hundreds of millions of pounds in profit to private rail companies to run the network. This is completely unacceptable.\"\nBut Royal Mail chairman Keith Williams, who was commissioned to carry out a review of the railways, said the companies would have to give more value under the new agreements, which represented the end of the \"complicated\" franchising arrangement.\nHe said they demanded \"more from the expertise and skills of the private sector\" and \"ensure passengers return to a more punctual and co-ordinated railway\".\nHowever, Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash claimed \"private rail companies are a waste of time and a waste of money\". He insisted that \"public ownership is the only model that works\".\nAnd Unite's national officer for rail Harish Patel said: \"Instead of the proposed new model which will allow privateers a renewed opportunity to feed off the taxpayer and passengers, the government should be permanently re-nationalising rail services to increase services, improve punctuality and reduce tickets prices.\" "

They therefore did not impose or recommend a sanction.\"\nThe IEP upheld two complaints relating to sexual misconduct by Mr Hill, although it found a third allegation, of workplace victimisation and discrimination, unproven.\nHe was notified of the panel's findings on 5 March and resigned on 16 March.\nThe subsequent by-election, held earlier this month, was won by the Conservatives.\nThe panel delayed publication of its findings until the conclusion of the employment tribunal on Wednesday.\nIn a statement to the IEP, the victim described Mr Hill's actions as having a severe impact on her self-esteem, confidence and wellbeing.\nDuring an online meeting on 25 March to discuss its findings, the panel said Mr Hill told them he was \"mortified\" by their decision and had got himself \"into a stupid situation of my own making\".\nIt added he made \"no acknowledgment of sexual misconduct or the impact of it, and, therefore, no apology or regret for his actions\".\nThe panel noted Mr Hill \"expressed remorse, but only for the circumstances in which he now found himself\".\nProspect, a union representing staff working in Parliament, said the ruling \"raises questions over whether it is right that men who are accused of sexual misconduct are permitted to physically interact with female staff, visitors and MPs\".\nDeputy general secretary Garry Graham called for a review of current practices \"particularly on this issue of how women can be kept safe at work, while allegations are investigated\".\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "text": "The man tasked with working out how to improve UK railways says a \"Fat Controller\" type figure, independent from government, should be in charge of day-to-day operations.\nThe former boss of British Airways, Keith Williams, said government involvement should be limited to overall policy and budget decisions.\nBut he said the Department for Transport should not manage the system. \nHis review of the rail system will be published this autumn. \nThe Fat Controller is a fictional character who manages the railways in Thomas the Tank Engine, the children's television series based on The Railway Series books.\nMr Williams said he also believed that, in the future, rail franchises should be underpinned by punctuality and other performance-related targets.\nThe government launched the review after passengers in northern and southern England experienced chaos over several weeks last summer following the introduction of a new timetable. \nBy December, punctuality across the country had dropped to a 13-year low. \nIn a BBC interview Mr Williams insisted the interests of passengers would shape every aspect of his work and that the creation of an individual or organisation with oversight of the entire rail system would be \"key for regaining public trust.\"\n\"Someone needs to be accountable to the public,\" he said. \nHe is still to decide on what relationship the individual or organisation would have with government but he said Network Rail, the public company managing rail infrastructure, should not take on an overall managerial role. \nThe idea has echoes of the Strategic Rail Authority, a body which, from 2001 to 2006, provided \"strategic direction\" for the industry. \nMr Williams had already said that the current rail franchising model was finished, but he has now indicated that a franchise should last longer than the current average of seven to eight years.\nHe argues that if train companies were in charge of networks for more time they would have more incentive to invest.\nAs things stand, under a franchise agreement, a train company will make a series of commitments to the government which have to be delivered. \nAccording to Mr Williams, a franchise should no longer be about \"how many ticketing offices there are in a station\". \nHis team is looking into how franchises could focus instead on performance targets such as punctuality and whether or not services have the correct number of carriages - something which continues to be a problem for passengers in the north of England. \nThe rail review also looks set to recommend an overhaul of the complicated rail ticketing system, which has not been reformed since the mid-90s. \n\"Pay-as-you-go across regions and cities has been difficult to implement because of the fares system that exists today,\" said Mr Williams. \nHe said a national system should be created to allow more third-party companies like thetrainline.com to improve the way people buy tickets.\nMick Cash, general secretary of rail union RMT, said it had warned that \"Keith Williams had been hand-picked by Chris Grayling and the Tories to try and get them off the hook over the privatised chaos on our railways\".\nHe added: \"RMT also warned that Keith Williams would side 100% with his big-business mates and duck the issue of public ownership of the railways - the option supported by over two-thirds of the British people. \n\"He has and after months of deliberation has come up with the classic cop-out of another unaccountable quango.\""

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has told Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu he expects a \"significant de-escalation\" in the Gaza conflict on Wednesday.\nMr Biden wanted a \"path to ceasefire\", the White House said.\nThe US is a staunch ally of Israel and has so far opposed a joint UN Security Council statement on the conflict.\nIn response Mr Netanyahu said he was \"determined to carry on\" until \"calm and security are restored to Israeli citizens\", according to Israeli media.\nThe conflict is in its 10th day, with a continuing exchange of rocket fire from Palestinian militants into Israel and Israeli air strikes on Gaza.\nOn Wednesday, four rockets were also fired from Lebanon into Israel and Israel's military responded by firing artillery shells at \"a number of targets in Lebanese territory\". It was not immediately clear whether this would prove to be a significant escalation.\nThe Gaza fighting began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, which controls Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.\nAt least 227 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters.\nIn Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza.\nOn Wednesday morning, Mr Biden held his fourth call with Mr Netanyahu since the conflict started.\nA statement released by the White House said: \"The president conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire.\"\nThe US has called before for a truce but has held up any joint UN statement, saying it would not help with de-escalation.\nThe Palestinian representative at the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the Security Council's failure to express a unified position \"shameful\".\nThe latest bid for a council resolution calling for a ceasefire, launched by France, failed on Wednesday when the US said it could \"undermine efforts to de-escalate\".\nOne Israeli military source told Reuters that Israel was assessing whether conditions were right for a truce.\nThe Ynet news website said that the Israelis were talking with Egyptian mediators. It quoted sources in the Israeli cabinet as saying Israel could achieve its objectives and end the fighting \"within days\".\nA Hamas leader said that efforts by mediators were \"serious and continuous\" but that Palestinian demands had to be met.\nEarlier on Wednesday Mr Netanyahu did not appear ready to begin a truce.\nHe said there were \"only two ways that you can deal with\" Hamas. \"You can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility, or you can deter them, and we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence, but I have to say we don't rule out anything.\"\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there had been renewed rocket fire from Gaza on Wednesday and that its fighter jets had attacked military infrastructure, including tunnels, and the homes of Hamas commanders.\nThe BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza said two Palestinian militants were killed in Gaza City, as dozens of strikes targeted both it and the southern city of Khan Younis. \nGaza City mother of seven Randa Abu Sultan, 45, told AFP news agency: \"My four-year-old son tells me he's scared that if he falls asleep, he'll wake up to find us dead.\"\nIDF spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman said Israel had tried to assassinate Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.\nMohammed Deif has survived repeated attempts on his life, including in the last major conflict in 2014. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown.\nSirens sounded across much of south and central Israel on Wednesday.\nHamas also targeted an Israeli air base overnight but the IDF said no bases were hit.\nOf the 3,750 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since the fighting began, 550 have fallen short in Gaza, according to the IDF. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system has intercepted about 90% of the rockets that have crossed into Israeli territory, it says.\nThe IDF estimated that at the start of the conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main groups in Gaza, had an arsenal of about 12,000 rockets or mortars.\nMr Netanyahu said the Israeli operation had \"set Hamas back by many years\".\nThere has also been unrest within Israel and in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinians took part in a general strike on Tuesday. There were clashes in several locations.\nSeparately on Wednesday, Turkey rejected US accusations that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had made anti-Semitic remarks about Israel. \nHe had accused Israel of \"terrorism\" against the Palestinians and recently said: \"It is in their nature\".\nState department spokesman Ned Price said the US found the remarks \"reprehensible\".\nOmer Celik, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan's party, said the president had given very strong messages against anti-Semitism, adding: \"Accusing our president of anti-Semitism is an illogical and untrue approach.

      "text": "Surge testing and jabs will be expanded to six new areas of concern in England to combat the spread of the Indian Covid variant, Matt Hancock has said.\nThe areas were identified using new techniques, including analysing wastewater and travel patterns, he told a Downing Street briefing.\nThe government is also supporting Scotland in rolling out more tests and vaccinations in Glasgow and Moray.\nSome 2,967 cases of the Indian variant have now been identified in the UK.\nThis is up from about 2,300 on Monday.\nMr Hancock said early evidence suggested that this variant - B.1.617.2 - passes on more easily from person to person than the one first discovered in Kent, adding that it was now \"even more important that people get vaccinated\".\nBut he said ministers were \"determined to do all that we can to ensure this new variant doesn't put our recovery at risk\".\nFurther surge testing and vaccinations will now be introduced in:\nThe health secretary said these were selected via \"an incredibly sensitive biosecurity surveillance system\", which spotted cases in earlier variant hotspots Bolton and Blackburn.\nMonitoring travel patterns, along with analysis of wastewater - or sewage - in 70% of the country had helped identify where variants were and also where they were at risk of spreading to, he said.\nOutlining the spread of the Indian variant, he added: \"The weekly case data in Bolton is now 283 per 100,000 and it doubled in the last week.\n\"There are now 25 people in Bolton Hospital with Covid - the majority are unvaccinated, nearly 90% have not yet had two vaccines.\n\"This shows the importance of getting vaccinated, not once but twice.\"\nScientists will know more about the transmissibility of the new Indian variant by \"some time next week\", England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said.\nOverall, a further three deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been recorded in the UK, and there have been 2,696 more cases overall. \nAnother 174,100 people have been given a first dose of a vaccine, and 324,001 more have received their second dose.\nThe spread of the Indian variant has cast doubt on plans to ease remaining restrictions in England next month.\nThe number of cases of Indian variant is climbing, but what this means remains to be seen.\nThe variant should soon be dominant - it is clearly more infectious than the UK variant which emerged last year.\nScientists are busy studying it to work out just how much more transmissible it is.\nThat means unpicking to what extent the rise is being driven by the sudden importation of the variant from abroad and the environmental factors in the communities where it is spreading. \nIn densely-populated housing conditions it's easier for the virus to be passed on - rather than because of an inherent biological advantage.\nScientists believe it could be anything between 10% to 50% more infectious depending on what influence each of those factors have.\nIf it's nearer 50%, that could drive a surge in cases that could spill over into significant hospital admissions even with the vaccine rollout.\nAt the lower end, the impact will be more muted and the full lifting of restrictions on 21 June could still be on.\nThere are some early signs it could be at the lower end, but it will be a week or two before we know that with any confidence.\nAt the briefing, Mr Hancock praised the UK's development of the AstraZeneca vaccine made by Oxford University, highlighting the worldwide benefits it had brought. He said:\n\"It is something every British taxpayer has had a part supporting and everyone in this United Kingdom should be incredibly proud of it,\" Mr Hancock said.\nMeanwhile, Prof Van-Tam told the news conference that scientists were sure the Indian variant was more transmissible but the \"million dollar question\" was how much more transmissible.\n\"We have a credible range that goes from a few per cent more transmissible through to 50% more transmissible - I think most people feel it is going to be somewhere in the middle... but it is just too early,\" he said.\nHowever, he said transmission of the new variant was \"not inevitable\" and it could be slowed down through \"cautious behaviour\".\n\"I think I've said 'don't tear the pants out of it' once before from this or a similar podium, but frankly we're back to that again now,\" he said.\nHe urged those living in hotspots to think carefully about their new freedoms and try to stick to outdoor activities in small groups.\nEarlier, at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said there was \"increasing confidence\" that Covid-19 vaccines were effective against all variants, including the Indian one.\nBut his official spokesman said ministers would want to see more information before making decisions on the next steps toward lifting lockdown.\nAt PMQs, Mr Johnson also repeated his warning that people should not be holidaying in amber list countries. This includes France, Spain and Greece.\nVisits to those countries should only be made in \"extreme\" circumstances such as a family illness, he said.\nEU ambassadors are recommending that restrictions on travel into the EU should be relaxed for fully vaccinated people, and those from countries with low infection rates. \nA decision on whether the UK will be included on a so-called \"white list\" will be made on Friday.\nPortugal, Italy and Greece have already dropped quarantine restrictions for British travellers and Spain is expected to make an announcement in the coming days.\nPortugal is the only EU country currently on the UK's own green list, allowing travellers to return without going into quarantine."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Southampton,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The public is being urged to take part in trials to find out whether a third dose of Covid vaccine could protect against new variants.\nAll seven vaccines the UK has ordered will be tested on working-age people and over-75s as part of a randomised trial.\nData on side-effects and immune responses will be gathered.\nThe findings will help vaccine advisers decide if re-vaccinating some people in the autumn is necessary.\nMore than 20 million people have been fully vaccinated - with two doses of a Covid vaccine - since the UK's vaccination programme started, but it's still not clear how long protection lasts.\nOffering some groups a third dose to boost protection from coronavirus ahead of winter has been suggested - but not confirmed. \nThe Cov-Boost study, which starts in June, will recruit 3,000 people of all ages who had their first dose in December or January, to test if this is worthwhile.\n\"It could be that some age groups may not need a booster and others do,\" said Prof Saul Faust, chief investigator for the trial, from the University of Southampton.\n\"We are not trying to say one is better than the other.\n\"The aim is to find out whether there should be a booster campaign and which vaccine to use,\" he said.\nProf Faust said he was not expecting any vaccines to be \"detrimental\" but some could cause high fevers or very sore arms, for example, which would be useful to know.\nThe vaccines will be trialled at 18 sites across the UK, and half doses will also be tested.\nThe full list of sites is: Southampton, London (University College Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and Northwick Park Harrow), Leicester, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Wrexham, Bradford, Oxford, Glasgow, Leeds, Cambridge, Birmingham, Brighton, Stockport, Liverpool and Exeter.\nParticipants will be asked to keep diaries of any side-effects after a third dose, which could be one of seven different Covid vaccines, and researchers will test participants' immune response after one, three and 12 months.\nThis involves testing their blood for antibodies to coronavirus - high levels are a sign that the body's defences are primed to fight off the virus.\nAll doses would be from current vaccines, designed to protect against the original form of the virus. \nIn addition to doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, some people will be given doses of vaccines from Novavax, Janssen, Valneva and CureVac, which are currently being trialled in large numbers of people, but have not yet been approved by the UK regulator. There will also be a control group, who will be given a dummy vaccine.\nEven though the study is using current vaccines, rather than vaccines which have been updated to target new variants, scientists say they expect a boost in antibodies which could be enough to protect against all circulating forms of the virus.\nDr Matthew Snape, associate professor of paediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said the study was a world-first and there would be global interest in the results.\nAnother study, called ComCov, which is testing using different doses of vaccines for the first and second doses found that mixing doses increased mild-to-moderate symptoms after vaccination.\nThe Cov-Boost study, which costs \u00a319.3 million, is being funded by the government and led by the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, as part of the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium (NISEC).

      "text": "The cost of a single-use plastic carrier bag in English shops has gone up from 5p to 10p.\nAll stores, big and small, have to apply the charge from Friday. Until now, smaller retailers were exempt. \nThe original 5p levy was introduced in England in 2015. Since then, the use of the bags has declined by more than 95%.\nCampaign group Friends of the Earth urged the government to go even further, saying the bags were part of a bigger plastic problem.\nThe group welcomed the scheme, but said it still had \"significant shortcomings\".\nCampaigners said the charge should be extended to paper carrier bags, while so-called \"bags for life\", which are designed to be reused but contain greater amounts of plastic, were posing a \"growing problem\". \n\"It seems that many plastic 'bags for life' are being used just once and not reused for the bag's lifetime, as is their purpose,\" said the group's plastics campaigner, Camilla Zerr.\n\"If ministers want to get to the root of this problem, they need to take a tougher stand against all single-use plastics.\"\nThe environmental group's warning has already been heeded by supermarkets including Morrisons and the Co-op, which have discontinued the sale of plastic bags for life.\nFriends of the Earth said the government's forthcoming Environment Bill should include \"legally binding targets\" to phase out the use of all unnecessary single-use plastic products.\nThe average person in England now buys just four single-use carrier bags a year from the main supermarkets, compared with 140 in 2014.\nBy extending the charge to all retailers, the government hopes the use of single-use carrier bags will fall by 70-80% in small and medium-sized businesses.\nEnvironment minister Rebecca Pow said: \"Everyone wants to play their part in reducing the scourge of plastic waste that blights our environment and oceans. \n\"The 5p bag charge has been hugely successful, but we can go further.\"\nShe added that the new higher charge in England would \"support the ambitious action\" the UK has already taken in its fight against plastic, \"as we build back greener\"."

      "text": "There must be a sustained focus on Northern Ireland's \"dreadful\" hospital waiting lists, a leading academic has said.\nNorthern Ireland has the worst waiting lists in the UK.\nIn April, the Department of Health estimated it could take up to 10 years to tackle the current lists.\nProf Deirdre Heenan, co-author of the Change or Collapse review of how to improve NI's health service, said a plan was needed to address the issue.\n\"I think we need to be honest with the public, to say we've lost control of this,\" she said.\nProf Heenan said she would like an assurance that there would be a dedicated full-time team putting an \"unrelenting focus\" on waiting lists.\nProf Heenan, a senior associate for the independent health think-tank Nuffield Trust in London, added that there appeared to be no accountability when health and care trusts missed their targets. \n\"I would really like to see a group of people managing a regional waiting list coming and telling the public what they're doing, setting targets, telling us what the plans are.\" \nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, she said many people in Northern Ireland had been waiting years for treatment for conditions such as hip replacements and cataract surgery.\nEileen Wilson, a  47-year-old mother of six, has been waiting for four years for a neurology appointment. \nIt is suspected she may have MS and can choke on food and has motor skill and bladder issues. \nShe said she hasn't heard from her hospital in four years.\n\"Every day is like living a battle really. I think if I had medication the symptoms would be under more control.\n\"I think to the NHS I'm just a name on a list, they don't see the people trying to live their lives.\n\"I feel my life's on hold. I have a granddaughter who's two and a half and I can't enjoy her, I just don't feel well enough.\"\nKevin McIvor, 36, suffers from scoliosis, a condition that causes the spine to curve abnormally and can crush internal organs.\nHe went to Turkey for a consultation after learning he faced \"years\" on the waiting list in Northern Ireland.\nMr McIvor is fundraising for surgery in Turkey.\n\"I received more care there [in Turkey] in that one day I was in that hospital. \n\"I was told I had three herniated discs, I was never told that before.\" \nMr McIvor said he had spent eight or nine hours in Antrim Hospital last year before being sent home. \n\"If they had picked up the severity of the scoliosis back then maybe I would be in a different place.\n\"I feel let down, the fact of the matter is that I require emergency surgery.\"\nMary Anderson, 65, is living with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia.\nShe was told she needed surgery on her ankle in June 2019, but needed a three-month review, due to her rheumatoid arthritis medication, before going onto the waiting list. \nThat review didn't happen until March 2020, and by then it was too late - a proper assessment could not be done due to the pandemic. She said she was now in \"limbo\".\n\"There's just that overwhelming sense of powerlessness. I'm stuck in constant pain,\" she said.\n\"It's very wearing in every sense.\n\"Some days I wake up and try to walk and it's very painful and other days it's not too bad but I never know day to day.\n\"It just becomes something that gnaws you down and leaves you feeling lost in the system.\"\nRoisin Curran is a 55-year-old mother of two.\nShe has been on tablets for a stomach complaint for two years, but has been advised to have a scope test to try to find the underlying problem. \nShe said she was shocked to be told she will wait at least two and a half years for the test.\n\"It would mean it would be five years since I'd been told I need to go on medication because of it. \n\" I just think it's too long to be waiting.\n\"The health service we have here, it's a disgrace.\"\nIt is not the first time we have heard from people facing long waits on waiting lists. \nPatients sound weary and demoralised. It is not just a case of their physical health, their mental health is affected as well. \nThe figures have been horrendous for a decade, if not more. We've had seven major health reports and six health ministers in that time, and very little has changed. \nIf you're told you are waiting six or seven years - what really does that mean? \nIt is a sign that the system is broken, so what are we going to do about it? \nThe pandemic has shone a light on the fact that when hospitals need to change, they can. Some of our hospitals and systems changed in a matter of weeks. Look at what happened with the Nightingale Hospital. \nUnfortunately, there doesn't seem to be the same agility, or the same desire, to change systems when it comes to other specialities across the system.\nBBC News NI asked the Department of Health to comment on the current waiting list difficulties and was referred to a ministerial statement, given by Health Minister Robin Swann, in the assembly on 13 April.\nMr Swann said he was \"absolutely determined to put this [waiting lists] right\" but described it as a \"long-term task\" that needed \"long-term, recurrent funding.\"\nHe told MLAs the pandemic had had a significant impact on \"our already appalling waiting lists\".\nIn March, the department's figures showed that almost all of NI's cancer waiting time targets were missed in the last quarter.\nIn December 2020, 792 people began treatment, 93.4% of them within 31 days, missing the 95% target.\nThere was also a breach in the target to see all urgent breast cancer referrals within 14 days.\nThe Department of Health has been asked for comment."

      "text": "The prime minister has publicly apologised to the families of the 10 people killed in Ballymurphy in 1971\nBoris Johnson began prime minister's questions on Wednesday by reading the names of the victims.\nHe went on to say that he was sorry for how the investigations were handled and for the pain endured by the families.\nLast week an inquest found that the victims, who were shot during an Army operation in Belfast, were \"entirely innocent\".\nMr Johnson told the House of Commons: \"No apology can lessen their lasting pain, I hope they may take some comfort in the answers they have secured and in knowing this has renewed the government's determination to ensure in future that other families can find answers without distress and delay.\" \nJohn Teggart, whose father Daniel was one of those killed in Ballymurphy, has called Boris Johnson's apology \"totally unacceptable\" and said he \"personally rejects it\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Mr Teggart labelled Mr Johnson's apology \"totally insincere\" and said it \"again has caused annoyance to the families\".\nMr Teggart ruled out ever meeting the prime minister and said he \"wouldn't waste a minute of his time with him\". \n\"I won't be letting him annoy me anymore, I have no time for him and his feeble attempts to apologise,\" Mr Teggart said. \nHe said Mr Johnson's apology should have focused on \"our loved ones who were murdered\" and not how the investigation was handled. \nMary Kate Quinn, whose uncle John Laverty was killed in Ballymurphy, said the Balllymurphy families \"were not informed\" that Mr Johnson was making a statement on Wednesday in the House of Commons. \nIn a tweet, Ms Quinn said: \"We found out from journalists. Yet again, that was not an apology. Boris did not apologise for the killings of our loved ones.\"\nAmong the victims were a priest who was trying to help the wounded and a mother of eight.\nNine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said.\nHowever, Mrs Justice Keegan said she could not definitively rule who shot the tenth victim, former World War Two soldier John McKerr.\nFamilies of the victims received a written apology from Mr Johnson last week, which they said had angered them. \nThey said the letter was received minutes before Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis apologised in Parliament for \"the events at Ballymurphy\" in 1971.\nMr Lewis said the events at Ballymurphy should never have happened.\nMr Johnson also told Parliament that the UK government was committed to introducing legislation in the current session to address the legacy of the Troubles.\n\"And to introduce a fair package for veterans as well, to protect them from unfair, vexatious litigation where no new evidence has been brought forward,\" Mr Johnson said. \nThe government is to bring forward legislation in the course of the next year to deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles.\nBased on details of the plan leaked in recent weeks, it is proposed that all prosecutions prior to 1998 and related to the Troubles will, in future, be banned under a statute of limitations.\nSinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald said Mr Johnson had added \"insult to injury\". \n\"I don't think that he has delivered anything that approximates a sincere or complete apology,\" Ms McDonald said. \n\"The bigger problem beyond that is that Boris Johnson and his government are determined to deliver an amnesty for British soldiers.\"\nSDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said Mr Johnson's apology was \"too little, too late\".\n\"I don't know why he couldn't make a proper apology to the families last week when he had many, many opportunities,\" Mr Eastwood said. \n\"He didn't actually apologise for their loved ones being killed by British soldiers. I just think it was frankly insulting to the victims.\"\nMr Eastwood said the prime minister should have met the families in Belfast. \nSimon Hoare, Northern Ireland Affairs Committee chair, said he had hoped the prime minister would give an apology and he was pleased that he had now done so. \n\"I think it was the right thing for the prime minister to do,\" Mr Hoare said.

He was wearing black jogging trousers, a black hooded jumper with the hood up, black trainers and a face mask. \nOfficers said a silver or grey hatchback car was also seen near to the house at the time of the fire.\nDet Insp Susie Cairns said: \"This was a completely reckless act which destroyed three cars and caused significant damage to the property's garage. \n\"The consequences could have been so much worse.\"\nShe urged anyone who was in the area at the time or who has relevant dashcam footage to get in touch with officers.\nThe Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed eight appliances responded to the blaze.\nMr Lawwell confirmed in January he is to retire at the end of June after 17 years at Celtic.\nHe has been replaced by Dominic McKay, who has already moved from Scottish Rugby to take up the post. \nA Celtic spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm that significant damage has been caused to Peter Lawwell's house and vehicles there, following an explosion and fire early this morning, forcing the family to leave the property.\"\n\"Clearly, Peter's family are extremely shaken and shocked by these terrible events, but thankfully all are safe.\""

      "tags": "Medical devices,Breast implants",
      "text": "Thousands of women who were victims of the PIP breast implant scandal should receive compensation, a French appeal court has decided.\nWomen involved in the case say they are elated and exhausted after 10 years of fighting for justice.\nThe court also upheld an earlier judgement finding German safety body TUV Rheinland negligent.\nTUV said it had acted \"diligently\", and that women must prove they had a PIP implant to be entitled to compensation.\nIt awarded safety certificates for faulty breast implants made by French company Poly Implant Proth\u00e8se (PIP).\nThe court decision could have far-reaching implications for thousands of other victims around the world.\nJan Spivey, one of 540 British women involved in the case, was given PIP implants after she had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. \nAfter hearing the decision, she said she was \"elated and exhausted\".\n\"It's been a very long journey,\" she said.\n\"We've been in and out of court, and that's been really difficult for women. We've got health issues and we've got lots of other responsibilities too - PIP has had an impact on the whole of our lives.\n\"It's been an inescapable issue.\"\nJan developed aching joints, pain and fatigue after having the implants, and once they were removed it was clear they had been leaking silicone into her body.\n\"My PIP implants from 20 years ago are still impacting on my life and my health and my wellbeing, even today,\" Jan said.\n\"I think I've been angry every single day for the 20 years I've been affected by PIP.\"\nOlivier Auma\u00eetre, the lawyer representing Jan Spivey and around 2,700 others in the current case, said it was an historic day for the victims and for women's rights. He said the company would now have to fully compensate all the women judged to be victims.  \n\"I'm very happy for all the women I represent who have waited for such a long time for this decision and suffered for such long periods,\" he said. \nBut many hundreds of women in the UK are still waiting for legal decisions on their cases and their right to compensation.\nOliver Thorn, lawyer with Slee Blackwell Solicitors, represents 500 women. He said many still had their breast implants in place because they did not have the money to get them replaced, and that was why they needed compensation. \n\"The cosmetic surgery industry as a whole needs to sit up and see what has gone on here and it's time things were changed,\" he said.\nThe president of The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Mary O'Brien said the UK medicines' regulator, the MHRA, had an important role in ensuring a similar scandal over implants never happened again.\n\"The human cost and distress to many women and their families following surgery involving PIP implants is sobering,\" she said.\nPlastic surgeons supported the setting up of a breast implant registry to improve patient safety. \nThey advise patients to consult their surgeon if concerned about symptoms related to their implants and read all reliable sources of information before undergoing breast implant surgery for any reason.\nAnother woman affected by the case, Nicola Mason - who had breast implants which then ruptured - said the court decision was \"a victory, it's amazing\".\n\"We've waited a long time for this,\" she told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.\nNicola first found out about the rupture when she was pregnant, after noticing a large lump under her arm. \nShe said it was \"quite traumatic and there was absolutely nothing I could do\".\nEventually, the implants were removed but she says she has been left with a massive lump of silicone under her arm which still flares up.\n\"I don't think anyone knows the long-term effects,\" she says. \nBetween 2001 and 2010 the substandard implants were manufactured by the French company Poly Implant Proth\u00e8se or PIP.\nIt was liquidated in 2010 and its founder was later given a prison sentence after it emerged the implants were filled with cheap, industrial-grade silicone which was not cleared for human use. \nIt is estimated up to 400,000 women worldwide have received the illegal implants. \nLatin America was worst hit, in particular Colombia, where there are estimated to be 60,000 victims. In the UK it is thought 47,000 women are affected.\nThe case, known as TUV1, was the first to be brought, a decade ago, against TUV Rheinland which issued European safety certificates for the PIP implants.\nLawyers for the German company said they disagreed with the French court's decision for holding the company liable, \"even partly\".\n\"The evidence in this case clearly shows that T\u00dcV Rheinland acted diligently, in compliance with applicable regulations,\" they said.\nAt no time, the company said, had it been aware that breast implants manufactured by PIP were not compliant.\nThe ruling is expected to have wider implications for almost 20,000 other women, half of whom are British, who are taking similar legal action in France.\nAlifie Jones is recovering at home after having her faulty PIP breast implants removed last month. \nShe was finally convinced by a friend to take them out after suffering years of extreme exhaustion and debilitating pain.\nShe says the worst thing about it was wondering why she felt so ill all the time: \"Not knowing what it was, the mysterious illnesses, not being able to exercise. Not being vibrant, having my life, sort of stolen from me in a way.\" \nThe surgeon was shocked by what he found when he removed one of the implants. It had broken into multiple pieces inside her - exposing her body to an industrial-grade silicone gel.\n\"I can't believe they were allowed to be implanted in me. I don't know how they got through regulations.\n\"But I feel guilty that I messed about with my body and I put them in in the first place. But I'm angry that a human being can do that to another human being.\"\nDid you receive a PIP implant?

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nTravellers should use \"common sense\" when considering overseas trips, the transport secretary has said, as he defended the UK's traffic light system. Grant Shapps said people should only go to countries on the \"amber\" list in \"exceptional circumstances\", amid concern over the Indian Covid variant. The boss of airline EasyJet said people were \"confused\" by the system. Follow the story here.\nAn initial \u00a3100m will be spent to try and deal with the record backlog of NHS treatments caused by the pandemic, Wales' new health minister has said. Eluned Morgan said the money will \"kick start\" the recovery of the health and care system. All health boards will get a share of the funding for new equipment, staff and promoting \"new ways of working\". Last month NHS Wales statistics showed more people were on waiting lists than ever before. \nIn the latest expansion of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, people aged from 25 to 29 years are now eligible for a Covid-19 jab. Supplies remain limited but there will be about 20,000 slots available weekly, with additional slots released every Thursday. England's rollout has reached the 34 and over age group, people aged 40 and over in Scotland have been invited to have their jabs but in some parts of Glasgow 18-39 year olds can book, while in Wales everyone aged 18 and over is being offered a vaccine.\nThey've been hailed as virus success stories - places that have seen virtually zero or single-digit Covid cases since the start of the year. But Singapore and Taiwan have seen a sudden and aggressive rise in cases - with Singapore logging 248 new infections just last week, and 1,200 in Taiwan. By global standards, these numbers may seem small - but for these places, such figures would have been unthinkable just months ago.

He was reportedly able to carry on with telephone and online engagements.\nIn January, it was announced that the Queen had received her Covid jab from a household doctor at Windsor Castle. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall received theirs in February.\nThe progress of the vaccine rollout varies across the UK. Over-30s are eligible in Scotland, while Northern Ireland has started offering the vaccination to anyone aged over 25.\nIn Wales, some areas have seen almost half of those aged under 30 receive first doses."

      "text": "Covid-19 has now been overtaken by flu and pneumonia as a cause of death in Wales, latest mortality analysis shows.\nFor six of the past 13 months, Covid-19 was the biggest cause of death in Wales but in April it was the 18th leading cause.\nThere were 35 deaths due to Covid in April - 1.4% of all deaths, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed.\nThis was also the largest month-on-month fall since the pandemic began.\nIt was a 81.5% fall compared to March.\nThe age standardised mortality rate was 12.6 deaths per 100,000 - the lowest since last September.\nHeart disease, dementia/Alzheimer's disease and strokes are the biggest causes of death - while even flu and pneumonia have now overtaken Covid, although this is still two-thirds lower than the five-year average.\nAbout 92% of communities across Wales experienced no deaths due to Covid at all in April. \nOnly Holyhead on Anglesey - with two deaths - had more than one.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South and Llasanffraid Glan Conwy.\nCovid accounted for 19% of all deaths in the first four months of 2021 but this was at the peak of the pandemic at the start of the year and it has shown a dramatic decline since. \nIt was responsible for 6.3% of all registered deaths in March; it was 22.2% in February and 35.2% in January.\nSeparate figures earlier this week showed so-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are now below the five-year average for the 10th successive week. \nThe number of deaths involving Covid-19 was five in the latest week - the lowest total since early September. \nThese accounted for 0.9% of all deaths, according to the ONS.\nThe trend has been for a steady decline and is 92% fewer Covid deaths than registered two months ago. \nDuring the latest week, up to 7 May, there were no deaths in 17 out of Wales' local authority areas, including across the Aneurin Bevan, Cardiff and Vale, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas.

      "tags": "Social mobility,Social class,Accents,Civil Service",
      "text": "Top Whitehall civil servants are even posher today than in the 1960s, says the Social Mobility Commission (SMC). \nHidden rules favour those with the \"right accent\", a report - Navigating the Labyrinth - claims. \nAlmost three-quarters (72%) of those in senior posts are from privileged homes, up from two-thirds (67%) in 1967.\nThe survey of more than 300,000 civil servants found a \"behavioural code\" that makes it harder for people from working-class homes to get promoted. \nOnly 18% of senior civil servants are from a low socio-economic background, says the SMC, the body appointed by government to advise on social mobility, \nMost of the 445,000 civil servants are employed by government departments.\nJobs range from administrative and operational roles such as prison officers and tax collectors, up to permanent secretaries, the most senior grade, who work with ministers to run their departments.  \nAmong those top Whitehall mandarins, 59% attended a private school - three times the rate among the wider population.\nThe permanent secretary at the Department for Transport who leads on social mobility, Bernadette Kelly, has welcomed the report.  \n\"It chimes with much of my experience in talking to colleagues right across the civil service, and at all grades, about social mobility,\" she says.\n\"The sense that there is a hidden route to the top that those from more privileged backgrounds find easier to navigate.\"\nThose from advantaged backgrounds are defined as having parents in professional or managerial occupations. \nThe parents of those defined as coming from disadvantaged backgrounds had either never worked, or had jobs such as drivers, cleaners, receptionists or mechanics. \nThere is a culture that favours polish over performance, creating a \"class ceiling\" that prevents people from poorer backgrounds getting the top jobs, the report finds.\nOne civil servant told researchers how senior staff would sometimes break into Latin.  \n\"I know that is a bit of a stereotype, but it is so real,\" Kristine says. \n\"You'll be in a ministerial meeting and they'll sort of talk in Latin, but they're making what you'll realise later is a sort of joke about Brussels that everyone sort of understands, and laughs.\"  \nThe report identifies how \"cosy fireside chats\" conducted in a neutral received pronunciation accent help those with the right background navigate the \"velvet drainpipe\" of recruitment. \n\"There is a definite style of speaking,\" one interviewee tells researchers in the report. \nAnother civil servant says people with working-class accents tend to fare less well: \"I used to put on a bit of an accent or try to enunciate a little bit better,\" Pauline says. \"Ridiculous and humiliating, when I look back on it.\"\nThe report finds those from advantaged backgrounds are much more likely to work in policy jobs in Whitehall, benefiting from \"the propulsive power of being in London\". \nTwo-thirds of civil servants in the capital come from privileged backgrounds, compared with 41% in north-east England.  \nThe government has plans to reform the civil service, initiated by the prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings, but this has been delayed by the pandemic. \nMr Cummings said he wanted to encourage \"weirdos and misfits with odd skills\" to work in government.\nOne ambition is to move more officials out of London, but the Social Mobility Commission warns the proposal to relocate 22,000 civil servants away from the capital risks increasing the concentration of civil servants from advantaged backgrounds still further. \n\"The civil service should be a role model for fair recruitment and career progression,\" says the report. \nThe authors accept that the civil service is acutely aware it needs to do better, and has made progress on diversity and inclusion.   \nHowever, getting in is not enough and more action is needed to nurture career progression, the report says. \n\"When I get feedback, one of the things [staff from disadvantaged backgrounds] raise is the degree to which the conversation is all about politics and about people on Twitter that everyone's following,\" civil servant Alistair tells the researchers.  \n\"You know, the majority of the country are not reading these tweets. Probably the entire audience for this tweet that we're discussing at the moment is in this room!\" "

      "tags": "Princess Diana, Princess of Wales,UK Royal Family,BBC,The Royal Family and the media",
      "text": "The BBC fell short of \"high standards of integrity and transparency\" over Martin Bashir's 1995 interview with Princess Diana, an inquiry has found.\nBashir acted in a \"deceitful\" way and faked documents to obtain the interview, the inquiry said.\nAnd the BBC's own internal probe in 1996 into what happened was \"woefully ineffective\", it added.\nThe BBC and Bashir have both apologised, and the BBC has written to Princes William and Harry.\nThe corporation said the report showed \"clear failings\", admitting it should have made more effort to get to the bottom of what happened at the time. \nAs well as Diana's sons, the BBC has also written apologies to Prince Charles and Diana's brother Earl Spencer. It is also returning all awards the interview received, including a TV Bafta won in 1996.\nBashir said mocking up the documents \"was a stupid thing to do\" and he regretted it, but said they had had no bearing on Diana's decision to be interviewed.\nLord Dyson - the retired judge who led the inquiry - found: \nPrincess Diana's interview with Bashir for Panorama was a huge scoop for the BBC - in it, the princess famously said: \"There were three of us in this marriage.\"\nIt was the first time a serving royal had spoken so openly about life in the Royal Family - viewers saw her speak about her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles, their affairs, and her bulimia.\nBut since then Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, has questioned Bashir's tactics to get the interview.\nThe independent inquiry was commissioned by the BBC last year, after Earl Spencer went public with the allegations. Its findings were published on Thursday.\nThe earl told BBC Panorama: \"Well, the irony is that I met Martin Bashir on the 31st of August 1995 - because exactly two years later she died, and I do draw a line between the two events.\"\nHe said it was \"quite clear\" from when he introduced Bashir to Diana in September 1995 that \"everyone was going to be made untrustworthy, and I think that Diana did lose trust in really key people\".\nPatrick Jephson - Diana's former private secretary - said the interview \"destroyed remaining links with Buckingham Palace\".\nHe said after the interview, Diana lost \"the royal support structure that had guided and safeguarded her for so many years\" which \"inevitably made her vulnerable to people who didn't have her best interests at heart, or were unable properly to look after her\".\nLord Dyson found that Bashir deceived Earl Spencer by showing him forged bank statements that falsely suggested individuals - including Mr Jephson - were being paid for keeping the princess under surveillance.\nThe inquiry said Bashir had later lied, telling BBC managers he had not shown the fake documents to anyone. \nAnd it described significant parts of Bashir's account of the events of 1995 as \"incredible, unreliable, and in some cases dishonest\".\nThe Dyson Report shows a catalogue of moral, professional and editorial failures at the BBC in the 1990s, which occur on three main levels. \nFirst, the interview of the century was obtained by deception. Martin Bashir has admitted to forging bank statements. This report says he lied repeatedly to several people, including at the BBC.\nSecond, the investigation led by future director general Tony Hall was \"woefully ineffective\". Bashir was believed far too readily. Earl Spencer was not interviewed. Crucially, Dyson rejects the grounds given for this failure by Hall and his team.\nFinally, Dyson uses a phrase which he knows to be explosive. There was a \"covering up\". The origin of the cover up is not clear. But no matter: the BBC conspired, on vast scale, to deceive the public it is funded by and serves. \nThis report will not just injure the BBC, but scar it. And it should be granted that though it shows the historic failures of BBC journalists, it also shows the power and merit of journalism. \nIt is thanks to determined reporters, not least at the Daily Mail group and the Sunday Times, that we today have the first full account of the real story behind the most remarkable - and arguably consequential - interview in television history.\nIn a statement, Bashir apologised for mocking up the documents, but said he remained \"immensely proud\" of the interview.\nHe said: \"The bank statements had no bearing whatsoever on the personal choice by Princess Diana to take part in the interview. \n\"Evidence handed to the inquiry in her own handwriting unequivocally confirms this, and other compelling evidence presented to Lord Dyson reinforces it.\"\nFor the first time, Diana's note that she wrote after the interview was broadcast has been published as part of the inquiry.\nIn it, she wrote: \"Martin Bashir did not show me any documents, nor give me any information that I was not previously aware of.\"\nAs well as Bashir, the report also criticises the BBC over how it handled the claims about Bashir's tactics.\nIn 1996, the BBC carried out its own investigation which cleared Bashir, Panorama and BBC News of wrongdoing.\nLord Dyson said that investigation - led by then-director of news, and future director general, Lord Hall - was \"woefully ineffective\".\nAnd as scrutiny from the press increased, the BBC gave \"evasive\" answers to journalists' questions, he said.\nWhen the BBC was asked about the bank statements by journalists in March 1996, senior BBC officials - including Lord Hall - already knew Bashir had lied three times about not having shown them to Earl Spencer, the report said.\nBut the BBC press office told journalists that Bashir was \"an honest and honourable man\".\nLord Dyson said he was \"satisfied that the BBC covered up in its press logs such facts as it had been able to establish about how Bashir secured the interview\". \nHe said the BBC \"fell short of the high standards of integrity and transparency which are its hallmark\".\nIn a statement, Lord Hall said he was wrong to give Bashir the \"benefit of the doubt\" at the time. \nHe added: \"Throughout my 35-year career at the BBC, I have always acted in ways I believe were fair, impartial and with the public interest front and centre. \n\"While Lord Dyson does not criticise my integrity, I am sorry that our investigation failed to meet the standards that were required.\"\nThe BBC's current director general, Tim Davie, said: \"Although the report states that Diana, Princess of Wales, was keen on the idea of an interview with the BBC, it is clear that the process for securing the interview fell far short of what audiences have a right to expect. We are very sorry for this. Lord Dyson has identified clear failings.\n\"While today's BBC has significantly better processes and procedures, those that existed at the time should have prevented the interview being secured in this way. \n\"The BBC should have made greater effort to get to the bottom of what happened at the time and been more transparent about what it knew.\n\"While the BBC cannot turn back the clock after a quarter of a century, we can make a full and unconditional apology. The BBC offers that today.\"\nBBC News understands that in a letter sent by Mr Davie to Prince Charles, Mr Davie apologised for Bashir's \"lurid and untrue claims\" about the prince, members of his staff and other members of the royal family.\nThe letter said the BBC accepts that Mr Bashir made the claims \"intending to play on the princess's fears, in order to arouse her interest in him, and without concern for the impact on those he maligned\".\nThe chairman of the corporation, Richard Sharp, said the BBC \"unreservedly accepted\" the report's findings that there were \"unacceptable failures\". \n\"We take no comfort from the fact that these are historic,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Lord Birt - who was BBC director general at the time of the interview - said thanks to the inquiry, \"we now know that the BBC harboured a rogue reporter on Panorama\".\nHe said it was a \"shocking blot on the BBC's enduring commitment to honest journalism\" and it was a matter of \"the greatest regret\" that it had taken 25 years for the truth to emerge.\nBashir, 58, is one of the most well-known journalists in the UK. \nAs well as Diana, he also made headlines for his 2003 interview with the pop star Michael Jackson. He has worked for ITV and various US television networks.\nLast week he left the BBC, citing ongoing health issues. He had been the corporation's religion correspondent and editor since 2016.\nLord Grade - who was BBC chairman between 2004 and 2006 - said the BBC's \"cover-up\" had been worse than Bashir's behaviour.\n\"It's taken 25 years to get the truth. It raises the question in your mind, how many more cover-ups are there in the files of BBC journalism that we haven't been told about?\"\nFormer BBC governor Sir Richard Eyre said the board of governors would have insisted on a full inquiry if they had known about Bashir's actions.\n\"The fact that Bashir lied should have been made clear to us, but in my memory, it never was,\" he said. \"We can see now that the false bank statements were the lever that opened the doors to the access to Diana.\"\nA Panorama investigation into the interview - delayed from last week - was shown at 19:00 BST on BBC One."

      "text": "A brief visit by Tesla boss Elon Musk to Luton has ignited rumours that he is considering a Tesla factory in the UK.\nThe electric car mogul flew into Luton Airport on a private jet last weekend and stayed two days, reports say.\nThe Daily Telegraph reports that the visit coincides with a hunt by UK officials for \"a major new car plant\" location.\nThe secrecy around the bids has led to speculation that Mr Musk may be involved.\nThe Telegraph reported (behind a paywall) that regional authorities - including those in Teesside and the West Midlands - were given an unusually short 48 hours to prepare bids for a 250-hectare site, without being told what company the bid was for.\nThe process was run by the Office for Investment, a new government office which is designed to help smooth out discussions between the public sector and private foreign investors post-Brexit.\nFlight-tracking software showed that a private Gulfstream jet widely reported to belong to Mr Musk, landed at Luton Airport from California.\nThe plane then moved on to Germany, where Mr Musk paid a visit on Monday to the site of Tesla's large \"gigafactory\", which has been plagued by delays.\nHowever, neither the government nor Tesla have confirmed the speculation about Mr Musk's brief stop in the UK. \nIt's also not the first time Mr Musk has landed in Luton for a brief visit, fuelling such rumours - he was reported to have made a similar stop in June last year.\nFor Elon Musk, Luton Airport - with its private terminal for corporate jets - may be just a handy place for a brief stop on his way to inspect his German operations. \nBut for a UK government desperate to boost inward investment, the stopovers - and there have been several - are a vital opportunity to woo the Tesla tycoon.\nTwo years ago he made it clear that Brexit uncertainty was a factor in rejecting the UK and choosing Berlin as the location for Tesla's \"gigafactory\", which the company bills as \"the most advanced high-volume electric vehicle production plant in the world\".\nBut British officials have not given up, stressing that outside the EU those pesky state aid rules don't apply, meaning there could be substantial government funding for a factory here.\nNow it's still hard to see the logic for a Tesla plant  just to supply the UK market - but Elon Musk has shown himself to be adept at taking advantage of government subsidies and tax breaks at home in the US, as well as in Germany. So don't rule it out quite yet."

He has since undergone a quadruple heart bypass and another heart operation more recently.\nThe decision to push back the Panorama episode comes shortly after a separate investigation into the interview - led by Lord Dyson - had concluded.\nThe BBC said Bashir had co-operated fully with the inquiry and would not comment publicly while that process was ongoing.\nLord Dyson, who was Master of the Rolls - the second most senior judge in England and Wales, had been tasked with looking into the steps Bashir and the corporation took to get the interview.\nHis report has been given to the BBC, which the broadcaster said would be published \"very soon\".\nNearly 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama interview, recorded 25 years ago.\nIn the interview, Diana famously said that \"there were three of us in this marriage\", referring to Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time she was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced.\nThe princess also talked frankly about her difficulties with post-natal depression and bulimia.\nDiana's son, the Duke of Cambridge, welcomed the launch of the inquiry late last year and his brother, the Duke of Sussex, reportedly also supported it.\nQuestions arose late last year over the interview, which was one of the most watched BBC programmes of all time and won Bashir a Bafta TV award.\nDiana's brother, Earl Spencer, said Bashir had used forged bank statements to persuade the princess to do the interview.\nIt was reported by the Daily Mail that the statements wrongly purported to show that two senior courtiers were being paid by the security services for information on his sister.\nThe BBC has previously apologised for the use of the statements, but has insisted they played \"no part in her decision to take part in the interview\".\nIn March, police ruled out a criminal investigation into the background to the interview."

I'm nearly 82, I'm pretty active and I love to go away.\"\nAlthough he is hoping to travel in September, he is not sure whether he can re-book or get his money back.\nFlights with Vueling from Cardiff have been operating to Alicante since 25 March and to Malaga since 1 May, in order for people to travel for essential reasons, such as to provide care, to work, education, or for health reasons.\nWales has adopted a traffic light-system similar to that in England and Scotland, placing countries on green, amber, and red lists, depending on Covid rates, with people urged to check the rules of the country of destination before booking.\nWhile it is no longer illegal to travel abroad to go on holiday, Wales' First Minister Drakeford has said people should not jet off anywhere amid concerns about new variants of Covid.\nCardiff Airport CEO Spencer Birns said: \"Cardiff Airport has remained open throughout the pandemic to support essential flights such as cargo, maintenance flights, elite sports team travel and passenger flights to facilitate essential travel, in line with UK and Welsh Government regulations.\n\"Airlines are reviewing their flying programmes on a global basis, and we advise all customers to check with their airline or tour operator for the latest updates on their trip. \n\"We continue to advise our customers to check the relevant government guidance on travelling to and from Wales, and to also check the restrictions of the country that they are travelling to.\"\nMr Birns said further information can be found on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office website, on the airport's website and on the websites of airlines and tour operators.\nMr Drakeford admitted his advice against foreign travel was not a rule because it would be \"unenforceable\", with many people from Wales flying from Manchester, Bristol and London airports.\nBut he urged caution against \"importing\" coronavirus from other parts of the world, and stressed people should \"think of their own safety and the safety of others\".\nThousands of Wales football fans are hoping to watch their team in the Euros next month as Wales play Switzerland and Turkey in Baku before facing Italy in Rome.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people not to travel to amber list countries on holiday.\nDespite it now being legal to travel for leisure to countries on the amber list, official advice is to only to do so for essential reasons like work and or caring for a relative.\n\"If people do go to an amber list country, they absolutely have to for some pressing family or urgent business reason, then please bear in mind that you will have to self-isolate, you'll have to take tests and do your passenger locator form and all the rest of it,\" Mr Johnson said."

      "text": "A woman whose mother died with Covid says a lack of basic information about her death has left her feeling \"numb\" and finding it difficult to grieve.\nViolet Hughes died at Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil, in September.\nThe 82-year-old's daughter Suzanne said she had been unable to find out if she was alone when she died, details of her treatment and her time of death.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board said it was \"committed to learning lessons\" from concerns raised by families.\nSuzanne, from Merthyr, said she wanted a Covid public inquiry to look into the way hospitals communicated with affected families.\nHer mother suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and kidney failure, and had been in hospital with similar symptoms before.\nThe following day the hospital called Suzanne to say a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) notice had been put in place for her mother.\nHowever, she was also told it was believed her mother could recover so an end-of-life plan was not being activated, meaning under Covid regulations Ms Hughes could not visit.\nShe called the hospital throughout the day and was told her mum was \"fine\" and sitting up in bed.\nWhen she called at about 17:20 BST, she was told Violet had tested positive for Covid-19 but was OK and being given oxygen.\nThen about 90 minutes later, Suzanne was called by the hospital and told to come in as her mum had deteriorated.\nBy the time she arrived a short time later, her mother had died. \n\"My mum was cold, had no colour,\" said Suzanne.\n\"I asked what time my mother had passed away, she [a member of staff] was unable to give me that info.\n\"She told me the nurse that was in charge of my mother had left to go home.\n\"So I said surely there was some handover in regards to the information about my mother and she said, 'oh I don't know anything about it, I've just come on to the ward'.\"\nA time of death has still not been given, nor have details about Violet's final hours as her medical notes are blank from 14:00 onwards - other than an entry stating that Suzanne had been informed of the positive Covid test. \nSuzanne said not being able to get information, such as whether any treatment for coronavirus was given, was \"awful\".\nShe added: \"I just wanted to know certain answers to questions and it felt as if I was being forgotten.\n\"I didn't feel there was any dignity. There was no respect given to us as a family, nor to my mother. \n\"That's quite hard, that's difficult to accept.\n\"I just dwell on the facts. I don't know when she died, how she died and was anyone with her. I don't know anything.\n\"The impact is so emotional. Was my mum alone, was somebody with her? It's playing on our minds.\n\"I'm just thinking if they'd provided a Covid treatment maybe she would have had more time to spend with her family.\n\"Would she have been here today?\"\nGreg Dix, director of nursing and patient care at Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board said: \"While we are unable to comment on the circumstances of individual cases, losing a loved one is devastating for any family and our thoughts and sympathies are with them.\n\"We take the quality of care and treatment provided to our patients extremely seriously and apologise to anyone who feels let down by our health board or where the level of care has fallen short. \n\"We remain committed to learning lessons from the pandemic as well as the experiences of any patients or families who raise concerns with us so we can continually work to improve our standards of care.\""

      "tags": "Organ donation,NHS England",
      "text": "In the last year, the organs of 296 people have been donated under a new law which makes all adults in England potential donors unless they opt out. \nThis accounts for 29% of all donors (1,021) since 20 May 2020 and resulted in a total of 714 organs being transplanted. \nMax and Keira's Law has been in force in England for 12 months.\nThe 'opt-out' system has been in place in Wales since 2015 and in Scotland since March this year. \nUnder the law in England, people are presumed to have consented to their organs being donated after their death unless they had opted-out, although relatives are consulted and can still block organ donations.\nA number of groups are not covered by the opt-out rule including those who lack the mental capacity to understand the new arrangements and people who have lived in England for under 12 months. \nThe legislation was named after Max Johnson, a boy who received a heart transplant and Keira Ball, the girl who donated it.\nMaggie Sturgess was driving her partner to a hospital appointment when she suffered a sudden, fatal brain haemorrhage.\nThe pub landlady from Buckinghamshire had not signed up as an organ donor, but under the new rule her kidneys and liver were donated to others, saving three lives.\nMaggie's daughter Lizzie Durning said: \"Mum was known for her zest for life and generous nature. She lived for the moment and never wanted to talk about death as she felt she was 'too young for that'. \n\"As a family it was difficult to suddenly find ourselves having to make that decision as well as cope with her death.\n\"Ultimately we decided that organ donation was the right decision. It fitted with mum's generous nature and we have known people waiting for transplant. \n\"Our Christmas was never going to be good, but it felt right if we could make someone else's just that bit better.\"\nThe law came into force on 20 May 2020 and the latest figures show that up to 30 April, 296 people were considered to be willing to donate, despite not having expressed an organ donation decision during their lifetime.\nThe NHS says that before the law change, 80% of the public said they supported the practice in principle, but only 38% of people had formally opted into organ donation, with the majority saying they simply hadn't got round to registering as a donor. \nSince April 2016, 2,433 people across the UK have died while waiting for a donation.\nCoronavirus has hit the number of transplants as patients who tested positive for the virus cannot donate.\nThe risk of proceeding with a transplant is also greater as recipients must be heavily immunosuppressed meaning an increased chance of catching coronavirus.\nRecipients must take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives to keep the immune system from attacking the transplanted organs.\nSimran - who was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease at the age of 13 - had been one of those campaigning for the law change. \nFor five years she had been on the waiting list for a kidney transplant but never once received a single potential call. \n\"I began to think that my transplant call would never come,\" she says.  \n\"From March 2018 I was reliant on daily dialysis, which lasted for 10 hours every night.\n\"The dialysis meant I couldn't sleep on my side and some nights the pain was so bad it would wake me up.\n\"Waiting for a transplant also means I wasn't really able to go abroad for a holiday, in case a kidney became available.\n\"Being from an Indian background, I was told early on that I could end up waiting longer for my transplant.\n\"When I finally got my call last September, I honestly couldn't believe it, I was in shock. \n\"The news only really sunk in when I returned home after the operation and saw my dialysis machine had been replaced by a bedside table - I burst into tears.\n\"While recovery took some time, it was just wonderful to finally be free of daily dialysis and I have even been well enough to start university. \n\"I used to feel tired all the time and felt like I couldn't stay out of my house for long. \n\"I worried I would miss out on having a university experience - now I'm hoping to be able to move into halls of residence.\n\"I am just so grateful to the donor and their family who said yes and made all this possible.\"\nJohn Forsythe, medical director at NHS Blood and Transplant praised the \"strength\" of families whose relatives donated organs after their death, adding: \"Many have told us how organ donation offered comfort in an otherwise tragic situation.\"\nFiona Loud, policy director at Kidney Care UK said: \"Simran's experience is sadly not unique - many people, particularly those from South Asian Communities, are waiting longer for a suitable kidney. \n\"Yet Max and Keira's Law offers so much hope to those who are still waiting, in need of a kidney transplant. \n\"This encouraging news gives the hope and optimism that so many people need to keep them going,\" she said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Blackburn,York",
      "text": "Failures in England's Test and Trace system are partly responsible for a surge in the Indian variant in one of the worst affected parts of the country, a report seen by the BBC says. \nFor three weeks in April and May, eight local authorities in England did not have access to the full data on positive tests in their area.  \nThe number of missing cases was highest in Blackburn with Darwen, Lancashire.\nA recent surge in infections there has been linked to the Indian variant.\nThe government said a Track and Trace \"software issue\" had affected a \"handful\" of places, but this had been resolved \"as quickly as possible\".\nThe other areas experiencing incomplete data were Blackpool, York, Bath and North East Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock.\nLabour called on ministers to \"explain what's gone wrong\".\nNHS Test and Trace - for which \u00a337bn has been set aside - identifies people who have been in close contact with someone who has caught Covid. \nBetween 21 April and 11 May, the system only provided details of a limited number of positive cases of coronavirus to the eight local authorities.\nOn 11 May, they were told by the Department of Health and Social Care that, over that period, 734 positive tests had not been reported.  \nAccording to a report by officials at one of the councils affected, the central Test and Trace system failed to notify its staff of cases, meaning their contacts could not be traced locally. \nIt says that \"the rapid spread of Indian variant cases... may be partially or largely attributable to risks in the international travel control system\", adding: \"These were exacerbated by the sporadic failure of the national Test and Trace system.\"  \nSix of the local authorities affected have confirmed to the BBC that they experienced problems. \nAlthough it is thought that the people tested were given their results, local authority staff were not provided with contact-tracing information through the central system. \nSome 3,424 cases of the Indian variant - which is believed to spread more quickly than the Kent variant that caused the winter spike in infections - have now been identified in the UK.\nThe government added India to the \"red list\" of countries, from which travellers must quarantine in a hotel on return, on 23 April - two days after the problems with Test and Trace started.  \nWhile national contact-tracing teams should take on variant cases, identifying the particular variant can take up to two weeks. \nIn the meantime, local authority staff are often the first to make contacts with positive cases.  \nWhere cases went unreported, they were also in many cases unable to offer support to isolating individuals.   \nThe Department of Health told Blackburn with Darwen Council that there were 164 cases it had been unaware of. The people affected were subsequently traced. \nAnother 130 cases were not reported, but, because they had passed the 10-day isolation period, could not be followed up.  \nEven when cases were uploaded to the system on 12 May, some key information, such as phone numbers or addresses, was incomplete.  \nFor Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said it \"beggars belief\" that councils had been \"left in the dark for two weeks when we know acting with speed is vital to containing an outbreak\".\nHe added: \"Ministers need to explain what's gone wrong and provide local health directors with all the resources they need to push infections down.\"\nLiberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus, said \"grave errors\" over Test and Trace failures had \"contributed to the surge in cases of the Indian variant\".\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"NHS Test and Trace has contacted over 10 million people since the start of the pandemic, and this has had a significant impact, breaking chains of transmission and reducing the spread of the virus. \n\"Over the past month, we have contacted over 150,000 people to tell them to self-isolate.\"\nThe spokesperson added: \"Due to a software issue, there was a delay in tracing contacts of a number of cases. This only affected a handful of local authorities and the issue was resolved as quickly as possible.\"\nData released by Public Health England shows there have now been 3,424 cases of the Indian variant detected - that is up by just over 2,000 on this time last week.\nCases are predominantly affecting the north west of England, particularly Bolton, and London, PHE said.\nThese numbers are going to continue growing - it is expected the variant will become dominant in the UK as scientists believe it is more infectious than the UK variant.\nIt's unclear by how much - currently experts are saying it could be anything between 10% to 50% more transmissible.\nBut what this means for infection levels and, crucially, serious illness remains to be seen.\nOverall infection levels remain low. Even if infection levels do rise, there is no guarantee that will translate into significant numbers of hospital cases because of the rollout of the vaccines.\nWhat will be crucial is just how more transmissible it is. Below 25% and the impact on hospital cases is expected to be minimal. Once you get to 40% it could become problematic.\nIt will be another week until scientists are able to give a confident estimate of what the true figure is."

      "text": "Stormont ministers have approved relaxing lockdown rules in Northern Ireland, meaning hospitality can operate indoors from Monday 24 May. \nThe Northern Ireland Executive met on Thursday to formally sign off the changes.\nThese include allowing six people from two households to meet indoors in homes from Monday.\nA traffic light system for foreign travel will also take effect from then, subject to ministerial approval.\nTwelve countries are on Northern Ireland's so-called \"green list\" for foreign travel.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill confirmed on Thursday that Portugal is among those countries. \nPeople going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return.\nBut those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid in the days after they arrive home. \nEngland, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday earlier this week. \nIt is understood that Stormont health officials had recommended Portugal should be on Northern Ireland's amber list, which would still require people to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival in Northern Ireland.\nAt present, the executive's advice is that people should only travel to or outside of Northern Ireland for essential purposes. \nIf returning from a country on the UK's red list, passengers must book and enter hotel quarantine.\nInternational travellers visiting or returning to Northern Ireland must also currently provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test result, provide journey and contact details and also isolate for 10 days.\nIt is all systems go for Monday, when we'll take some of our biggest steps yet back to normality.\nStormont ministers are allowing pubs and restaurants to trade indoors again - a move that couldn't come soon enough given the recent bad weather.\nWhile there's a further unlocking of the local economy, just as important are the relaxations to help reunite families and friends who have faced many months with severely limited social contact.\nPeople also keen on a holiday can now start planning for this, albeit the so-called green list is limited and anyone hoping to head abroad will face higher costs and extra paperwork.\nThings have been rolling steadily for some time. Now it appears the executive is preparing to take off its stabilisers and speed up our journey out of lockdown.\nOutgoing First Minister Arlene Foster, who attended the executive meeting virtually from London as she had been meeting Boris Johnson, said it was great news for the economy. \n\"Now is a time to look ahead and to enjoy these hard won freedoms safely,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"We must continue to do all we can as a community to keep ourselves and each other safe and I appeal to everyone to be cautious to help ensure we can keep heading in the right direction.\"  \nMs O'Neill said the moves were another positive step but she urged caution. \n\"I'd remind people to still be careful, be cautious, because we do have the new variants that are there, but we need to keep going steady as we go and follow the public health advice,\" Ms O'Neill said. \nThe deputy first minister accepted that some people would be disappointed that certain countries had not made it on to the green list. \n\"This is about trying to keep the virus under control,\" Ms O'Neill said. \n\"We've got to such a good point, the community transmission is low, but there's a real danger and a real threat being posed by new variants, in particular the Indian variant,\" Ms O'Neill added. \n\"So we're watching that very carefully. We're in a good place right now, there isn't widespread community transmission, but the health advice is very clear in saying it's a matter of when, not if. So we have to bear that in mind in terms of the limitations of travel.\"\nNon-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is to be allowed from Monday and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area.\nThe CTA is the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man.\nAt Thursday's executive meeting, ministers backed the reopening of hotels and B&Bs from Monday and the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. \nIndoor household visits will also be allowed from that date, with six people from two households allowed at one time. Children under 12 do not count towards the total.\nOvernight stays will also be allowed.\nPubs and restaurants will be allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household.\nHospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the announcement will \"bring back hope to businesses\".\n\"As we now look towards Monday's reopening, the health and wellbeing of customers, staff and the wider public will be the priority for all the hospitality sector business owners,\" he said. \nLondonderry Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin said businesses \"can now begin to look towards the busy summer period and our economic recovery\".\nBut she added there was some \"ambiguity and grey areas\" within the hospitality industry over \"what is exactly required of them to reopen, especially in the absence of any published regulations or guidelines yet\".\nOther measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume.\nUp to 1,000 fans will also be allowed to attend Friday's Irish Cup final at Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh.\nBut spectators will not be allowed back for Derry City's game against St Patrick's Athletic on Monday night.\nThe decision was taken after discussions with public health officials, \"based on the current high rates of Covid-19 transmission in the city\", according to a statement on the club's website.\nPeople in England, Scotland and Wales have been allowed to meet in each other's homes and enjoy indoor hospitality since Monday."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nFailures in England's Test and Trace system were partly responsible for a surge in the Indian coronavirus variant in one of the worst affected parts of the country, according to a report seen by the BBC. Technical difficulties left eight councils unable to identify cases of the variant for three weeks from late April - including Blackburn with Darwen, where a surge in infections has been linked to the Indian variant. The Department of Health said the temporary problem concerned a small number of contacts of positive cases but was resolved quickly. Read more here: where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading?\nThe reopening of indoor hospitality and a foreign travel traffic light system have been given the go-ahead in Northern Ireland from Monday. The Northern Ireland Executive met on Thursday to sign off the changes. These also include allowing six people from two households to meet indoors in homes. The traffic light system for foreign travel will follow a similar system already implemented in the rest of the UK - read more about it here.\nThe boss of EasyJet has defended people who want to travel to amber list countries - such as Spain and Italy - saying it is \"absolutely legal\". It comes after the government advised people not to go to those countries on holiday. Johan Lundgren said the government stance was \"very confusing\" and frustrating for passengers. The legal ban on foreign holidays ended in the UK on Monday, with the government bringing in a traffic light system of rules for international travel. The amber list covers the vast majority of foreign destinations, including most of Europe, and the government says people should only travel to these countries in exceptional circumstances.\nThe Duke of Cambridge has shared a photograph showing him getting his first Covid jab on Tuesday, joining the UK's total of more than 37 million people to have received a first dose. Prince William, 38 - who received his jab at London's Science Museum - is the latest senior royal to share having received the vaccine, following the Queen and the Prince of Wales. \"To all those working on the vaccine rollout thank you for everything you've done and continue to do,\" he tweeted.\nAn orchestra which disbanded more than 60 years ago has been revived to provide a platform for musicians hit by the pandemic. The Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra - established in Leeds in 1947 but disbanded eight years later - is due to accompany headline acts at major concerts and events this year. Trumpeter Anthony Thompson, who has played for Pope Benedict XVI and performed with Sting, took a job as a builder's labourer when the pandemic hit. He will be among those joining the orchestra, which is due to play at concerts around Yorkshire this summer.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe speed of the vaccine rollout varies across the UK, head here to find out when you will be offered the jab. \nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Although he underwent major surgery toward the end of last year, he is facing some ongoing issues and has decided to focus on his health.\"\nHe added: \"We wish him a complete and speedy recovery.\"\nBashir is one of the most well-known journalists in the UK, having made news headlines for his interviews with Michael Jackson and Diana, Princess of Wales.\nIt was during her 1995 interview with Bashir that Princess Diana admitted to having had an affair and also spoke of Prince Charles's relationship with the then Camilla Parker-Bowles.\n\"There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,\" she told Bashir on Panorama, in a programme watched by millions globally.\nHowever, Bashir had recently come under scrutiny after it emerged mocked-up bank statements had been produced in an attempt to secure the interview with the princess.\nThe BBC has apologised for the use of the statements, but has insisted they played \"no part in her decision to take part in the interview\".\nBashir will not face a criminal investigation. But retired Supreme Court judge Lord Dyson has carried out an inquiry into the incident.\nA spokeswoman for Lord Dyson said he had concluded his investigation and that the report had been \"passed to the BBC for publication in due course\".\nA BBC spokesman said the report would be published \"very soon\".\nBashir, aged 58, had been absent from his role in recent months after contracting Covid-19 and undergoing quadruple bypass surgery.\nIn the first of his two most famous interviews, Princess Diana also talked frankly about her difficulties with post-natal depression and bulimia.\nIt made headlines around the globe and was watched by 22.8m in the UK, winning Bashir a Bafta TV award.\nHe was also named Royal Television Society's Journalist of the Year in 1996.\nIn 2003, Bashir also interviewed pop singer Jackson for an ITV documentary.\nThe journalist asked him about reports of multiple plastic surgery and the \"baby dangling\" incident, when the star held his baby son over a balcony to show waiting fans beneath.\nThe programme, for which Bashir trailed the singer for eight months, was watched by 14m viewers.\nBashir's career began as BBC news correspondent from 1987 to 1992. He then joined the corporation's investigative programme Panorama, and also worked on shows including Songs of Praise and Public Eye.\nIn a 1998 Panorama programme he interviewed Louise Woodward, the British au pair convicted of the manslaughter of Matthew Eappen, a baby she was looking after in the US.\nThe exclusive interview, in which she declared her innocence, was recorded after she was released from a US prison, when her conviction was reduced from murder to involuntary manslaughter.\nBashir also interviewed the five men suspected of killing London teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1999, having moved to ITV in 1998 to work on Tonight with Trevor McDonald.\nHe went on to speak to disgraced Tory peer Lord Archer, Tony Martin the Norfolk farmer who was jailed for killing a burglar and former footballer George Best, as well as making a series of documentary films about the serial killer doctor, Harold Shipman.\nOther interviewees included Michael Barrymore and Major Charles Ingram, also known as \"the coughing major\", infamous for his appearance on TV game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\nIn 2004, Bashir moved to New York, where he worked on ABC News, and later MSNBC as a political commentator, where he worked until 2013.\nHe quit MSNBC when he became the controversial focus of attention himself, for remarks he made about former US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. \nHe then broadcast an apology on his show saying his remarks were \"ill-judged\".\nBashir returned to the UK and was appointed the BBC's Religious Affairs correspondent in 2016. In 2019, he took part in a celebrity version of ITV's X Factor, which replaced the traditional X Factor series, and was eliminated in the third week.  "

      "text": "Teachers' grades could be biased towards students with more \"agreeable\" personalities - rather than actual ability, claim psychologists.\nAn international study found a 10% advantage in teachers' grades for those seen as being likeable, compared with results in anonymous exams.\nUniversity researchers warned students should not be \"penalised\" because of negative expectations about them.\nTeachers' grades will be used this year for cancelled exams across the UK.\nThe international psychology study looked at how personality could influence perceptions of ability.\nIt did not draw on the replacement exam systems being used in the UK, but head teachers' leader Geoff Barton rejected the idea of teachers being unfairly swayed.\n\"Teachers are highly trained professionals who are well aware of the importance of assessing all their students fairly and without any form of favouritism or bias,\" he said.\nThe psychology study, from researchers at Queen's University Belfast and Goldsmiths, University of London, analysed how the personalities of students compared with grades awarded by teachers and then their written exam results.\nIt was based on a sample of 1,200 students in Russia, whose psychological profiles had been mapped against their academic record.\nIt found that those with personality traits seen as more positive - such as more sociable, well-behaved and \"agreeable\" - received a boost in teachers' grades, which were not then borne out by performance in anonymous exams.\nTeachers also seemed to be more sympathetic in grading towards students who were stressed or anxious, showing more \"leniency\" in grades for those seen as more \"emotionally fragile\".\nThis pattern worked against those who were perceived as having more negative, anti-social or annoying traits.\n\"It seems teachers awarded higher grades to pupils who were more agreeable and marked them down if they were less likeable,\" said Kostas Papageorgiou from Queen's University Belfast.\n\"But we shouldn't penalise students for these characteristics,\" said Dr Papageorgiou.\nThe study, also involving academics in Russia and Italy, found no clear pattern between personality types and actual performance in exams.\nBut the evidence suggested \"teacher ratings might reflect some conscious or unconscious biases\", said the psychologist Dr Papageorgiou.\nThis is a higher profile issue in the UK this summer - with teachers' grades playing an important part, along with other assessments, in deciding results for exams cancelled by the pandemic.\nThe findings, although based on a sample of 14 to 18 year olds in Russia, have a relevance in all education systems, says Dr Papageorgiou.\n\"Bias is universal, it's part of all of us,\" warned Dr Papageorgiou. \"I don't see any reason why this sort of bias wouldn't apply here.\"\nThe study did not look at bias in terms of gender or ethnicity, but researchers said the findings revealed how much perceptions of academic ability could be influenced by other factors, in this case students' personalities.\nDr Papageorgiou says that a variation of 10% in grading might not seem high, but it could mean a significant difference in an academic setting.\nHe said it showed that \"bias can operate on many levels\".\nBut the psychologist said that: \"Marking exams blindly and having a moderation system in place will definitely reduce the negative impact of this bias.\"\nMr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said teachers' professionalism would prevent favouritism and measures were in place to ensure fairness in this year's results.\n\"They are following detailed guidance from the exam boards and the exam regulator Ofqual, and schools and colleges are operating quality assurance processes to ensure fairness and consistency. \n\"Teachers and leaders are working incredibly hard to carry out these assessments following the government's decision to cancel public exams this summer. \n\"They are utterly committed to making sure that their students receive fair and accurate grades in GCSEs, A-levels and other important qualifications,\" said the heads' leader."

      "text": "A large UK study suggests having coronavirus around the time of birth may increase the chance of stillbirths and premature births - although the overall risks remain low.\nScientists say while most pregnancies are not affected, their findings should encourage pregnant women to have jabs as soon as they are eligible.\nThe majority are offered vaccines when they are rolled out to their age group. \nThe study appears in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. \nThe research, led by the National Maternity and Perinatal Audit, looked at data involving more than 340,000 women who gave birth in England between the end of May 2020 and January 2021. \nAll women were tested for the virus when they were admitted for births - whether they had symptoms or not.\nThe study found:\nResearchers say a higher risk of stillbirth and prematurity, as well as a greater chance of having a Caesarean section, remained even once factors such as the mother's age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and common health conditions were taken into account. \nBabies born to women who tested positive were more likely to need special neonatal intensive care because they were born early and needed more support - rather than being infected with coronavirus itself. \nProfessor Asma Khalil, co-author of the paper, said it was important for women and healthcare workers to be aware of the potential risks.\nShe added: \"This study is the largest yet in England to describe the pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women who had tested positive for Covid-19 around the time of birth. \n\"While it is reassuring that the overall increases in the rate of stillbirth and pre-term birth remain low, this study does show that the risk of stillbirth or premature birth may be increased in women who have the infection around the time of birth. \n\"This highlights the importance of Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant women; it reduces the risk not just to themselves, but also to their babies.\"\nDr Mary Ross-Davie, from the Royal College of Midwives, agreed that vaccination was key in protecting people from the virus. \nShe added: \"While the increased risk of a stillbirth or pre-term birth remains low when women have Covid-19 in pregnancy, the important message here is that pregnant women, like all of us, should continue to take precautions to reduce their chances of exposure to the virus. \n\"This includes continuing social distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing,\" she said.

So it is exciting to be part of such a happy conclusion,\" he added. \nThe owner, a lifelong antiques and antiquities collector, said the items had been taken when his home in Ludlow was broken into four years ago. \n\"As well as many item from my collection, they took out the hot water cylinder and left the water running - this didn't seem to make much sense initially - but several days of flooding left the house uninhabitable and they were able to return twice a fortnight later, break in again and search for further items,\" he said.\nThe found pieces were returned to him as some still had auction tickets, he said, which connected him to them. \nHe said it was \"wonderful\" to see the items again, which included some of his \"favourite\" pieces, and he was \"extremely grateful\" to Mr Cartwright.\nThe owner said he had attempted to offer Mr Cartwright a reward, which he declined, but said he hoped to meet him in the future and \"buy him a pint or two\".\nDet Con Tom Court said the investigation into the burglary was continuing.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "What has gone wrong with rail franchising?",
      "tags": "Network Rail,National Rail,Rail travel",
      "text": "The debate over the future of running Britain's rail network flared up once more this week.\nWhile the government tepidly defended its system, unions and passengers united to attack it as prices were hiked again above the government's own preferred measure of inflation.\nEven the Department for Transport called the current model \"flawed\" as it announced that FirstGroup was to take over the running of the London Euston to Glasgow Central route.\nThe Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, hailed the deal as a shift to a new model for rail.\nBut the RMT union's general secretary, Mick Cash, described it as a \"another political fix by a government whose privatised franchise model is collapsing around their ears\".\nIt all comes as rail punctuality across the country languishes at a 13-year low.\nAnd despite growing passenger anger, fares will rise next year in line with the abandoned Retail Prices Index at 2.8%, rather than the lower Consumer Prices Index. \n\"The system is clearly not working, everybody agrees that it's not working,\" rail writer Christian Wolmar tells the BBC.\nThe Department for Transport maintains that privatisation has worked. It points out that passenger numbers have doubled, while the rail system has attracted \u00a36.7bn of private investment and added 4,600 new daily services.\nBut the mounting criticism of the system was clearly not what the government had hoped for when it privatised the network in the 1990s.\nNetwork Rail, then known as Railtrack, was set up to look after the tracks, tunnels and signalling. Meanwhile, private companies could compete to run the trains.\nAt the time, the government hoped that those private firms would compete on most routes through a system known as \"open access\". Rather than bidding for entire lines, services themselves were on offer.\nIt also asked firms to bid to run subsided franchises on loss-making routes.\nBut that left the taxpayer to pick up the tab for all loss-making services. When the network was publicly-owned, these would have been subsidised by the profitable ones.\nAs a result, franchises for entire lines became the norm to stop the cornering of profitable services, and now less than 1% of passengers travel on open-access services.\nThe effect of that has been a lack of competition among train operators which is bad for consumers, says Professor Mark Barry from Cardiff University.\n\"We've got a system that was meant to bring competition to railways post-privatisation and provide some means for companies to innovate, take a risk in return to procure some value.\n\"The reality is though, there isn't a lot of competition on the railway - apart from the franchising system itself.\"\nThis might suggest that train operators are having an easy ride and raking in profit, but the opposite is often the case. \nAs Mr Wolmar points out, in reality rail companies have very little control over their revenues. They can introduce wi-fi on their trains and launch advertising campaigns but much of their fortune depends on factors beyond their control, such as employment levels and economic growth.\nIn a competitive tendering environment, that can mean that the rail firms make a loss over the course of rail franchise, which typically lasts seven years. \nAnd that explains, in part, the failure of Stagecoach and Virgin Trains' East Coast Main Line franchise, which was handed back to the government last year.\nProf Barry thinks the franchising model should change so that the franchisee is not left with the revenue risk.\nInstead, he argues, the government should award contracts by telling the bidders how much money is available and asking them to compete on quality.\nHe said Transport for Wales had experimented with that model successfully.\nThe man charged with reviewing the franchise system, former British Airways boss Keith Williams, may have an even more radical suggestion.\nHe has said a \"Fat Controller\" type figure, independent from government, should be in charge of day-to-day operations.\nMr Williams has also said he believes that, in the future, rail franchises should be underpinned by punctuality and other performance-related targets.\nThe government launched the review after passengers in northern and southern England experienced chaos over several weeks last summer following the introduction of a new timetable.\nHis review of the rail system will be published this autumn.\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"The recently awarded West Coast Partnership represents a decisive shift towards a new model for rail. It is a partnership supported by Keith Williams, built with the flexibility to respond to his recommendations and deliver fundamental reform to a flawed system. \n\"The transport secretary has asked Keith to produce his recommendations for a White Paper, with fearless proposals that will deliver a consumer focussed railway system fit for the 21st Century.\""

      "title": "Covid: NHS waiting lists will take 'years' to recover",
      "text": "It will take \"a number of years\" for NHS waiting times in Wales to recover to pre-coronavirus levels, the organisation's boss has warned.\nThe number of people waiting more than 36 weeks for planned hospital treatments is six times higher than at the start of 2020.\nWaiting list figures, published for the first time since March, show nearly 169,000 people waiting.\nThe total waiting list has now swelled by more than 55,500.\nThe number has grown after most non-urgent treatment was postponed to prepare the NHS for the first coronavirus wave.\nSince then, the service has been trying to restart non-emergency treatments and aims to keep them going as much as possible during the second wave. \nDespite recent progress, NHS Wales chief executive Andrew Goodall warned waiting times could grow even further, saying there was a \"real concern\" that hospital doctors were only able to see about half as many in-patients and day cases as normal.\nHe believes there will be a third fewer out-patients seen and operating theatres working at half their usual capacity due to infection control measures.\nData showed that between March and August there had been a five-fold increase in the longest waiting times of more than 36 weeks.\n\"The overall waiting list has not changed so much, it's simply patients have been shifted more to the end of the list as we've had to prioritise urgent and emergency cases,\" Dr Goodall added.\n\"We have made a lot of improvement on waiting times in recent years and it will take us a number of years to recover that and it will take investment and resources also.\"\nBefore today, the last figures related to waiting times in January.\nSo we can now see that by September:\nThe longest waits included 41,202 people waiting for orthopaedic or trauma treatment - a 372% increase since January - and 203 waiting for cardiothoracic surgery, more than four times as many.\nWelsh Government targets state 95% of patients should be treated within six months and nobody should wait longer than six months.\nRecent analysis by the BBC Wales Investigates programme suggested at least 49,000 people in Wales were waiting more than a year in September and for six out of seven health boards, at least 25,000 were waiting for surgery.\nThat would amount to a tenfold increase in the number of patients compared to September 2019.\nThe Welsh Government said \"difficult decisions\" were made to postpone surgery and outcomes for patients would have been even worse had it not acted.\nThe NHS has gradually resumed non-urgent activity since the first wave and is trying to get procedures done, in so far as that is possible, but it has been substantially lower than what is usual.\nClive Price, from Merthyr Tydfil, is waiting for a hip operation, which has been put off because of Covid.\nHe was expecting to find out in April before surgery was cancelled and fears he could be waiting a long time.\n\"Out of 10, the pain is 20,\" he said. \"All the way down, my leg goes dead if I'm sitting down too much.\"\nMr Price added: \"You're afraid to go into hospital because of Covid - I'd go in now if I could but I've been told nothing. Operations like mine are going up and up, I could be waiting months. I want to get it done and go out.\"\nAlong with waiting times figures, the Welsh Government has published for the first time three new \"experimental\" performance measures for A&E departments:\nNo targets have been set in relation to these measures and the Welsh Government said they were set with input from front-line emergency care staff.\nDr Jo Mower, clinical director for the National Programme for Unscheduled Care, has been a consultant in Cardiff for the past 16 years.\nShe said she was confident the new measures, alongside the current time-targets, would be better for those who came to A&E themselves, as well as those who arrive by ambulance. \n\"There may be times when we're overwhelmed, but we want to ensure our patients are triaged and assessed as close to their arrival time as possible, so the patient can get the right treatment, especially for those critical interventions like heart attacks, sepsis, strokes - and this will identify those patients but also those who could possibly wait a little longer for their treatment.\"\nThe current target is 95% of patients should spend no longer than four hours in A&E, but this has never been met since it was introduced in 2010.\nThe waiting times for A&E for October showed 76.5% of patients were seen, transferred or discharged within four hours, a slight improvement on both January and about the same October 2019.\nThere were 4,360 patients who waited more than 12 hours, even though the targets state nobody should have to wait that long. \nHowever, critics of the current measures say they give little indication of the quality and urgency of care given to patients.\nMeanwhile, in September, there was a 13.5% rise in patients entering the single cancer treatment pathway, compared to the month before, although this was still 1,145 (8.7%) compared to a year before.\nFor the third month in a row, the Welsh Ambulance Service failed to meet its target of reaching 65% of \"red\" life-threatening calls within eight minutes.\nIn October, 60.8% arrived within eight minutes. Health officials said one issue is that it can take up to six minutes for staff to get into full PPE kit before seeing each patient, while a standard clean now for ambulances took up to 20 minutes after each call.\nDr Goodall said once the pandemic has been brought under control, the NHS would need to transform the way it works in order to tackle the backlog.\nBut he said the rapid changes made to deal with Covid-19 - such as the growth in video consultations - proved what was possible, and he believed ministers would consider long-term funding challenges.\n\"I personally feel our longest waiting times may still take a number of years to resolve. But what I don't want to happen is we continue to respond in the same old fashioned way.\"\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said an extra \u00a330m had been made available for the remainder of 2020/21.\nBut he said the effects of Covid would be long-lasting.\n\"The extraordinary figures today underscore the nature of the challenge that our NHS faces and the very direct impact of responding to this unfinished pandemic,\" he said.\n\"If we'd tried to run our services as normal I am confident we'd have been overwhelmed, but not allowing this to happen means we've built up a significant backlog which means it'll take pretty much a full Senedd term to resolve. It's important that people understand the reality of where we are.\"\nHe added: \"That will mean more challenges for people who are waiting longer and it'll mean significant challenges for our NHS, because our staff are still in the midst of coping with the pandemic, so there are big and difficult choices ahead that will go well beyond when this pandemic finally does come to an end.\"\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) in Wales said the figures had reached extraordinary levels and were \"stark\".\n\"What is vital now, is clear messaging for these patients, many of whom have, and continue to suffer due to these delays,\" said David Bailey, chair of the BMA council in Wales. \n\"Clear communication which provides insight as to where they are in the system, may offer a small amount of peace of mind. To have no information at all will be for many, extremely distressing.\"\nResponding to the A&E waiting time figures, Dr Suresh Pillai, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Wales said it showed a worrying trend of increasing long waits. \n\"Long waits have always been dangerous, but at a time where Covid is still endemic and we are having to care for patients alongside managing the virus, we simply cannot have crowded emergency departments,\" he said.\nDr Olwen Williams, of the Royal College of Physicians in Wales, said Dr Goodall's comments reflected the views of many doctors on the frontline.\n\"We need to take this opportunity to adapt and redesign the way we provide care, with better use of new technologies, investment in innovative preventative and community medicine, and much wider patient involvement in decision-making,\" she said.  \nAndrew RT Davies, Conservative health spokesman, said urged the health minister to \"get a grip on this because troubling as these figures are, they are not just abstract numbers\". \nHe added: \"Our plan would mean ramping up capacity in Covid-free hospitals so we can get back on top of treatments, and patients aren't left waiting in unnecessary agony or anxiety.\"\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"We still need to see more urgency in delivering significant 'green' Covid-free, or 'Covid-light' sites for diagnosis and treatment. \n\"Stopping in-hospital transmission of the virus is another area which needs significant attention.\""

      "text": "The health secretary has acknowledged the pain and suffering of victims of the contaminated blood scandal, saying the government would pay compensation if recommended to.\nMatt Hancock was facing questions at a public inquiry into what's been called the worst NHS treatment disaster.\nAround 3,000 people died after being given blood products containing HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970s and 1980s.\nMr Hancock said he wanted \"to make sure their voices are heard\".\nAnd he said the government would pay compensation if the inquiry decided it should.\nCurrently, victims and families get financial support but have not been compensated for loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. \nMinisters announced a public inquiry in 2017 after decades of campaigning by victims and their families.\nNearly 5,000 people with the blood disorder haemophilia were infected with potentially fatal viruses after being given a clotting agent called Factor VIII. \nMuch of the drug was imported from the US, where prisoners and other at-risk groups were often paid to donate the plasma used to make it.\nVictims included dozens of young haemophiliacs at a boarding school in Hampshire who died after contracting HIV as a result.\nTens of thousands more victims may have been exposed to viral hepatitis through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth. \nFamilies of victims of the scandal have long fought for annual support payments to be increased and full compensation to be paid.\nIn March ministers said that families in England who lost relatives as a result of the scandal will receive the same support payments as those in other parts of the UK.  \nTreasury minister Penny Mordaunt said bereaved partners would automatically get a \u00a310,000 lump sum.\nBut campaigners say some families have been excluded from the scheme, including children who lost parents to HIV at the time. \nThe UK government has now said that full compensation could be paid in the future, depending on the outcome of the inquiry. \nThat is likely to pave the way for much larger payments covering lifetime loss of earnings and ongoing care costs.\nMinisters have appointed the retired barrister Sir Robert Francis to carry out a study looking at different options for compensation, and to report back with recommendations, before the inquiry publishes its conclusions.\n\"This is a huge move but if they decide to base compensation on what the inquiry decides, that gives them another two or three years before they have to find a penny,\" said Su Gorman, whose husband Steve Dymond died aged 62 in December 2018 of organ failure linked to hepatitis C.\n\"If they really wanted to pay compensation, they could find a way of doing it which would not prejudge the inquiry.\"\nThe public inquiry, led by Sir Brian Langstaff, has been examining the circumstances surrounded the contaminated blood scandal since 2018.\nHundreds of people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C or their family members have already given evidence, with hearings held at sites across the UK.\nThe inquiry is examining how and why the infections occurred, what was known at the time about the risks of the treatments, and whether patients were given sufficient warnings about the dangers involved.\nEvidence hearings are scheduled to continue into next year with a final report likely to be published in 2022 or 2023.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"The infected blood tragedy should never have happened. The ongoing public inquiry was set up to establish the truth and give individuals and families the answers they rightly deserve.\n\"We've always been clear that those who have been affected by this tragedy should be supported by a fair and transparent support scheme focused on their welfare, providing some security and consistency.\n\"The government has listened to the call for parity of support across UK and in March announced a package for the whole of the UK which will bring greater uniformity to the four National support schemes.\""

      "text": "Former US president Donald Trump blasted \"wayward Republicans\" after lawmakers made a rare bipartisan push to investigate the Capitol riot.\nWith the support of 35 Republicans, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives voted 252-175 to look into the events of 6 January. \nParty leaders had urged Republicans to oppose the bill, with Mr Trump labelling it a \"Democrat trap\".\nThe bill appears to lack the Republican support it needs to pass in the Senate.\nIt seeks to create an independent inquiry modelled on the commission that investigated the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. \nThe legislation establishes a 10-member body, evenly split between the two main parties, that would make recommendations by the end of the year on how to prevent any repeat of the Capitol invasion.\nTrump supporters stormed Congress on 6 January in a failed bid to thwart certification of President Joe Biden's victory in November's election.\nWednesday's vote was seen as a loyalty test to the former president for members of his party.\nAll 10 of the House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in the days after the Capitol riot for incitement of insurrection were among the 35 who voted for the commission.\nIn a statement after the vote, Mr Trump hit out at the \"wayward\" Republican group, saying, \"they just can't help themselves\".\n\"We have much better policy and are much better for the country, but the Democrats stick together, the Republicans don't,\" Mr Trump said, singling out several of his highest-profile Republican critics, including Utah Senator Mitt Romney.\n\"Sometimes there are consequences to being ineffective and weak,\" Mr Trump added.\nRepublican House Leader Kevin McCarthy dismissed the number of party defections in a weekly news conference on Thursday, saying: \"I thought it would probably be higher.\" \nHe added that the idea of this Democratic-led House commission was \"a lot of politics\", noting that committees in the Senate were already conducting their own inquiry.\nAsked if was willing to testify about a conversation he had with Mr Trump on the day of the riot, he responded, \"sure\".\nOn Wednesday, New York congressman John Katko, who negotiated the legislation with Democrats, said: \"This is about facts - it's not partisan politics.\"\nMr Katko - the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee - said \"the American people and the Capitol Police deserve answers, and action as soon as possible to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again\".\nBut Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, said the commission was a Democratic ruse \"to smear Trump supporters\".\nShortly before the vote, Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, said on the House floor: \"We have people scaling the Capitol, hitting the Capitol Police with lead pipes across the head, and we can't get bipartisanship? What else has to happen in this country?\"\nBut the legislation faces dim prospects in the Senate, where the rules mean Democrats would need 10 Republicans to join them in passing it.\nJohn Thune, the deputy Republican leader in the upper chamber, said he was concerned the inquiry would be \"weaponised politically\" in the 2022 election cycle.\nMr Trump has been dividing post-presidential life between his golf clubs in Florida and New Jersey and hinting about another run for the White House in 2024.\nHe continues to spread unfounded claims that last year's election was stolen from him - the conspiracy theory that drove many of his supporters to Capitol Hill on 6 January.\nOne of them, an unarmed woman, was shot and killed by police as she tried to break into the House chamber.\nTwo other protesters died of heart failure in the melee and one other from an amphetamine overdose.\nA Capitol Police officer who tackled the protesters died of a stroke the following day. Two other officers took their own lives in the days after.\nThe Capitol Police union said one officer lost an eye during the attack and others sustained brain injuries."

      "title": "Princess Diana interview: What did Martin Bashir and the BBC do?",
      "tags": "Princess Diana, Princess of Wales,UK Royal Family,BBC",
      "text": "The BBC has made an \"unconditional apology\" over the way it obtained an interview with Diana, Princess of Wales in 1995.\nAn independent inquiry by Lord Dyson, a former senior judge, found journalist Martin Bashir used deception to secure the interview and then lied to BBC managers. \nMartin Bashir's interview with Princess Diana, broadcast by Panorama in late 1995, was a huge scoop for the BBC. Never before had a serving royal spoken in such candid terms about life in the Royal Family. \nIn the interview, Princess Diana:\nMore than 20 million people watched the interview and it caused huge controversy. \nShortly afterwards, the Queen wrote to Prince Charles and Princess Diana telling them to divorce.\nQuestions about the manner in which interview was secured, started to be asked within a short time of its airing.\nA graphic artist working for the BBC said he had been asked by Martin Bashir to produce fake bank statements. \nThese appeared to show payments by a newspaper group to a former member of staff of Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's brother.\nThe Dyson report says this was to gain Earl Spencer's confidence, so he would introduce Mr Bashir to Diana.\nWhen questioned by BBC bosses, Mr Bashir admitted having the statements mocked up, but repeatedly denied showing these documents to Earl Spencer. \nThe report says Mr Bashir \"lied and maintained the lie until he realised that it was no longer sustainable. This was most reprehensible behaviour which casts considerable doubt on his credibility generally\".\nPrincess Diana was the mother of Prince William and Prince Harry. \nShe married the Prince of Wales, the heir to the throne, in London's St Paul's Cathedral, in 1981.  \nThe couple separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.\nShe died in a car crash in Paris a year later, along with her companion Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul.\nThey had been speeding away from photographers following the car, when Mr Paul lost control and smashed into a concrete pillar.\nAnalysis indicated he had significant levels of alcohol in his blood at the time.\nThe BBC comes in for strong criticism in the Dyson report. \nAfter the forged bank statements were revealed by the Mail on Sunday newspaper in early 1996, an internal BBC inquiry cleared Mr Bashir, Panorama and BBC News of wrongdoing. \nThe director of news who conducted the inquiry was Tony Hall, now Lord Hall, who later became the BBC director general.  \nHowever, the Dyson Report says this inquiry was inadequate because it failed to interview Earl Spencer - something it calls \"a big mistake\".\nIt says it did not treat Mr Bashir's account with \"necessary scepticism and caution\", given that he admitted faking bank statements (itself a serious breach of BBC rules) and could give \"no credible reason\" why.\nLord Hall - who left the BBC in 2020 - admitted that he was wrong to give Martin Bashir the \"benefit of the doubt\" at the time of the investigation. He has since resigned from his  job as chairman of the National Gallery.\nThe Dyson report also says the BBC covered up facts about how Mr Bashir secured the interview. \nIt criticises the corporation for giving evasive responses to press inquiries, and says \"without justification, the BBC fell short of the high standards of integrity and transparency which are its hallmark\". \nThe BBC says the report has identified \"clear failings\" and that while it now has better procedures in place, \"those that existed at the time should have prevented the interview being secured in this way\".\nIt also says it should have made \"greater effort to get to the bottom of what happened at the time and been more transparent about what it knew\".\nMartin Bashir left the BBC a few days before the release of the Dyson report. \nHe apologised for the fake bank statements - which he said were \"a stupid thing to do\" - but said they had had no bearing on Princess Diana's decision to grant him an interview. \nThe BBC has published a report into how Martin Bashir was rehired as religion correspondent in 2016, when questions had already been asked about his conduct.\nIt found there was no evidence given the job to cover up the circumstances around his Diana interview. It said he \"would have never been reappointed\" had everything about his conduct been known.\nPrinces William and Harry have spoke of the hurt caused by the interview.\nPrince William said Diana \"was failed not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions\". He said the interview made a \"major contribution to making my parents' relationship worse\".\nPrince Harry said the \"ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices\" ultimately took his mother's life."

      "text": "The price of Bitcoin fell below $34,000 (\u00a324,030) for the first time in three months on Wednesday, after China imposed fresh curbs on crypto-currencies.\nBeijing banned banks and payment firms from providing services related to crypto-currency transactions.\nIt also warned investors against speculative crypto trading on Tuesday.\nIt follows falls in Bitcoin of more than 10% last week after Tesla said it would no longer accept the currency.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin recovered some ground, although it was still down -10.4% at $38,131.\nMeanwhile, other digital currencies such as Ether, which acts as the fuel for the Ethereum blockchain network, and Dogecoin lost as much as 22% and 24% respectively.\nAt the same time, Tesla shares fell more than 3% on Wall Street, possibly because of the electric carmaker's exposure to Bitcoin.\nThe firm, owned by Elon Musk, still holds around $1.5bn worth of the crypto-currency.\nCrypto-currency trading has been illegal in China since 2019 in order to curb money-laundering. But people are still able to trade in currencies such as Bitcoin online, which has concerned Beijing. \nOn Tuesday, three state-backed organisations, including the National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association and the Payment and Clearing Association of China issued a warning on social media.\nThey said consumers would have no protection if they were to incur any losses from crypto-currency investment transactions.\nThey added that recent wild swings in crypto-currency prices \"seriously violate people's asset safety\" and are disrupting the \"normal economic and financial order\".\nNeil Wilson of Markets.com said: \"China has for some time been putting pressure on the crypto space, but this marks an intensification - other countries might follow now as central banks make strides towards their own digital currencies.\n\"Until now, Western regulators have been pretty relaxed about Bitcoin, but this might change soon.\"\nIn March, Tesla boss Elon Musk announced unexpectedly that the electric carmaker would allow customers to buy cars using Bitcoin.\nBut last week, he did a U-turn and suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin because of environmental concerns.\nHis fears centre on Bitcoin mining - the energy-intensive process through which the digital currency is generated, using high-powered computers. It often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal.\n\"We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,\" Mr Musk wrote.\n\"Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.\"\nHe said the electric carmaker did not intend to sell any of its Bitcoin and intended to reinstate crypto-currency transactions once mining shifted to using more sustainable energy sources.\nAlthough the digital currency cannot be traded in China, more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world is done in China.\nFor anyone who has followed the crypto-currency scene for a while, the events of recent weeks are a familiar story. \nSome random event - say, a tweet from Elon Musk announcing Tesla will accept crypto-currency payments - sends Bitcoin to new highs, and people begin to say it's winning mainstream acceptance.\nThen another random event happens, perhaps a change of course from the Tesla tycoon. It comes tumbling down again, and talk of it going mainstream fades into the background.\nLast month, in a chatroom on Clubhouse (another phenomenon that seems to be swinging from boom to bust) I expressed some scepticism about crypto-currencies. \nUp popped a senior figure from London's thriving fintech scene: \"Rory, Rory,\" he chided me, \"crypto is becoming an accepted asset class.\"\nWith big City institutions taking an interest, that had a ring of truth - back in April, at least. \nBut this week, the weather had changed, with the Financial Times reporting \"new doubts among institutional fund managers over the future of crypto-currencies as an asset class\".\nMy mind went back to 2013, when I had first taken an interest in Bitcoin. In a report for Radio 4's PM programme, I had bought a pizza for 0.5 BTC, a tortuous process which had not seemed worth the \u00a330 it cost back then - of course, at today's exchange rate, that was a \u00a314,000 pizza.\nI had also written a blog post headlined \"The Bitcoin Bubble\", in which I tried to mine some lessons from a period when the price of the cryptocurrency shot up from $15 to $276 and then hurtled lower again. \nI ended a piece  in which I compared the cryptocurrency with 17th-Century Dutch tulips or London houses in the 1980s with this thought: \"Unless and until Bitcoin can be used to buy a sandwich, or be accepted by your friends when you pay them back for a restaurant meal, then it is likely to remain just a playground for geeks and gamblers.\"\nEight years on, it is still virtually impossible to buy a sandwich with Bitcoin.\nAnd why would you want to, when there's a good chance you'll be mocked a few years later - as I've been for my transaction - for giving away an asset that goes on to soar in value?"

      "text": "Israel and Hamas are close to a ceasefire deal to end fighting, reports say.\nSources familiar with truce talks have told the BBC that Israel has informed Egyptian mediators it will agree to end military action.\nThere has been no official confirmation of this from Israel where PM Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting his security cabinet.\nBoth sides are facing international pressure to end hostilities.\nThe Israeli security cabinet will vote on a proposed unilateral ceasefire that would take effect within 24 hours, Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported.\nEarlier a senior Hamas official said he expected a ceasefire deal with Israel in \"a day or two\", while Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday vowed to continue the military operation until \"calm and security are restored\".\nOn Thursday more than 100 Israeli air strikes targeted Hamas infrastructure in the north of Gaza. Hamas retaliated with rocket fire.\nFighting began in Gaza on 10 May after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.\nAt least 232 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its Hamas-controlled health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters.\nIn Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza.\nPeople involved in the discussions with the two sides also told the Wall Street Journal that a ceasefire could come as early as Friday.  Egyptian officials have made headway in negotiations with Hamas's leadership, and the Israeli military has privately conceded that it is nearing the completion of its objectives, US and foreign officials are quoted as saying by the newspaper.\nAn Egyptian security source also told Reuters news agency the two sides had agreed in principle to a ceasefire after assistance from mediators but negotiations were still taking place. \nHowever, Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen dismissed reports of a ceasefire beginning on Friday, telling Kan public radio: \"We will finish the operation when we decide we have attained our goals.\"\nOn Wednesday, US President Joe Biden held his fourth call with Mr Netanyahu since the conflict started.\nA statement released by the White House said Mr Biden had \"conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire\". \nThe latest bid for a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire, launched by France, failed on Wednesday when the US said it could \"undermine efforts to de-escalate\".\nBy Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem\nIf Joe Biden was hoping for what he called a significant de-escalation in the conflict, he hasn't got it yet.\nBBC colleagues in Gaza reported a long night of bombardment, from air and sea.\nBut there was an eight-hour lull in rocket attacks from Hamas, which could be seen as a step on President Biden's \"road to a ceasefire.\"\nHamas officials sound confident that the fighting could end in the next day or two.\nRhetorically, at least, that's not the impression Israel wants to give. Expect to hear more talk of an operation continuing at \"full throttle\", with plenty of targets left to hit.\nAfter speaking to President Biden yesterday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was \"determined to continue this operation until its goal is achieved - to restore peace and security to you, the citizens of Israel. \"\nBut the clock is clearly ticking. The Biden administration has signalled its impatience.\nAs they prepare to call a halt soon, Israeli officials are putting a positive gloss on the operation so far.\nThey say they've achieved more in the past 10 days than they did in seven weeks in 2014, without needing to send troops in on the ground.\nAs talks continue, the fighting has shown little sign of letting up. \nIsrael launched a series of air strikes on Gaza in the early hours of Thursday. Hamas-run radio said a woman had been killed and four children wounded in one attack on the town of Khan Younis. \nIsrael said it had targeted \"multi-barrel rocket launching sites and aerial defence compounds\" belonging to Hamas.\nThe Israel Defense Forces reported that after more than eight hours of quiet, rocket sirens sounded again in southern Israel on Thursday morning.\nOne anti-tank missile was fired at an empty Israeli military bus, leaving a soldier standing nearby with minor injuries, according to local media reports. \nAre you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

      "text": "More than half a million people are now waiting for treatment on NHS waiting lists in Wales after record backlogs during the coronavirus pandemic.\nMost non-urgent treatment was postponed in March 2020 to prepare the NHS for Covid patients.\nNew figures show that as of February, waiting lists had hit record levels with 549,353 awaiting treatment or surgery - a 19% rise in a year.\nThis is the equivalent of 17% of the Welsh population.\nThe figures, published by Stats Wales, also show almost 218,000 had been waiting more than 36 weeks - nine months - for treatment by February this year.\nThat is about eight times higher than in the same period last year, before the pandemic officially hit, and makes up 39.6% of the waiting list.\nHowever, there have been some improvements, with the number of those waiting the longest falling 4,194 between January and February this year.\nDealing with the growth in waiting lists during the course of the pandemic is likely to be the biggest challenge facing whoever becomes the next Welsh health minister following the 6 May vote.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nStatistics showing the waiting times for treatment for conditions, show the scale of the challenge facing the Welsh NHS:\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nThe disruption caused by Covid-19 has also led to a huge increase in people waiting for diagnostic tests, to either confirm an illness or rule out a disease.\nThere were 1,752 waiting more than 14 weeks in February last year, now that has increased to more than 38,000  - a 2,072% rise.\nNHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall had previously warned staff were \"exhausted\" and said tackling the backlog could take five years.\nWhile bodies representing health care workers have warned hospitals do not have the capacity to provide care \"in the way it had done before\" because of social distancing measures needed during the pandemic.\nOn Wednesday, no new deaths with Covid-19 were recorded in Wales, according to Public Health Wales, and there have now been eight days in the past month when no deaths have occurred.\nWhile case rates have fallen to 15.2 per 100,000 people, those representing medical staff in Wales have warned the pandemic is not over and the impact of the virus will be felt for years.\nRecently the Welsh NHS Confederation said it was \"impossible to say\" when services would return to normal, and there were concerns about new variants, and spikes in case rates in other countries.\nDarren Hughes, director, said issues around testing before surgery and social distancing, meaning less beds on wards, were adding to delays for patients, and many staff had been redeployed to administer the vaccine.\n\"We are doing everything we can to get up to the maximum capacity as soon as possible,\" he said.\"Delivery of normal service, under the Covid-adjusted way of doing things is very difficult,\" he added.\nWith health one of the biggest topics at the Welsh Parliament election, all parties have been asked to comment.\nPlaid Cymru said waiting times were \"already unacceptably long even prior to the pandemic and have now been exacerbated by Covid\". \nA spokesperson said if elected to power the party would recruit 4,000 nurses, 1,000 doctors and 1,000 allied health professionals, and deliver new diagnostic centres for cancer and other conditions.\nThey said this would \"ensure early treatment, and create a new sustainability, a new robustness, in a new and transformed National Health and Care Service\".\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said it was a \"good time\" to rethink how the health service works.\n\"Welsh Liberal Democrats want to see a greater emphasis put on preventive care and early diagnosis, along with investment in technology and community pharmacies delivering a greater range of services to take pressure off hospitals and A&E departments,\" a spokesperson said.\nWelsh Labour said the pandemic had had an impact on all parts of the NHS across the UK and its \"cautious approach\" to easing lockdown had been important to get cases under control.\n\"The NHS is our top priority and that's why we've pledged an NHS Recovery Plan on day one with more than \u00a31bn of funding behind it that can help our NHS and its staff tackle the number of cases we need to deal with,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"A costed plan that includes a commitment to train 12,000 staff. We have a plan to get Wales through the pandemic and then to move our NHS forward.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives said figures meant more than 550,000 were \"anxiously waiting for their treatment to start\".\n\"Today's figures round off another disastrous five years of Labour at the end of 22 painful years of them being in power, and show the urgency for a radical change of tack,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"Welsh Conservatives would develop a clear plan to enable the Welsh NHS to clear the waiting list backlog, including by making use of cross-border and independent facilities to speed up treatment, as well as delivering five new and upgraded community hospitals over the next Senedd, as well as recruiting 1,200 more doctors, 3,000 more nurses, and other professionals through our 'Retain, recruit and train' programme.\""

In a report for Radio 4's PM programme, I had bought a pizza for 0.5 BTC, a tortuous process which had not seemed worth the \u00a330 it cost back then - of course, at today's exchange rate, that was a \u00a314,000 pizza.\nI had also written a blog post headlined \"The Bitcoin Bubble\", in which I tried to mine some lessons from a period when the price of the cryptocurrency shot up from $15 to $276 and then hurtled lower again. \nI ended a piece  in which I compared the cryptocurrency with 17th-Century Dutch tulips or London houses in the 1980s with this thought: \"Unless and until Bitcoin can be used to buy a sandwich, or be accepted by your friends when you pay them back for a restaurant meal, then it is likely to remain just a playground for geeks and gamblers.\"\nEight years on, it is still virtually impossible to buy a sandwich with Bitcoin.\nAnd why would you want to, when there's a good chance you'll be mocked a few years later - as I've been for my transaction - for giving away an asset that goes on to soar in value?"

It's time.\"\nPorter made his name on Broadway, winning a Tony Award for his role in the musical Kinky Boots in 2013.\nHe won an Emmy in 2019 for playing Pray Tell, an MC on the 1980s New York ballroom scene, in Ryan Murphy's acclaimed TV drama Pose. He earned Golden Globes nominations for best TV drama actor in both 2019 and 2020.\n\"I was the generation that was supposed to know better, and it happened anyway,\" he said of contracting HIV.\n\"The shame of that time compounded with the shame that had already [accumulated] in my life silenced me, and I have lived with that shame in silence for 14 years. HIV-positive, where I come from, growing up in the Pentecostal church with a very religious family, is God's punishment.\"\nHe said he told \"everybody who needed to know\", explaining: \"I was trying to have a life and a career, and I wasn't certain I could if the wrong people knew.\n\"It would just be another way for people to discriminate against me in an already discriminatory profession. So I tried to think about it as little as I could. I tried to block it out.\"\nHe said he was making it public now because \"it's time to grow up and move on because shame is destructive - and if not dealt with, it can destroy everything in its path\".\nHe did not even tell his mother until recently, he said. \"I was embarrassed. I was ashamed. I was the statistic that everybody said I would be.\n\"So I'd made a pact with myself that I would let her die before I told her. That's what I was waiting for, if I'm being honest. When we moved her into the Actors Fund Nursing Home, I was like, 'She's not going to be here long, and then I'll write my book and come out and she won't have to live with the embarrassment of having an HIV-positive child.'\n\"That was five years ago. She ain't going anywhere.\"\nHe and his sister made a plan to visit her to break the news, but he decided to do so over the phone on the last day of filming Pose, he said.\n\"Not two minutes into the conversation, she's like, 'What's wrong?' I said, 'Nothing.' She's like, 'Son, please tell me what's wrong.'\n\"So I ripped the Band-Aid off and I told her. She said, 'You've been carrying this around for 14 years? Don't ever do this again. I'm your mother, I love you no matter what. And I know I didn't understand how to do that early on, but it's been decades now.'\n\"And it's all true. It's my own shame. Years of trauma makes a human being skittish. But the truth shall set you free. I feel my heart releasing.\"\nModern treatments mean people can live long and healthy lives with HIV. \"This is what HIV-positive looks like now,\" Porter said.\n\"I'm going to die from something else before I die from that. My T-cell levels are twice yours because of this medication.\""

      "text": "Women given faulty breast implants fear thousands of them may have to pay back compensation after visits by bailiffs warning them of legal proceedings.\nGerman safety body TUV Rheinland was found liable for the global PIP implant scandal in 2017 and ordered to make payouts to victims by a French court.\nThe firm has begun an appeal and some 13,000 victims awarded compensation have been issued legal papers.\nOne victim said bailiff visits had left her with anxiety and panic attacks.\nTUV Rheinland said it had been forced to send papers directly to victims' homes as the legal team representing the women had failed to register with the court, in compliance with French law.\nThe implants were manufactured by the French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) and in 2010 it emerged they had been made with substandard, industrial-grade silicone.\nThe scandal affected about 300,000 women in as many as 65 countries, including France, the UK, Germany, Venezuela and Brazil.\nSarah Higginson, from Andover in Hampshire, was awarded an interim payout of \u00a33,000 in 2017 for implants she had in 2008, leaving her with \u00a32,085.48 after legal fees. \nThe 39-year-old said the visit by bailiffs left her suffering with anxiety and panic attacks and she feared if the appeal was successful money would have to be paid back.\n\"We had to wait years for the small amount of compensation we did get and that didn't even cover the cost of the surgery and now we're getting this treatment with people turning up with papers left, right and centre,\" she said.\n\"It is causing long term mental damage. On top of that, it's all the worry about what's inside you and the long-term health implications\".\nStephanie Wendy Lee from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, had the implants in 2008 and has also been served papers from the French courts. \nShe said: \"When you actually receive this package it's terrifying. \n\"It's like having a court summons. You think, is a bailiff suddenly going to turn up at the house and take stuff away? Am I going to prison for money that I've been given through the courts?\"\nStephanie said she believed the stigma of having a cosmetic procedure affected the way people treated the victims of PIP. \nShe said: \"Because it's a cosmetic thing, because you've had an implant put inside your bust, the majority of people say\u2026 'well you chose to have it done'.\"\nShe is now calling for more to be done to help those trying to rebuild their lives. \nAmanda Carter had PIP implants in 2002. In early 2010 she started to experience extreme pain in her right breast and found the implants were leaking silicone into her body. She later had them removed.\nMrs Carter, 47, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, now helps run the Official PIP Implant Campaign (OPIC) support group on Facebook.\nHer papers were delivered to an old address - something she said was also causing distress to other victims.\n\"It's been hugely concerning,\" she said. \"A lot of women are concerned that a bailiff at their door means that they can come in and take their possessions and a lot of people have presumed they are there to collect.\"\nTUV Rheinland, which was among the bodies that had certified the implants, was found responsible for failing to detect problems with them and ordered to pay compensation.\nHowever, it maintains it was not responsible for what the implants were made of, only the way they were produced.\nThe founder of PIP, Jean-Claude Mas, was sentenced to four years in prison for fraud in 2013. He died in April aged 79.\nC\u00e9cile Derycke, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells Paris representing TUV Rheinland in France, said the company had \"taken many steps\" to avoid sending the documentation to the claimants.\n\"In French law people who are defendants before the court of appeal must either register counsel with the court, or they must receive the other party's submissions through a bailiff.\n\"Unfortunately after more than a year of trying to avoid this - to avoid the costs and also the complexities for everyone involved - no lawyer had registered counsel for some of the claimants and so that's why TUV Rheinland didn't have any other choice but to send the documentation to some of the claimants, and the French lawyers for the claimants were duly informed that this would happen.\"\nThe BBC has been unable to reach Olivier Auma\u00eetr, the lawyer representing PIP victims, for comment.

      "text": "The government must urgently act on its pledge to extend bereavement payments to co-habiting couples, a cross-party group of MPs has said.\nThe group wants ministers to comply within three months of court rulings that say limiting the benefits to married couples breached human rights.\nA Labour MP behind the move said current rules \"punished\" the children of unmarried parents. \nBoris Johnson vowed last year to \"remedy\" the \"injustice\". \nCampaigners said around 2,000 co-habiting families a year lose out on the payments, made to individuals whose husband, wife or civil partner has died.\nMinisters pledged in July last year to extend the payments to cover co-habiting couples with children, but are yet to bring forward proposals.\nThe Department of Work and Pensions said it was \"carefully considering\" how to implement the change.  \nBereavement Support Payment is a benefit paid to families for 18 months if a husband, wife or civil partner dies - but unmarried partners are ineligible. \nIt is awarded at different levels according to individual circumstances, but can rise to almost \u00a310,000 if a couple receives child benefit.\nIn February 2020, the High Court found denying co-habiting parents the payments was against their human rights. \nIt followed a similar judgment at the Supreme Court in 2018.\nMPs and child poverty campaigners have been lobbying ministers since then to update the legislation to reflect the ruling. \nSuch a law was not included in last week's Queen's Speech - when the government set out its legislative programme for the coming year. \nOn Wednesday, a group of 54 MPs signed a symbolic amendment to the programme, calling on ministers to \"fully remedy\" the situation by complying with the rulings within three months. \nIt was later defeated by 366 votes to 265.\nOne of the MPs to sign the amendment, Labour's Stella Creasy, said it would support \"some of the most vulnerable people in our communities\".\nShe added that figures from the Child Bereavement Network showed \"every 22 minutes in this country, a child loses a mother or a father\" and risked losing their home or their family circumstances as a result. \nMs Creasy said: \"It's estimated 2,000 families a year who find themselves in that horrific situation - many more who will have done because of Covid - are then not eligible for financial support.\n\"The reason they are not eligible is something very simple. Because the state has decided that because their parents are not married those children must be pushed in to poverty.\"\nShe added: \"The government knows it has to remedy this situation, because otherwise we are punishing children for the decisions that their parents have made.\"\nA spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said it was committed to extending the payments to co-habiting couples, adding: \"We understand how vital this support is to families.\n\"We are carefully considering the detail and implementation which we will outline in due course.\""

      "tags": "UK trade tariffs,Elizabeth Truss,Agriculture",
      "text": "Senior ministers have met to discuss concerns about how a zero-tariffs free-trade deal with Australia would affect UK farmers.\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss said on Wednesday that negotiators were \"in a sprint\" to secure an agreement in principle by early June.\nBut a farming union has warned of \"irreversible damage\" from a bad deal and the cabinet is reportedly split.\nThere are fears huge Australian cow and sheep farms could undercut UK rivals.\nThe UK government is keen to strike trade deals following Brexit and has indicated that the agricultural sector may have to prepare for the lowering of tariffs on imports.\nIn 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK was valued at \u00a320.1bn, and both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably.\nCurrently, trade in meat between the two countries is very small. \nApproximately only 0.15% of all Australian beef exports go to the UK. \nLast year, 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK came from Australia. \nThe Financial Times has reported that Environment Secretary George Eustice and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove strongly disagree with Ms Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost over granting tariff-free access to Australian, and possibly New Zealand, farmers.\nMinisters met earlier on Thursday to discuss the issues. \nThe BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said a source had given her a \"flavour\" of how the meeting went, tweeting: \"Liz [Truss] left the room happier than [George] Eustice\".\nOur political editor said while it was \"not quite white smoke on what was actually decided\" we \"should have a better indication\" by the end of the day about what was discussed.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak has said that any trade deal signed by the UK government will include \"the appropriate safeguards and protections\" for farming and standards. \nIn an interview with BBC Newsbeat he said: \"The government is keen to try and conclude a trade deal with Australia that's good for British businesses and good for British shoppers.\"\nThe National Farmers' Union has urged ministers to \"make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly\", while the Scottish and Welsh governments have also raised concerns.\nScottish Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon has written to Ms Truss, arguing that \"a trade deal that liberalises tariffs for Australian farmers, to put it bluntly, will put UK farmers out of business\".\nShe also suggested imposing quotas to control imports of lamb and beef, which must be \"duly maintained and not eroded over time\". \nAnd Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted a \"level playing field\".\n\"How can our hill farmers compete with Australian climate?\" he asked. \"How can our hill farmers compete with the space that is available for the huge farms that they have in Australia?\"\nMr Drakeford said UK animal welfare standards were \"higher\" than those in Australia, making two-way trade more difficult.\nUltimately the aim of any trade deal is pretty simple.\nBoth sides want the best for their consumers and businesses but if there was a soundtrack to trade rounds it will be \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" because there has to be compromise involved. \nWhat's at stake here is exactly which of those red lines we're likely to want to bend, because Australia has all along said it wants more access for its farmers. It wants no tariffs on the goods it sends to the UK, and it doesn't want any quotas involved.\nThat has alarmed farmers here - our farms tend to be much smaller, maybe a few dozen herd of cattle, as opposed to thousands - and also we have higher charges for things like environmental standards, so they say we'd be disadvantaged.\nWe know some cabinet ministers have some sympathy with that, but the Department for International Trade argues there will still be safeguards in place, any changes will be introduced over many years. And if you look at what Australia actually sells to us at the moment, they are not taking full advantage of the allowances they already have. \nThis is about Global Britain's bigger ambitions and how that is going to be playing out over the years. Because ultimately trade economists say if you look at the change in imports we could see under a zero tariffs situation , they are equal to 0.1% of our total imports. Pretty tiny. \nIt's when you start talking about deals with the big players in agriculture - the US and Brazil. They'll be watching this one closely. \nThe Conservative MP, Dehenna Davison, told BBC Radio 5 Live that cheaper meat imports from Australia \"could bring down the price of a weekly shop\" and \"that can be seen as a good thing\".\nBut she said poor quality food would not be brought in to the country and the government \"would not let\" the UK be \"flooded\" with an influx of cheap meat to undercut British farmers. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said the UK was seeking deals \"tailored so that they can best meet the needs of the British people\".\n\"We want to secure an ambitious deal that benefits businesses and consumers across the UK, and of course any agreement will include protection for the agriculture industry,\" he added.\nFiona Simpson, president of Australia's National Farmers' Federation, told BBC Today programme on Radio Four, she wanted to \"re-establish a very strong trade relationship with the UK, which we had before the UK joined the EU\".\nShe added that some UK consumers had a desire to \"eat some Aussie beef\".\nBut Australian farmers were \"just not able to ship our produce in any sort of a quantity to the UK\", Ms Simpson said, adding: \"It's just way too expensive and way too far.\"\nAre you a farmer in the UK?

      "tags": "Israel,Palestinian territories,Gaza",
      "text": "Home to about two million people, Gaza is 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, an enclave bounded by the Mediterranean Sea, Israel and Egypt.\nTensions between Gaza and Israel have recently escalated into the worst violence for several years and led the UN to warn of \"a full-scale war\".\nOriginally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war. Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers in 2005.\nIt is under the control of the militant Islamist group Hamas, which ejected forces loyal to the then governing Palestinian Authority (PA) after a violent rift in 2007.\nSince then, Israel and Egypt have restricted the movement of goods and people in and out in what they say are security measures against militants.\nHamas and Israel fought a brief conflict in 2014, and in May 2021 hostilities between the two sides broke out again. \nThe Gaza fighting began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. On 10 May Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. Exchanges intensified and hostilities quickly escalated into the worst violence between Israel and Gaza since 2014.\nPower cuts are an everyday occurrence in Gaza. Before the latest upsurge in fighting, households in Gaza were receiving power on eight-hour rotations.\nThe latest violence is said to have damaged power lines and disrupted fuel supplies. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha), most homes are now receiving power for only three-four hours per day.\nThe Strip gets most of its power from Israel together with further contributions from Gaza's only power plant and a small amount from Egypt. \nBoth the Gaza Power Plant (GPP) and many people's individual generators depend on diesel fuel, but supplies brought in via Israel are frequently blocked causing more disruption.\nSince Hamas came to power in Gaza in 2007, Egypt has largely kept its border with Gaza closed.\nLast year additional restrictions were imposed to try to restrict the spread of coronavirus. \nThe Rafah crossing into Egypt and the Erez crossing into Israel were both shut on about 240 days and opened on only 125 in 2020, according to Ocha figures. \nIn 2019 about 78,000 people left Gaza via the Rafah crossing but in 2020 that fell to 25,000.\nIn the north, crossings into Israel at Erez also fell dramatically in 2020 - partly due to pandemic restrictions. This year about 8,000 people have left Gaza via the Erez crossing, most of them patients or people accompanying them for medical care in Israel.\nUntil the latest violence, traffic had begun to pick up again. Some aid convoys have since been allowed through, but otherwise crossings have remained shut.\nAbout 80% of the population of Gaza depends on international aid, according to the UN, and about one million people rely on daily food aid.\nThe blockade imposed by Israel has severely impacted movements in and out of the Strip and the ability to trade.\nTo try to get round the blockade, Hamas has built a network of tunnels which it uses to bring goods into the Strip and also as its underground command centre. Israel says tunnels are also used by militants to move around out of sight and are being targeted by air strikes.\nCoronavirus has also had an impact on the local economy, but it was just beginning to show signs of recovery, according to the World Bank, when the fighting broke out.\nGaza has one of the highest population densities in the world. According to the UN, almost 600,000 refugees in Gaza are living in eight crowded camps.\nOn average there are more than 5,700 people per square kilometre - very similar to the density of population in London - but that figure rises to more than 9,000 in Gaza City.\nIsrael declared a buffer zone along the border in 2014 to protect itself from rocket attacks and infiltrations by militants. The zone reduced the amount of land available for people to live or farm on.\nThe UN estimated about 140,000 houses were damaged or destroyed in the 2014 violence and it has since supported almost 90,000 families with help to rebuild their homes.\nOcha says several hundred homes have been severely damaged in the latest fighting, but it will take some time to reveal the full extent of the damage.\nGaza's public health system is in a precarious state due to various reasons. Ocha says Israel and Egypt's blockade, lower health expenditure from the West Bank-based PA and internal political conflict between the PA - which has responsibility for healthcare in the Palestinian territories - and Hamas are all to blame.\nThe UN helps out by running 22 healthcare facilities. But a number of hospitals and clinics were damaged or destroyed in previous conflicts with Israel.\nPatients from Gaza needing treatment in West Bank or East Jerusalem hospitals must first get requests approved by the PA and then exit passes approved by the Israeli government - in 2019, the approval rate for patient applications to leave the Gaza Strip was 65%.\nOver the last few months, the health situation has been exacerbated by coronavirus.\nIn April, a spike in cases saw almost 3,000 a day in Gaza. There have been more than 104,000 cases since the start of the pandemic and more than 946 people have died with the virus.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) warns that the border restrictions are not only limiting access to life-saving treatment for victims of the hostilities, but they are also hampering the coronavirus response.\nThe WHO says it is affecting the \"critical\" vaccination programme and increases the risk of spreading the virus as people seek refuge with relatives or in emergency shelters.\nMore than a million people in Gaza are classed as \"moderately-to-severely food insecure\", according to the UN, despite many receiving some form of food aid.\nBorder crossings have been opened to allow aid convoys through, but shelling has caused some disruption to deliveries.\nIsraeli restrictions on access to agricultural land and fishing have reduced the amount of food Gazans can produce themselves.\nThey are not allowed to farm in the Israeli-declared buffer zone - 1.5km (0.9 miles) wide on the Gaza side of the border - and this has led to a loss in production of an estimated 75,000 tonnes of produce a year.\nIsrael imposes a fishing limit meaning Gazans can only fish within a certain distance of the shore. The UN says if the limit were lifted, fishing could provide employment and a cheap source of protein for the people of Gaza.\nAfter the latest upsurge in violence, Israel temporarily banned any fishing from the Gaza Strip. Over the years it has set varying limits on the fishing zone, disrupting the livelihoods of about 5,000 fishermen and related workers.\nMost people in Gaza suffer from a shortage of water. Tap water is salty and polluted and is not fit for drinking.\nWhile most Gazan households are on a piped water network, Ocha says families received water for only six-eight hours every four days in 2017 due to insufficient power. This has been reduced still further by the latest attacks.\nThe World Health Organization set the minimum requirement for daily water needs at 100 litres per head - to cover drinking, washing, cooking and bathing. In Gaza average consumption is about 88 litres.\nSewage is another problem. Although 78% of households are connected to public sewage networks, treatment plants are overloaded. Ocha says more than a hundred million litres of partially treated and raw sewage is pumped into the Mediterranean daily.\nA new wastewater treatment plant came into operation at the beginning of 2021 to help deal with the problem.\nMany children attend schools run by the UN and many of them are acting as places of shelter for people who have fled the latest shelling.\nAccording to the Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, 64% of its 275 schools run a \"double shift\" system, with one school of students in the morning and another in the afternoon.\nAn average class size was around 41 pupils in 2019.\nThe literacy rate for those aged 15-19 is now 99% - it has steadily increased over the past few years.  \nAlthough only about 66% of pupils stay on at high school to complete upper secondary or the equivalent of sixth form.\nGaza has one of the world's youngest populations, with almost 65% of the population under 25 years old, according to the CIA Factbook.\nMany young people are unemployed. \nAn Ocha report from 2020 said youth unemployment was running at 70%, partly as a result of the pandemic.\nCorrection 28 July 2020: A previous version of this story has been amended to make clear that the Gaza Strip is still controlled by Hamas, and not the Palestinian Authority."

      "text": "Women from 15 universities have signed a letter calling for a mandatory policy for dealing with sexual assault allegations in higher education.\nThe women said their allegations of sexual assault were mishandled by their universities.  \nCurrently it is not compulsory for higher education institutions to implement a specific policy to deal with allegations of sexual assault.\nUniversities UK said \"all universities have policies and practices in place\".\nIt added it had created guidance to support the sector and that universities were accelerating efforts to address misconduct in recent years. \nSamantha Kilford, 23, from Neath, is one of the women from across the UK to have signed the letter. She said she was sexually assaulted during freshers week by a student at the University of the West of England (UWE).\n\"The investigation took a year. It felt very dragged out and very secretive. It felt like they were waiting for me to give up,\" she said.\n\"It also felt like they were protecting him. In the investigation they even offered him the opportunity to interrogate me about what I had told them. He knew everything I was saying but I had no idea what his responses were.\n\"The most frustrating bit is that I still don't know what the result of the investigation was. They told me I wasn't allowed to know. They just said the complaint was upheld and that was it.\"\nIn response, the UWE said that data protection laws \"prevent the university from sharing all of the details of the final outcome\" and that they \"do not allow direct questioning between the alleged perpetrator and the student who has reported the incident\".\nIt also said it takes \"a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and misconduct\" and it would \"be happy to talk to the reporting student concerned directly about her experience, any recommendations on how we can improve our practice, and our protocol on case outcomes''.\nSydney Feder, 23, initiated the letter after  she said she was sexually assaulted during her final year at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.\nShe said the college's investigation was negligent and made her feel \"worthless\" after she said she was \"totally left out of the process\" and that she was never told of the outcome of the investigation. \nMs Feder also started an online petition after a series of anonymous survivor accounts began to appear on Instagram from different universities through the pandemic. She said a \"baseline safeguarding policy written by the government\" is needed.\nThe Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama said anything reported to them was \"investigated thoroughly\", and that \"these specific allegations and questions raised are the subject of a sensitive and ongoing civil compensation claim to which the college has filed a robust defence\". \nThe letter is also signed by 13 charities and campaign groups, including the 1752 group, which campaigns to end staff sexual misconduct in higher education.\nThe signatories list a number of suggestions in the letter for the governments to consider, including:\nCurrently, universities and colleges generally investigate allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct through their own internal complaints procedures.\nA recent study by John Edmonds and Eva Tutchell, authors of Unsafe Spaces, found there are a minimum of 50,000 sexual assaults at universities every year.\nThrough Freedom of Information requests from 102 universities in England and Wales, the same study said that only nine had satisfactory safeguarding policies for dealing with sexual assault. A third, 32, were considered by the authors as \"very poor\".\n\"Some of these universities' policies are like stuff out of the 19th Century. It's policy making in the dark. This is a national crisis,\" said Mr Edmonds. \nEarlier this month, the Office for Students, England's independent regulator of higher education, called for universities to urgently review their policies by this summer. \nNicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said: \"Over the next year we will examine how universities and colleges respond to our expectations. As part of this process, we will consider options for connecting the statement directly to our conditions of registration.\" \nHannah, who studies at the University of Leicester, also signed the letter after she said her allegation of rape was not dealt with by the university. \n\"I felt like the university didn't care,\" she said. \"I felt like they wanted to shut up this case with minimal cost and fuss.\n\"He was worth \u00a336,000 to them. It felt like the money was worth more to them than doing what was right.\"\nThe University of Leicester said it was \"fully committed to well-being and safety of students and staff\" and \"cannot comment on individual cases, however every disclosure is taken extremely seriously and investigated fully\".\nHannah said: \"They are a business, not an academic service. Money is their number one priority. \n\"If you touch that financial pocket it will break. We have to break the system. Someone has to intervene. That's why I've signed the letter.\" \nThe UK government said it was committed to working with the Office for Students and urged universities to engage with their statement of expectations and review their policies. \nBoth the Scottish government and the Northern Ireland Executive said they have set out clear expectations that institutions are expected to adopt to ensure they have efficient policies in place. \nThe Welsh government said they supported HEFCW's guidance for Higher Education institutions and fund specialist organisations to deliver training at universities across Wales.\nIn a statement, Universities UK, which represents the institutions around the country, said all UK universities have policies and practices in place to address all forms of harassment, as well as a code of practice for students which sets out expected behaviours.\n\"We have seen universities accelerating efforts to address harassment and misconduct in recent years, working together with dedicated students, staff and student unions to develop policies and campaigns to raise awareness and encourage students to have the confidence to come forward to report, knowing they will be listened to and that action will be taken by the university when needed,\" it said. \n\"The challenge is to make sure students know where to get help and support when they need it, and universities are constantly considering the best ways to signpost relevant information and appropriate support for all members of their community.\n\"Universities UK has created a wide range of national frameworks and guidance to support the sector in tackling violence against women, harassment and hate crime. We will continue supporting our members to bring about culture change by, embedding policies and best practice so that universities are safe places to live, work and study.\""

      "title": "Indian variant: Why is UK taking a risk with the variant?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A Covid variant first identified in India and spreading in parts of the UK, has threatened to derail Britain's plans for a return to normality. In allowing the latest lockdown easing, the government stands accused of recklessness. So why has it taken the risk?\nLast Thursday 39 of the country's leading scientists and health experts gathered - via video conference - to discuss the escalating situation. \nAt the Sage meeting they were presented with a paper by the government's modelling committee, that made alarming reading. \nThere was, the document said, a \"realistic possibility\" that the Indian variant was 50% more transmissible than the UK variant which had been responsible for the deadly winter wave.\nIf this was the case, the modellers said, there was the potential for a summer wave that would be even worse. It could not have been more alarming. \nOne of those present, Sir Jeremy Farrar, said they faced the \"hardest policy decision\" of the pandemic - but in the end moving ahead with the roadmap was a reasonable call considering the context.\nDig beneath the headlines and a more complex picture emerges than the 50% figure which grabbed headlines. The term \"realistic possibility\" is actually a defined phrase, one of several on a sliding scale used by these committees.\nIt means there is basically a 50:50 chance the modellers are right about the variant being as much as 50% more infectious. \nAlong with the modelling presented on Thursday, several other pieces of evidence were looked at. Public Health England (PHE) had been gathering data on what had been happening on the ground as part of the test-and-trace programme. It cast doubt on the 50% figure.\nA number of things did not add up to its analysts. \nSome of the data on \"secondary attack rates\" - the chances of an infected individual passing the virus on to someone - suggested the variant may be much less infectious than feared.\nAnd it did not seem to be behaving in the same way in every region. A significant cluster has been found in London, but that had not risen at the same speed as it had in Bolton. \nThe degree of extra transmissibility makes a big difference. A variant that is 20% more transmissible has a much smaller impact on hospital cases.\nThe sheer volume of imported cases from travellers returning from India - it was argued - could have caused a spike, and explain a big chunk of what appeared to be the extra infectiousness.\nOne of the problems in nailing how infectious a variant is, is the lag between getting a positive diagnosis from a patient and establishing which variant of the virus caused it. It takes about a week.\nSo the picture we are looking at is, in fact, out of date.\nAnother sign being analysed is the latest raw infection rates in hotspot areas - before samples are sequenced. There are now some tentative signs the rapid rises may have started slowing, offering support to the hope the 50% extra transmissibility figure is too high.\nWhat is more, some at the meeting believe the models were too pessimistic - suggesting the vaccination programme will stem the rise in infections or at least limit the scale of serious illness more than the modellers predicted.\n\"There is a huge degree of uncertainty with this - we have spotted this early and we are still trying to work out what exactly is going on with this variant,\" said one of those working on analysing it.\nNaturally with so much unknown, there was much debate both at Sage and in other meetings that took place on Friday, about how to respond. \nThe nuclear option of delaying indoor mixing, due to re-start on 17 May, was discussed. Doing so could buy more time to study the emerging data on the Indian variant, while allowing for more vaccine rollout. \nBut the government was already committed - it had been confirmed last Monday - and so it was ruled out, although in Scotland extra restrictions have stayed in place in Glasgow and Moray. \n\"It was agonising. There was just not enough evidence there to justify the move,\" said one of the people close to the decision-making. \"But keeping restrictions comes with a cost too.\"\nThere have been plenty of experts questioning whether Monday's unlocking was worth the risk, including members of Independent Sage and the British Medical Association.\nBut it is worth noting that these are the same critics who warned against the full re-opening of schools in March, saying it would lead to a surge. They also said the January lockdown was not tough enough to bring cases of the UK variant down and objected to delaying the gap between vaccine doses to 12 weeks with the BMA calling for the gap to halved.\n\"We know if it goes wrong the critics will say 'we told you so'. But... those people criticising now have been wrong before,\" another of those involved in the meetings last week said. \nThat, of course, is the price that comes with power - and if cases and, crucially, hospitalisations do take off it will look like a mistake. \nBut this is unlikely to be the last time the UK is faced with such a situation. \nMuch has been made, understandably, of the decision not to put India on the red list sooner. But this is not just a UK problem - the Indian variant has been found in 50 countries across the world, including Australia. \nYes, the UK has identified the most cases after India, but it does do nearly half the world's genomic sequencing. Another of the scientists who took part in the Sage meeting last week, Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has said the spread of the variant could not have been stopped, only delayed \"a little bit\".\nProf Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases, at Edinburgh University, agrees. \"This situation was entirely expected. In six months time I'm sure we will be talking about another variant,\" he says.\nHe is more worried about the South Africa variant given it seems more able to escape some of the effect of the vaccines - although the evidence is pointing to a rather more limited escape than was originally feared.\nVariants, unfortunately, will be a fact of life in this pandemic until the virus is brought under control across the world. But that does not mean there is no way out or that the UK, with its progress with vaccination, cannot keep moving towards a more normal way of life."

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

We think she was asleep in the bush and then she just came at us - fast.\n\"I was at the back of the group and people just scattered and started to hide because the black rhino has typically poor eyesight.\n\"I saw her coming and pushed two guys behind the trees. But I didn't get out of the way in time.\"\nThe rhino headbutted him.\n\"She hit me and I was sandwiched between her and the tree,\" he said. \"I fell and she came around to hit me again and then the calf ran across my leg.\n\"When she was getting ready to go a third time, everyone started shouting and they ran off.\"\nKieran was taken to hospital by IPSS Medical Rescue who had been scrambled, along with anti-poaching units to find him.\nAfter popping his hip back into place, all he is left with are substantial bruises. \nNumbers of the endangered African black rhino have increased slightly over the past six years partly due to ambitious protection efforts against poachers.\nThe animals are known for their \"attack-first\" attitude when they catch an unfamiliar scent. \n\"They are likely to charge at anything unfamiliar and have a reputation, because of their bad eyesight, of sometimes charging into objects such as trees and rocks, mistaking them as threats.\"\nWednesday's encounter was the closest Kieran has had with a rhino. But despite being hurt, he says he cannot wait to get back out into the reserves again.\n\"No serious injuries have occurred and I'm making a good recovery. I still absolutely love what I do and have no negative feelings towards the innocent rhino.\n\"I still love and adore all animals, including the black rhino, and look forward to being back in the field as soon as I'm able.\n\"I was scared but I love these animals and she was only protecting her calves. It's just one of those things.\""

      "tags": "Travel,Network Rail,Department for Transport,Rail travel,Travel & leisure industry",
      "text": "Rail passengers have been promised a better and more efficient service under the biggest shake-up in decades.\nA new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would replace an \"overcomplicated and fragmented\" system.\nHe told the BBC the changes did not mean fares would inevitably rise, but could not give guarantees.\nAsked on Today if the changes meant rising ticket prices, Mr Shapps said: \"No, is the answer\". But he added: \"I'm not here to give guarantees for years to come.\"\nLabour said there was \"little substance\" behind the plans. \nThe government says a more unified rail system will lead to more \"high-quality, consistent services\" from 2023 onwards, plus better connections. \nThere will also be changes to make travel smoother, including:\nThe flexible season tickets will offer savings on certain routes for people who do not travel to work every day, reflecting the expected changes to commuting patterns after the pandemic.\nThey are due to go on sale on 21 June for use seven days later, and will allow passengers to travel on any eight days in a 28-day period. \nDarshita Rajani, who lives in Wellingborough but works in London, welcomes the idea of a flexible season ticket. \nCurrently a season ticket for her journey costs just under \u00a38,000. But she will only be doing three days a week when she goes back to the office so that would be prohibitively expensive.\n\"If things don't change I will still have to buy a season ticket, which is a waste of money, but a day ticket costs \u00a3116,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"It's insane how much they charge for a 50-minute train journey. I hope there will be two-days-a-week, three-days-a-week flexi tickets.\"\nThe reforms follow the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018 and years of complaints about the \"fragmented\" franchising system, which has been scrapped.\nGBR will replace the current track operator, Network Rail, in 2023 and the government says the new system will look more like Transport for London, with multiple operators under one brand.\nThe systems will differ slightly in Scotland and Wales, where transport is devolved, but GBR will still operate in those nations.\nThe Department for Transport said in Scotland and Wales will continue to exercise their current powers and be accountable for them, but the government will explore options to ensure all nations benefit from the reforms.\nGBR will continue to own the infrastructure in Scotland and Wales (other than some of the South Wales Valley Lines), as Network Rail does now.\nRail in Northern Ireland is devolved and not linked to the wider UK network. \nMr Shapps said the ultimate aim was to create \"one guiding mind\" overseeing the UK rail system, so there was there is more accountability when things went wrong.\nMost rail services will still be run by the private sector, but under new \"passenger contracts\" they will be expected to meet targets on punctuality and efficiency for the first time.\nKeith Williams, the former boss of British Airways who led the review into the reforms, told the BBC's Today programme: \"What we've done here is listen to what customers want out of rail and react to that.\n\"And that really is a more reliable punctual service and better opportunities [when] buying tickets. \n\"There is an enormous opportunity here not only to simplify the way that people buy tickets, but also to benefit from a retail environment which gives greater flexibility in the way that fares are operated in the future.\"\nMr Shapps, who also worked on the review, said the the new reforms would give the railways \"solid and stable foundations for the future\" after \"years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication.\"\nOn possible fare rises, he pointed out that the taxpayer had plugged a \u00a312bn hole during the coronavirus crisis to keep the railways operating and fares were subsidised. \nBut he said there was no \"hidden agenda\". \n\"Of course any government in the future will have to weigh those things up,\" he said. \nIf the plan is followed through and properly implemented, it should see an end to the squabbling over who is to blame when the trains are late, dirty or overcrowded. Everything will be the problem of a single body.\nThat concentration of power will also be a potential Achilles' heel. One of the successes of the privatisation was the freedom for train companies to do new things - a freedom that was a partial factor in the remarkable revival in passenger numbers in the past two decades. \nIf that spirit of innovation is lost - and if civil servants and politicians endlessly interfere in the working of the new authority - the railways risk sliding into stagnation. \nThe fear among railway executives is that the Treasury, having had to pay dearly to support services during the pandemic, will seek to claw back spending, leading to cuts in services. \nAnthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said passengers would welcome a move \"towards a more accountable and joined-up railway\".\n\"Ultimately what they will care about is whether rail is the best option for them, if it is reliable, efficient and good value,\" he said. \nBut Labour's shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said the the reforms were unlikely to work. \n\"With fare hikes, \u00a31bn cuts to Network Rail and broken promises to communities across the country, it's yet another example of ministers talking a good game, with very little substance underneath.\"\nHenri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, welcomed the plan in principle saying the old franchise model \"was broken\".  \nBut he called for more to be done on lowering fares in the North.\n\"Although more pay-as-you-go ticketing is welcome, the lack of greater progress in fares reform means that there is less incentive for people to stop using their cars to travel around the North.\"\nMeanwhile, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the proposals could deliver \"the biggest changes in a generation\".\nDirector general Andy Bagnall said: \"Train operators called for a guiding mind and Great British Railways will help to bring the whole industry together.\n\"To deliver for passengers and freight customers, it must have the independence to hold the operators of both tracks and trains to account equally. Crucially, it needs to allow operators to put their customers at the absolute forefront of decision-making,\" he added.\nThe publication of the plan comes eight months after the government scrapped the system of rail franchising, which had been in force since privatisation, and unveiled plans to extend support for train firms.\nAfter a drop in passenger numbers during the pandemic as more people worked from home, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues."

      "text": "Surge testing and jabs will be expanded to six new areas of concern in England to combat the spread of the Indian Covid variant, Matt Hancock has said.\nThe areas were identified using new techniques, including analysing wastewater and travel patterns, he told a Downing Street briefing.\nThe government is also supporting Scotland in rolling out more tests and vaccinations in Glasgow and Moray.\nSome 2,967 cases of the Indian variant have now been identified in the UK.\nThis is up from about 2,300 on Monday.\nMr Hancock said early evidence suggested that this variant - B.1.617.2 - passes on more easily from person to person than the one first discovered in Kent, adding that it was now \"even more important that people get vaccinated\".\nBut he said ministers were \"determined to do all that we can to ensure this new variant doesn't put our recovery at risk\".\nFurther surge testing and vaccinations will now be introduced in:\nThe health secretary said these were selected via \"an incredibly sensitive biosecurity surveillance system\", which spotted cases in earlier variant hotspots Bolton and Blackburn.\nMonitoring travel patterns, along with analysis of wastewater - or sewage - in 70% of the country had helped identify where variants were and also where they were at risk of spreading to, he said.\nOutlining the spread of the Indian variant, he added: \"The weekly case data in Bolton is now 283 per 100,000 and it doubled in the last week.\n\"There are now 25 people in Bolton Hospital with Covid - the majority are unvaccinated, nearly 90% have not yet had two vaccines.\n\"This shows the importance of getting vaccinated, not once but twice.\"\nScientists will know more about the transmissibility of the new Indian variant by \"some time next week\", England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said.\nOverall, a further three deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been recorded in the UK, and there have been 2,696 more cases overall. \nAnother 174,100 people have been given a first dose of a vaccine, and 324,001 more have received their second dose.\nThe spread of the Indian variant has cast doubt on plans to ease remaining restrictions in England next month.\nThe number of cases of Indian variant is climbing, but what this means remains to be seen.\nThe variant should soon be dominant - it is clearly more infectious than the UK variant which emerged last year.\nScientists are busy studying it to work out just how much more transmissible it is.\nThat means unpicking to what extent the rise is being driven by the sudden importation of the variant from abroad and the environmental factors in the communities where it is spreading. \nIn densely-populated housing conditions it's easier for the virus to be passed on - rather than because of an inherent biological advantage.\nScientists believe it could be anything between 10% to 50% more infectious depending on what influence each of those factors have.\nIf it's nearer 50%, that could drive a surge in cases that could spill over into significant hospital admissions even with the vaccine rollout.\nAt the lower end, the impact will be more muted and the full lifting of restrictions on 21 June could still be on.\nThere are some early signs it could be at the lower end, but it will be a week or two before we know that with any confidence.\nAt the briefing, Mr Hancock praised the UK's development of the AstraZeneca vaccine made by Oxford University, highlighting the worldwide benefits it had brought. He said:\n\"It is something every British taxpayer has had a part supporting and everyone in this United Kingdom should be incredibly proud of it,\" Mr Hancock said.\nMeanwhile, Prof Van-Tam told the news conference that scientists were sure the Indian variant was more transmissible but the \"million dollar question\" was how much more transmissible.\n\"We have a credible range that goes from a few per cent more transmissible through to 50% more transmissible - I think most people feel it is going to be somewhere in the middle... but it is just too early,\" he said.\nHowever, he said transmission of the new variant was \"not inevitable\" and it could be slowed down through \"cautious behaviour\".\n\"I think I've said 'don't tear the pants out of it' once before from this or a similar podium, but frankly we're back to that again now,\" he said.\nHe urged those living in hotspots to think carefully about their new freedoms and try to stick to outdoor activities in small groups.\nEarlier, at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said there was \"increasing confidence\" that Covid-19 vaccines were effective against all variants, including the Indian one.\nBut his official spokesman said ministers would want to see more information before making decisions on the next steps toward lifting lockdown.\nAt PMQs, Mr Johnson also repeated his warning that people should not be holidaying in amber list countries. This includes France, Spain and Greece.\nVisits to those countries should only be made in \"extreme\" circumstances such as a family illness, he said.\nEU ambassadors are recommending that restrictions on travel into the EU should be relaxed for fully vaccinated people, and those from countries with low infection rates. \nA decision on whether the UK will be included on a so-called \"white list\" will be made on Friday.\nPortugal, Italy and Greece have already dropped quarantine restrictions for British travellers and Spain is expected to make an announcement in the coming days.\nPortugal is the only EU country currently on the UK's own green list, allowing travellers to return without going into quarantine."

      "tags": "Great Ormond Street Hospital",
      "text": "A victim of a former Great Ormond Street Hospital porter who sexually abused boys over decades has spoken of his \"guilt, shame and despair\".\nPaul Farrell, 55, pleaded guilty to 76 offences against eight victims between 1985 and 2020.\nA court heard that the true number of offences was \"not less than 560\" but probably \"in the thousands\".\nFarrell, from Camden in north London, will be sentenced following a two-day hearing and faces a lengthy jail term.\nHe befriended the parents of his victims and lodged with them or acted as a babysitter at addresses across the capital in order to abuse their children. \nProsecutor Paul Douglass told Wood Green Crown Court that Farrell's abuse included forcing one of the victims, who at the time was aged between seven and nine, to perform sex acts over a two-year period.\nDuring this same period, Farrell also abused the victim's younger brother, with neither sibling knowing what was happening to the other at the time.\nThe defendant made himself \"indispensable\" to another boy by buying him presents, giving him money and taking him to football matches, according to Mr Douglass, gifts described by the victim as \"bribes for being abused\".\nReading out an impact statement from the witness box, the victim told Farrell: \"I have carried this every day for the last 10 years. I want you to know that you are not going to break me. I am going to get over this and be the best man I can be for the community.\"\nBut his feelings were in contrast to those of the younger of the two brothers involved in the case. \nIn his statement, read to the court by Mr Douglass, he said: \"The last 18 months of my life have been unrecognisable and torturous.\"\nSince making a complaint to the police, he had felt \"guilt, shame, despair and disgust\" over what had happened, and had struggled with depression and his relationship with his family.\n\"I now feel hopeless, lost and disgusted at my silence that has allowed you to ruin the lives of so many innocent children,\" the victim's statement added.\n\"Innocent children like me and my brother will be profoundly scarred by your actions for the rest of our lives.\"\nMr Douglass told the court that the victims had not previously reported the abuse because they had a \"sense of shame\" of what had happened, while some feared that their parents would suffer the consequences.\n\"The defendant used a combination of bribes and threats which enabled him to commit serious sexual offences against the same victims, sometimes for many years,\" he said.\n\"He never gave his victims the slightest indication that he knew that what he was doing was wrong.\n\"For many of them, the sexual abuse became routine. He exerted complete control over his victims, and sometimes their families.\"\nFarrell worked at Great Ormond Street for 26 years. He did not target any patients there but did abuse two of his victims on the hospital site.\nMr Douglass said he had \"ruthlessly exploited the vulnerabilities of his victims\".\nHe told the hearing that the total number of offences Farrell had admitted numbered \"not less than 560 over a period of 35 years\" but that the true figure was \"likely to be in the thousands\".\nMr Douglass said Farrell was arrested for the first time in January last year after one of the victims saw a picture of the defendant on Facebook, which showed him around children.\nFarrell had previously pleaded guilty to a series of charges relating to eight complainants, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, now aged between nine and 43.\nThe offences, carried out between 1985 and 2020, include attempted rape, sexual assault of a child under 13 and making indecent photographs of children.\nA further 20 charges have been left to lie on the file.\nA spokeswoman for Great Ormond Street Hospital said their thoughts were with the victims of \"this horrendous abuse\".\nShe added: \"His actions are in direct contrast to everything we stand for as a children's hospital.\n\"We would like to reiterate what has been said in court; that Paul Farrell did not target children at GOSH.\n\"We urge anyone who has concerns about this case to call the helpline that we have set up with the NSPCC on 0800 101 996.\""

      "text": "Legal concerns have been raised over the movement of hospital patients into care homes in Scotland at the height of the Covid pandemic.\nThe Mental Welfare Commission studied a sample of discharges when someone did not have the capacity to decide for themselves. \nThey found some cases where there was no legal authority for the move.\nThe commission also said it had found \"endemic\" examples of poor practice.\nMore than 10,000 deaths where Covid was listed on the death certificate have been recorded in Scotland - 33% of these have been in care homes while 60% were in hospitals.\nLast month Public Health Scotland said it \"cannot rule out\" a link between hospital discharges and outbreaks in care homes, with nearly a third of homes experiencing an outbreak.\nThe commission studied the detail of 457 moves between March to May 2020 - about 10% of the number reported at the time by Public Health Scotland.\nIt found 20 of those to have been unlawful and that a number were related to the pandemic.\nOne case included a misinterpretation that the Social Work Act had been enacted as a result of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020.\nHowever, the Social Work Act was never activated and removed in September that year.\nIn another instance, a Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) introduced alternative applications for guardianship orders, making decisions \"internally\" instead of referring the matter to the courts.\nAgain, the commission found this started in response to the pandemic and ended in August 2020.\nA total of 338 moves were said to have been authorised using Welfare Power of Attorney or Adults with Incapacity legislation.\nThe commission found those working in hospital discharge were not fully aware of the powers held by attorneys or guardians in 78 out of 267 cases.\nCare home placement also caused confusion in some cases, the report suggested, where someone was admitted to a care home but remained liable for their property.\nThe report made eight recommendations for HSCPs, including making sure staff understand the law through training.\nIt urged the Care Inspectorate to take account of the report in its inspection activity, and the Scottish government to monitor the delivery of the recommendations.\nThe commission's chief executive Julie Paterson said that while some concerns related to the \"significant pressures\" of the pandemic, it \"worryingly\" found \"endemic examples of poor practice\".\nShe said: \"Lack of understanding of the law, lack of understanding of good practice, confusion over the nature of placements, misunderstanding over power of attorney.\n\"These findings are very disappointing and may mean that many more moves were made without valid legal authority.\n\"This report also finds a lack of uniformity from one HSCP to another, with different approaches to national legislation and guidance adopted in different areas.\"\nThe Care Inspectorate welcomed the chance to \"consider findings carefully\" and said it would take recommendations forward.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said it was working with HSCPs to improve progress and to share good practice."

      "text": "A police officer accused of murdering a former footballer said he was \"absolutely petrified\" when he used his Taser on him.\nIn an interview from the time, PC Benjamin Monk said ex-Villa star Dalian Atkinson was \"absolutely livid\" when he and a colleague arrived at the scene.\nHe said Mr Atkinson told him \"I'm taking you to the gates of hell\" and he believed this was his intention.\nPC Monk, 42, is on trial for Mr Atkinson's murder in Telford.\nMr Atkinson, a former Aston Villa star who also played for Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday, died shortly after the officers responded to calls to his father's house in Meadow Close at about 01:30 BST on 15 August, 2016.\nThe court previously heard Mr Atkinson had been acting strangely, shouting in the street and claiming to be the Messiah.\nIn his police interviews, summarised in court, PC Monk recounted how Mr Atkinson's \"face was one of utter rage\" when he opened the door.\n\"It was surreal, he'd got the biggest wildest eyes I'd ever seen, they were protruding from his head,\" he said. \"That was the anger simply coming from this man's face\".\nHe told officers Mr Atkinson, who he described as \"quite simply huge\", was pacing and he decided to deploy his Taser because he knew he could not outrun or overpower him.\n\"The bloke was towering above me, absolutely towering. His shoulders literally filled the frame of the door,\" he said.\nThe first discharge failed and PC Monk said Mr Atkinson then started running at him and his colleague PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, 31.\n\"I genuinely thought we had had it,\" he said.\nHe continued his account, saying Mr Atkinson then turned back towards the house, kicking and punching the front door, which was when PC Monk loaded a second Taser cartridge.\nWhen that too failed, PC Monk said Mr Atkinson told him \"I'm taking you to the gates of hell\" and he believed this was his intention.\nWhen Mr Atkinson fell to the floor after PC Monk successfully discharged a third Taser cartridge, the officer said he felt \"relief\".\nThe trial heard PC Monk discharged the Taser for 33 seconds - six times longer than standard. In his interviews, he said he did not know when he had taken his finger off the trigger and \"felt his brain had stopped working\".\nThe prosecution's case is that the force PC Monk deployed, including kicking Mr Atkinson's head forcefully, was excessive and went beyond self defence.\nPC Bettley-Smith, is accused of using a police baton unlawfully and striking Mr Atkinson whilst he was incapacitated.\nPC Monk denies murder as well as an alternative charge of manslaughter. PC Bettley-Smith denies assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Germany,Russia,Vladimir Putin,United States,Natural gas,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The Biden administration has waived sanctions on a company building a controversial gas pipeline between Russia and Germany.\nThe US also lifted sanctions on the executive - an ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin - who leads the firm behind the Nord Stream 2 project. \nThe move came in a report on Russian sanctions delivered to Congress by the Department of State.\nCritics say the pipeline is a major geopolitical prize for the Kremlin.\nThe project, which would take gas from the Russian Arctic under the Baltic Sea to Germany, is already more than 95% complete.\nThe Department of State report notes that Nord Stream 2 AG and its chief executive, Matthias Warnig, a former East German intelligence officer, engaged in sanctionable activity.\nBut it concludes that it is in the US national interest to waive the sanctions.\nThe Department of State also imposed sanctions on four Russian ships involved in the building of Nord Stream 2, though detractors said that would not be enough to stop the pipeline. \nPresident Joe Biden has said he opposes the $11bn (\u00a37.8bn) project. His Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said during his confirmation hearing that he was \"determined to do whatever we can to prevent that completion\" of Nord Stream 2.\nOn Wednesday, America's top diplomat met his Russian counterpart at an international summit in Iceland.\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia and the US had \"serious differences\", but should work together \"in spheres where our interests collide\".\nMr Blinken said Mr Biden wanted \"a predictable, stable relationship with Russia\".\nEarlier Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said reports of the impending US sanctions waiver were \"a positive signal\".\nAnd Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by the state-run Tass news agency as welcoming \"a chance for a gradual transition toward the normalisation of our bilateral ties\".\nGerman officials also welcomed the sanctions waiver as \"a constructive step\" from the Biden administration.\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters: \"It's an expression of the fact that Germany is an important partner for the US, one that it can count on in the future.\"\nBut Yuriy Vitrenko, the chief executive of Ukraine's state-owned energy company, Naftogaz, said Kyiv would press Washington to impose sanctions to stop the pipeline.\nMr Vitrenko said Nord Stream was Russia's most \"dangerous geopolitical project\".\nThe Biden administration's decision was criticised by a member of the president's own party, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Menendez.\nThe New Jersey Democrat said in a statement: \"I urge the administration to rip off the Band-Aid, lift these waivers and move forward with the congressionally mandated sanctions.\"\nHe added that he failed to see \"how today's decision will advance US efforts to counter Russian aggression in Europe\".\nUS congressional Republicans also condemned the waiver. \nJim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it was \"a gift to Putin that will only weaken the United States' leverage in the lead up to the impending Biden-Putin summit\".\nMr Biden will travel to Europe next month and a potential summit with the Russian president is in the works.\nMichael McCaul, the top-ranking House Republican on foreign affairs, said: \"If the Putin regime is allowed to finish this pipeline, it will be because the Biden Administration chose to let it happen.\"\nHe added: \"It is a Russian malign influence project that threatens to deepen Europe's energy dependence on Moscow, render Ukraine more vulnerable to Russian aggression and provide billions of dollars to Putin's coffers.\"\nWhen Mr Biden came into office he sought to draw a contrast between himself and his predecessor, Donald Trump, by vowing there would be no more \"rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions\".\nBut analysts say the US president was reluctant to risk a trans-Atlantic rift with Germany at a time when he has been trying to reach out to European allies.\nThe sanctions waiver comes after cyber-criminals who the US government says were based in Russia took a major American oil pipeline offline this month, leaving thousands of petrol stations across the US south-east with fuel shortages.\nIt also comes after Mr Biden was lambasted in January for cancelling the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the US, citing the need to combat climate change. \nThat project had been forecast to generate tens of thousands of jobs."

      "text": "Campaigners have called the decision by an Oxford University college not to remove a statue of Cecil Rhodes an \"act of institutional racism\".\nOriel College said its Rhodes statue would not be taken down due to costs and \"complex\" planning processes after initially backing its removal. \nRhodes Must Fall said the college's decision was a \"slap in the face\".\nThe group said it would \"continue to fight for the fall of this statue and everything it represents\".\nCampaigners say Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa, represented white supremacy and was steeped in colonialism and racism.\nHe had been a student at Oriel and left \u00a3100,000 - about \u00a312.5m in today's money - to the college through his will in 1902. His statue sits above a doorway on the front of the college's Rhodes Building, which faces Oxford's High Street. \nEarlier on Thursday, a commission set up by Oriel College to examine the figure's future and Rhodes' legacy said the \"majority\" of its members supported its removal.\nBut Oriel said it would not seek to move the statue due to the process potentially taking years with no certainty of the outcome.\nThe college said it was focused on implementing the commission's recommendations around \"the contextualisation of the college's relationship with Rhodes\" and improving diversity and educational equality among students.\nCampaign group Rhodes Must Fall said: \"No matter how Oriel College might try to justify their decision, allowing the statue to remain is an act of institutional racism.\n\"Pretending that this is a choice made due to financial costs is a slap in the face with the hand of white supremacy.\"\nThe group said it would \"continue to push for the removal of this harmful iconography as a critical step in the decolonisation process of the institution and the city\" and would \"seek to diversify our tactics moving forward\".\n\"We urge Oriel College to reconsider their position immediately and to take steps towards reparations,\" the group said.\nLord Mendoza, provost of Oriel College, said the college understood \"this nuanced conclusion will be disappointing to some, but we are now focused on the delivery of practical actions aimed at improving outreach and the day-to-day experience of BME students\".\nThe college said the majority of submissions to the commission backed the retention of the statue.\nAny decision to move the statue would require planning permission from Oxford City Council, Historic England and the secretary of state for local government, Robert Jenrick.\nThe Rhodes Must Fall campaign began in South Africa, where a Rhodes statue was removed, and was adopted in Oxford by campaigners who argued his views were incompatible with an \"inclusive culture\" at the university.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Northern Ireland Assembly,Common Travel Area (CTA),Northern Ireland Executive,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Stormont ministers have approved relaxing lockdown rules in Northern Ireland, meaning hospitality can operate indoors from Monday 24 May. \nThe Northern Ireland Executive met on Thursday to formally sign off the changes.\nThese include allowing six people from two households to meet indoors in homes from Monday.\nA traffic light system for foreign travel will also take effect from then, subject to ministerial approval.\nTwelve countries are on Northern Ireland's so-called \"green list\" for foreign travel.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill confirmed on Thursday that Portugal is among those countries. \nPeople going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return.\nBut those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid in the days after they arrive home. \nEngland, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday earlier this week. \nIt is understood that Stormont health officials had recommended Portugal should be on Northern Ireland's amber list, which would still require people to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival in Northern Ireland.\nAt present, the executive's advice is that people should only travel to or outside of Northern Ireland for essential purposes. \nIf returning from a country on the UK's red list, passengers must book and enter hotel quarantine.\nInternational travellers visiting or returning to Northern Ireland must also currently provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test result, provide journey and contact details and also isolate for 10 days.\nIt is all systems go for Monday, when we'll take some of our biggest steps yet back to normality.\nStormont ministers are allowing pubs and restaurants to trade indoors again - a move that couldn't come soon enough given the recent bad weather.\nWhile there's a further unlocking of the local economy, just as important are the relaxations to help reunite families and friends who have faced many months with severely limited social contact.\nPeople also keen on a holiday can now start planning for this, albeit the so-called green list is limited and anyone hoping to head abroad will face higher costs and extra paperwork.\nThings have been rolling steadily for some time. Now it appears the executive is preparing to take off its stabilisers and speed up our journey out of lockdown.\nOutgoing First Minister Arlene Foster, who attended the executive meeting virtually from London as she had been meeting Boris Johnson, said it was great news for the economy. \n\"Now is a time to look ahead and to enjoy these hard won freedoms safely,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"We must continue to do all we can as a community to keep ourselves and each other safe and I appeal to everyone to be cautious to help ensure we can keep heading in the right direction.\"  \nMs O'Neill said the moves were another positive step but she urged caution. \n\"I'd remind people to still be careful, be cautious, because we do have the new variants that are there, but we need to keep going steady as we go and follow the public health advice,\" Ms O'Neill said. \nThe deputy first minister accepted that some people would be disappointed that certain countries had not made it on to the green list. \n\"This is about trying to keep the virus under control,\" Ms O'Neill said. \n\"We've got to such a good point, the community transmission is low, but there's a real danger and a real threat being posed by new variants, in particular the Indian variant,\" Ms O'Neill added. \n\"So we're watching that very carefully. We're in a good place right now, there isn't widespread community transmission, but the health advice is very clear in saying it's a matter of when, not if. So we have to bear that in mind in terms of the limitations of travel.\"\nNon-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is to be allowed from Monday and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area.\nThe CTA is the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man.\nAt Thursday's executive meeting, ministers backed the reopening of hotels and B&Bs from Monday and the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. \nIndoor household visits will also be allowed from that date, with six people from two households allowed at one time. Children under 12 do not count towards the total.\nOvernight stays will also be allowed.\nPubs and restaurants will be allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household.\nHospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the announcement will \"bring back hope to businesses\".\n\"As we now look towards Monday's reopening, the health and wellbeing of customers, staff and the wider public will be the priority for all the hospitality sector business owners,\" he said. \nLondonderry Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin said businesses \"can now begin to look towards the busy summer period and our economic recovery\".\nBut she added there was some \"ambiguity and grey areas\" within the hospitality industry over \"what is exactly required of them to reopen, especially in the absence of any published regulations or guidelines yet\".\nOther measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume.\nUp to 1,000 fans will also be allowed to attend Friday's Irish Cup final at Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh.\nBut spectators will not be allowed back for Derry City's game against St Patrick's Athletic on Monday night.\nThe decision was taken after discussions with public health officials, \"based on the current high rates of Covid-19 transmission in the city\", according to a statement on the club's website.\nPeople in England, Scotland and Wales have been allowed to meet in each other's homes and enjoy indoor hospitality since Monday."

      "text": "The Archbishop of Canterbury has issued a \"full personal apology\" to the survivors of abuse by former barrister John Smyth QC in the 1970s and 80s.\nSmyth, who died aged 77 in 2018, violently beat boys who attended Christian summer camps.\nJustin Welby said: \"I am sorry this was done in the name of Jesus Christ by a perverted version of spirituality and evangelicalism.\"\nSurvivors who recently met Mr Welby welcomed him \"taking responsibility\".\nIn a statement issued by Lambeth Palace, the archbishop said: \"I continue to hear new details of the abuse and my sorrow, shock and horror grows.\n\"The Church has a duty to look after those who have been harmed. We have not always done that well.\"\nHe said the Church's safeguarding team will investigate every clergyperson which they suspect \"knew and failed to disclose the abuse\".\nMr Welby worked in the evangelical Christian camps for public schoolboys run by Smyth, but denies any knowledge of the abuse at the time.\nSmyth beat teenage boys who had attended the camps, according to a secret report from 1982.\nThe report, by the charity Iwerne Trust which ran the camps, described Smyth's abuse against 22 young men. \"The scale and severity of the practice was horrific,\" it said.\nIt reported that after identifying the boys, mostly from public school Winchester College, Smyth took them to his home in Hampshire and carried out lashings with a garden cane in his shed.\nEight of the boys received a total of 14,000 lashes, according to the report, written by two clergymen. Two more boys received 8,000 strokes between them over three years.\nBoth the Iwerne Trust and Winchester College knew about the abuse in the 1980s but failed to report it to the police.\nSmyth subsequently moved to Zimbabwe where he continued to run holiday camps for boys. He refused to comment on the allegations before he died.\nAfter meeting survivors of Smyth's abuse last month, Mr Welby said the victims were \"rightly concerned that no-one appears to have faced any sanction yet, when it is clear a number of Christians, clergy and lay, were made aware of the abuse in the 1980s\".\nHe said they were angry Smyth was not stopped in 2013, when both the Church and Mr Welby were told about the abuse.\n\"By this time Mr Smyth had been out of the UK for nearly 30 years,\" Mr Welby said. \"We, the Church, were unclear as to his activities abroad or indeed to the utterly horrendous scope and extent of his actions here and overseas.\"\n\"I recognise the anger of the survivors and victims but having checked that the Diocese of Cape Town was informed and that the police were properly informed and involved our jurisdiction did not extend further.\"\nMr Welby also apologised to survivors that it had taken him so long to meet them personally.\nIn response, a group of survivors welcomed his statement and called for those who knew about the abuse at the time to come forward.\n\"We are pleased that the Archbishop of Canterbury is taking responsibility and acting as a good example for the other culpable parties involved in our story,\" they said in a statement.\n\"It is clear a large number of individuals, clergy and lay, have known about these abuses for over 30 years.\"\nIn 2017, Mr Welby issued what he described as a \"general apology\" on behalf of the Church of England, \"before we understood the full horror and scope of the abuse\".\nThe Church of England has commissioned an independent review of its handling of allegations against Smyth, led by former director of social services Keith Makin.\nMr Welby said the review, which is expected to conclude in summer, would be published in full.\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by issues raised in this story, sources of support are available at the BBC Action Line.

      "text": "A \u00a3100m recovery plan to help the NHS recover from the pandemic has been announced by the Welsh government.\nThe plan details the impact of Covid-19 on the NHS and aims to rebuild services and reduce waiting times.\nRecord numbers of patients are waiting for hospital treatment after many faced cancellations and delays as \"exhausted\" healthcare staff tackled the pandemic.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said it would still be \"a long journey\" to recovery.\nNHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said there was an \"opportunity to change for the better\".\nBut he warned staff were exhausted, and tackling waiting lists could take five years.\nWriting in the recovery plan, Dr Goodall said the response to the pandemic had \"been nothing short of incredible\". \n\"The NHS, and all of its social care partners including the independent and third sectors, have demonstrated their ability to do things at scale and pace,\" he said.\nDr Goodall said the pandemic showed how technology and greater collaboration presented opportunities to improve the way the health and care system worked in future.\nThe document details the health inequalities which have been highlighted by the pandemic, including the impact on BAME communities and children who live in areas of social deprivation.\nIt said the recovery of services must include a focus on children's mental health, as well as practical actions to address racial inequality.\nIt also includes the publication of new quality statements, which set out in more detail the outcomes that should be expected for cancer and heart conditions.\nDemand on cancer services reduced during the pandemic, with fewer people going to see their GP with concerns about symptoms.\nIn the 10 months to December 2020, about 30,000 fewer people than expected in Wales were identified with suspected cancers - about 18% lower than the same period in 2019.\nDoctors fear people were reluctant to come forward with symptoms because of the pandemic.\nThe document said more would be done to encourage people to come forward, and it will develop the quality statement for cancer to address longer-term challenges.\nThe Wales Cancer Alliance said: \"Wales could soon be the only UK nation without a cancer strategy, with the Welsh government opting to publish a brief quality statement... instead of replacing its detailed cancer plan.\n\"This is despite stark and repeated warnings from the 20 charities in the Wales Cancer Alliance coalition that the statement does not go far enough. \n\"While the alliance welcomes the NHS Covid recovery plan, also published today by the Welsh government, this plan covers the immediate recovery from the pandemic and does not have the long-term vision in cancer services Wales needs.\"\nThe recovery plan said there was a \"fundamental need\" to change the way planned services were delivered and in order to tackle the backlog of treatments it said interim measures would require working with \"partner organisations who can provide capacity quickly.\"\nOther priorities noted in the recovery plan include identifying the \"hidden harms\" caused by Covid in the social care sector, increasing the collaborative working that has developed during the pandemic and recognising carers through pay, including a move towards paying the real living wage.\nIt also highlights the need to expand diagnostic services such as endoscopy.\nDr Olwen Williams, vice-president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, said supporting the mental health and well-being of NHS staff was important. \n\"If there's one lesson we should learn from the past year, it's that we must value our staff,\" she said. \n\"They have poured heart and soul into patient care during Covid-19, and they deserve compassionate leadership. \n\"This recovery plan must be backed up by action from health boards. Investment in more staff, flexible working, protected time for research and education - these things are vital.\"\nMr Gething said: \"The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our health and social care system, patients and staff.\n\"As we emerge from the most serious stage of the pandemic, we are now in a position to set out how we can start to recover.\n\"This plan sets out the broad principles of recovery and more detailed actions will follow. I am making available an initial \u00a3100m now to support the first steps, but it is clear more resources will be needed to make a full recovery.\n\"It will be a long journey, but it is also an opportunity to transform how we deliver health and care services in the future and to tackle the health inequalities in our society that the pandemic has made even more evident.\n\"That is why, alongside our recovery plan, I am also pleased to announce our national clinical framework, which sets out how we see NHS clinical services developing over the next decade.\"\nWelsh Conservative health spokeswoman Angela Burns said Labour's past \"broad approaches\" had failed to \"deliver the improvements we need to see for our people and public services in Wales\".\n\"Before the pandemic struck, waiting lists were already incredibly high, having doubled in the year before the pandemic hit.\n\"Now, one in five people in Wales sit on a waiting list, which is another public health crisis.\n\"Regrettably, there is still a gaping hole in dealing with the cancer backlog and Welsh Conservatives would implement a cancer recovery plan as a matter of urgency.\" \nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said any plans that focused solely on \"recovery from the pandemic\" overlooked two decades of \"managed decline\". \nHe said healthcare in Wales needed to be \"completely transformed\", adding Plaid would recruit 1,000 doctors and 5,000 nurses and that care workers, would be \"given the same terms and conditions and pay scales as health workers\". \n\"Our cancer plan will speed up diagnosis and treatment, young people will be supported with their mental health and wellbeing through a network of youth welfare hubs,\" he added.\n\"Our NHS has to be rebuilt in a way that makes it more robust than ever.\""

      "text": "The majority of new coronavirus cases in the UK are the so-called Indian variant - named the Delta variant by the World Health Organization.\nThis version - or mutation - was first spotted in India last October.\nViruses mutate all the time. Most variants are insignificant, but some can make a virus more contagious. \nUK scientists say the Delta variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is spreading more quickly than the Kent or Alpha variant, which was behind a surge in cases over the winter.\nThere have been almost 18,000 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant in England, just under 3,000 in Scotland, 189 in Wales and 37 in Northern Ireland. \nThe latest Public Health England figures up to 2 June showed the worst-hit areas were:\nHowever, just because it's the most common strain doesn't always mean there's lots of it about. \nIn West Lancashire and East Hertfordshire, for example, in the two weeks to 29 May the variant accounted for 100% of the cases analysed for variants. But this amounted to only nine individual infections each.\nNot all cases are analysed and a higher proportion are in areas with lots of the Delta variant, potentially skewing the figures. \nBut random swabbing carried out by the Office for National Statistics, which is not skewed in this way, also found a growing proportion of cases looked like they were the Delta variant. \nIt does appear to spread more easily than the Kent variant (B.1.1.7). \nTransmission rates for the Indian strain have been put at anywhere between 30 and 100% higher than for the Kent or Alpha variant. \nRoughly 12% of contacts of people with the Indian variant went on to develop coronavirus, compared with 8% of those who had the so-called Kent variant, according to Public Health England analysis - suggesting it is roughly 50% more transmissible. \nBut some of that could be the behaviour of humans, rather than the virus itself. \nWhen a variant spreads faster than others, it could be driven by the strain being more infectious, by differences in how close people get, or by different vaccination rates. \nFor instance, it's been pointed out some of the worst-affected areas have very low proportions of residents working from home.\nDespite fears over the Indian variant, most of the UK went ahead with easing restrictions on 17 May.\nHowever, the government has issued new guidance for people in eight areas of England with high numbers of cases\nPeople have been advised to minimise travelling in and out of Kirklees, Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside.\nIn addition, residents have been advised - wherever possible - to meet people outside, maintain social distancing of 2m (6ft) from people not in their household and work from home if they can. \nIt is not clear whether the next stage of easing in England will happen on 21 June, as was set out in the government's roadmap. \nThe prime minister and health secretary have indicated they will wait for another week's data before making a decision.\nMany countries already have bans on people from the UK and elsewhere entering. \nFrance has brought a ban on non-essential travel from the UK back into force in direct response to the spread of the India variant.

      "tags": "Royal College reports,Freedom of Information,NHS",
      "text": "Beth and Dan Wankiewicz want answers about why their baby son Clay died last year, shortly after his birth at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. \nDespite a low-risk pregnancy, the family say Clay died from multiple skull fractures.\nDoncaster and Bassetlaw NHS Foundation Trust said \"the provision and delivery of high-quality\" care is a priority. \nThe BBC has found a 2016 review flagging concerns about the hospital's maternity care was never published.\nThe report - one of scores of unpublished reports discovered by a Freedom of Information request by BBC's Panorama programme - highlighted significant patient safety concerns.\nBeth Wankiewicz was admitted to hospital last July, but after a day of labour her baby had still not been born.\nWith no consultant doctor on site, a junior doctor made two attempts to deliver the baby with forceps, after getting advice on the phone.  \nDan remembers the second attempt with forceps being much more vigorous \"which was a bit of a shock\".  \nThe family say there was a further delay before they had a Caesarean section. Their baby had to be pushed back up the birth canal into the womb for the C-section to be performed. \n\"I think after about 10 minutes, we both looked at the clock, and we said it's not looking good,\" said Dan. \nAround 20 minutes after their son was born, despite attempts to resuscitate him, they were told he had died. \nThe following day they say a midwife told them she was being pressurised by other staff to say Clay had been stillborn, but she was sure he had been born alive, and she had heard a heartbeat.\nThe family now believe this was to avoid scrutiny and the need for a coroner's inquest, which doesn't happen with still births. \nBeth and Dan say Clay's post-mortem shows he died of multiple skull fractures. \nDavid Purdue, chief nurse and deputy chief executive of Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, offered sympathy to the family, and said the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch had drawn up a report into the case with findings that had been shared with the trust, the family and the coroner. He said an inquest would be held soon.\nA BBC investigation has now found that in 2016 a review of services by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists identified serious patient safety concerns within maternity services at the trust, but it had not been published. \nThe trust had asked for the review following a \"number of serious clinical incidents\". \nSome of the concerns were that: \nFollowing a 2015 maternity scandal at Morecambe Bay, in which 11 babies and one mother died, a report by Dr Bill Kirkup recommended that trusts openly report the findings of any external investigation. \nThe BBC showed the 2016 report to the family, who hadn't seen it before.  \n\"My heart just dropped... reading point after point of things that resonate with us in Clay's care that had been picked up in 2016 ' said Beth.\n\"It was just heartbreaking to know that they knew back then\"\nNatalie Cosgrove, the couple's solicitor, said she had represented several families since the review, where the issues identified have been a factor. \nShe said: \"My concern is why those concerns have not been acted upon by the trust.\"\nPeter Walsh, head of the charity Action against Medical Accidents, said: \"I found it very worrying. Frankly, it's very reminiscent of reports I've seen into other trusts where the problems have become huge scandals: Morecambe Bay, Shrewsbury and Telford.\" \nDavid Purdue, deputy chief executive of the trust said : \"The provision and delivery of high quality maternity services is our number one priority. Following the invited report from the Royal College in 2016, we shared the executive summary, recommendations and action plans with our regulators, partners and staff and have completed all of the actions.\"   \nIn a statement, the health regulator in England, the Care Quality Commission said: \"We liaised with the trust regarding the steps they were taking to respond to the review and address the recommendations of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists, and where we had concerns that the recommended actions were not being progressed fast enough, we called for improvements.\"\nMaternity services at both hospitals run by the trust are currently rated as Requires Improvement by the hospital regulator. \nA spokesperson for the trust said the summary, recommendations and actions had been available \"upon request\" and shared with commissioners and regulators.  \nAn NHS England spokesperson said: \"Throughout the pandemic the NHS has safely delivered thousands of babies while keeping staff and patients safe, and the NHS announcement of an additional \u00a395 million to boost maternity services will improve women's experience further. \n\"All independent reviews should be made available to relevant health commissioners and regulators...and [we] expect trusts to take prompt action to address appropriate recommendations.\""

      "tags": "Princess Diana, Princess of Wales,BBC,Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex,The Royal Family and the media,Prince William, Duke of Cambridge",
      "text": "The Duke of Cambridge has blamed BBC failings over its interview with his mother for fuelling her paranoia and worsening his parents' relationship. \nAfter an inquiry found the BBC fell below its standards, Prince William said he was \"most saddened\" Diana never learned she had been deceived.\nHe said his mother was failed \"not just by a rogue reporter\" but by BBC bosses.\nThe Met Police said it will assess the new report, after previously deciding against a criminal investigation.\nThe Duke of Sussex blamed a toxic media culture for his mother's death.\nIn his separate statement, Prince Harry said that the \"ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices\" ultimately took his mother's life.\nHe expressed concern such practices \"are still widespread today\", adding that it was \"bigger than one outlet, one network or one publication\".\n\"Our mother lost her life because of this, and nothing has changed. By protecting her legacy, we protect everyone, and uphold the dignity with which she lived her life,\" he said.\nThe BBC has written to apologise to Princes William and Harry, as well as the Prince of Wales and Diana's brother Earl Spencer.\nMatt Wiessler, the graphic designer who first raised concerns about the fake documents used to secure the interview and who was later denied work by the BBC, told Radio 4's Today programme that an apology sent to him at 22:00 BST on Thursday was \"too little, too late\".\nHe criticised Lord Hall, who led an internal investigation at the time, and then BBC director-general Lord Birt for not apologising to him in person. \nIt's hard to overstate the strength of feeling expressed by William. \nNot just about Martin Bashir, but with the whole BBC, whom he thinks entirely failed to investigate the matter and covered up elements that were not to its liking. \nNote, there was no talk of drawing a line under this, there was no talk of this being a long time ago. \nInstead, he effectively accuses the BBC of driving his parents towards divorce and playing some part in the events that led towards his mother's death. \nHarry too, issued a statement, not as angry, not so pointed, instead referring, as he has before, to a \"culture of exploitation and unethical practices\". \nIn the past, of course, it's been Harry that's been so angry with the media, William appeared to have made his peace with it, but the second in line to the throne has launched a visceral attack on the BBC, a sign of his deep hurt and deep dismay. \nThe independent inquiry - by retired judge Lord Dyson - found that interviewer Martin Bashir acted in a \"deceitful\" way and faked documents to obtain his interview. \nThe BBC's 1996 probe led by then-head of News and Current Affairs Lord Hall into initial complaints about what happened was \"woefully ineffective\", it added.\nPrince William said the interview made a \"major contribution to making my parents' relationship worse\", adding it has \"since hurt countless others\".\n\"But what saddens me most, is that if the BBC had properly investigated the complaints and concerns first raised in 1995, my mother would have known that she had been deceived,\" he said. \n\"She was failed not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions.\"\nLord Dyson found that Bashir deceived Earl Spencer into introducing the journalist to his sister by showing him forged bank statements that falsely suggested individuals were being paid for keeping the princess under surveillance.\nPrince William said that, in his view, the deceitful way the interview was obtained \"substantially influenced what my mother said\" in response to Bashir.\nHe said the original Panorama interview programme had \"no legitimacy\" and should never be aired again.\n\"It effectively established a false narrative which, for over a quarter of a century, has been commercialised by the BBC and others,\" he said.\nBashir said mocking up the documents \"was a stupid thing to do\" and he regretted it, but said they had no bearing on Diana's decision to be interviewed.\nA note written by Diana, published in the report for the first time, said she had no regrets about the broadcast and Bashir did not show her the faked documents. It was taken by the BBC as evidence for Bashir's claims.\nBut Lord Dyson said the BBC should have considered the possibility that the documents were shown to her brother, Earl Spencer, and used indirectly to gain access to the princess.\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said the inquiry's \"devastating\" findings into the \"unfounded and wrong\" actions of senior figures at the BBC meant the government would have to consider whether the corporation's governance should be reformed.\nThe independent inquiry was commissioned by the BBC last year, after Earl Spencer went public with allegations about how the interview was obtained. \nIts findings were published on Thursday.\nLord Dyson found: \nThe earl told a new documentary by BBC Panorama: \"Well, the irony is that I met Martin Bashir on the 31st of August 1995 - because exactly two years later she died, and I do draw a line between the two events.\"\nHe said it was \"quite clear\" from when he introduced Bashir to Diana in September 1995 that \"everyone was going to be made untrustworthy, and I think that Diana did lose trust in really key people\".\nPatrick Jephson - Diana's former private secretary  - said the interview \"destroyed remaining links with Buckingham Palace\" and left her vulnerable to \"people who didn't have her best interests at heart\".\nMr Wiessler said this inquiry should have been held in 1996 when he first raised the alarm and said there was still a culture that \"the little people\" and whistleblowers did not need to be addressed.\nHe said it was not a \"fitting response for the 25 years I've been waiting for people to stop calling me a forger and a leaker\".\nCalling for senior BBC figures at time to apologise to him in person, he said: \"Nobody has come forward. It's just weak, calculating, and quite honestly after 25 years it's nasty what they are doing - to this day.\"\nFormer BBC producer Mark Killick said he was told he was being removed from Panorama after raising concerns about the faked documents because \"we only want loyal people on the programme\".\nHe told BBC Breakfast the report was a \"good start\" but said the BBC had created a \"culture of fear\" that may have contributed to subsequent scandals. The current leadership must make it clear that staff can \"speak truth to power without fear of losing their jobs\", he said.\nBashir's interview with Princess Diana for a special edition of Panorama was a huge scoop for the BBC. In it, she famously said: \"There were three of us in this marriage,\" - referring to her husband's affair with Camilla Parker Bowles.\nIt was the first time a serving royal had spoken so openly about life in the Royal Family - viewers saw her speak about her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles, their affairs, and her bulimia.\nBashir, 58, is one of the UK's best known journalists, and also made headlines for his 2003 interview with pop star Michael Jackson.\nLast week he left the BBC, citing ongoing health issues. He had been the corporation's religion correspondent and editor since 2016.\nIn a statement, Lord Hall said he was wrong to give Bashir the \"benefit of the doubt\" at the time in the internal investigation which cleared Bashir, Panorama and BBC News of wrongdoing. \nHe added that throughout his 35-year career at the BBC he \"always acted in ways I believe were fair, impartial and with the public interest front and centre\". \nThe BBC's current director general, Tim Davie, said: \"Although the report states that Diana, Princess of Wales, was keen on the idea of an interview with the BBC, it is clear that the process for securing the interview fell far short of what audiences have a right to expect. \n\"We are very sorry for this. Lord Dyson has identified clear failings.\"\nHe added that the BBC should have \"made greater effort to get to the bottom of what happened at the time and been more transparent about what it knew\".\nIt is understood that in a letter sent by Mr Davie to Prince Charles, the director-general apologised for Bashir's \"lurid and untrue claims\" about the prince, members of his staff and other members of the Royal Family.\nThe letter said the BBC accepts that Bashir made the claims \"intending to play on the princess's fears, in order to arouse her interest in him, and without concern for the impact on those he maligned\".\nA Panorama investigation into the interview - delayed from last week - was shown on Thursday evening on BBC One, within hours of Lord Dyson's findings being published."

I think what we can see is that this strain can circulate very effectively.\"\n\"I don't really see why it wouldn't continue to spread in other parts of the country,\" he said. \n\"Obviously we're doing everything we can to contain the spread of that, but it's likely that more generalised measures may start to be needed to control it.\"\nHe added that the size of a third wave would depend on how transmissible the variant proves to be and how many people have been vaccinated.\nNearly 37 million people in the UK - around 70% of the adult population - have received their first dose, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.\nMore than 20.8 million - around 40% - have had a second dose. \nThe Duke of Cambridge, 38, said in a tweet that he received his first dose on Tuesday, and thanked those working on the vaccine rollout.\nPeople aged 34 and over in England are now able to book their Covid-19 jab, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Over-30s are eligible in Scotland.\nNorthern Ireland has started offering the vaccination to anyone aged over 25. \nAnd in Wales, all over-18s in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan will have been offered the chance to have their first Covid vaccine by the end of May."

It had the highest number of missing cases.\nProf Andrew Hayward, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Breakfast that people should \"minimise travel abroad\" and the Indian variant passes on more easily from person to person than the one first discovered in Kent.\nAsked whether the UK was at the start of a third wave, he said: \"I think so. I think what we can see is that this strain can circulate very effectively.\"\n\"I don't really see why it wouldn't continue to spread in other parts of the country,\" he said. \n\"Obviously we're doing everything we can to contain the spread of that, but it's likely that more generalised measures may start to be needed to control it.\"\nHe added that the size of a third wave would depend on how transmissible the variant proves to be and how many people have been vaccinated.\nNearly 37 million people in the UK - around 70% of the adult population - have received their first dose, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.\nMore than 20.8 million - around 40% - have had a second dose. \nThe Duke of Cambridge, 38, said in a tweet that he received his first dose on Tuesday, and thanked those working on the vaccine rollout.\nPeople aged 34 and over in England are now able to book their Covid-19 jab, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Over-30s are eligible in Scotland.\nNorthern Ireland has started offering the vaccination to anyone aged over 25. \nAnd in Wales, all over-18s in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan will have been offered the chance to have their first Covid vaccine by the end of May."

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Blackburn,York",
      "text": "Failures in England's Test and Trace system are partly responsible for a surge in the Indian variant in one of the worst affected parts of the country, a report seen by the BBC says. \nFor three weeks in April and May, eight local authorities in England did not have access to the full data on positive tests in their area.  \nThe number of missing cases was highest in Blackburn with Darwen, Lancashire.\nA recent surge in infections there has been linked to the Indian variant.\nThe government said a Track and Trace \"software issue\" had affected a \"handful\" of places, but this had been resolved \"as quickly as possible\".\nThe other areas experiencing incomplete data were Blackpool, York, Bath and North East Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock.\nLabour called on ministers to \"explain what's gone wrong\".\nNHS Test and Trace - for which \u00a337bn has been set aside - identifies people who have been in close contact with someone who has caught Covid. \nBetween 21 April and 11 May, the system only provided details of a limited number of positive cases of coronavirus to the eight local authorities.\nOn 11 May, they were told by the Department of Health and Social Care that, over that period, 734 positive tests had not been reported.  \nAccording to a report by officials at one of the councils affected, the central Test and Trace system failed to notify its staff of cases, meaning their contacts could not be traced locally. \nIt says that \"the rapid spread of Indian variant cases... may be partially or largely attributable to risks in the international travel control system\", adding: \"These were exacerbated by the sporadic failure of the national Test and Trace system.\"  \nSix of the local authorities affected have confirmed to the BBC that they experienced problems. \nAlthough it is thought that the people tested were given their results, local authority staff were not provided with contact-tracing information through the central system. \nSome 3,424 cases of the Indian variant - which is believed to spread more quickly than the Kent variant that caused the winter spike in infections - have now been identified in the UK.\nThe government added India to the \"red list\" of countries, from which travellers must quarantine in a hotel on return, on 23 April - two days after the problems with Test and Trace started.  \nWhile national contact-tracing teams should take on variant cases, identifying the particular variant can take up to two weeks. \nIn the meantime, local authority staff are often the first to make contacts with positive cases.  \nWhere cases went unreported, they were also in many cases unable to offer support to isolating individuals.   \nThe Department of Health told Blackburn with Darwen Council that there were 164 cases it had been unaware of. The people affected were subsequently traced. \nAnother 130 cases were not reported, but, because they had passed the 10-day isolation period, could not be followed up.  \nEven when cases were uploaded to the system on 12 May, some key information, such as phone numbers or addresses, was incomplete.  \nFor Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said it \"beggars belief\" that councils had been \"left in the dark for two weeks when we know acting with speed is vital to containing an outbreak\".\nHe added: \"Ministers need to explain what's gone wrong and provide local health directors with all the resources they need to push infections down.\"\nLiberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus, said \"grave errors\" over Test and Trace failures had \"contributed to the surge in cases of the Indian variant\".\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"NHS Test and Trace has contacted over 10 million people since the start of the pandemic, and this has had a significant impact, breaking chains of transmission and reducing the spread of the virus. \n\"Over the past month, we have contacted over 150,000 people to tell them to self-isolate.\"\nThe spokesperson added: \"Due to a software issue, there was a delay in tracing contacts of a number of cases. This only affected a handful of local authorities and the issue was resolved as quickly as possible.\"\nData released by Public Health England shows there have now been 3,424 cases of the Indian variant detected - that is up by just over 2,000 on this time last week.\nCases are predominantly affecting the north west of England, particularly Bolton, and London, PHE said.\nThese numbers are going to continue growing - it is expected the variant will become dominant in the UK as scientists believe it is more infectious than the UK variant.\nIt's unclear by how much - currently experts are saying it could be anything between 10% to 50% more transmissible.\nBut what this means for infection levels and, crucially, serious illness remains to be seen.\nOverall infection levels remain low. Even if infection levels do rise, there is no guarantee that will translate into significant numbers of hospital cases because of the rollout of the vaccines.\nWhat will be crucial is just how more transmissible it is. Below 25% and the impact on hospital cases is expected to be minimal. Once you get to 40% it could become problematic.\nIt will be another week until scientists are able to give a confident estimate of what the true figure is."

      "tags": "Literature,British Constitution,Books,Hilary Mantel",
      "text": "Award-winning Wolf Hall author Dame Hilary Mantel says the UK needs a written constitution \"to stop rogue prime ministers illegally interfering with the workings of Parliament\".\nHer comments come after Boris Johnson advised the Queen to suspend Parliament at the height of 2019's Brexit crisis.\n\"It's quite evident that when Boris Johnson attempted to do that, it was for the courts to stop him,\" she says.\nThe Supreme Court later ruled the move to suspend Parliament was unlawful.\nMr Johnson said he \"profoundly disagreed\" with the ruling from the UK's highest court.\nDame Hilary tells the BBC: \"If people will not play by the established rules and by the canons of decency, then we are going to have to have rules in place that restrain them.\n\"It's a sad position to come to, because I think the flexibility of our unwritten constitution was a historical wonder,\" she adds.\n\"But I think there will have to be a reckoning in the next few years.\"\nDame Hilary is making these comments as she announces the world premiere of the stage adaptation of The Mirror and the Light, the third book in her Thomas Cromwell series focusing on political intrigue during the reign of King Henry VIII, which will open in London's West End in September. \nA constitution is a legal document which sets out the terms and conditions under which a country or state is governed. The UK is unusual, as unlike the majority of countries, its constitution is not written or codified in a single document. \nInstead, under the UK's unwritten system, a vast array of different laws, customs and conventions, that have evolved over centuries, make up the constitution.\nSupporters argue it offers greater flexibility: it can evolve and adapt to reflect changes in society. Some say that many of the world's most repressive regimes have written constitutions.\nDetractors say unwritten constitutions are open to ambiguity and can be subject to numerous interpretations. One example is the opposing interpretations taken by the government and the Supreme Court over whether Parliament could be suspended during the Brexit crisis in 2019. \nThe prime minister said he wanted to outline his government's policies in a Queen's Speech on 14 October 2019, and to do that, Parliament would have to be prorogued and a new session started.\nCritics said he was trying to stop MPs scrutinising his Brexit plans. During prorogation, MPs cannot debate government policy or ask written or oral questions of ministers. \nThe UK's final Court of Appeal said it was wrong to stop MPs carrying out their duties in the run-up to the Brexit deadline on 31 October. The prime minister said although he \"profoundly disagreed\" with the ruling he would \"respect\" it.\nDame Hilary, 68, is a shrewd observer of political drama that spans the ages. \"I think what my books have tried to show is that there is no life without politics,\" she says.\nShe has been immersed in Tudor politics for more than 15 years, working on her Wolf Hall trilogy of historical novels about the plots and intrigues at the court of King Henry VIII and the rise and fall of his chief adviser Thomas Cromwell.\nDame Hilary has spent the past year writing the play of The Mirror and the Light herself. She says she wanted to \"give it a go\".\nBut, perhaps surprisingly for a writer of 14 works of fiction and a memoir, she was not sure she could do it on her own. \n\"Although I'd written plays for radio... I've not written a whole stage play by myself. I felt my inexperience,\" she admits. \"I thought, 'I need a collaborator.'\"\nBen Miles, who starred as Cromwell in the Royal Shakespeare Company productions of Wolf Hall and its sequel Bring up the Bodies, suggested himself as \"co-pilot\" on the project. \nThe pair had become close friends and Miles, who played Peter Townsend in The Crown and John Profumo in The Trial of Christine Keeler on television, has also recorded the audio books for all three novels.\nWith Dame Hilary at home in Devon and Miles in London, the pair worked almost entirely via email over the past \"difficult year\" due to Covid-19 restrictions. \nThat was not the only challenge. They needed to turn a 912-page epic, with a colossal cast of characters, into a two-and-a-half hour play.\n\"The hardest task for us was what we were going to include from the novel and what we weren't,\" says Miles, who will return to his role as Cromwell when The Mirror and the Light opens at the Gielgud Theatre.\nThey hope they have managed to turn the \"vast\" book into \"a really entertaining evening\", Dame Hilary says.\n\"Audience members need not fear that they are going to have to bring along a picnic,\" she jokes. \"It's not a marathon. It's not intimidating. It's nothing to be afraid of.\"\nThe television adaptation of The Mirror and the Light is on its way too. \"It is going ahead. It's being written now, but delayed by Covid like everything else,\" she says.\nIt is therefore unlikely to be on our screens before 2023. \"It's just a question of patience.\" The previous BBC TV adaptation of the first two books - which was entitled Wolf Hall but brought together Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies - won two Bafta TV awards, and a Golden Globe. \nShe says she \"would certainly hope\" that Sir Mark Rylance, who played Cromwell in the BBC series and Damian Lewis, who appeared as Henry VIII, will be able to return to their roles, although \"these are busy people with big schedules and it will all be a question of timing\".\nWhile all three books will eventually make it on to the stage and screen, there was to be no historic triple Booker Prize win for Dame Hilary. \nShe triumphed in 2009 for Wolf Hall and again in 2012 with Bring up the Bodies, making her the first woman to win twice. But The Mirror and the Light failed to make the shortlist. \nShe was, she says, disappointed. But not for long.\n\"I experienced that falling sensation for all of five seconds. And then I thought, onwards and upwards, because I breathed out and I thought, now I can get on with different things. I can actually move on. \n\"I was glad to be free.\"\nLooking to the future she says: \"I think I will write another novel. I have something just forming up. I don't really want to even breathe on it at the moment by speaking about it in public, because sometimes, you never know, these things don't work. \n\"But yes, I hope to write another novel, and possibly another play.\"\nThe Mirror and the Light will run at the Gielgud Theatre in London from 23 September to 28 November.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Japanese manga author Kentaro Miura has died aged 54.\nHe was best-known for his popular dark fantasy creation Berserk, which debuted as a series in 1989.\nIn a statement, publisher Hakusensha confirmed he died on 6 May.\n\"All us editors sincerely pray for his repose, expressing our deepest respect and appreciation for his work,\" the Japanese company said, adding the family had already held a private funeral.\nNews of his death has prompted an outpouring of grief from fans all around the world.\nBerserk featured a journey of revenge by a young warrior travelling through a medieval-inspired world of battles and magic.\nThe story was renowned for its visual storytelling, combined with some of the most eye-catching and precise art ever seen in manga.\nFor Koroush Khaneghah, Berserk is \"one of the most beautiful pieces of art\" he's ever seen.\n\"I was mesmerised by every little thing. The impact it's had on me was one of awe and wonder,\" the 26-year-old from London tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nHe feels the art is in a league of its own.\n\"It was so detailed, hollow and empty like the Berserk world. It led to the dark fantasy setting which was something I hadn't encountered before.\"\n\"It combined the mystery and adventure I love from the fantasy world, with a brutal dark edge which made it addictive,\" he adds.\nThe impact of Berserk can be seen in its wider influence.\nAs a result of its popularity, it was adapted into an animated series, a book, animated movies as well as a video game, with multiple other games based on it.\n\"It was a pioneer, influenced countless anime, but the most notable for me was a game called Dark Souls,\" Koroush says.\nThat game is one that Koroush has spent \"over a thousand hours\" of his childhood playing.\n\"At some point in my life I will pivot to more artistic contributions to the world, and without a doubt, Berserk will be a major inspiration.\"\nAnd that's a thought shared by many fans. Many have also been gathering online to pay tribute, holding virtual memorials in video games.\nAmerican publisher Dark Horse Comics tweeted: \"Miura-sensei was a master artist and storyteller and we had the great privilege of publishing several of his finest works, including his masterpiece, Berserk.\"\n\"He will be greatly missed.\"\nKoroush adds: \"If I could tell him anything, it would just be that he's brilliant and thank him for sharing his brilliance with the world.\n\"How I'll continue to thank him is by sharing his incredible work with as many people as possible.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\nMr Johnson said Mr Suleman was the \"organiser of the whole thing\" while Abubakr Satia sourced the Avensis used in the shooting and \"made sure all the key players were in the right place at the right time\".\nBoth Uthman Satia and his girlfriend Judy Chapman acted as getaway drivers for Mr Raja and Mr Ennis, it is claimed, while Kashif Manzoor ensured the Avensis was running properly.\nThe prosecution alleges Ayaz Hussain acted as a link between Mr Suleman and gunman Mr Raja. \nMr Suleman, 40, Mr Manzoor, 26, Mr Hussain, 35, Mr Satia, 32, all from Blackburn, Mr Raja, 33, of Stretford, Mr Ennis, 31, of Partington, Mr Satia, 29, and Ms Chapman, 26, both of Great Harwood, all deny murder.\nAll eight have also pleaded not guilty to the attempted murder of Mr Khan.\nThe trial is estimated to last up to 10 weeks.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Transport,Rail travel,HS2,UK government spending,Infrastructure",
      "text": "The government needs to keep up spending on public transport, even though its usage has plummeted during the Covid pandemic, a government adviser has told the BBC.\nCommuter numbers could drop by a quarter because of home working, said Sir John Armitt, head of the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC).\nBut the government should \"hold their nerve\" in case of a bounce back.\nThis was important for sustainability reasons, he said.\nSir John told the BBC that the NIC's modelling indicated there could be a continuing hit to passenger numbers of 25% from fewer commuters returning to offices after the pandemic. \n\"If you want to avoid congestion in the future, if you want to stick to your zero carbon, then you need to get people back on public transport.\n\"Therefore for the government, it's going to be a case of continuing to ensure that public transport is available, whether it's the trains or whether it's the buses, so that people can make use of it as and when they feel relaxed to do so,\" Sir John told the BBC.\nHe said despite their modelling, the government should \"hold their nerve\" and wait to see actual data on the return to work, and give people the opportunity to make choices over the next two or three years.\nAssuming changes that could materialise in the coming months were permanent, they could damage city centres, which have driven economic activity.\nHe said that the rise of home working and Zoom meetings did not alter the benefits of investing in high-speed rail lines.\nHistoric underinvestment in rail capacity remained the fundamental reason for HS2, Sir John said.\nDuring the pandemic, the government has underpinned practically the entire rail system.\nThe latest figures showed there were fewer than a third of the normal level of rail journeys in the last quarter of last year.\nSir John also said that city centres would change as a result of new ways of working, and that \"shops and offices could be replaced to a degree by housing\" and that \"could be really beneficial\".\nLast week, 43 out of 50 big UK employers questioned by the BBC said they did not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time.\nThey said they would embrace a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week.\nIn a report, the NIC acknowledged that the \"radical and rapid\" rise in working from home during the Covid pandemic could lead to a permanent shift to less commuting.\nThe NIC found that almost a third of UK workers intended to work from home more often after the pandemic than they had before.\nAlmost half of UK employees were doing some work from home in April 2020, while in March 2021, almost a third of employees were working from home exclusively and 12% occasionally, it said.\nWorkers might also seek to relocate to more suburban and rural areas, but cities remained attractive and there might not be enough suburban and rural houses to cope with demand if people wished to relocate, it added.\nHome-working opportunities tended to be limited to certain types of occupations, such as those that needed higher levels of qualifications, the NIC said.\nThis change in working patterns \"greatly reduced workers' footfall in business and commercial districts in city centres\".\nIn the first lockdown in March 2020, public transport use dropped by between 80% and 95%, depending on the type of transport.\nCycling boomed in the first lockdown, but then its uptake levelled off, while car use \"recovered almost fully\" during periods with reduced restrictions.\nHowever, there is no evidence of increased car ownership, \"which could indicate that people are not yet making decisions about long-term preferences\", the NIC added."
