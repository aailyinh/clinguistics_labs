      "title": "Cats must be microchipped under animal care plan",
      "tags": "Animal welfare,Intensive farming",
      "text": "Microchipping pet cats will become compulsory under a wide-ranging new animal welfare plan.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the policy would be monitored by vets and enforced in the same way as it is for dogs, which he said has led to over 90% compliance.\nThe plan will also formally recognise the sentience of many animals.\nBut Mr Eustice said this measure was aimed at pets and livestock, rather than wild animals.\nThe government's Action Plan for Animal Welfare also includes measures to ban exporting live animals for slaughter, the keeping of primates as pets and importing hunting trophies. There may also be changes to the ways that animals can be confined - such as the practice of keeping them in cages.\nHowever, there is no plan to require imports to meet the same welfare standards as in the UK, which the National Farmers' Union (NFU) described as \"hypocrisy\".\nThe plan will also see remote-controlled training collars for dogs outlawed and the government says it will look at banning the sale of foie gras - a food made from the livers of force-fed ducks or geese.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Eustice said that compulsory microchipping for cats would resemble the current rules for dogs, where vets advise pet owners whose animals do not have a microchip to get one, and \"if they ignore it, there is an enforcement process\".\nDog owners can be fined \u00a3500 under the existing law.\nLianna Angliss at Hopefield Animal Sanctuary said that as well as helping to reunite lost cats with their owners, compulsory microchipping could help animal sanctuaries trace people who abandon their pets.\nThe environment secretary also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the recognition of animal sentience would give the UK an equivalent to a declaration that already applies in the European Union.\nIt will enshrine in law that animals have the capacity to feel hunger and pain, and are aware of what is happening to them. It will apply to vertebrates, but not to animals such as octopus and squid.\nMr Eustice said there would be an expert animal sentience committee which would advise on policy.\nBut asked if it would affect hunting, fishing or road-building projects which might disturb habitats, he said the recognition of animal sentience was \"much more applicable\" to pets and livestock than wildlife.\nClaire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society, said recognising animal sentience was a key part of \"probably the biggest new set of commitments on animal welfare for decades\".\nThe plan includes legislation in a number of bills set to be approved in the coming months. These include the Kept Animals Bill, the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill and the Animals Abroad Bill. These will expand on the protections in the Animal Welfare Act 2006. \nLegislation to restrict the use of glue traps, designed to capture rats and mice, will also be supported.\nReacting to the news that owners will have to get their cats microchipped, Jacqui Cuff, head of advocacy and government relations for Cats Protection, said she was \"delighted\". \n\"We had the dog microchipping regulation passed in 2016, so we've been waiting a long time. There are around 2.6 million unchipped pet cats in the UK; that's a lot of cats wandering around with no permanent identification,\" she said.\nCat theft reportedly increased by more than 12% over the last year, and only around 70% of owned cats are chipped at the moment.\nChris Sherwood, chief executive of the RSPCA, said: \"These announcements will make a real and lasting difference to animals' welfare, so we're pleased the government is committed to improving animals' lives in the UK and abroad. We can no longer ignore the inextricable link that exists between the way we treat animals, our own health and that of the planet - but to really achieve a step change, it will take courage from right across government.\n\"We urge the government to put animal welfare at the heart of policy making and make these announcements just the beginning of an evolving, holistic animal health and welfare strategy.\"\nWith regard to farmed animals, live exports for fattening and slaughter will be banned. This is only possible because the UK has left the EU. The caging of poultry and the practice of restricting the movement of pregnant and suckling pigs will also be examined. \nSows can legally be kept in a \"farrowing crate\" for up to five weeks. These crates are of a size that prevents the sow from turning around and potentially crushing her new-born piglets. However, preventing sows from engaging in normal behaviour can cause them to become stressed.\nThere is, however, no legal guarantee that food from animals reared abroad will have been produced to high animal-welfare standards. \nLast year, ministers controversially voted against a House of Lords amendment which would have blocked imports that didn't meet welfare and food safety standards in the UK. It will now depend on post-Brexit trade deals with countries such as the US, where cows are routinely treated with hormones and chickens are washed with chlorine - which is illegal here. \nThe deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, Stuart Roberts, said it was \"ridiculous\" if high standards weren't applied to imports as well.\n\"We have some of highest standards for animal welfare in the world. It's good that the government have that same ambition,\" he said. \n\"But at the moment we are negotiating a trade deal with Australia, where you can have journey times for animals in excess of 24 hours without access to food or water. We cannot increase standards here, and at the same time not apply the same criteria to imports, it's just hypocrisy.\"\nMr Eustice said the UK could use tariffs on imported produce to uphold its standards and could also impose a ban on the sale of imported food which relied on practices banned domestically - such as foie gras.\nOther measures in the plan include banning the advertisement of \"unacceptable low-welfare animal practices abroad\" such as elephant rides, along with prohibiting the export of \"detached shark fins\". The Ivory Act, banning the sale of ivory, will also be implemented. \nThere will also be new laws to \"crack down on illegal hare coursing,\" and police will be given more powers to protect farm animals from dangerous or out-of-control dogs."

      "title": "PM 'apologises for events in Ballymurphy' in 1971",
      "tags": "Belfast,Boris Johnson,The Troubles,Ballymurphy inquest",
      "text": "The prime minister has \"apologised unreservedly\" for the \"events that took place in Ballymurphy\" in 1971, Downing Street has said.\nA spokesperson said during a phone call with NI's first and deputy first ministers on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said what happened was \"tragic\".\nAn inquest found 10 people who were shot in the wake of an Army operation in Belfast were \"entirely innocent\".\nFamilies of some of the Ballymurphy victims have rejected the apology.\nPoliticians in Northern Ireland have also criticised the manner in which it was delivered.\nJohn Teggart, whose father Danny was among those who were killed, said Mr Johnson's comments were an \"insult\".\n\"The apology was to third parties, it wasn't to the Ballymurphy families,\" he said.\n\"It's not a public apology.\n\"What kind of insult is it to families that he couldn't have the conversation with ourselves?\"\nA statement from a Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson told First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill he was sorry for the \"huge anguish\" which had been caused to the families due to their \"lengthy pursuit of truth\".\nThe prime minister was \"deeply sad\" at the findings of the inquest led by Mrs Justice Keegan, it continued.\nAmong the victims were a priest who was trying to help the wounded and a mother of eight.\nNine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said.\nHowever, she could not definitively rule who shot the tenth victim, John McKerr.\n\"The prime minister apologised unreservedly on behalf of the UK Government for the events that took place in Ballymurphy and the huge anguish that the lengthy pursuit of truth has caused the families of those killed,\" Mr Johnson's spokesperson said.\n\"The prime minister restated the government's intention to deliver a way forward in Northern Ireland that focuses on reconciliation, delivers for victims of the Troubles and ends the cycle of reinvestigations. \n\"He stressed the importance of working hard to keep the gains made through the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and of all parties doing their utmost to help the victims' families find out what happened to their loved ones, so that future generations are not burdened by the past.\"\nBriege Voyle, whose mother Joan Connolly was killed, said the prime minister's apology \"means nothing\".\n\"I don't care about an apology, I want to know why [our loved ones were killed],\" she told the BBC.\nShe added it would have been \"more respectful\" for Mr Johnson to make the apology in parliament, rather than through a phone call.\nThere are real question marks over the nature of how this apology was issued.\nNot by the prime minister at the despatch box in parliament, nor to the families who had been calling for a direct, public apology, but in a readout from Number 10 after a private meeting with Stormont's first and deputy first ministers.\nPart of the confusion is that the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in statements giving their version of the call make no reference to any apology from Boris Johnson.\nUltimately, only the politicians who took part in the call and their advisers know exactly what was said, and how it was said.\nThere is speculation that Brandon Lewis's planned statement to the Commons on Thursday about the inquest's findings will include a public apology.\nGiven the underwhelming response from the families to the prime minister's words and how this has been handled so far, they may not take much more comfort from what the government says next.  \nA Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson said the first and deputy first ministers were told that Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis would make a statement on Ballymurphy on Thursday. \nThey said: \"Michelle O'Neill put it to Boris Johnson that he should apologise to the families of those killed in Ballymurphy by British state forces. \n\"After 50 years of cover-up and lies they have been vindicated and their innocence declared. \n\"She challenged attempts by his government to deny the Ballymurphy families, or any other access to justice now or in the future.\"\nMs O'Neill, Sinn Fein's vice-president, had previously described an apology as the \"bare minimum\" required by the government.\nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said: \"I would encourage the British government to respond in a comprehensive and fulsome way to the finding that 10 completely innocent people were shot and killed.\"\nHe added: \"I would encourage them to understand the depth of the pain and grief felt by the families and how that pain and grief was compounded by the untruths that were told about their loved ones.\n\"This should be done in a manner that respects the wishes of these families.\"\nAlliance Party MP Stephen Farry said it was \"helpful\" that the government was \"prepared to apologise\", however, he added a statement needed to be made in parliament on Thursday.\n\"The scope of apology needs to be scrutinised to ensure it covers all aspects,\" he continued.\nSDLP assembly member Matthew O'Toole tweeted it was \"utterly repugnant\" for the prime minister to believe it was an \"appropriate manner\" to issue a statement on the shootings through a spokesperson.

      "tags": "Coronavirus public inquiry,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is \"fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage\" of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nHe told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022.\nThe inquiry would place \"the state's actions under the microscope\", he added, and take evidence under oath.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021.\nBut addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not \"inadvertently distract\" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. \nThe inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in \"due course\", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. \nOn Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases.\nMr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the \"right moment\".\nHe said the \"new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here\".\n\"Should these [variants] prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January.\"\nBolton has one of the highest instances of the Indian variant in the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s.\nHealth officials in Glasgow have expressed concern about a rising number of Covid cases in the city - the latest public case rate is 58.3 per 100,000, well above a key threshold for easing restrictions. \nMore than 127,600 people have died in the UK with coronavirus, making it one of the worst affected countries by number of deaths.  \nThe inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. \nMr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a \"statutory basis\" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath.  \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry.\nIn response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman \"will happen before the spring of next year\".\nMr Johnson - who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May - said: \"The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic.\"\nHe added: \"The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year.\"\nA WHO report released on Wednesday said the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. \nMost leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK.\nThe inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. \nKey questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only \"war-gamed\" a serious flu epidemic. \nWhy were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? \nWhy was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? \nThere will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. \nDifferent approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. \nThe biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. \nThe inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. \nThe Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were \"getting away from\u2026 early accountability\".  \nMeanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference.\nShe said spring 2022 was \"simply too late to begin\".\n\"It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year.\n\"A rapid review in summer 2020 could have saved our loved ones who died in the second wave in winter.\"\nAlong with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal \"lessons learned\" investigation into its handling of the pandemic.\nDowning Street confirmed an \"informal\" review of its response has been carried out but declined to say whether it would be published.\nFran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a \"rapid review\".\nShe told the BBC: \"That is something that can be done in a matter of weeks, that wouldn't tie up people's time to the degree that a full judge-led inquiry would.\n\"That would hopefully begin to get some quick answers to some of the very pressing questions.\"\nDame Deirdre Hine - the author of the independent review into the swine flu pandemic - told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it [the inquiry] has to cover; I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years.\"\nProfessor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry.\nHe told the BBC's Newscast podcast: \"What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise.\"\nIn the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic.\nHe added he \"wholeheartedly\" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as \"a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital\".\nIn response to a question from Conservative MP Felicity Buchan on the government's work-at-home advice, Mr Johnson said it was \"certainly\" the intention to lift the guidance on 21 June, but the government would \"say that with more clarity a bit later on\".\nEveryone who can work from home must do so under the current government advice.\nOn Thursday, England's Covid vaccination programme will open to those aged 38 and 39, with the NHS website to be updated at 07:00 BST.\nPregnant women will also be able to book through the national booking service from Thursday and will be directed to vaccination centres offering Pfizer and Moderna in their local area - in line with guidance from the UK's vaccine advisers.\nMore than 18.4m people - 35% of the adult population - have now received both doses of a vaccine, with 35.7m people having received one jab."

      "tags": "Transport,Oil,United States,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "US motorists have been urged to not hoard fuel as supplies tighten due to a major pipeline remaining shut after a cyber-attack.\nSome drivers in the south east were seen stocking up as petrol stations began running dry and prices rose.\nThe average price for petrol was the highest on Tuesday since November 2014, at $2.98 (\u00a32.11) per gallon, the American Automobile Association said.\nNorth Carolina, Virginia and Florida have declared a state of emergency.\nBut US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said there was no need for motorists to hoard petrol.\nMs Granholm said there was not a shortage but a supply \"crunch\" in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and southern Virginia, regions that typically rely on Colonial for fuel.\nA ransomware cyber-attack on Friday forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down the main part of its network.\nThe operator has forecast that it will not substantially restore operations of the 5,500-mile (8,900km) pipeline network that supplies nearly half of the East Coast's fuel until the end of the week.\nThe FBI has accused a criminal gang called DarkSide of the ransomware attack. \nThe gang is believed to be based in Russia or Eastern Europe and avoids targeting computers that use languages from former Soviet republics, cyber experts said.\nRansomware is a type of malware designed to lock computers by encrypting data and demanding payment to regain access.\nRussia's embassy in the US rejected speculation that the country's government was behind the attack. \nPresident Joe Biden a day earlier said there was no evidence so far that Russia was responsible.\nIf the general public or politicians ever needed proof of how devastating cyber-attacks can be, this hack will more than suffice: chaos at the pumps, states of emergency declared and the White House calling for calm.\nAnd this is just the stuff we're being told about.\nIn Colonial Pipeline's latest press update, we're given hints about the mayhem inside the company.\nWith high-tech sensors and safety systems taken offline, the firm says it's hired dozens of staff to walk or drive the 5,000-mile length of the pipeline every day.\nIt's also deployed helicopters to check on the pipes and a growing fleet of delivery trucks.\nAnother clue to the chaos is that the company's website has been periodically taken offline.\nColonial says this is a separate problem, but tellingly it has now blocked all traffic from outside of the US.\nEven the hackers themselves seem surprised by the damage they've caused.\nAccording to new research from cyber-security company FireEye, the hackers known as Darkside launched their global crime spree in August last year, raking in millions from organisations in more than 15 countries.\nBut this hack seems like it may have crossed some sort of line even for these hardened criminals. The true test of their morals, though, will depend on whether or not they will continue the extort the company or help it recover.\nMore than 7% of petrol stations in Virginia and 5% in North Carolina were out of fuel on Tuesday as demand jumped 20%, tracking firm GasBuddy said. \nOn Tuesday, the government stepped in to issue an emergency fuel waiver lasting one week, designed to help alleviate any shortages.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the move, which relaxes some rules usually applied to fuel, would run until 18 May in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington DC.\nIn addition, Georgia suspended sales tax on petrol until Saturday.\nOn Monday North Carolina declared a state of emergency and temporarily suspended vehicle fuel regulations \"to ensure adequate fuel supply supplies throughout the state\".\nWhile the pipeline outage is having short-term consequences in some regions, some experts believe the longer term impact will be small.\n\"Markets will go crazy, but two weeks later no one knows it happened,\" said Chuck Watson, director of research at Enki, which studies the economic effects of natural and other disasters.\nFuel prices were expected to rise with the start of the summer driving season, although the US Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday that the ongoing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic would \"significantly affect petroleum markets in the summer of 2021\".\nThe pipeline shutdown contributed to the rise in fuel prices, the AAA said.\n\"We might see the delivery challenges due to the attack add a few cents to the expected increase in the national average,\" a spokesperson added."

They can't.\"\nThe law changed in April 2020, ending the automatic half-way release for offenders convicted of rape, manslaughter and GBH after that date, with those criminals having to spend two thirds of their sentence behind bars.\nBut a petition by Laura's father is calling for \"the new rules to be applied retrospectively\" to those being released half-way through their jail term and has so far received over 1,750 signatures.\nLaura's father said her family was trying to secure a Sheffield-wide exclusion zone for Recio-Nugent if they could not stop him being released.\nThe Ministry of Justice said what Laura suffered was \"a horrific crime\" and added: \"Those released on licence face strict conditions - including non-contact orders and exclusion zones - and a return to prison if they breach them.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Child abuse,Sentencing in England and Wales",
      "text": "The body overseeing criminal sentences in England and Wales is proposing treating paedophiles who are caught in stings the same as abusers who harm real children. \nThe plan from the Sentencing Council says judges should look at intent, rather than whether a child was harmed. \nUndercover operations with officers posing as children are a common way of uncovering paedophile rings. \nOffenders have sought reduced jail terms if no child came to harm. \nThe rules will cover the sentencing of all abusers caught via stings, usually operating online - including those run by police forces around the world and traps set by informal groups of people often dubbed \"paedophile hunters\". \nCurrent guidelines have long been interpreted as meaning that in many cases, where someone was caught in a sting, the jail term would be lower because of the absence of a child. \nBut last year, senior judges at the Court of Appeal looked at the actions of abusers - including one who thought he was on his way to meet a real child. \nThe judgement said that the intentions of the men should be the key starting point for their sentences.\nLord Justice Fulford, the lead judge on that case and a member of the Sentencing Council, said: \"The changes we are proposing today will make sure the courts give the proper weight to the harm intended by those who commit offences against children.  \n\"When an offender intends sexual activity with a child, that must be reflected in the sentence imposed, even where that activity does not ultimately take place.\"\nThe proposals would affect all abusers convicted of arranging a sexual offence with a child or inciting a child to take part in abuse, whether or not the harm was caused or the victim actually existed. \nThe maximum jail term for these crimes is 14 years and the guidelines set out how long offenders should be jailed for, depending on the specific circumstances of their crime.

      "text": "The government is to bring forward legislation in the course of the next year to deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles.\nAs expected, the move was signalled in the Queen's speech.\nThe mention was brief: \"Measures will be brought forward to strengthen devolved government in NI and to address the legacy of the past.\"\nAccompanying government papers said the new legislation will be set out in the coming weeks.\nThe papers stated: \"The government is fully committed to introducing legislation to address the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and will confirm further details in the coming weeks.\n\"It is clear that the current system for dealing with the legacy of the past is not working well for anybody, with criminal investigations increasingly unlikely to deliver successful criminal justice outcomes and failing to obtain answers for the majority of victims and families.\n\"The government will introduce a legacy package that delivers better outcomes for victims, survivors and veterans, focuses on information recovery and reconciliation, and ends the cycle of investigations.\"\nBased on details of the plan leaked last week, it is proposed that all prosecutions prior to 1998 and related to the Troubles will, in future, be banned under a statute of limitations.\nInstead the focus will be on \"information recovery\" for families of those killed. \nThe government has started to brief political parties on the finer points of what is proposed.\nIt faces strong opposition to what is generally viewed as an amnesty which will apply across the board to former paramilitaries as well as those who served in the security forces.\nPart of the government's motivation is a manifesto commitment to protect ex-soldiers from re-investigation and prosecution.\nSpeaking before a meeting with the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, the Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the proposals were \"an insult to victims\"\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in politician added: \"At its core this is about the British state closing down any prospect of a meaningful investigation of its role in the conflict.\"\nThe Justice Minister Naomi Long has also had talks with Mr Lewis.\nShe said the plan displayed \"a callous and cavalier attitude\" to victims and survivors.\nIt is not clear when exactly the government intends to bring forward the legislation or whether it will force it through in the absence of support from the parties and victims' groups.\nThe conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles lasted almost 30 years from the late 1960s, and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people.\nNorthern Ireland was created in 1921 and remained part of the UK, while the rest of Ireland became an independent state.\nThis created a split in the population between the unionists - who were mainly Protestants and were happy to stay in the UK - and nationalists, who were predominantly Catholics and wanted to join the new Irish state.\nMany Catholics faced discrimination in jobs and housing and in the late 1960s began protests which were met with a crackdown from the Northern Ireland government, and led to the UK government to sending over troops in 1969.\nThey were largely welcomed, but later armed groups from both sides, like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA)  began carrying out bombings and shootings.\nPeace talks started in the early 1990s, and culminated in the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which ended the worst of the violence.

      "tags": "Social media,Facebook,Mental health",
      "text": "A Facebook moderator has for the first time given evidence revealing the mental toll of the job, to a parliamentary committee.\nThe Irish parliament heard how moderators viewed graphic content up to eight hours a day.\nLaw firm Foxglove and the Communication Workers Union, representing moderators, called for better psychological support and freedom to speak out.\nFacebook said it provides 24 hours support to staff.\nIsabella Plunkett has worked as a Facebook content moderator for just over two years, and still works there.\nHer job is to review posts on the platform - which can contain graphic violence, exploitation, extremism, abuse and suicide.\nThe 26-year-old says she could not speak to her friends or family about the things she saw at work due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) which she had signed at the beginning of her contract.\nMembers of Ireland's Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, commended her bravery in speaking out.\n\u201cI'm here speaking out and I don't actually necessarily know in detail what I'm legally allowed to say and not to say,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt was always clear we couldn't speak about our job, we couldn't speak about our job to friends, family... and it's definitely a workplace with a sense of secrecy.\u201d\nFacebook told the BBC that NDAs are standard practice and that reviewers can discuss any aspect of their job with doctors and counsellors.\nStaff can discuss the general challenges and rewards of their jobs with family and loved ones, but not specific details of the content they are reviewing.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done the job for two years and I don\u2019t think I could do it for much longer because of the strain it does cause to your mental health,\u201d Isabella told the BBC.\n\u201cIt's not like a normal job where you can go to work and go home and forget about it - the stuff you\u2019re seeing is really ingrained in your mind.\u2019\u201d\nIsabella processes around 100 \"tickets\" a day - these can be videos, images or text posts on the platform. She said they often contain graphic violence, suicide, exploitation and abuse.\nShe works for Covalen, one of Facebook\u2019s largest contractors in Ireland.\nIsabella claims she was not allowed to work from home, unlike her counterparts who were employed directly by Facebook who did the same job.\nAs a result, she says she is exposed to more graphic content, because she is in the office.\n\u201cThe high priority queues - the graphic violence, the child stuff, the exploitation and the suicides, people working from home don\u2019t get that - the burden is put on us.\u201d\nDespite having family shielding at home, she was told to come into the office and developed anxiety, for which she now takes antidepressants.\n\u201cEvery day was a nightmare,\u201d she said, adding that the support given was \u201cinsufficient.\u201d\nFacebook says psychological help is available to all its moderators 24 hours a day, but Isabella claims its wellness coaches are not qualified psychiatrists.\n\u201cI was seeing the wellness team but didn\u2019t feel I got the support I needed. I can\u2019t say I left work feeling relieved or knowing I could go home and have a good night's sleep - that\u2019s not possible,\u201d she added.\n\u201cIt would follow me home. I could just be watching TV at home and think back to one of the horrible, really graphic tickets.\u201d\nSub-contracted staff are given 1.5 hours of \"wellness\" time a week, she says, which can be used for speaking to a wellness coach, going for walks or taking time out when feeling overwhelmed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. I\u2019m now seeing the content I view in work in my dreams. I remember it, I experience it again and it is horrible.\n\u201cYou never know what is going to come next and you have to watch it the full way through because they might have violators.\u201d\nSome Facebook moderators are asked to sign a disclaimer before starting work, accepting that the content seen in their jobs could lead to poor mental health and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). \nAn example of the contract, read out in the committee said: \u201cI understand that exposure to this content may give me post traumatic stress disorder.\n\"I will engage in a mandatory wellness coaching session but I understand that those are not conditions and may not be sufficient to prevent my contracting PTSD.\u201d\nA Facebook spokeswoman said: \"Everyone who reviews content for Facebook goes through an in-depth training programme on Facebook's Community Standards and has access to psychological support to ensure their wellbeing.   \n\u201cWe are committed to working with our partners to provide support for our content reviewers as we recognise that reviewing certain types of content can sometimes be hard,\" she added. \n\"In Ireland, this includes 24/7 on-site support with trained practitioners, an on-call service, and access to private healthcare from the first day of employment.\n\"We are also employing technical solutions to limit their exposure to potentially graphic material as much as possible. This is an important issue, and we are committed to getting this right.\u201d\nFacebook uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and human moderators to review content.\nIn future, it hopes to reduce the number of human moderators through machine learning.\nBut Isabella said this was a Facebook \"fantasy\", that systems were \u201cnot even near that stage\u201d.\nSpeaking to the committee, Isabella said \u201cpeople are intimidated\u201d by the NDA process and afraid of losing their jobs.\nShe cited an internal communications platform on Facebook, in which workers' posts were deleted when speaking up. Facebook denied these claims and said no disciplinary action is taken for employees raising concerns.\n\u201cPeople complained about the treatment and what was going on and how they felt unsafe,\u201d Isabella told the committee. \u201cIt was clear that it was being censored because people's comments were being deleted, accounts were being disabled.\"\nShe said her experience drove her to give evidence: \u201cI just had such a feeling that I needed to do it,\u201d she added in her testimony. \u201cI need to speak for the people that are too afraid, that feel they have too many responsibilities, and they can't afford to take any risks.\""

      "text": "Universities in England could face fines under new legislation if they fail to protect free speech on campus. \nVisiting speakers, academics or students could seek compensation if they suffer loss from a breach of a university's free speech obligations.\nThe Higher Education (Freedom of Speech Bill) was one of the proposed pieces of legislation announced in the Queen's Speech on Tuesday.\nUniversities said it was important not to create \"unnecessary bureaucracy\".\nUnder the plans, new freedom of speech and academic duties would be placed on universities and, for the first time, on student unions.\nIndividuals would be given a right to seek compensation through the courts if the freedom of speech duties of an institution or student union had been breached.\nThe Office for Students, the higher education watchdog in England, would have the power to impose fines on institutions if they breached the rules.\nAmong the proposals there is also an appointed \"free speech champion\" who would examine potential infringements of duties, for example, the no-platforming of speakers or the dismissal of academics.\nThe government hopes the changes will ensure that university staff feel safe to put forward controversial or unpopular views, without being at risk of losing their jobs.\nBut a spokeswoman for Universities UK (UUK) said: \"Universities are (rightly) already legally required to have a code of practice on free speech and to update this regularly.\n\"It is important that the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill is proportionate by focusing on the small number of incidents, while not duplicating existing legislation and creating unnecessary bureaucracy for universities which could have unintended consequences.\"\nJo Grady, head of the University and College Union, said: \"There are serious threats to freedom of speech and academic freedom from campus, but they come from the government and university managers, not staff and students. \n\"Widespread precarious employment strips academics of the ability to speak and research freely, and curtails chances for career development. \n\"If the government wants to strengthen freedom of speech and academic freedom, it shouldn't be policing what can and cannot be said on campus, and encourage university managers to move staff on to secure, permanent contracts.\"\nBut Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it was a basic human right \"to be able to express ourselves freely and take part in rigorous debate\". \n\"Our legal system allows us to articulate views which others may disagree with as long as they don't meet the threshold of hate speech or inciting violence - this must be defended, nowhere more so than within our world-renowned universities.\n\"Holding universities to account on the importance of freedom of speech in higher education is a milestone moment in fulfilling our manifesto commitment, protecting the rights of students and academics, and countering the chilling effect of censorship on campus once and for all.\"\nUniversities minister Michelle Donelan added: \"This bill will ensure universities not only protect free speech but promote it too. \n\"After all how can we expect society to progress or for opinions to modernise unless we can challenge the status quo?\""

However, its advice is based on different criteria to the Department of Transport's advice.\nAt present, only 12 countries are on the government's \"green list\" for foreign holidays under the traffic light system for travel, meaning people are not required to quarantine when they get back. But they will need to take a Covid test before departure and another on arrival. \nBy contrast, those visiting amber countries such as Spain and France must take a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival. They also need to quarantine at home for 10 days when they return.\nOn The Beach's Mr Cooper said it would not be offering foreign holidays to \"green list\" countries because \"it is very likely that we will see regular fluctuations in destinations' traffic light classifications\".\n\"Given this, there is too much uncertainty for us to take new bookings with confidence that they will go ahead, or for us to know the potential inconvenience or incremental costs that customers might experience or incur,\" he said.\n\"Unlike many of our competitors, we have no interest in selling holidays that are unlikely to happen, as our business model enables us to put customers first, rather than needing to get cash in the door to contribute to high fixed costs, and offering refunds in the form of a voucher when holidays get cancelled.\"\nSpeaking on Friday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that although holidays abroad would no longer be illegal from Monday 17 May, the government advised against travel to amber countries for leisure. \nHowever, Tui and EasyJet are still going to push ahead with their plans to offer holidays to \"amber list\" countries.\nAn EasyJet Holidays spokeswoman said: \"We recognise that many our customers do still want their holidays to go ahead, so for 'amber' list destinations where holidays can be enjoyed safely and legally, which do not have 'all but essential travel' warnings and where there is no quarantine requirement in destination, we are providing flexibility and choice so customers can make up their own mind about their holiday.\" \nShe added that EasyJet won't operate any holidays to destinations on the \"red\" list.\nTui's spokeswoman said: \"We want to offer our customers flexibility and choice this summer, so where borders are open and FCDO advice allows travel, we will operate to those destinations. \n\"We know some customers may be unsure about travelling this summer, so we've offered free changes 14 days before travel for anyone due to travel before the end of August.\"\nThe flurry of activity by the FCDO at the start of last week led a few to think that they had cracked which countries would be on the green list early. But they spoke too soon; while there is overlap the two are not the same. \nThe government would say the two lists each serve a different purpose. The Foreign office list is advice to help British travellers assess the risk posed to them if they travel to a country. The traffic light list is about stopping the virus and variants coming into the country.\nEssentially, one is about personal risk, one is about national risk. There is still a strong overlap between the two and the fact that the countries differ has still left some passengers and the industry scratching their heads. \nUnlike now, there will be no law stopping travellers from going to amber countries, just government advice not to do so for leisure. Doing so will mean quarantine on return and added cost for tests, which will put many off. But after low passenger numbers for over a year, some operators think that it's a price that certain passengers will be willing to pay.  \nAlso on Wednesday, Spain's Foreign Minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya said the UK should take a regional approach when deciding which places should be on the green list. The country is on the amber list.\nShe told BBC Breakfast: \"We are having good discussions with the UK authorities to convince them there are many regions in Spain - Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Valencia - where the numbers are equivalent to those in the UK today.\n\"Maybe if the UK looks with a regional lens they will discover that there are many safe places already in Spain to travel to. Let's keep on working, but it's looking good for British tourists to spend their holidays in Spain this summer.\"\nShe said Spain was proceeding at pace with its vaccination effort and that over 30% of Spaniards had already received at least one shot, with six million were fully vaccinated. She said that the country was 98 days away from collective immunity.   \nIt comes as Tui reported reported a sharp jump in demand for holidays this winter as more people defer their holidays.\nAs of 2 May, bookings this year for winter 2021/22 breaks were up 17% on the same period in 2019. But total summer bookings were down 69% due to continued uncertainty over travel rules. \nNevertheless, TUI said it expected the safe return of holidays in the coming months. \n\"The continued vaccination progress across our key customer markets and destinations, combined with more testing, and comprehensive hygiene measures throughout our eco-system, should enable the safe return to holidays this summer,\" it said.\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, third lockdown and travel restrictions, Tui's revenues dived by 89% to \u20ac716m (\u00a3614.6m) in the six months to March.\nHowever, TUI said customers were keen to travel once Covid restrictions were fully lifted.\nIt said nearly three times as many Britons have decided to book with the travel giant for the summer of 2022 compared with 2019.\nThe travel operator said it was focused on reopening a portfolio of destinations strong vaccination coverage and low incidence rates, including the Greek islands, the Balearics, the Canaries and Portugal.

      "text": "Every adult who has tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland is to be invited to take part in a major new study into the effects of long Covid. \nResearchers hope to identify how many people in Scotland continue to be unwell after having the virus.\nThe Covid in Scotland Study (CISS) will ask people what their symptoms are and how it affects their lives.\nThose taking part will be asked to use a phone app to answer questions about their health before and after Covid. \nEarly estimates suggest as many as 6,000 people in Scotland were experiencing long term symptoms after the first wave of the pandemic but it is not known what that tally is now. \nProf Jill Pell, an expert in public health at the University of Glasgow, will lead the study in collaboration with Public Health Scotland and the NHS in Scotland.\nShe said: \"Most people recover quickly and completely after infection with Covid-19, but some people have reported a wide variety of long-term problems.\n\"It is crucial that we find out how many people have long-term problems, and what those problems are, so that we can set up systems to spot problems early and deal with them effectively.\"\n\"I thought at the time it was just the flu,\" explained long Covid sufferer Wendy Nibloe.\nWendy, from Girvan, fell ill before the coronavirus testing regime was in place last year and it was months before her GP diagnosed her long Covid. \nThe grandmother told BBC Scotland that fatigue and headaches mean tasks she never gave a second thought to before are now difficult for her. \n\"Up and down the stairs is still a struggle, washing the dishes - it's all gone,\" Wendy explains.\n\"A hands-on granny - that is what they are used to but I can't do it anymore.\n\"You've got no control over it, you could be talking to somebody and then you forget what you were saying.\"\nWendy says she now recognises her \"shut off point\" where she has to go and rest until she is better again. \nThere is no universally agreed definition of long Covid, but it covers a broad range of symptoms.\nSo far, research studies indicate that the most common persistent symptoms include breathlessness and fatigue, although people have reported a number of other on-going health concerns.\nThe NHS in England has opened dozens of specialist clinics to offer rehabilitation to people recovering from the disease.\nA BBC investigation in November found no health boards in Scotland were offering dedicated long Covid clinics - existing services such as physiotherapy were being used instead. \nUsing NHS health data records, all Scottish adults who have had a positive test - as well a sample of people who tested negative for the disease - will be sent a text message inviting them to take part in the new study.\nParticipants who tested negative will be asked similar questions about their current and past health so researchers can compare answers with those who had the virus.\nScotland's chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith said: \"We recognise the longer term impacts Covid-19 is having on the physical and mental wellbeing of people in Scotland.\n\"This new study will be a valuable tool to help us learn more about the effects of what is still a relatively new illness and ensure people receive the best possible treatment and care.\" "

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Cardiff University",
      "text": "Covid-19 restrictions led to the sharpest fall in violent crime for at least 20 years, a report suggests. \nViolence was down by a third in England and Wales in 2020 compared with the previous year, according to research by Cardiff University. \n\"From a violence perspective, 2020 was the safest year on record,\" said co-author Prof Jonathan Shepherd.   \nBut the report also found that the easing of restrictions was \"accompanied by rapid increases\" in violence.\nCardiff University's Violence Research Group analysed data for the whole of 2020 from 133 NHS hospital emergency departments, minor-injury units and walk-in centres, across England and Wales.\nThe number of people who attended for treatment of violence-related injuries in 2020 was 119,111 - 56,653 fewer than in the previous year. \nThe reductions were across all age groups but were most marked among children under the age of 11, where violence levels were down by 66%. \nThe report concluded that this was \"likely to reflect the unprecedented restrictions imposed on free movement of citizens and businesses to limit the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic\".  \nWhen restrictions were eased in May 2020 to include the phased re-opening of pubs and bars, violence rose again, and by August it had reached pre-pandemic levels.\nDuring the second lockdown in the autumn, which included a 22:00 curfew, there was another sharp fall in the number of people needing hospital treatment for injuries. \nThe data highlights a clear link between violence and late-night drinking.\n\"Efforts to prevent serious violence should be concentrated in night-time economies where pubs, clubs and other licensed premises are located,\" says the report.\nAnother encouraging conclusion is that there has been a gradual reduction in serious violence over most of the past 20 years. \nThis is because of \"advances in inter-agency collaboration, data sharing and analysis, targeted policing and real-time CCTV surveillance,\" said Prof Shepherd. \n\"These factors are all vulnerable when the economy is stretched; they need constant attention.\"\nBut while the figures are clearly welcome, they do not tell the whole picture. \nHomicide in England and Wales has been rising since 2015, as has knife crime. \nAlso, not all violence ends with a visit to hospital. \nStatistics for the year ending March 2020 revealed that fewer than half of all violent incidents resulted in physical injury.\nThe effects of lockdown on domestic violence are still unclear because few of the hospitals in this survey were able to provide information on the location of violence. \nData from Cardiff A&E shows levels of violence in the home in the city were unchanged in 2020. \nHowever, other figures have shown an increase in demand for domestic abuse services across England and Wales. \nA 10% rise in domestic violence-related offences was recorded by the police in the year ending September 2020, which may reflect improved levels of police recording. \nThe picture is further complicated because a large number of domestic offences are never reported. \nOn Thursday the Office of National Statistics will publish annual figures on crime patterns, which will shed more light on what happened to violence during the pandemic.

      "text": "Palestinian militants say they fired 130 missiles at the Israeli city of Tel Aviv after an Israeli air strike felled a tower block in the Gaza Strip. \nThe 13-storey building was attacked an hour and a half after residents and local people were warned to evacuate, Reuters news agency reports.\nIsrael's military says it is targeting militants in Gaza in response to earlier rocket attacks.\nAt least 31 people have died in some of the worst violence in years.\nThe international community has urged both sides to end the escalation, which follows days of unrest in Jerusalem. \nMilitants had already fired hundreds of rockets towards Jerusalem and other areas. \nThree people have been killed in Israeli areas while at least 28 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier that the main militant group, Hamas, had \"crossed a red line\" by firing rockets towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. \nHamas, which controls Gaza, says it has been acting to defend Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque from Israeli \"aggression and terrorism\" after the site, which is holy to Muslims and Jews, saw clashes between Israeli police and Palestinians on Monday that left hundreds injured. \nThe past few days have seen the worst violence in Jerusalem since 2017. It followed mounting Palestinian anger over the threatened eviction of families from their homes in occupied East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers. Tension had already been stoked by a month of altercations between protesters and police in the predominantly Arab part of the city.\nHamas said it had launched rockets at Tel Aviv and its suburbs in response to \"the enemy's targeting of residential towers\". \nVideo footage from the city shows rockets streaking through the night sky, some exploding as they are hit by Israeli interceptor missiles.\nA 50-year-old woman was killed by a rocket in Rishon LeZion, near Tel Aviv, Israeli official said. \nIn the Tel Aviv suburb of Holon, a rocket hit a bus just after it had been evacuated. A girl of five and two women, one 50 and one 30, were injured.\nIn Tel Aviv itself, pedestrians ran for shelter and diners streamed out of restaurants while others flattened themselves on pavements as the sirens sounded, according to Reuters. \nBen Gurion Airport briefly halted flights and an energy pipeline between the cities of Eilat and Ashkelon was hit.\nThe rockets were launched after the destruction of the Hanadi Tower in Gaza, which houses an office used by the political leadership of Hamas.\nHours after the collapse, there were still no reports of casualties.\nThere are reports that a second high-rise building was also destroyed by the Israelis after a warning to evacuate.  \nIsraeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said the Israeli strikes were \"just the beginning\".\n\"Terror organisations have been hit hard and will continue to be hit because of their decision to hit Israel,\" he said. \"We'll return peace and quiet, for the long term.\"\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said the group was \"ready\" if Israel chose to escalate.\n\"If [Israel] wants to escalate, we are ready for it, and if it wants to stop, we're also ready,\" he said in a televised address. \"There is a new balance of force.\"\nThe UN Security Council will meet privately on Wednesday to discuss the conflict, diplomats said.\nThe fundamental reason for the renewed violence does not change. It is the open wound of the unresolved conflict between Jews and Arabs that has blighted and ended Palestinian and Israeli lives for generations. \nThis latest episode has happened because of tension in Jerusalem, the sharpest part of the conflict. The holy sites in the Old City are national as well as religious symbols. Crises affecting them have often ignited violence. \nThe triggers for what has happened this time include heavy-handed Israeli policing of Palestinians during Ramadan and controversial efforts in the Israeli courts to evict Palestinians from their homes.\nBut other events could have had the same effect. This was a crisis waiting to happen, in a conflict that, once again, has been left to fester. \nLeaders on both sides have concentrated on safeguarding their own positions. \nThe biggest challenge, of making peace, has not been addressed seriously for years. \nEarlier on Tuesday, two women, one in her 60s and the other in her 80s, were killed in a rocket attack on the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, with one other person seriously injured, medics say.\nHamas said it had fired 137 rockets at Ashkelon and nearby Ashdod in the space of five minutes, and warned it had \"many surprises\" prepared if the fighting continued.\nAt least 95 people received treatment in Israeli hospitals as a result of the attacks.\nThe Israeli military said earlier that 90% of rockets had been intercepted by its Iron Dome missile defence system.\nAmong the \"terror targets\" in Gaza it said it had struck were two attack tunnels being dug under the border with Israel.\nAmong those killed by Israeli air strikes was the head of the Islamic Jihad group's special rocket unit, Samah Abed al-Mamlouk, and the commander of a Hamas anti-tank missile unit is also said to have been killed. \nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported that at least 28 Palestinians, including 10 children, had been killed in Israeli strikes and more than 150 others had been injured.\nVictims included a 59-year-old woman and her disabled son and seven members of one family, including three children, in Beit Hanoun. \nThe fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. \nThe site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. \nThe fate of Jerusalem, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. \nPalestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own."

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Housing market,Renting,Private rented sector",
      "text": "Tenants are showing signs of returning to major cities to take advantage of rents that were lowered during lockdown, a report suggests.\nWork and leisure restrictions, as well as younger adults returning to live with their families, meant demand dropped in the last year.\nThis in turn led to rent falls, including a drop of 9.4% in London, according to property portal Zoopla.\nBut, since Easter, it said demand had picked up.\nThere was a two-speed rental market over the last year, according to the Zoopla figures.\nOutside London, rents rose by 3% in the year to the end of March.\nHowever, the cost of renting in some of the UK's big cities fell. In Edinburgh, it dropped by 3.2% and in Manchester it was down by 1%.\nIn London, the drop was particularly pronounced. This meant average rents accounted for 42% of an average single earner income in London, down from 49% in March last year. That was considerably lower than the peak of 53% in late 2016.\nLondon still remained a comparatively expensive place to rent a home. The national average sees rent take up 31% of a single earner's income.\nDemand among renters for city properties is starting to rise significantly again, the report suggests, with tenants looking out for particular characteristics in the light of Covid.\nPrivate outdoor space is a priority. The proportion of renters searching for properties with gardens had doubled since last year, the report said.\nGr\u00e1inne Gilmore, head of research at Zoopla, said the availability of mortgages for people only able to offer a low deposit meant some were keen to buy a first home rather than rent, but this would be limited by economic uncertainty.\n\"The opening up of the economy and the slow return to business as usual as the vaccine rolls out means [rental] demand will continue to build over the summer as more people move to rent their first property - although, as ever, this will be dependent on the economy opening up in line with the planned timetable,\" she said.\n\"Demand will continue to rise in city centres as offices start to reopen.\"\nVarious surveys have shown significant rises in house prices for buyers over the last year."

Accepting delays is a further demonstration of complacency from them on the matter.\n\"There are protocols in place to hold passengers on planes or divert them to other airports, to prevent excessive, unnecessary and completely avoidable queues in immigration halls.\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Protecting public health is our priority and as we reopen international travel safely we will maintain 100% health checks at the border to protect the wider public and our vaccine rollout. \n\"While we do this, wait times are likely to be longer and we will do all we can to smooth the process, including the roll-out of our e-Gate upgrade programme during the summer and deploying additional Border Force officers.\"\n\n\n"

      "tags": "Family,Children,Social services,Adoption",
      "text": "Claire and Ed adopted their sons 13 years ago. When the brothers found their biological family on social media aged 15 and 16, it took just three months for them to cut off all contact with their adoptive parents.\nClaire and Ed say their children were sent \"intrusive\" messages from their birth family and withdrew from their parents. Both children no longer attend school and there have been reports the older boy is involved in drug dealing. \n\"For us, it's just been devastating to have our family broken,\" Ed tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"But the big tragedy and the big, human cost is theirs. Because they've just been manipulated.\"\nAdoption UK says such complete breakdowns of relationships are rare - but unsupervised contact is becoming more common.\nThe charity's research suggests nearly a quarter of adopted children make direct contact with their birth family - often via social media - before they gain the right to access information about their origins at the age of 18.\nFormer High Court family law judge Sir Mark Hedley says there are no legal means of preventing young people from using social media to get in touch with their biological family, and banning their relatives from responding could be counter-productive.\nThe situation has prompted a call from Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on adoption, for social services to enable safer, supervised contact before the age of 18.\nThree-quarters of adopted child have experienced neglect or abuse in their birth families, according to Adoption UK, raising concerns that post-adoption contact could be risky in some circumstances.\nClaire and Ed say despite more than 30 emails and repeated phone calls to social services and their regional adoption agency asking for support, no one intervened. \"You just scream into a void for help,\" says Claire.\nIn October last year, before the contact happened, Claire says she felt her family seemed happy and settled, perhaps for the first time in years.\nTheir older son was attending a specialist school, having therapies which seemed to be helping him, while the younger boy was in a mainstream school, seemingly a \"happy lad\" on course for his GCSEs, she says.\nThe couple say their older child had been increasingly curious about his birth family and they had arranged for him to send a note through letterbox contact - a system that is used in many adoptions to keep birth families updated as a child grows up, monitored by the local authority.\nBut before that happened, it took him just a \"matter of minutes\" to look his family up on social media using details he had been given during the adoption process, they say.\nHis birth family welcomed the contact and were \"very persistent\" in keeping in touch. He began to go missing from home overnight and was found close to his biological family's house.\nIn December, he stopped going to school and Claire says there were allegations he had been dealing drugs. \"He was completely knocked off course and started to follow a completely different life trajectory,\" she says.\nClaire says the younger boy had been \"resistant\" to being introduced to his birth family, but was subjected to \"intrusive\" contact over phone and Facetime.\nHe withdrew from his adoptive family and from school, began meeting with his birth family, and would return with vapes, clothes and money, she says. \nClaire says: \"Our boys struggled with friendships, they struggled with school, they struggled with attention, they struggled to live within society's boundaries.\n\"And then what happens if a group of people come along and say, look, you don't need to go to school, you don't need to live in society's boundaries, we love you no matter what?\n\"[They say] 'Your parents are too harsh on you. They're too critical. And this is your escape clause.' I'm sure, you know lots of children, at that stage in their life would be tempted to move away from their families.\"\nNow the couple say they have not had any meaningful contact with their sons for three months. \n\"They no longer live with us or regard as their parents and they don't want us to be their parents going forward. They're quite hostile towards us,\" Ed says.\nHe says the boys have blocked their adoptive parents' phone number, and when their sons initiate a call it is \"not in a positive way\".\n\"There might be a chance of amicable relations sometime in the future, but not as a family,\" says Ed.\nHe says they cannot compromise on their values of \"hard work, honesty and being law-abiding\" but they now think their sons are \"in a different world to that\". \nThey feel they cannot be a part of that world and cannot influence the boys back onto the right path, he says. \nClaire says she felt they were \"naive\", believing themselves to be a close family unit. Ed says they had not been prepared for the possibility of contact before the boys were 18, and the result was \"beyond any worst-case scenario we could ever have contemplated\".\n\"You wouldn't believe it was possible for you to try to instil values and raise children for so many years and for it just to be totally wiped out in such a short amount of time,\" Claire says.\nCharlotte Ramsden, president of the Association of Directors of Children's Services, says when children contact birth family through social media and relationships are damaged, it is a \"really complex and tragic situation\".\nModern adoption needs to recognise that \"children have multiple attachments, they have complex identities, they are desperate to be loved and to understand their backgrounds\", she says.\nBut while lifelong support and advice for adoptive families has improved, \"it's not at the level we think it needs to be\", Ms Ramsden says.\nTrying to prevent contact by restricting information is not the answer, she says. \n\"In a sense that's where adoption was a very long time ago, that information wasn't shared with children, but that actually was proved to cause them more difficulties.\"\nThis story is based on Sinead Heekin and Mishal Husain's interview with Claire and Ed for the Today programme. UK audiences can hear it on BBC Sounds. Names were changed to protect the identities of children."

      "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic was preventable, an independent review panel has said.\nThe panel, set up by the World Health Organization, said the combined response of the WHO and global governments was a \"toxic cocktail\".\nThe WHO should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, its report said, adding that without urgent change the world was vulnerable to another major disease outbreak.\nMore than 3.3 million people around the world have now died of Covid.\nWhile the US and Europe are beginning to ease restrictions and resume some aspects of pre-pandemic life, the virus is still devastating parts of Asia.\nIndia in particular is seeing record-breaking numbers of new cases and deaths, with severe oxygen shortages in hospitals across the country.\nCountries neighbouring India, such as Nepal, are also seeing surges of the virus.\nCovid-19: Make it the Last Pandemic, was compiled by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response.\nIts aim was to find answers as to how the virus had killed more than 3.3 million people and infected more than 159 million.\n\"The situation we find ourselves in today could have been prevented,\" co-chair Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a former president of Liberia, told reporters. \n\"It is due to a myriad of failures, gaps and delays in preparedness and response.\"\nThe panel argued that the WHO's Emergency Committee should have declared the outbreak in China an international emergency a week earlier than it did.\nIt should have done so at its first meeting on 22 January last year, the report said, instead of waiting until 30 January.\nThe month following the WHO's declaration was \"lost\" as countries failed to take appropriate measures to halt the spread of the virus.\nThe WHO was then hindered by its own regulations that travel restrictions should be a last resort, the panel said, adding that Europe and the US wasted the entire month of February and acted only when their hospitals began to fill up.\nWhen countries should have been preparing their healthcare systems for an influx of Covid patients, much of the world descended into a \"winner takes all\" scramble for protective equipment and medicines, the report said.\nTo prevent another catastrophic pandemic, the report suggests key reforms: \nPanel co-chair and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was \"critical to have an empowered WHO\".\n\"If travel restrictions had been imposed more quickly, more widely, again that would have been a serious inhibition on the rapid transmission of the disease and that remains the same today,\" she added.\nThe most eye-catching line of this report is that the pandemic was the 21st Century's \"Chernobyl moment\" and its assertion that the world wasted time in February 2020 while the virus took hold. \nThe panel calls for better processes and structures to spot the next highly infectious pathogen. As well as better funding for the World Health Organization to make it stronger and give it more teeth. \nAfter the worst shock to the global economy since World War Two, all countries will agree that it's a case of \"never again\". But will meaningful reform be possible when so much of the current response is still about putting national interests first?\nThe panel has called for rich countries to share one billion doses of vaccine by September, for example. Yet many nations with large stockpiles remain reluctant to declare their hand.\nThere are some issues the panel didn't have time to consider in depth. The most fundamental one remains our relationship with the animal world to stop viruses jumping to humans in the first place."

      "text": "Concerns have been raised about the impartiality of an Ofsted review into claims of sex abuse in schools.\nThe government ordered the review after thousands of anonymous allegations of abuse in schools were posted on the Everyone's Invited website. \nBut the head of the largest teaching union says education watchdog Ofsted is unable to conduct an impartial review. \nHowever, the Department for Education said Ofsted would ensure a wide range of expertise informed its work.\nThe mostly anonymous testimonies of abuse and misogyny started emerging mainly from within private schools but thousands of allegations have since been attributed to pupils from state schools and colleges as well.\nOfsted was asked to conduct a review into safeguarding policies and practices on sexual abuse in both state and independent schools in England.\nBut National Education Union (NEU) joint general secretary Dr Mary Bousted says the watchdog is not best placed to conduct the review. \n\"The Department for Education wants an inquiry that it can control, so it overuses Ofsted for a whole manner of inquiries because it has a close relationship with Ofsted and can control the results of that inquiry and the recommendations,\" she said. \nPart of the inquiry's remit is to investigate whether Ofsted and the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI), which inspects private schools, have been robust enough in their monitoring of schools. \nBut Dr Bousted said \"What is being asked of them is something they have failed to do over decades. \n\"Why the government thinks that they are the correct bodies to do this investigation and to make these recommendations, I simply do not understand.\" \nUntil recently, the Department for Education commissioned Ofsted to monitor the ISI. \nBut a letter from the government seen by the BBC's Newsnight programme said Ofsted's powers to investigate whether private schools were meeting all of their statutory obligations towards pupils were being removed, despite warnings about the impact this might have on safeguarding.\nLabour MP for Birmingham Yardley Jess Phillips also has concerns that Ofsted is conducting the review - and that Dame Christine Ryan, who chairs the education watchdog, has strong links with the ISI, as its chief inspector up until April 2017.\n\"There is an enormous conflict of interest,\" Ms Phillips said.\n\"And it is just another example of marking your own homework. \n\"The Department for Education, they need to admit that something has gone wrong here and that they have had a responsibility that they did not act on.\n\"The reason that the Department for Education commissioned this review is because it was in the public eye, it was at the peak of public interest in response to various issues. \n\"The government promised to collect this data and do similar reviews five years ago.\"\nOfsted said it had visited more than 30 state and private schools and colleges for the review, speaking to dozens of staff and nearly 1,000 pupils. \n\"We asked how well systems of support and response work when incidents are reported,\" an official said. \n\"We also asked about wider issues, from lessons in the classroom to culture in the corridors, to find out what barriers may prevent young people from reporting abuse in the first place. \n\"We are also considering the role of inspection and whether our work, and that of ISI, could be improved in this area.\"\nA Department for Education official said it was \"vital that any allegations are dealt with properly\". \n\"Crucially, Ofsted will work with representatives from social care, police, victim support groups, education leaders and the Independent Schools Council to ensure a wide range of expertise inform their work,\" the official said.\nOfsted is expected to complete its review by the end of this month. \nYou can watch Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:45 on weekdays, catch up on iPlayer, subscribe to the programme on YouTube and follow it on Twitter."

Then one thinks better of it and shuffles back into his seat. \nIt's an inauspicious start - but luckily Dua Lipa is just around the corner to save the day.\nShe struts out of a Tube station on to the stage, racing through a slick and thrillingly choreographed hits medley that encompasses more than half of the songs on her recent album, Future Nostalgia.\nFrom there, the show finds its footing. \nHost Jack Whitehall delivers his jokes with just enough edge and charm to sneak past the censors - taking aim at Piers Morgan and Laurence Fox, before introducing Olivia Rodrigo to the stage with the memorable line: \"In the words of Tiger Woods: 'Driver's License, take it away...'\"\nRodrigo casually proceeds to cement her status as pop's most promising newcomer with a flawless performance of her ubiquitous ballad, accompanied by several thousand swaying phone lights. \nLater, Headie One brings together some of UK rap's leading names - including AJ Tracey and Young T & Bugsey - for a searing rendition of Ain't It Different and Princess Cuts, whose modified lyrics took aim at the demonisation of drill music and black youth.\n\"What else can a drill youth rap about part from my worst days,\" rapped the star, whose real name is Irving Adjei. \"You see me on stage but I was in jail for three of my birthdays. \n\"Two black Brits stand here at the Brits but still we ain't seen as British\"\nPowerful and well-received in the arena, it is clearly aiming for the impact of Dave's performance of Black at last year's awards - but the stars' quickfire delivery obscures some of the most effective lines.\nElsewhere, Rising Star winner Griff marks out her territory as one-to-watch with a commanding version of her single Black Hole (performed from inside a black hole, in a victory for literalists everywhere); while Olly Alexander and Sir Elton John give a dramatic reading of It's A Sin, reflecting the impact of the Aids epidemic.\nTheirs is another pre-taped performance, as is The Weeknd's rain-soaked rendition of Save Your Tears, but to cut the organisers some slack, a normal show is simply not possible in the current circumstances. \nWhile the audience are free to mingle without masks and social distancing, the backstage area still has to adhere to strict Covid rules. That means no dressing rooms and minimal crew, making it almost impossible to stage quick-turnaround performances of the scale we've become used to (many of the acts, I'm told, have had to put on their outfits in a nearby hotel, drive to the venue, then leave again as soon as they come off stage). \n\"I was mad Elton John wasn't here in person but otherwise it was brilliant,\" says Christy Black, who's come to see the show from Bow in London.\n\"Honestly, the emotion you feel when you hear live music is like no other. You can't get that from Spotify. You can't get that from YouTube. When you're around people and you're all enjoying it together, it can't get any better.\"\n\"It's nice to be back to normality,\" says Ashley Singh, a college worker from Stratford. \"I've missed live music massively. It's such an important part of our lives. \n\"To be back here was a real punctuation mark to the end of this pandemic. Next month, hopefully, things will go back to normal.\"\nThe majority of the audience are keyworkers, and every mention of their efforts during the Covid crisis receives an instant standing ovation.\nDua Lipa leads the charge, backing Dame Elizabeth Anionwu's campaign to give higher wages to nurses. Harry Styles, Rag 'n' Bone Man and Little Mix add their voices to the chorus, too. Even Taylor Swift, who normally lives in LA, praises the \"help and support we got from the NHS\" over the last year.\n\"To hear Taylor Swift say the words NHS just blew me away,\" says Gemma Fagan, an NHS dietician who specialises in intestinal failure. \"And Dua saying Boris should give us a pay rise? I couldn't cope.\"\n\"We worked so hard during the lockdown without time off,\" says Crystal Ihenachor, a physioptherapist from Leyton. \"Our annual leave was cancelled and some of us even lost our patients. So the fact that they thought of the keyworkers was amazing.\"\nIn the end, the actual awards are almost a sideshow - but it's worth noting that, for once, the Brits largely got it right.\nDua Lipa's intergalactic disco opus Future Nostalgia is the big winner, scooping album of the year. Billie Eilish is named best international female, confirming her position as the current queen of pop. Taylor Swift is named a global icon because, well, she is one.\nThe Weeknd, so mystifyingly snubbed at this year's Grammys, takes home best international male - and receives a eulogy from Michelle Obama. \"In a tough year, he's provided a light that's pretty blinding and given us all a reason to dance,\" she observes.\nMeanwhile, Little Mix correct a historic wrong by becoming the first girl band to win best British group. \nThey dedicate their win to all their overlooked predecessors - sending thousands of journalists to Wikipedia to check who beat the Spice Girls in 1997 (Manic Street Preachers, which isn't as bad as it could have been, given that Kula Shaker were also up for the prize).\nThe audience greet every twist and turn with uproarious applause, clearly giddy at being allowed to hear loud music again without the neighbours banging on the walls.\n\"I'm not going to lie: Prior to this event I was so nervous and anxious about coming out,\" says Shanelle Nwanebi, a marketer from London. \n\"But once we were in the arena, it just came naturally. It didn't feel like we'd been locked down for a whole year. The whole ambience and environment, I absolutely loved it.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Dua Lipa demanded a pay rise for NHS workers as she won two major awards at the Brits - the UK's first major in-person ceremony of the Covid era.\nAnd Little Mix called out sexism in the music industry after becoming the first all-female outfit to win best British group.\nThe other big winners on the night were J Hus, Harry Styles and Taylor Swift.\nThe test event at London's O2 Arena took place with a 4,000-strong audience and no social distancing or face masks.\nRappers Headie One and AJ Tracey used several verses of their performance to call out the demonisation of drill music and criticise the government, while highlighting the work done by footballer and free school meals campaigner Marcus Rashford.\nWhile the 2021 Brits were not on a leap year it was very much a Lipa year, as the singer won two of the three awards for which she was nominated.\nFuture Nostalgia, the best-selling album released last year in the UK, predictably won best album.\nBut it was after winning the best British female award, her first of the night, that the star called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to give nurses and NHS workers pay rises, as opposed to mere applause.\nThis year, each of the Brit award trophies came in two parts and Dua dedicated hers to British nurse Dame Elizabeth Anionwu - who she noted has spent \"a stellar nursing career fighting racial injustice\" and \"protecting frontline workers\".\n\"She has also said that there's a massive disparity between gratitude and respect for frontline workers,\" said the singer. \"Because it's very good to clap for them, but we need to pay them.\n\"So I think what we should do, is we should all give a massive, massive round of applause and give Boris a message that we all support a fair pay rise is for our frontline.\"\nThe audience, which was packed with key workers, gave her a standing ovation.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, environment secretary George Eustice responded to Dua Lipa's speech by stressing there was a \"difficult public finance environment\".\n\"There's been a pay freeze for most of the public sector and it's also important to recognise that in recent years that there have been some pay rises as well, particularly for nurses and the lower paid,\" he said.\n\"We can't always go as far as you'd like, but it's also the case that there's a pay review that's going on into the NHS,\" he continued.\nThe government recommended in March that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year, while many other public sector workers will have their pay frozen.\nBefore her double win, Dua Lipa had performed a medley of hits from her latest floor-filling record.\nIt was a visual love letter to her home city of London, complete with a Tube platform string quartet, Amy Winehouse-style beehive hair and a union jack skirt which evoked memories of Spice Girl Geri Halliwell's famous patriotic dress.\nThe night's big winner also shared her delight at seeing more women on both the stage and the winners' podium - several years after she called out the Brits for overlooking female artists.\nThis year, by contrast, women won four of the five mixed categories.\nOne such example, Little Mix dedicated their award to some of the great all-female bands who could and should have won in previous years.\n\"It's not easy, being a female in the UK pop industry,\" said Leigh-Anne Pinnock while accepting their award.\n\"We've seen white male dominance, misogyny and sexism, and a lack of diversity.\n\"We're proud that we've stuck together, surrounded ourselves with strong women and are now using our voices more than ever.\"\n\"The fact that a girl band has never won this award really does speak volumes,\" added bandmate Jade Thirlwall. \"So this award isn't just for us, it's for the Spice Girls, Sugababes, All Saints, Girls Aloud.\n\"All of the incredible female bands - this one's for you.\"\nSince the departure of Jesy Nelson, Little Mix are now a three-piece. Two of them - Pinnock and Perrie Edwards - have recently announced that they are pregnant.\nSpeaking to the BBC the day after Little Mix's speech, former Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts said: \"They absolutely deserved that award last night and it's long overdue. I feel very proud of the girls because obviously they've been going for 10 years and it's not too dissimilar from the story of Girls Aloud.\"\nShe told 5 Live's Nihal Arthanayake: \"We were nominated a good few times for that award but we never received it, it was always a male indie band that would be recognised.\"\nElsewhere, rapper J Hus was not on hand on the night to pick up his award for best male solo star.\nBut Harry Styles was - in typically well-tailored fashion, sporting a brown and white Gucci suit - to collect best British single for his ubiquitous hit Watermelon Sugar.\nIf last month's Oscars took place in tinsel town then the Brits was very much tonsil town, as spectators underwent Covid tests on their way into the event.\nThe event formed part the government's pilot scheme for reopening live events safely, which includes the forthcoming FA Cup Final.\nThe live audience of about 4,000 people was about one-fifth of the O2's capacity and more than half of the ticket-holders were key workers from Greater London and their guests.\nSeveral performances were pre-recorded including Coldplay's show opener from a pontoon on the River Thames, and another from best international male The Weeknd.\nAfter being introduced by Jackie Weaver - of local council Zoom meeting fame - Chris Martin and co played their new single Higher Power with a little help from some holograms and pyrotechnics.\nSir Elton John later appeared on tape too alongside Years & Years star Olly Alexander for a rendition of Pet Shop Boys track It's a Sin, title track of the latter's recent drama series.\nBefore the event, US pop star Taylor Swift - who best international group-winners Haim described as \"the most incredible human being\" - was announced as the first female winner of the global icon award.\nSwift, who normally resides in Los Angeles, was there in-person to accept it and also praised the \"help and support we got from the NHS\" over the past year.\nIn the only other award announced beforehand, young singer Griff was named as the winner of the rising star prize, and she demonstrated why with a career-making performance.\nPrevious winners of the award include Adele, who went on to win a host of more senior Brit Awards in the years that followed.\nAnother star in bloom, Arlo Parks, said it was \"a dream come true\" to win the breakthrough award and she sang - in front of a garden centre's worth of sunflowers - like she had been doing it forever.\nThe event finished with a collaboration between Rag 'n' Bone Man, a virtual Pink, and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust Choir.\nBefore teeing them up, comedian Jack Whitehall, hosting the awards for a fourth time, gave \"a massive big up to the key workers here tonight, and across the country\".\n\"We will never be able to thank you guys enough,\" he said.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A police and crime commissioner has defended his force after a report found it had again failed to record thousands of crimes. \nInspectors issued a \"cause for concern\" notice after finding Dyfed-Powys Police had documented just 87.6% of reported crime.\nThe force had previously been told to improve two-and-a-half years ago. \nBut Dafydd Llywelyn said he had been \"reassured\" that victims were being safeguarded despite the findings.\nInspectors estimate 4,400 crimes are not recorded, including around 2,400 violent crimes and domestic abuse. Similar findings were identified in 2018.\nMr Llywelyn, who was re-elected as Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for the force on Sunday, said he had been told by senior officers within the force that improvements had been made in that time.\n\"What's disappointing is that hasn't been borne out by the HMIC report,\" he said.\nHe claimed the inspectorate sampled about 600 incidents from a three-month period.\n\"From those there were between 60 and 70 crimes not recorded, that's unfortunate, and all crimes should be recorded, I fully accept that,\" Mr Llywelyn said.\n\"What we're talking about is the lack of recording of 'crimes within crimes' - where there is a multi-faceted crime incident, where numerous allegations are made.\"\nHe said of the 20 incidents involving domestic abuse, 15 had at least one crime recorded and victims were fully risk-assessed and safeguarded.\n\"I'm still concerned about the five that haven't been risk-assessed because that's my job as the commissioner, to be the victims' champion.\"\nCharlie Armstrong, of HMIC, said the full inspection report for Dyfed-Powys Police is due to be issued in the autumn, but they took the decision to issue a \"cause for concern\" now.\n\"We think there is a significant service failure in terms of the way the force is recording crime,\" she said.\n\"However, we wouldn't want to say that without acknowledging the force has taken steps to improve many areas of it's performance around crime recording.\n\"We are confident that the chief constable and her team already understand some of those gaps and are working to address those.\"\nShe added: \"When it has recorded the crime, it conducts effective investigations in the majority of cases.\" \nBBC Wales asked to speak with the acting Chief Constable, Claire Parmenter, but the request was declined.\nIn a statement on behalf of the chief constable, the force said: \"We accept the concerns and recommendations published by HMICFRS in respect of crime data integrity. \n\"As an organisation, we are firmly committed to supporting victims and putting them at the heart of everything we do. The force has plans in place to improve its crime recording and I am determined we will get this right.\n\"Since the date of this inspection, we are already seeing improvements as a result of the swift additional action we have taken, achieving 100% crime recording compliance in respect of anti-social behaviour for February and March 2021 which is positive.\""

      "text": "The UK economy shrank by 1.5% in the first three months of 2021, but gathered speed in March as lockdown restrictions began to ease, official figures show. \nThe reopening of schools and strong retail spending helped the economy grow 2.1% in March, its fastest monthly growth since last August.\nBut the economy is still 8.7% smaller than it was before the pandemic.\nHowever, March marked a possible turning point, economists suggested.\nTej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, predicted the UK economy was now on course for a bumper bounce-back this year.\n\"The first quarter should mark the low point for the economy in 2021,\" said Mr Parikh. \"The lockdown, and added costs of navigating new trading terms with the EU, limited many businesses' trading activities at the start of the year.\"\nThe UK economy suffered a  record annual slump in 2020 as coronavirus restrictions hit output and 2021 started off equally downbeat.\nThe reintroduction of restrictions in January led to a fall in business investment and household consumption expenditure, according to the ONS.\nHowever, schools reopening on 8 March triggered an uplift in retail sales and sectors such as construction and manufacturing remained resilient, growing strongly in March. \nBusinesses also continued to adapt and make themselves Covid secure.\nThe vaccine rollout, the extension of support measures at the Budget, and the roadmap to reopen the economy have led to expectations that the UK economy will rebound strongly this year.\nBut there are concerns about long term damage. \nSuren\u202fThiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"The first quarter decline should be followed by a robust rebound in the second quarter as the effects of the release of pent-up demand, as restrictions ease and the strong vaccine rollout, are fully felt. \n\"However, with the longer-term economic damage caused by coronavirus likely to increasingly weigh on activity as government support winds down, the recovery may be slower than many, including the Bank of England, currently predict.\"\u202f \nAlpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, said that households and businesses have adapted better to working and living under Covid restrictions \"despite the brutal cost of doing so\".\nBut Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Samuel Tombs pointed out that the UK's economic growth was still the slowest of the Group of Seven (G7) rich countries, for the fourth quarter in a row.\nGDP looks on course to grow by 5% between April and June \"which should mean that the UK finally hands over the wooden spoon to another G7 economy\", he added.\nOn Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the the BBC the economy was \"getting back on track\".\n\"Despite a difficult start to this year, economic growth in March is a promising sign of things to come,\" he added.\nEarlier this month, the Bank of England said it expected the UK economy to enjoy its fastest growth in more than 70 years this year, as restrictions are lifted.\nBut it cut its forecast for 2022 from 7.25% to 5.75%, suggesting the government was likely to raise taxes to pay for its huge pandemic-support programmes. \nOfficial trade figures, published at the same time as growth figures, showed a shift away from trading with EU countries since Brexit.\n\"Imports from Europe remained sluggish in the first three months of the year, being outstripped by non-EU imports for the first time on record,\" said ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan.\nNew Brexit trading rules between the EU and the UK came into effect at the beginning of January.\nIn the January to March quarter, the UK's exports to the EU fell 18.1% to \u00a332.2bn, while exports to non-EU countries rose by 0.4% to \u00a341.1bn, compared with the previous quarter.\nThe value of imports from the EU fell by 21.7% to \u00a350.6bn, and imports from non-EU countries fell by 0.9% to \u00a353.2bn.\nThe ONS said the UK's total trade deficit, excluding precious metals, narrowed by \u00a38.4bn to \u00a31.4bn.\nMr Sunak told the BBC the government has invested \"hundreds of millions of pounds to help businesses adjust to those new trading arrangements and support them in the process\".\n\"We've always said there will be a period of adjustment and that's what you're seeing,\" he added.\nIn ordinary times a 1.5% quarterly hit would be considered a considerable economic fall. In context of a further national shutdown, it shows some resilience in the UK economy. \nBusinesses, particularly manufacturing and construction, were beginning to work out how to cope with pandemic restrictions. The good news is that by the end of the quarter the rebound was starting.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is not getting carried away with euphoria about the fastest growth in decades. The Treasury is well aware that this is mostly the arithmetic consequence of the bounce back from a sharp hit in 2020. \nThe ONS showed that the economic hole in the UK caused by the pandemic still does not compare favourably with other major economies, with the US, for example, having recovered all lost output. \nMr Sunak points to the much better than expected unemployment figures as the result of the furlough scheme. There is still uncertainty about how the global economy will respond to new waves of the pandemic. The chancellor is not changing the plan for tax rises on business. "

      "text": "Up to six people from different households will be able to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales from Monday.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed indoor hospitality can reopen from 17 May as Wales' Covid case rate continues to fall.\nExtra cash support for hospitality businesses still affected by Covid restrictions has also been announced.\nMr Drakeford said the funding would \"support firms and safeguard jobs\".\nThe support is available to businesses such as pubs, clubs, restaurants and late-night entertainment venues.  \nThey can claim up to \u00a325,000 to help them through to the end of June, as they prepare for re-opening and more normal trading conditions.\nThe news comes after calls from some in the hospitality industry for all significant restrictions on trading to be lifted before July.\nIn England pubs will also open indoors on Monday, with people from different households or not in a bubble having to stay one metre apart.\nWhen they reopen in Wales, six people from any households will be able to meet, but those who do not live together, or who are not in bubbles, will have to socially distance, with the rule being two metres apart.\nNumbers have been increased from the four people set out in the Welsh government's lockdown easing plan.\nBBC Wales understands this was changed to make it easier to enforce, bringing it into line with beer garden rules, and indoor meeting drinking rules in England.\nSarah John, of Boss Brewery in Swansea, said while she was \"breathing a sigh of relief\" to reopen indoors, many small pubs would not be able to reopen unless the two-metre rule was reconsidered.\n\"Capacity-wise you can get a lot fewer people in, for some small venues it might not be feasible... ideally we would have liked to have seen that taken down to one metre as well,\" she said.\nMs John said she hoped the Welsh government would reduce social distancing at the next lockdown briefing on Friday, and the industry needed clarity for the future.\n\"The back and forth has been difficult... it's very important to be on the home straight, we want to see some commitment from Mark Drakeford on when we will be totally restriction free,\" she said.\nPaul Slater, landlord of the Trotting Mare Inn in Overton-on-Dee, which is right on the Welsh-English border said he was delighted to open indoors, after two weeks of \"hit and miss weather\" with customers sitting outside with hot water bottles and blankets.\nHe said the two-metre social distancing rule would mean numbers able to sit indoors would halve from 72, and would be a \"balancing act\".\n\"In the week it won't make too much of a difference, but at weekends we are going to be very limited... We have a lot of drinkers at a weekend, so it's a balancing act between reserving tables for drinkers or people eating,\" he told Radio Wales Breakfast.\nAt the Cross Keys in Penrhynside, near Llandudno, Conwy county, landlords Robin Fitzpatrick and Sabine L\u00f6eber said they had concerns people's habits might have changed during lockdown.\nThey said people may have saved money while being unable to go out, and want to spend money in their homes, and it may led to a \"slow recovery\".\nDue to social-distancing measures, the pub had temporarily got rid of its pool table to sit more people inside, but they said even then numbers would be reduced by a third.\nHowever the couple said they had not considered staying closed.\n\"We are a community pub, so long as we break even and provide a service...we are doing what we are passionate about,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said.\nAmy Wilson, who runs her grandfather's business Elmers Cafe, on Crwys Road in Cardiff, said they would be sticking to four people per table indoors because the cafe did not have a large area.\n\"If there are six people then we'll encourage them to sit outside,\" she said.\n\"Our customer base includes students, builders and older local people. We have a 91-year-old regular called Bryn. He comes in every day and has a tea and toast.\n\"But it's been so sad seeing him having a takeaway and eating outside, sometimes even in the rain. We put a little chair out there for him. It'll be nice to have him coming back inside.\"\nAfter being closed since 18 December, Marco Orsi said he was looking forward to reopening his caf\u00e9 in Pontypridd and said he hoped people would be \"queueing out the door\".\nHe said that he believed cafes should have been allowed to open indoors weeks ago, when non-essential shops pulled up their shutters.\n\"What we will be opening up to is a slight question mark...with the town centres, but I am confident, in due course, that things will get back to normal,\" he said.\nHe added he believed it was customers' own responsibility to social distance and business owners should not be made to police it.\n\"People should know how to behave now, if they don't I'm not going to educate them, we will keep social distancing, but I don't expect to police it myself,\" he said.\nSophia Joannides, Owner of Bluebell Coffee and Kitchen in Tyc\u00f4ch, Swansea, said she was excited to see all her regulars again, some who had not visited for over a year due to having to shield.\n\"Outside dining hasn't really worked for us due to our lovely Welsh weather, we are lucky we have quite a bit of space inside Bluebell, but we are still working on a very reduced capacity,\" she said.\n\"Our customers are the most loyal and supportive, so we know the next few weeks will be great.\"\nSupply chain firms, events and conference venues not covered by the Welsh government's Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF) can also apply for support.\nMr Drakeford said the cash announced was part of a \u00a3200m package earmarked for the incoming Welsh government to help businesses affected by the pandemic.\n\"We know the restrictions have helped to keep us all safe but they have had a big impact on Welsh businesses, which is why we are making more funding available to support firms and safeguard jobs,\" he said.\nAs leader of Welsh Labour, Mr Drakeford had faced criticism during the Senedd election campaign for not announcing the extra financial support for the hospitality sector. \nAt the time, he said \"election rules\" prevented him from releasing the cash - and the move did not apparently harm Labour's chances of being re-elected last week. \nHospitality businesses which can apply for this funding include pubs, clubs, restaurants, nightclubs, late night entertainment venues, supply chain firms, events and conference venues not covered by the Welsh government's Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF).\nThe government said an \"eligibility checker\" would open on the Business Wales website at midday on 17 May so businesses can find out how much support they are likely to be entitled to and how to apply.\nMr Drakeford added: \"The public health situation continues to improve in Wales - we have the lowest coronavirus rates and the best vaccination rates in the UK.\"\nThe relaxation is the latest development in the Welsh government's route out of the lockdown imposed last year to contain the spread of coronavirus.\nGyms, swimming pools and community centres have already reopened while cinemas, theatres and museums are also due to reopen from 17 May, though with strict social-distancing rules still in place.\nThe news came as only six Welsh council areas reported deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest week of figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nDeaths overall were also below normal levels for a ninth week in succession.\nThe number of deaths where Covid was mentioned on death certificates dropped to seven in the week ending 30 April - half the previous week's total and the lowest for more than seven months.\nThese accounted for 1.2% of all registered deaths in Wales.\nIt is a further indication of the retreat of Covid, which has resulted in low case numbers and falling hospital cases.\nThe trend has been for a steady decline in deaths and the weekly total is 93% fewer than registered two months ago."

      "text": "Up to six people from different households will be able to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales from Monday.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed indoor hospitality can reopen from 17 May as Wales' Covid case rate continues to fall.\nExtra cash support for hospitality businesses still affected by Covid restrictions has also been announced.\nMr Drakeford said the funding would \"support firms and safeguard jobs\".\nThe support is available to businesses such as pubs, clubs, restaurants and late-night entertainment venues.  \nThey can claim up to \u00a325,000 to help them through to the end of June, as they prepare for re-opening and more normal trading conditions.\nThe news comes after calls from some in the hospitality industry for all significant restrictions on trading to be lifted before July.\nIn England pubs will also open indoors on Monday, with people from different households or not in a bubble having to stay one metre apart.\nWhen they reopen in Wales, six people from any households will be able to meet, but those who do not live together, or who are not in bubbles, will have to socially distance, with the rule being two metres apart.\nNumbers have been increased from the four people set out in the Welsh government's lockdown easing plan.\nBBC Wales understands this was changed to make it easier to enforce, bringing it into line with beer garden rules, and indoor meeting drinking rules in England.\nSarah John, of Boss Brewery in Swansea, said while she was \"breathing a sigh of relief\" to reopen indoors, many small pubs would not be able to reopen unless the two-metre rule was reconsidered.\n\"Capacity-wise you can get a lot fewer people in, for some small venues it might not be feasible... ideally we would have liked to have seen that taken down to one metre as well,\" she said.\nMs John said she hoped the Welsh government would reduce social distancing at the next lockdown briefing on Friday, and the industry needed clarity for the future.\n\"The back and forth has been difficult... it's very important to be on the home straight, we want to see some commitment from Mark Drakeford on when we will be totally restriction free,\" she said.\nPaul Slater, landlord of the Trotting Mare Inn in Overton-on-Dee, which is right on the Welsh-English border said he was delighted to open indoors, after two weeks of \"hit and miss weather\" with customers sitting outside with hot water bottles and blankets.\nHe said the two-metre social distancing rule would mean numbers able to sit indoors would halve from 72, and would be a \"balancing act\".\n\"In the week it won't make too much of a difference, but at weekends we are going to be very limited... We have a lot of drinkers at a weekend, so it's a balancing act between reserving tables for drinkers or people eating,\" he told Radio Wales Breakfast.\nAt the Cross Keys in Penrhynside, near Llandudno, Conwy county, landlords Robin Fitzpatrick and Sabine L\u00f6eber said they had concerns people's habits might have changed during lockdown.\nThey said people may have saved money while being unable to go out, and want to spend money in their homes, and it may led to a \"slow recovery\".\nDue to social-distancing measures, the pub had temporarily got rid of its pool table to sit more people inside, but they said even then numbers would be reduced by a third.\nHowever the couple said they had not considered staying closed.\n\"We are a community pub, so long as we break even and provide a service...we are doing what we are passionate about,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said.\nAmy Wilson, who runs her grandfather's business Elmers Cafe, on Crwys Road in Cardiff, said they would be sticking to four people per table indoors because the cafe did not have a large area.\n\"If there are six people then we'll encourage them to sit outside,\" she said.\n\"Our customer base includes students, builders and older local people. We have a 91-year-old regular called Bryn. He comes in every day and has a tea and toast.\n\"But it's been so sad seeing him having a takeaway and eating outside, sometimes even in the rain. We put a little chair out there for him. It'll be nice to have him coming back inside.\"\nAfter being closed since 18 December, Marco Orsi said he was looking forward to reopening his caf\u00e9 in Pontypridd and said he hoped people would be \"queueing out the door\".\nHe said that he believed cafes should have been allowed to open indoors weeks ago, when non-essential shops pulled up their shutters.\n\"What we will be opening up to is a slight question mark...with the town centres, but I am confident, in due course, that things will get back to normal,\" he said.\nHe added he believed it was customers' own responsibility to social distance and business owners should not be made to police it.\n\"People should know how to behave now, if they don't I'm not going to educate them, we will keep social distancing, but I don't expect to police it myself,\" he said.\nSophia Joannides, Owner of Bluebell Coffee and Kitchen in Tyc\u00f4ch, Swansea, said she was excited to see all her regulars again, some who had not visited for over a year due to having to shield.\n\"Outside dining hasn't really worked for us due to our lovely Welsh weather, we are lucky we have quite a bit of space inside Bluebell, but we are still working on a very reduced capacity,\" she said.\n\"Our customers are the most loyal and supportive, so we know the next few weeks will be great.\"\nSupply chain firms, events and conference venues not covered by the Welsh government's Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF) can also apply for support.\nMr Drakeford said the cash announced was part of a \u00a3200m package earmarked for the incoming Welsh government to help businesses affected by the pandemic.\n\"We know the restrictions have helped to keep us all safe but they have had a big impact on Welsh businesses, which is why we are making more funding available to support firms and safeguard jobs,\" he said.\nAs leader of Welsh Labour, Mr Drakeford had faced criticism during the Senedd election campaign for not announcing the extra financial support for the hospitality sector. \nAt the time, he said \"election rules\" prevented him from releasing the cash - and the move did not apparently harm Labour's chances of being re-elected last week. \nHospitality businesses which can apply for this funding include pubs, clubs, restaurants, nightclubs, late night entertainment venues, supply chain firms, events and conference venues not covered by the Welsh government's Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF).\nThe government said an \"eligibility checker\" would open on the Business Wales website at midday on 17 May so businesses can find out how much support they are likely to be entitled to and how to apply.\nMr Drakeford added: \"The public health situation continues to improve in Wales - we have the lowest coronavirus rates and the best vaccination rates in the UK.\"\nThe relaxation is the latest development in the Welsh government's route out of the lockdown imposed last year to contain the spread of coronavirus.\nGyms, swimming pools and community centres have already reopened while cinemas, theatres and museums are also due to reopen from 17 May, though with strict social-distancing rules still in place.\nThe news came as only six Welsh council areas reported deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest week of figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nDeaths overall were also below normal levels for a ninth week in succession.\nThe number of deaths where Covid was mentioned on death certificates dropped to seven in the week ending 30 April - half the previous week's total and the lowest for more than seven months.\nThese accounted for 1.2% of all registered deaths in Wales.\nIt is a further indication of the retreat of Covid, which has resulted in low case numbers and falling hospital cases.\nThe trend has been for a steady decline in deaths and the weekly total is 93% fewer than registered two months ago."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Glasgow,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Concern is growing about a rising number of Covid cases in Glasgow as the area prepares to move down to level two.\nThe latest published case rate is 58.3 per 100,000 population - well above a key threshold for easing restrictions.\nA senior health official said there were clusters of high infection rates in parts of the city.\nThe so-called India variant is suspected to be involved, although this has yet to be confirmed.\nAll mainland council areas with the likely exception of Moray are due to move to level two on Monday. \nAttention has been focused on a surge in cases in Moray although this increase appears now to be slowing.  \nMoray's latest rate stands at 100.2 per 100,000 population, almost five times the Scotland-wide average, according to Public Health Scotland (PHS).\nGlasgow, however, has also seen a steady rise, and is now above 50 cases per 100,000 population -  one of the benchmarks for deciding if level two or level three restrictions are appropriate. Other factors taken into account include the ability of the local NHS to cope. \nScotland's clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, told BBC Scotland's The Seven that the case rate in Glasgow has been rising for the last five or six days. \nHe said he was concerned but he was confident Glasgow would still be able to move to level two as hospital admissions, intensive care and mortality remained low. \n\"The doesn't mean I'm complacent,\" he said. \"In fact I want to encourage people to follow the rules tonight, tonight over the weekend, into Monday and then the new rules on Monday. \n\"And any suggestion that people should gather in groups, or march or parade or anything that breaks rules - please don't do that because Glasgow is at a fragile moment.\"\nLinda de Caestecker, director of public health at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said she \"anticipated\" that Glasgow would still move to the lower level. \nBut she said officials were carefully monitoring case rates in particular districts such as Pollokshields and Battlefield in the south of the city.\nWhile the figures published by Public Health Scotland relate to three days ago, she told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime the most recent data was indicating a city-wide rate of 74 cases per 100,000.\nAsked what was driving the increase, she told BBC Scotland: \"It seems particularly to be household mixing. \n\"We know that restrictions are going to be lifted in a few days' time and I do understand people thinking if we can do it on Monday, why can't we do it now. But it is people mixing together in households that we think is the source of this increase.\"\nMs Caestecker said some upturn in case numbers was to be expected as restrictions eased, but she was \"concerned\" about the increase in Glasgow.\n\"It shows we cannot be complacent. The numbers go up very, very quickly - particularly as we see new variants coming in that are more transmissible,\" she said.\nA proportion of the cases in Glasgow are suspected to involve the Indian variant though this has still be confirmed through genomic sequencing.\n\"What we know is that it's not the Kent variant, so the assumption is it's the Indian variant but we haven't got the sequencing yet so we can't be sure,\" she said.\nNicola Sturgeon announced on Tuesday that all mainland council areas would move to level two next week, with the exception of Moray where a final decision on whether it should remain in level three is to be made on Friday. \nLevel two rules mean people can meet up inside homes, pubs and restaurants can sell alcohol indoors and venues such as cinemas can reopen.\nThe previous major relaxation of Covid restrictions was on 26 April when non-essential shops and hospitality businesses reopened.\nThe impact of the easing of restrictions tends to show up in the figures about a fortnight later because of the incubation period of Covid-19 which is five to six days on average but can be as long as 14.\nClackmannanshire has also seen rising Covid rates recently, currently just below the 50 case threshold, with provisional data from PHS indicating the figure will rise further in the coming days. \nMidlothian, currently with 36 cases per 100,000, is another local authority area where case rates appear to be on the rise.

      "title": "Covid: Will UK vaccine success keep virus at bay?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Next week will see the most significant lifting of restrictions yet in England, with indoor mixing to be allowed. The rest of the UK is making similar steps.\nIt means the onus is increasingly shifting on to the vaccines, rather than social distancing and restrictions, to keep the virus at bay. How well do they work? And is there now enough immunity in the population to protect us all?\nThe UK has benefited from both fast rollout and good uptake. Currently, a third of the adult population is fully vaccinated, with another third having had one dose.\nAmong those at most risk - the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions, where 99% of Covid deaths have occurred - uptake for the first dose has been 95%.\nSome describe that as being only partially vaccinated. But that can underplay the significance of that first dose, which provides most of the protection - the second acts to boost immunity and is important for long-lasting protection.\nThe latest government data - based on evidence from the rollout - suggests one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine cuts the risk of infection by as much as 70% and death by even more.\nData on their effectiveness after two doses is only just emerging - but, as expected, it suggests this level of protection is boosted even further. For Pfizer, which was rolled out first, the risk of death is reduced by 97%.\nWhat is more, those that are vaccinated but do become infected are thought to be about half as likely to pass the virus on.\nThe vaccines are working about as well as could be hoped in the real world - and confirm what the trial results always suggested.\nIn fact, the impact is so good it raises the prospect of the UK reaching the herd-immunity threshold, meaning the virus is unlikely to spread because so few people can catch it.\nSir John Bell, a member of the government's vaccine taskforce, believes we may indeed be at a \"tipping point\".\nBut it is a complex equation influenced by other factors. The amount of natural immunity from people who have had Covid already will play a role.\nData from April published by the Office for National Statistics indicated nearly seven out of every 10 adults had Covid antibodies - above what could be explained by vaccination alone.\nAnother factor is how the public reacts. Even if the government lifts restrictions completely in June, as it has suggested, it is unclear how quickly \"normal\" behaviour will return.\nWhat is clear is the amount of virus circulating is very low and has continued to fall even as the first steps out of lockdown have been made.\nWhether this will be enough to stop infections rising in the coming months remains to be seen.\nScientists had always warned the easing in England, Scotland and Wales on Monday, 17 May, was the one that could push numbers up the most, given the virus is most likely to be passed on indoors.\nBut there is good reason to hope the vaccines will be enough to stop that pretty much on their own, says Dr Adam Kucharski, an expert in infectious diseases, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\"It is possible we will get to a situation where [infection rates won't rise] without the need for many other measures,\" he says.\n\"The vaccines are working that well that domestically we can gradually relax restrictions and enjoy the summer.\"\nThe big unknown, Dr Kucharski says, is the variants. Those identified in Brazil, South Africa and India appear to be able to evade some of the immune response from the vaccines.\nBut much of this is based on testing in labs rather than evidence from the real world, which makes it hard to interpret, as it largely focuses on one element of the immune response - antibodies.\n\"The data is very patchy. That makes it difficult knowing with certainty what will happen next.\"\nThe \"most likely scenario\", he says, is vaccines lose some ability to stop infections - but provide protection against serious disease.\nEmerging real-world evidence suggests this is the case. A study in Qatar indicated the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine remained as effective at preventing serious illness and lost only a little of its ability to block infections - and that was against the South Africa variant scientists are most concerned about.\nBut the lack of certainty makes some uneasy. University College London clinical research director Prof Christina Pagel, a member of the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, wants the UK to proceed with more caution, not releasing restrictions fully until all adults have received their second dose, which is not expected before the end of September. \nShe is calling for an Australia-style closure of borders to reduce the risk of variants being imported. \"I just don't think it is worth the risk,\" she says. \nBut, as always with Covid, the argument returns to what is proportionate. There is a theoretical risk the virus could mutate enough to undermine the vaccines so there is a surge in serious cases. \nBut what is the likelihood of that happening all of a sudden as opposed to a gradual shift over years that is more common with coronaviruses and will allow vaccines to be updated to keep up with the virus?\nProf Neil Ferguson, an expert in infectious disease, from Imperial College London, whose modelling led to the first lockdown, says it is the worst-case scenario and unlikely. And the UK is \"much more likely to be on a steady course\" out of the pandemic.\nDr Muge Cevik, from St Andrews University, agrees. Having researched the variants, she says we should take confidence from the emerging picture, with the evidence \"strongly pointing\" to the vaccines continuing to work really well, at least in terms of preventing serious illness and death. \nAt worst, there will be some continued low-level spread - but the vaccine programme's success means that is now less likely to translate into significant numbers of serious cases. \n\"We are in a really good position,\" Dr Cevik says. \"We are de-risking Covid.\""

The proportion reached 36% before Christmas.\nThree people were being treated on invasive ventilated beds, including in critical care, for confirmed or suspected coronavirus on Tuesday. Last week saw the number drop to a record low of two. This is 97% fewer Covid patients than in mid-January.\nCardiff and Vale health board had two critical care Covid patients and there was one in Aneurin Bevan health board but there were none elsewhere. \nOn 11 May, admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases were running at a daily seven-day average of 14. This is just above last month's record low of 13.\nThere were 13 confirmed and suspected Covid patients admitted on Tuesday - Covid admissions now make up 1.2% of all hospital admissions."

      "text": "A ceasefire was agreed on 21 May between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. \nIt came after 11 days of fighting, which left at least 255 people dead. Most of those killed were Palestinians in the territory of Gaza.\nIsrael and Hamas both claimed victory in the latest conflict. \nThe violence in May followed a month of rising tensions in Jerusalem. But the fighting has gone on for decades.\nBritain took control of the area known as Palestine after the ruler of that part of the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in World War One. \nThe land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority. \nTensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave Britain the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. \nFor Jews it was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe and seeking a homeland after the Holocaust of World War Two.\nViolence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also grew.\nIn 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. \nThat plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.\nIn 1948, unable to solve the problem, British rulers left and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the state of Israel.\nMany Palestinians objected and a war followed. Troops from neighbouring Arab countries invaded.\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\".\nBy the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. \nJordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. \nJerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.\nBecause there was never a peace agreement - with each side blaming the other - there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.\nIn another war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.\nMost Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\nNeither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.\nIsrael still occupies the West Bank, and although it pulled out of Gaza the UN still regards that piece of land as occupied territory. \nIsrael claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.\nIn the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in these areas, where more than 600,000 Jews now live.\nPalestinians say these are illegal under international law and are obstacles to peace, but Israel denies this.\nTensions are often high between Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. \nGaza is ruled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has fought Israel many times. Israel and Egypt tightly control Gaza's borders to stop weapons getting to Hamas. \nPalestinians in Gaza and the West Bank say they are suffering because of Israeli actions and restrictions. Israel says it is only acting to protect itself from Palestinian violence.\nThe threatened eviction of some Palestinian families in East Jerusalem has also caused rising anger.\nThere are a number of issues which Israel and the Palestinians cannot agree on. \nThese include: what should happen to Palestinian refugees; whether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removed; whether the two sides should share Jerusalem; and - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside Israel. \nPeace talks have been taking place on and off for more than 25 years, but so far have not solved the conflict.\nIn short, the situation isn't going to be sorted out any time soon.\nThe most recent peace plan, prepared by the United States when Donald Trump was president, was called \"the deal of the century\" by Israel's then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But it was been dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.\nAny future peace deal will need both sides to agree to resolve complex issues.\nThe BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, says the latest round of violence in May was the fourth big war between Hamas and Israel since 2008.\nHe's seen previous wars end like this before: \"Similar things have been said by both sides in claiming victory and then essentially the seeds of the next conflict are sown.\n\"I can tell you one thing for certain - that if the status quo does not change favourably, there will be another round of this.\"\nCorrection 21st June 2021: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the US as recognising Israel's claim to the whole of Jerusalem and this has been amended to instead explain that the US recognises the city as Israel's capital.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "The Troubles,Ballymurphy inquest",
      "text": "Ten people killed in west Belfast almost 50 years ago in the wake of an Army operation were \"entirely innocent\", an inquest has found.\nThe inquest, which began in November 2018, examined the deaths in and around the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast in August 1971. \nThe shootings happened after an operation in which paramilitary suspects were detained without trial.\nVictims included a priest trying to help the wounded and a mother of eight.\nNine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said. \nThe coroner could not definitively say who shot the tenth victim, John McKerr.\nMrs Justice Keegan, who delivered her findings over the course of more than two hours, said the deaths took place during Northern Ireland's Troubles in a \"highly charged and difficult environment\".\nThe killings happened over three days immediately following the introduction of internment - the arrest and detention of paramilitary suspects without trial.\nShe noted that during that time there was widespread disorder. \nAcross Belfast alone on 9 and 10 August 1971, it was recorded that there were approximately 12 explosions, 59 shooting incidents, 17 reported deaths, 25 reported injuries, 13 incidents of rioting, 18 reports of arson and other reports of civil disorder of various kinds.\nBut Mrs Justice Keegan concluded, to a round of applause: \"What is very clear, is that all of the deceased in the series of inquests were entirely innocent of any wrongdoing on the day in question.\"\nEileen McKeown, daughter of victim Joseph Corr, said her family was \"delighted\" with the findings and added that now the \"world knows that they are innocent\".\nA UK government spokesperson said it would now \"take the time to review the report and carefully consider the conclusions\".\nMrs Justice Keegan said the effects of the killings on the families of the 10 victims had been \"stark\". \nInquests were held into the deaths in 1972, but they were separate and returned open verdicts. \nThe new inquests, which began in November 2018, have been held together.\nThe court heard almost 100 days of evidence from more than 150 witnesses. \nThese included more than 60 former soldiers, more than 30 civilians and experts in ballistics, pathology and engineering. \nFather Hugh Mullan, 38 and Francis Quinn, 19\nThe coroner found both men were shot by the Army on 9 August 1971, although neither was armed.  \nShe said there was no evidence Mr Quinn had a gun or was in close proximity to someone who had a gun. \nShe said she was quite convinced Fr Mullan was a \"peace-maker\" and that he was carrying a white object at the time that he was shot. \n\"He had made representations to the Army earlier about the issues that were pertaining in the community. Letters sent by the military after his death provided an indication of the esteem in which he was held,\" the coroner found. \nMrs Justice Keegan said there was enough evidence both men were trying to render help to someone injured at the time.\nShe concluded, in the case of both men, that \"the use of force was clearly disproportionate\".\nPat Quinn, the brother of Francis Quinn, later said it was a great day for the families, \"but it's also a bittersweet day\".\nJoan Connolly, 44; Daniel Teggart, 44; Noel Phillips, 19; Joseph Murphy, 41\nMrs Justice Keegan found there was \"no doubt\" the four were shot by the Army in August 1971.\nShe acknowledged the Army was coming under fire from gunmen in the area at the time, but she concluded the use of force against the deceased was \"clearly disproportionate\".\nShe said they were innocent, unarmed and were \"posing no risk.\"\nThe coroner said it was clear the environment was difficult at the time, with many people, including children, out on the streets but she said the state had failed to establish that the shootings were justified.\n\"The four deceased were unarmed and were not acting in any way of threat. No arms were found on or near the deceased and there was no evidence of gunshot residue that satisfied evidential standards,\" Mrs Justice Keegan said. \n\"None of the deceased were claimed as members of the IRA, none had military trappings at their funerals and their death notices highlighted no association.\"\nRuling on a claim by a soldier that 33 rounds of ammunition were found in a pocket on clothes worn by Mr Teggart, she said if this was the case it was \"quite an amount of ammunition\" yet it was not mentioned by other soldiers.\nShe concluded she was not satisfied that \"this fact is proven.\"\nThe coroner said there was some IRA activity in the area, and she was satisfied the military were justified in using force. \n\"There was, however, no justification provided by the Army for the shootings of the four deceased,\" she added. \nLater, Briege Voyle, Ms Connolly's daughter, said the Army told a lie 50 years ago and the UK government covered up that lie.\n\"The coroner's findings are clear she was innocent,\" she said. \nJanet Donnelly, the daughter of Joseph Murphy, said that for 50 years her family had lived with the knowledge that her father was \"an innocent civilian murdered by British paratroopers\".\nJohn Teggart, son of Daniel Teggart, said: \"I want to speak directly to the people of Britain at this moment. Can you imagine what would happen if the British soldiers murdered 10 unarmed civilians on the streets of London, Liverpool or Birmingham?\n\"What would you expect, an investigation? Would you expect justice? Or would you be happy for them to get an amnesty?\"\nEdward Doherty, 31\nMrs Justice Keegan said Mr Doherty was an innocent man when he was shot, who posed no threat. She said he was on the street and had come across events on his way home. \nShe said he was not linked with the IRA and there was was no sign of petrol or explosives on his body. \n\"He was not a petrol bomber and he was not acting in any other way that would justify a violent attack on him,\" the coroner said.  \n\"Mr Doherty was not associated with any terrorist group. He was an innocent victim of the situation.\"\nShe said a British soldier, known as M3, fired in response to a petrol bomber, but the \"firing of his weapon was disproportionate to the risk posed to him\".\n\"Unfortunately, Mr Doherty was caught up in what happened in this incident and he lost his life as a result,\" Mrs Justice Keegan said. \nLater on Tuesday, Mr Doherty's sister, Kathleen, said she was \"elated that my brother's name is eventually cleared\".\n\"He was a good man and he was a humble man,\" she told the BBC's Evening Extra programme.\nJoseph Corr, 43, and John Laverty, 20\nMrs Justice Keegan found that on the balance of probability, both men were shot by the Army. \nShe said it was wrong to describe the two men as gunmen and that rumour should be dispelled. \nShe also said the Royal Military Police investigation of the killings at the time was inadequate.\n\"There was no adequate investigation by the Royal Military Police. The Coroner found that both men were shot in the back when either crouching, crawling or prone,\" the coroner's verdict stated.  \n\"There was no evidence that the deceased were armed or acting in a manner that could be perceived as posing a threat.\"\nCarmel Quinn, Mr Laverty's sister, later said \"no-one cared\" about her brother's death.\n\"He was my big brother and we would never give up fighting for him,\" she said. \nEileen McKeown, Mr Corr's daughter, said her family was \"delighted\" with the rulings and that the \"world knows that they [the victims] are innocent\".\nJohn McKerr, 49\nMrs Justice Keegan said Mr McKerr was an innocent man who was not acting in any suspicious way when he was shot. She said he was \"indiscriminately shot on the street\".\nShe said he had \"no association with the IRA\" and that his family could now know that any claim to the contrary could be allayed \"once and for all.\"\nShe said he may have been shot by a stray bullet but it was not possible for her to say where any shot may have come from. \nShe said the evidence was not clear or consistent in this case and there was no direct evidence as to who fired the fatal shot. \n\"The military were in the area at the time, but that did not equate to responsibility for the death. As a result of weaknesses in the evidence and the limitations of the original investigation, it was impossible to say where exactly any shot came from,\" the coroner found. \nThe coroner described the \"inadequacy of the original investigation as shocking\".\n\"Not one statement was taken from the military in the area, the scene was not sealed and the bullet was not recovered.\n\"It is in itself a serious indictment of the state's failure to properly investigate the death of an innnocent civilian,\" she said. \nREAD MORE: Who were the victims?\nConcluding her remarks after more than two hours, Mrs Justice Keegan said she wanted to acknowledge the families of the victims and said it must be a difficult occasion of remembrance.\nShe added: \"I do express the hope that some peace may now be achieved now that these findings of the inquest have been delivered.\"\nCatherine Morrison, BBC News NI\nAfter the findings were delivered, the families of the victims streamed out of the makeshift courtroom at the Waterfront conference centre in Belfast wreathed in smiles. \nHugging each other, some crying with relief and with joy, they spoke of their delight at the coroner's findings: the names of their loved ones finally cleared after 50 years.\nPat Quinn, whose brother Frank was shot dead during one incident on 9 August 1971, said he shed tears for the first time in many years.\nOthers remembered family members who have since died and were not here for today's ruling.\nThere were cheers as relatives left and had their photographs taken by the waiting press in the bright sunshine.\nIt's been a hugely significant day for these families.\nMrs Justice Keegan said often, during the hearings, that she wanted to hear evidence that would help her understand what had happened.\nShe has had to decide the circumstances of how each person died on the balance of probability.\nShe has also had to determine who was there, where the shooting came from, who she thought fired the fatal shot, and the circumstances in which those shots came to be fired. \nOther information or witnesses were missing.\nOne person, known as Witness X, offered to pass on what he knew about Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) snipers in the area. \nBut he never gave evidence in the end and the court concluded that ballistics evidence cast some doubt on what he had indicated that he would say.\nThere was clear testimony at the inquest that the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA were in the area on those days and did open fire on certain occasions. None of them testified.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, tweeted that it had been a \"long road\" for the families. \n\"The court has considered the evidence and the findings should be accepted,\" she wrote. \n\"I commend the families for their tenacity.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, the vice-president of Sinn F\u00e9in, said the victims were innocent and the families had been vindicated. \nJustice Minister Naomi Long tweeted that the families \"had to battle too hard and too long\" to hear Tuesday's verdict. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was \"inspired by the fearless dedication of these families\".\nUlster Unionist Party MLA Doug Beattie said the government needs to come up with a \"coherent plan to deal with the past and deal with the victims of our Troubles\".\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he wanted to \"acknowledge the terrible hurt\" that had been caused to the families of those killed and said the government would \"carefully consider\" the coroner's findings.\nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Mich\u00e9al Martin said \"the legacy of violence in Northern Ireland remains a deep wound\".\nShadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the families' 50-year wait was \"a profound failure of justice\".\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We note the coroner's findings which have been long awaited by the bereaved families of the deceased, military personnel and their relatives. \n\"We recognise how difficult the process has been for all of those affected by the events of August 1971 and the inquest. We will now take the time to review the report and carefully consider the conclusions drawn.\"\nLord Dannatt, former head of the Army, said \"matters should have been investigated much more thoroughly a long time ago\".\n\"The families should not have had to wait this long to get the degree of truth that has come out today through this very extensive inquest which has gone on for some time,\" he said. \nREAD MORE: Ballymurphy findings 'cast new light on dark pages'"

      "text": "Residents in Israel and Gaza say they are bracing themselves for a drawn-out conflict, as Palestinian militants and Israeli forces continue to exchange fire. \nMilitants have fired hundreds of rockets towards Israel since Monday night, and Israel has responded by hitting targets in Gaza.\nThe violence is the worst in years and has caused casualties on both sides.\nThe BBC has been talking to residents about their fears.\nYolande Knell, Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem\nThe southern Israeli city of Ashkelon has borne the brunt of the latest heavy barrages of Gaza rockets.\nThe Hamas militant wing warned it would make life \"hell\" here and that is how it has seemed for locals.\nThe constant wail of warning sirens sends them scrambling for cover. \nOverhead, there are loud bangs and trails of white smoke across the blue sky as Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system intercepts most of the launches from nearby Gaza.\nHowever, a number of buildings have been directly hit. Two women were killed. Dozens of people have been rushed to hospital for treatment.\nMany of the older buildings here do not have the bomb shelters that now come as standard in Israel.\nOne woman spoke of the terrifying moment before dawn when a missile hit her home as she hid in her wardrobe. \nMany here are bracing themselves for the heavy exchange of fire to continue for days.\n\"It will go far, this round of violence,\" says one man, Yossi Asulin. \"Now that there are people killed, people here want to solve the problem [with Hamas] once and for all.\"\nIn the Israeli city of Lod, which is currently under a state of emergency, an Israeli Arab man, 52, and his 16-year-old daughter died when rocket fire hit their car, also injuring the teenager's mother.\n\"I was at home, we heard the noise of the rocket. It happened so quickly. Even if we had wanted to run somewhere, we don't have a safe room,\" Ahmad Ismail, the girl's cousin, told public broadcaster Kan.\nAs air raid sirens sounded throughout the night, thousands of people slept in bomb shelters, including Anna Ahronheim, the defence and security correspondent of the Jerusalem Post, and her five-month-old baby.\n\"To hear hundreds of interceptions and even to hear rockets fall near us was horrifying,\" she told the BBC.\nAn Israeli woman in the coastal city of Ashkelon said on Channel 11 television: \"The children have escaped the coronavirus, and now a new trauma.\"\nBut Adam Mallerman, a British-born man from Jerusalem, told BBC OS on World Service Radio that while there are \"cycles of violence...  there is an acceptance that this is the price for building this incredible little country of ours\".\n\"We have neighbours like Hezbollah and Hamas who would like to see us removed genocidally,\" he said. \"There is almost nobody here, certainly born here, who doesn't know people or hasn't lost people in either the wars over the last 75 years or acts of terrorism.\"\nIn Gaza, smoke is still rising into the air and the streets are full of rubble. Palestinians are assessing the damage after a night of violence.\nOne family in northern Gaza has lost five members who were killed by an Israeli air strike, including two young brothers who were filling sacks of straw at the time.\n\"We were laughing and having fun when suddenly they began to bomb us. Everything around us caught fire,\" their 14-year-old cousin, Ibrahim, told AFP news agency, breaking down in tears as he described their death.\nAnother air strike hit a car carrying three civilians, who were all killed.\nDonia Amer, who also lives in Gaza, told BBC OS that she and her family had woken to \"hundreds of explosive sounds\" at the same time - what she called \"30 minutes of madness\".\n\"We can never forget this moment,\" she said. \"We can never forget our children's fear, nor ours.\"\n\"What should I say? This is a crime,\"Gaza resident Abed Aldayah, 54, told Reuters news agency.\n\"They were civilians: a woman, her children, a barber and a shop owner. These are the people who were at the scene. They didn't hit a militant nor an official, we are civilians sleeping at our homes.\"\nRushdi Abu Alouf, BBC News, Gaza City\nGaza has not experienced a situation like this for years. This miserable, overcrowded city knows very well what war means.\nThe main commercial street in the city centre is almost empty except for a few shoppers. Most shops were closed ahead of Eid al Fitr - the most important religious and social occasion for Muslims. \nBombardments did not abate as the sound of Palestinian rockets and Israeli air strikes echoed across the region on Tuesday morning.\nA few metres away from our office in Gaza, a loud explosion rang out and huge black smoke billowed into the sky after an Israeli air strike hit an apartment building housing hundreds of residents. The raid killed two Islamic Jihad military leaders hiding inside.\n\"This is Israeli terrorism, we are innocent civilians. My children are terrified, they do not want to go home again for fear of renewed air strikes,\" says one woman - screaming and carrying her young child as she escapes from the building. \nSince the round of fighting began, residents have rushed to their homes to flee the bombing. Gaza has no shelters or air raid sirens, so residents have no other options but to hide in their homes. \n\"We do not know for how long this round of fighting will continue. It seems that the escalation is continuing,\" says local resident Sherin Emadadein. \"I'm a mother of four children, we live in an apartment in a seven-floor building. There is no basement in our building, I do not know where we will flee if our building is bombed.\"\nSherin spoke to me on the telephone as she bought food from the only food shop open in her west Gaza neighbourhood. \n\"I was supposed to buy chocolate and sweets to celebrate the end of the long fasting month of Ramadan, but now we don't know for how long this escalation will last so I only buy the basic needs,\" she adds."

      "text": "Palestinian militants in Gaza have fired dozens of rockets at Israel after its air strikes killed top commanders and felled another tower block there.\nThe escalation, which began on Monday, has triggered street violence in Israel between Jews and Israeli Arabs. \nIn two incidents, a Jewish man in Acre was attacked by Arab men, and a Jewish mob pulled a Palestinian out of his car and beat him up in Bat Yam.\nAt least 67 people in Gaza and seven people in Israel have been killed.\nThe fighting erupted on Monday after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by Muslims and Jews.\nMore than 374 people were arrested and 36 officers were injured after clashes in Israeli cities, Israeli police said.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking late on Wednesday night, said he planned to send in military forces to help police maintain order in cities ruptured by violence.\nMr Netanyahu said the attacks in recent days amounted to \"anarchy\".\n\"Nothing can justify an Arab mob assaulting Jews, and nothing can justify a Jewish mob assaulting Arabs,\" he said in a video statement, as reported by the Times of Israel.\nMilitant groups in Gaza, run by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, have been firing rockets into Israel since Monday night, and Israel has responded by hitting targets in the territory.\nOn Thursday morning, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said about 1,500 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israeli cities since hostilities escalated at the start of this week.\nThe health ministry in Gaza says that more than 400 people have been injured there since the conflict began, in addition to the 67 who have died.\nMr Netanyahu said the government would use all its strength to protect Israel from enemies on the outside and rioters on the inside.\nBut the Palestinian Authority, which governs in parts of the West Bank, condemned Israel's \"military aggression\" in a tweet, saying it was \"traumatising an already beleaguered population of two million people\".\nThe militants in Gaza said they had fired 130 rockets into Israel in response to an Israeli air raid which destroyed the al-Sharouk tower in Gaza City.\nThe tower, which is the third tall building to be destroyed by air strikes this week, housed al-Aqsa TV, the station run by Hamas.\nIsrael said it had killed senior Hamas officials in Gaza, and was also targeting missile launching sites. Hamas confirmed a senior commander and \"other leaders\" had died.\nThe IDF said on Wednesday that their strikes on Gaza were the largest since the conflict in 2014.\nResidents had been warned to evacuate the buildings before fighter jets attacked; however health officials said there were still civilian deaths.\nFive members of one family were killed in an air strike on Tuesday, including two young brothers, according to AFP news agency.\n\"We were laughing and having fun when suddenly they began to bomb us. Everything around us caught fire,\" their 14-year-old cousin, Ibrahim, said, breaking down in tears as he described their death.\nMeanwhile millions of Israelis were in bomb shelters on Wednesday evening, according to the IDF, after sirens warning of rockets sounded across the country.\nAnna Ahronheim, the defence and security correspondent of the Jerusalem Post, described spending Tuesday night in a shelter with her five-month-old baby.\n\"To hear hundreds of interceptions and even to hear rockets fall near us was horrifying,\" she told the BBC.\nA child killed in the Israeli town of Sderot was named as Ido Avigal, aged six, who was caught in an attack on a block of flats.\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \"gravely concerned\" by the ongoing violence. The UN Security Council has met to discuss the issue, but has not issued a statement.\nIn a phone call with Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden offered his support for Israel's security but stressed the need to restore \"a sustainable calm\".\n\"My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory,\" he told reporters at the White House.\nUS Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he had sent an envoy to the region to meet both sides.\nRussia has called for an urgent meeting of the Middle East Quartet (the US, EU, UN and Russia).\nA Russian foreign ministry statement quoted a Hamas spokesman as saying the movement was ready for a ceasefire if Israel stopped \"violent acts\" in East Jerusalem and \"illegal measures in respect of its native Arab residents\".\nThe fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. \nThe site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded.\nPalestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April.\nIt was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day.\nThe fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. \nPalestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own.\nAre you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

      "text": "Tenants are showing signs of returning to major cities to take advantage of rents that were lowered during lockdown, a report suggests.\nWork and leisure restrictions, as well as younger adults returning to live with their families, meant demand dropped in the last year.\nThis in turn led to rent falls, including a drop of 9.4% in London, according to property portal Zoopla.\nBut, since Easter, it said demand had picked up.\nThere was a two-speed rental market over the last year, according to the Zoopla figures.\nOutside London, rents rose by 3% in the year to the end of March.\nHowever, the cost of renting in some of the UK's big cities fell. In Edinburgh, it dropped by 3.2% and in Manchester it was down by 1%.\nIn London, the drop was particularly pronounced. This meant average rents accounted for 42% of an average single earner income in London, down from 49% in March last year. That was considerably lower than the peak of 53% in late 2016.\nLondon still remained a comparatively expensive place to rent a home. The national average sees rent take up 31% of a single earner's income.\nDemand among renters for city properties is starting to rise significantly again, the report suggests, with tenants looking out for particular characteristics in the light of Covid.\nPrivate outdoor space is a priority. The proportion of renters searching for properties with gardens had doubled since last year, the report said.\nGr\u00e1inne Gilmore, head of research at Zoopla, said the availability of mortgages for people only able to offer a low deposit meant some were keen to buy a first home rather than rent, but this would be limited by economic uncertainty.\n\"The opening up of the economy and the slow return to business as usual as the vaccine rolls out means [rental] demand will continue to build over the summer as more people move to rent their first property - although, as ever, this will be dependent on the economy opening up in line with the planned timetable,\" she said.\n\"Demand will continue to rise in city centres as offices start to reopen.\"\nVarious surveys have shown significant rises in house prices for buyers over the last year."

      "text": "Ellen DeGeneres is to end her long-running US talk show in 2022 after 19 years on the air.\n\"As great as this show is, and as fun as it is, it's just not a challenge any more,\" she told the Hollywood Reporter.\nThe announcement comes just months after the show faced accusations it was a toxic place to work.\nIt led to three senior producers losing their jobs and DeGeneres opening the current season with an on-air apology.\nThe Ellen DeGeneres Show, which has aired since September 2003, will come to an end in 2022 after its 19th season.\nThe daily mix of comedy, interviews and human interest stories has been a US television staple, though ratings have declined in recent years.\n\"I was going to stop after season 16,\" DeGeneres said. \"That was going to be my last season and they wanted to sign for four more years and I said I'd sign for maybe for one. \n\"They were saying there was no way to sign for one. 'We can't do that with the affiliates and the stations need more of a commitment.'\n\"So, we [settled] on three more years and I knew that would be my last. That was the plan all along.\" \nDeGeneres' show broadcast its 3,000th edition last month, which its host admitted had been an \"emotional\" experience.\n\"It's going to be really hard on the last day, but I also know it's time,\" she continued. \"I'm a creative person, and when you're a creative person you constantly need to be challenged.\"\nThe 63-year-old went on to say that last year's allegations that the show's workplace was \"dominated by fear\" had not been a factor in her decision to pull the plug.\n\"If I was quitting the show because of that, I wouldn't have come back this season,\" she said, while admitting it \"destroyed\" her to see \"everything I stand for... attacked\".\n\"It broke my heart when I learned that people here had anything other than a fantastic experience - that people were hurt in any way,\" she went on.\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, DeGeneres told staff of her decision on Tuesday and is due to give an interview to fellow chat show host Oprah Winfrey on Thursday.\nHer show has won more than 60 Daytime Emmy awards, the most recent coming when it was named outstanding entertainment talk show in 2020.\nThe Ellen Show regularly attracts A-list Hollywood guests and clips from the show often attract millions of views on YouTube.\n\"Although all good things must come to an end, you still have hope that truly great things never will,\" said Mike Darnell of show producer Warner Bros.\nHe said the show was a \"phenomenon\" that had become \"the premiere destination for both superstars and incredible heartfelt human-interest stories\".\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Liz Cheney: Republican ousted from leadership for challenging Trump election claims",
      "tags": "Republican Party,Donald Trump,US Congress",
      "text": "US Republicans have voted to oust a top lawmaker, Liz Cheney, from her leadership post over her criticism of former President Donald Trump.\nThe Wyoming lawmaker, daughter of ex-US Vice-President Dick Cheney, has held the third-ranking post in the House of Representatives since 2019.\nOn Tuesday she said her party could not stand for truth if it upheld Mr Trump's false claims he won the 2020 election.\nHouse Republicans will probably replace her this month with a Trump loyalist.\nThe move is seen as a sign Mr Trump's grip on the party is stronger than ever six months after he lost the election.\nMs Cheney's fate was decided in less than 20 minutes by House Republicans behind closed doors on Wednesday morning.\nColleagues reportedly applauded her leadership tenure, but Ms Cheney drew boos when she spoke during the session and said: \"We cannot let the former president drag us backward and make us complicit in his efforts to unravel our democracy.\"\nThe ballot was not recorded but lawmakers cast an overwhelming voice vote in favour of removing Ms Cheney from her post.\nImmediately following her removal, she told reporters: \"I will do everything I can to ensure that the former president never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.\"\nMs Cheney has repeatedly condemned Mr Trump over his unfounded claims the 2020 vote was stolen from him.\nFellow Republican lawmakers say she is relitigating the past while they want to move on and focus on the next election.\nReacting to the news of Ms Cheney's removal from leadership, Mr Trump released a statement attacking her as \"a bitter, horrible human being\" and \"a talking point for Democrats\".\nThe Democratic leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, lavished praise on Ms Cheney as a leader of great courage, patriotism and integrity\".\nHer political fall from grace stems from the aftermath of the Capitol riots on 6 January, when Trump supporters stormed Congress.\nShe was one of 10 members of her party who voted days later with Democrats to impeach the then-president for incitement of insurrection. He was acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.\nAccusing her of disloyalty, rank-and-file House Republicans held a vote a month later on unseating Ms Cheney from her role as party conference chair.\nBut the party's leader in the lower chamber, Kevin McCarthy, advised colleagues at the time against removing her. She survived the secret ballot by 145-61. Since then she has continued to upbraid Mr Trump.\nThe final straw for many party colleagues seems to have been her anti-Trump broadside last week in a Washington Post op-ed. After its publication, Mr McCarthy and his deputy, Republican whip Steve Scalise, began taking steps to oust Ms Cheney.\nMr McCarthy was recently caught on a hot mic telling a Fox News presenter: \"I've had it with her. You know, I've lost confidence.\"\nLiz Cheney was 10 years old when the first Star Wars film premiered. Forty-four years later, she's playing Obi-Wan Kenobi to Donald Trump's Darth Vader, telling him that if he strikes her down, she will become more powerful than he can possibly imagine.\nWith her ouster from House Republican leadership on Wednesday morning, the first part is done. Now it's up to Ms Cheney to build an anti-Trump movement that makes the second part a reality.\nUnlike some other Republican officeholders who challenged Mr Trump and then faded into the relative obscurity of corporate boards, minor book deals and occasional talk show appearances, Ms Cheney is planning an ambitious campaign to support politicians who chart a course away from Mr Trump and his continued efforts to rehash and re-litigate his 2020 electoral defeat.\nShe is putting herself forward as a reliably conservative counterpoint to Trumpism, and she has the congressional voting record to back that up. \nFor the moment, Republicans - at least in the House of Representatives - seem to think fealty to Mr Trump is more important than ideological purity. Ms Cheney is betting her political future that this won't always be the case.\nElise Stefanik, a four-term congresswoman from upstate New York, is the current favourite to succeed Ms Cheney.\nSoon after the vote to remove Ms Cheney, Ms Stefanik quickly signalled her interest in a letter to colleagues, pledging to \"unify our message as a team and win the majority in 2022\".\nA former critic of Mr Trump, the 36-year-old has morphed over the last couple of years into one of his staunchest allies.\nHe repaid her loyalty on Monday with an endorsement.\nHowever, not everyone in the party supports Ms Stefanik, with some complaining that her voting record in the House is too liberal.\nChip Roy, a member of the hardline conservative Freedom Caucus, set forth his opposition to Ms Stefanik in a memo to colleagues on Tuesday.\u00a0\n\"Let us contemplate the message Republican leadership is about to send by rushing to coronate a spokesperson whose voting record embodies much of what led to the 2018 ass-kicking we received by Democrats,\" the Texas congressman wrote.\nShe is now fighting for her political life back in her constituency, where her party has already voted at the state level to censure her for voting to impeach Mr Trump.\nAt least five Republicans have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run against her in 2022.\nOf the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Mr Trump, nine in total now face primary challengers from within their party to unseat them from Congress next year.\nIn an interview with NBC News shortly after the vote, Ms Cheney called her removal \"the opening salvo\" in a fight \"to bring back our party to substance and principles\". \nOf the primary challenges she faces in Wyoming, she said: \"Bring it on.\""

      "tags": "Animal welfare,Intensive farming",
      "text": "Microchipping pet cats will become compulsory under a wide-ranging new animal welfare plan.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the policy would be monitored by vets and enforced in the same way as it is for dogs, which he said has led to over 90% compliance.\nThe plan will also formally recognise the sentience of many animals.\nBut Mr Eustice said this measure was aimed at pets and livestock, rather than wild animals.\nThe government's Action Plan for Animal Welfare also includes measures to ban exporting live animals for slaughter, the keeping of primates as pets and importing hunting trophies. There may also be changes to the ways that animals can be confined - such as the practice of keeping them in cages.\nHowever, there is no plan to require imports to meet the same welfare standards as in the UK, which the National Farmers' Union (NFU) described as \"hypocrisy\".\nThe plan will also see remote-controlled training collars for dogs outlawed and the government says it will look at banning the sale of foie gras - a food made from the livers of force-fed ducks or geese.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Eustice said that compulsory microchipping for cats would resemble the current rules for dogs, where vets advise pet owners whose animals do not have a microchip to get one, and \"if they ignore it, there is an enforcement process\".\nDog owners can be fined \u00a3500 under the existing law.\nLianna Angliss at Hopefield Animal Sanctuary said that as well as helping to reunite lost cats with their owners, compulsory microchipping could help animal sanctuaries trace people who abandon their pets.\nThe environment secretary also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the recognition of animal sentience would give the UK an equivalent to a declaration that already applies in the European Union.\nIt will enshrine in law that animals have the capacity to feel hunger and pain, and are aware of what is happening to them. It will apply to vertebrates, but not to animals such as octopus and squid.\nMr Eustice said there would be an expert animal sentience committee which would advise on policy.\nBut asked if it would affect hunting, fishing or road-building projects which might disturb habitats, he said the recognition of animal sentience was \"much more applicable\" to pets and livestock than wildlife.\nClaire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society, said recognising animal sentience was a key part of \"probably the biggest new set of commitments on animal welfare for decades\".\nThe plan includes legislation in a number of bills set to be approved in the coming months. These include the Kept Animals Bill, the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill and the Animals Abroad Bill. These will expand on the protections in the Animal Welfare Act 2006. \nLegislation to restrict the use of glue traps, designed to capture rats and mice, will also be supported.\nReacting to the news that owners will have to get their cats microchipped, Jacqui Cuff, head of advocacy and government relations for Cats Protection, said she was \"delighted\". \n\"We had the dog microchipping regulation passed in 2016, so we've been waiting a long time. There are around 2.6 million unchipped pet cats in the UK; that's a lot of cats wandering around with no permanent identification,\" she said.\nCat theft reportedly increased by more than 12% over the last year, and only around 70% of owned cats are chipped at the moment.\nChris Sherwood, chief executive of the RSPCA, said: \"These announcements will make a real and lasting difference to animals' welfare, so we're pleased the government is committed to improving animals' lives in the UK and abroad. We can no longer ignore the inextricable link that exists between the way we treat animals, our own health and that of the planet - but to really achieve a step change, it will take courage from right across government.\n\"We urge the government to put animal welfare at the heart of policy making and make these announcements just the beginning of an evolving, holistic animal health and welfare strategy.\"\nWith regard to farmed animals, live exports for fattening and slaughter will be banned. This is only possible because the UK has left the EU. The caging of poultry and the practice of restricting the movement of pregnant and suckling pigs will also be examined. \nSows can legally be kept in a \"farrowing crate\" for up to five weeks. These crates are of a size that prevents the sow from turning around and potentially crushing her new-born piglets. However, preventing sows from engaging in normal behaviour can cause them to become stressed.\nThere is, however, no legal guarantee that food from animals reared abroad will have been produced to high animal-welfare standards. \nLast year, ministers controversially voted against a House of Lords amendment which would have blocked imports that didn't meet welfare and food safety standards in the UK. It will now depend on post-Brexit trade deals with countries such as the US, where cows are routinely treated with hormones and chickens are washed with chlorine - which is illegal here. \nThe deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, Stuart Roberts, said it was \"ridiculous\" if high standards weren't applied to imports as well.\n\"We have some of highest standards for animal welfare in the world. It's good that the government have that same ambition,\" he said. \n\"But at the moment we are negotiating a trade deal with Australia, where you can have journey times for animals in excess of 24 hours without access to food or water. We cannot increase standards here, and at the same time not apply the same criteria to imports, it's just hypocrisy.\"\nMr Eustice said the UK could use tariffs on imported produce to uphold its standards and could also impose a ban on the sale of imported food which relied on practices banned domestically - such as foie gras.\nOther measures in the plan include banning the advertisement of \"unacceptable low-welfare animal practices abroad\" such as elephant rides, along with prohibiting the export of \"detached shark fins\". The Ivory Act, banning the sale of ivory, will also be implemented. \nThere will also be new laws to \"crack down on illegal hare coursing,\" and police will be given more powers to protect farm animals from dangerous or out-of-control dogs."

      "title": "Covid: Will UK vaccine success keep virus at bay?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Next week will see the most significant lifting of restrictions yet in England, with indoor mixing to be allowed. The rest of the UK is making similar steps.\nIt means the onus is increasingly shifting on to the vaccines, rather than social distancing and restrictions, to keep the virus at bay. How well do they work? And is there now enough immunity in the population to protect us all?\nThe UK has benefited from both fast rollout and good uptake. Currently, a third of the adult population is fully vaccinated, with another third having had one dose.\nAmong those at most risk - the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions, where 99% of Covid deaths have occurred - uptake for the first dose has been 95%.\nSome describe that as being only partially vaccinated. But that can underplay the significance of that first dose, which provides most of the protection - the second acts to boost immunity and is important for long-lasting protection.\nThe latest government data - based on evidence from the rollout - suggests one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine cuts the risk of infection by as much as 70% and death by even more.\nData on their effectiveness after two doses is only just emerging - but, as expected, it suggests this level of protection is boosted even further. For Pfizer, which was rolled out first, the risk of death is reduced by 97%.\nWhat is more, those that are vaccinated but do become infected are thought to be about half as likely to pass the virus on.\nThe vaccines are working about as well as could be hoped in the real world - and confirm what the trial results always suggested.\nIn fact, the impact is so good it raises the prospect of the UK reaching the herd-immunity threshold, meaning the virus is unlikely to spread because so few people can catch it.\nSir John Bell, a member of the government's vaccine taskforce, believes we may indeed be at a \"tipping point\".\nBut it is a complex equation influenced by other factors. The amount of natural immunity from people who have had Covid already will play a role.\nData from April published by the Office for National Statistics indicated nearly seven out of every 10 adults had Covid antibodies - above what could be explained by vaccination alone.\nAnother factor is how the public reacts. Even if the government lifts restrictions completely in June, as it has suggested, it is unclear how quickly \"normal\" behaviour will return.\nWhat is clear is the amount of virus circulating is very low and has continued to fall even as the first steps out of lockdown have been made.\nWhether this will be enough to stop infections rising in the coming months remains to be seen.\nScientists had always warned the easing in England, Scotland and Wales on Monday, 17 May, was the one that could push numbers up the most, given the virus is most likely to be passed on indoors.\nBut there is good reason to hope the vaccines will be enough to stop that pretty much on their own, says Dr Adam Kucharski, an expert in infectious diseases, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\"It is possible we will get to a situation where [infection rates won't rise] without the need for many other measures,\" he says.\n\"The vaccines are working that well that domestically we can gradually relax restrictions and enjoy the summer.\"\nThe big unknown, Dr Kucharski says, is the variants. Those identified in Brazil, South Africa and India appear to be able to evade some of the immune response from the vaccines.\nBut much of this is based on testing in labs rather than evidence from the real world, which makes it hard to interpret, as it largely focuses on one element of the immune response - antibodies.\n\"The data is very patchy. That makes it difficult knowing with certainty what will happen next.\"\nThe \"most likely scenario\", he says, is vaccines lose some ability to stop infections - but provide protection against serious disease.\nEmerging real-world evidence suggests this is the case. A study in Qatar indicated the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine remained as effective at preventing serious illness and lost only a little of its ability to block infections - and that was against the South Africa variant scientists are most concerned about.\nBut the lack of certainty makes some uneasy. University College London clinical research director Prof Christina Pagel, a member of the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, wants the UK to proceed with more caution, not releasing restrictions fully until all adults have received their second dose, which is not expected before the end of September. \nShe is calling for an Australia-style closure of borders to reduce the risk of variants being imported. \"I just don't think it is worth the risk,\" she says. \nBut, as always with Covid, the argument returns to what is proportionate. There is a theoretical risk the virus could mutate enough to undermine the vaccines so there is a surge in serious cases. \nBut what is the likelihood of that happening all of a sudden as opposed to a gradual shift over years that is more common with coronaviruses and will allow vaccines to be updated to keep up with the virus?\nProf Neil Ferguson, an expert in infectious disease, from Imperial College London, whose modelling led to the first lockdown, says it is the worst-case scenario and unlikely. And the UK is \"much more likely to be on a steady course\" out of the pandemic.\nDr Muge Cevik, from St Andrews University, agrees. Having researched the variants, she says we should take confidence from the emerging picture, with the evidence \"strongly pointing\" to the vaccines continuing to work really well, at least in terms of preventing serious illness and death. \nAt worst, there will be some continued low-level spread - but the vaccine programme's success means that is now less likely to translate into significant numbers of serious cases. \n\"We are in a really good position,\" Dr Cevik says. \"We are de-risking Covid.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nYesterday Boris Johnson committed to holding an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic, and now we've got a date for it. He told MPs it will be held in spring 2022 and it will place the government's actions \"under the microscope\". There have been calls for an inquiry for a while, and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has asked why it can't be earlier, such as later in 2021. We look at what the inquiry is and how it might work.\nMeanwhile, it's the World Health Organization's handling of the pandemic which is currently under scrutiny. An independent review panel has drawn up a report looking at what went wrong. It says the combined response of the WHO and global governments was a \"toxic cocktail\", and the WHO should have declared a global emergency a week earlier than it did. More than 3.3 million people have now died of Covid. There's more on the global impact here.\nThere's good news from the latest official figures on the UK economy. Although the economy shrank in the first three months of 2021 and is still smaller than it was pre-pandemic, it has gathered speed and grew 2.1% in March - it's fastest monthly growth since last August. Economists suggest this could mark a possible turning point and we could now be on course for a bumper bounce-back this year.\nIt's coming further down the age range - people aged 38 to 39 in England are being sent text messages inviting them to book their Covid jabs. They'll have either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, after the rules were changed to ensure under-40s get an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. The rollout in England is at a similar pace to the rest of the UK, although Northern Ireland is slightly ahead - over-30s are being invited. Read more about when you might get your jab.\nThere are signs that renters who moved away from major cities during lockdown are coming back. That's according to a new report from property listing website Zoopla. They say that demand for rented properties in some major cities fell last year, which caused prices to drop - such as the 9.4% decrease in London. But since Easter, demand has apparently picked up as tenants return for the cheaper rents, and they're also looking for places with certain features such as gardens. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nA further 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were recorded in the UK on Thursday, all of them occurring in England.

      "text": "A inquest has found that 10 people who were shot over a three-day period in Ballymurphy, west Belfast, in 1971, were \"entirely innocent\".\nCoroner Mrs Justice Keegan said nine of the victims were shot by the Army, could not definitively say who shot the tenth.\nThe victims included a priest trying to help the wounded and a mother of eight.\nMrs Justice Keegan, who delivered her findings over the course of more than two hours, said the deaths took place during Northern Ireland's Troubles in a \"highly charged and difficult environment\".\nBBC News NI reporter Will Leitch covered the inquest to its conclusion following 16 months of hearings.\nHe has reflected on some of the harrowing stories he heard during his \"longest and most difficult assignment\".\nIt was a cry of horror. A sharp, sudden cry of pain, of grief, of deep, deep sorrow.\nA visceral cry which must have pierced the heart of every single person who heard it echo around courtroom 12 of the Laganside Courts complex in Belfast.\nThe courtroom gasped as waves of emotion rippled out from the jury box, where the families were sitting to watch witnesses give evidence on day 33 of the Ballymurphy Inquest.\nThe daughters of Joan Connolly comforted their sister.\nShe had just heard, for the very first time, graphic details of how her mother was shot, and died, alone and in great pain, just feet from a house where another woman inside was frantically trying to save her.\nThat woman, now in the witness box, paused, and looked anxiously at the coroner to see if she should continue her evidence.\nMargaret Elmore had, under oath, described what she remembered from August 1971, and knew that in doing what the court asked, had inadvertently awoken great sorrow.\nThe court rose, to allow time for everyone to recompose themselves.\nThat was just one painful moment in March 2019 during the Ballymurphy Inquest, but one which has stayed with me.\nThis story was about ordinary people and the quest for the truth of what happened 50 years ago.\nI have watched and listened to many sad or upsetting court cases in my 30 years as a reporter.\nBut nothing prepares you for the cries of a woman who had just heard how half of her mother's face had been shot off.\nIn all, there had been more than 150 witnesses and 248 statements.\nOn my desk I now have four box files full of documents, notes, transcripts, TV and radio scripts.\nWhere the statement came from someone who could not attend, or was already dead, they were read out to the court, in full and at length.\nI watched as witnesses gave their recollections, listened to the voices of former soldiers giving evidence from behind a curtain and concentrated as experts in forensic pathology or ballistics explained their findings.\nI looked into the faces of former colonels and generals who waived their anonymity and tried to explain their command decisions.\nI also looked on as barristers asked pointedly about the witnesses who did not appear and the documents which were never submitted as evidence.\nIn 1971, the coroner had a list of all the soldiers who claimed to have shot anyone, but in the intervening years that list was lost.\nSeveral Army records, including some from the Parachute Regiment in 1971, are missing or incomplete.\n\"Witness X\" offered to supply information about Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) snipers in the area at the time, but despite giving answers to the coroner's investigators, he never appeared to testify in court.\nAlthough several witnesses, including the former Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams, said they had seen Irish Republican Army (IRA) gunmen in the area, no one from the IRA came forward with any information.\nCovering the Ballymurphy Inquest has been my longest and most difficult assignment, but the stories I tried my best to tell belonged to those people whose memories unfolded in the courtroom."

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic was preventable, an independent review panel has said.\nThe panel, set up by the World Health Organization, said the combined response of the WHO and global governments was a \"toxic cocktail\".\nThe WHO should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, its report said, adding that without urgent change the world was vulnerable to another major disease outbreak.\nMore than 3.3 million people around the world have now died of Covid.\nWhile the US and Europe are beginning to ease restrictions and resume some aspects of pre-pandemic life, the virus is still devastating parts of Asia.\nIndia in particular is seeing record-breaking numbers of new cases and deaths, with severe oxygen shortages in hospitals across the country.\nCountries neighbouring India, such as Nepal, are also seeing surges of the virus.\nCovid-19: Make it the Last Pandemic, was compiled by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response.\nIts aim was to find answers as to how the virus had killed more than 3.3 million people and infected more than 159 million.\n\"The situation we find ourselves in today could have been prevented,\" co-chair Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a former president of Liberia, told reporters. \n\"It is due to a myriad of failures, gaps and delays in preparedness and response.\"\nThe panel argued that the WHO's Emergency Committee should have declared the outbreak in China an international emergency a week earlier than it did.\nIt should have done so at its first meeting on 22 January last year, the report said, instead of waiting until 30 January.\nThe month following the WHO's declaration was \"lost\" as countries failed to take appropriate measures to halt the spread of the virus.\nThe WHO was then hindered by its own regulations that travel restrictions should be a last resort, the panel said, adding that Europe and the US wasted the entire month of February and acted only when their hospitals began to fill up.\nWhen countries should have been preparing their healthcare systems for an influx of Covid patients, much of the world descended into a \"winner takes all\" scramble for protective equipment and medicines, the report said.\nTo prevent another catastrophic pandemic, the report suggests key reforms: \nPanel co-chair and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was \"critical to have an empowered WHO\".\n\"If travel restrictions had been imposed more quickly, more widely, again that would have been a serious inhibition on the rapid transmission of the disease and that remains the same today,\" she added.\nThe most eye-catching line of this report is that the pandemic was the 21st Century's \"Chernobyl moment\" and its assertion that the world wasted time in February 2020 while the virus took hold. \nThe panel calls for better processes and structures to spot the next highly infectious pathogen. As well as better funding for the World Health Organization to make it stronger and give it more teeth. \nAfter the worst shock to the global economy since World War Two, all countries will agree that it's a case of \"never again\". But will meaningful reform be possible when so much of the current response is still about putting national interests first?\nThe panel has called for rich countries to share one billion doses of vaccine by September, for example. Yet many nations with large stockpiles remain reluctant to declare their hand.\nThere are some issues the panel didn't have time to consider in depth.

      "text": "A programme of pilot events organised as part of Wales' road out of Covid lockdown has left north Wales ignored, politicians say.\nPlaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives have demanded action to be taken.\nThe Welsh government unveiled nine pilot test events on Tuesday, including the Wales-Albania international friendly in June.\nOfficials said the programme of events followed discussions with organisers, venues and councils.\nBut Plaid Cymru said there were no events \"north of Brecon\".\nThe government has said the programme would help develop guidance and processes to \"allow the safe return of events in Wales\".\nThe first are taking place this week, with Eid-al-Fitr celebrations and the Tafwyl Welsh language festival at Cardiff Castle, both with up to 500 people attending.\nBut the new Plaid Senedd member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Mabon ap Gwynfor, said the list spoke \"volumes about the Labour Welsh government's priorities\".\n\"Venues have struggled through the pandemic in all parts of the country and it is deeply regrettable that the pilot plan is ignoring the many suitable locations we have here across the region,\" said Mr ap Gwynfor.\n\"If the government is serious about making sure that the north is not left behind its actions after the election must match its warm words before it.\"\nWelsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"It's pleasing to see spectator trials given the green light, but ministers should correct the one glaring error in the plan and ensure there are pilots in north Wales, not just concentrated in the south.\"\nThe decision to name two play-off games for Swansea City and Newport has also sparked controversy.\nThe Football Association of Wales' head of competitions Andrew Howard said on social media that not including any games from Welsh football leagues was \"gut-wrenching\".\nIn Wrexham, Plaid Cymru councillor Carrie Harper has started a petition calling for events at the town's Racecourse stadium.\n\"All we want is a bit of fair play for the north - the Welsh government has announced these pilots for open-air events, which is very welcome, but they're all south of the M4,\" she said.\nThe town's Labour Senedd member Lesley Griffiths said officials have already been in discussion with the club, and \"would love to see the Racecourse\" included if the team reaches the National League play-offs, with a chance of being promoted to the English Football League Two.\nOne festival organiser in north Wales has warned that without a date for reopening the live outdoor sector, they will have to pull the plug.\nRock The Park in Wrexham has already sold 30,000 tickets for the event in August.\nThe Welsh government has said it will \"provide more clarity\" for the sector on Friday.\nBut Rock the Park's Sam Foulkes told BBC Wales Live that the lack of information was not fair on organisers, customers or artists.\n\"Give us a date. When can live music happen again, when can we get people in a field?\" said Mr Foulkes.\n\"These things are planning to go ahead in England.\n\"We've got artists asking us can we come and perform, they need to book things, customers wanting to book hotels, there's no information out there whatsoever.\"\nSarah Hemsley-Cole from industry body We Make Events Cymru said a lack of information was having a big impact on the sector in Wales.\n\"I think the reality is the test event programme here in Wales is not as ambitious at the one in England,\" she said.\n\"At the moment we are seeing events turning away from Wales, we are seeing opportunities lost where in Wales we cannot commit whereas in England they are able to be a lot bolder and a lot braver.\n\"The longer-term impact we are worried about is if a festival chooses to relocate to England, would you ever come back to Wales?\"\nUnder the UK government's Event Research Programme, several events have already taken place, including Tuesday's Brit Awards, which had an indoor audience of 4,000 without social distancing.\nWelsh government officials have said successful test events will \"hopefully allow larger gatherings back to stadia, theatres and other venues in Wales\".\nOn the locations, they added: \"Selection of the events to be included in the proposed pilot programme was made on the basis of discussion with venues, local authorities and event organisers, seeking spread across types of event and locations across Wales.\"\nYou can see more on this issue on Wales Live on Wednesday, at 22:35 BST on BBC One Wales."

      "tags": "UK Parliament",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has said the government \"won't settle for going back to the way things were\", as the UK emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.\nHe promised to end the \"criminal waste of talent\" in parts of the UK by spreading opportunity more evenly.\nIt came as the government unveiled 30 planned new laws for the year ahead in the Queen's Speech.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's programme lacked urgency and ambition.\n\"Today we needed a Queen's Speech that rose to scale of the moment,\" said Sir Keir, but instead, he claimed, it was \"packed with short-term gimmicks and distant promises\".\nSir Keir seized on the absence of new legislation to fix the funding of adult social care - something he said the prime minister had promised on the steps of Downing Street two years ago.\nHe said the government's failure to act on the issue after the pandemic was \"nothing short of an insult\" and it was \"a similar story on skills and education\".\nThe government has promised to bring forward social care proposals later this year.\nMany of the measures in the Queen's Speech are aimed at the Conservatives' new electoral strongholds in the Midlands and north of England.\nThe prime minister told MPs: \"We intend to unite and level up across the whole of our United Kingdom because we one nation Conservatives understand this crucial point - that you will find flair and imagination and enthusiasm and genius distributed evenly across this country while opportunity is not.\n\"And we need to change that because it is not just a moral and social disgrace, it is an economic mistake. It is a criminal waste of talent.\n\"And though we cannot for one moment minimise the damage that Covid has done - the loss of learning, the NHS backlogs, the courts delays, the massive fiscal consequences - we must use this opportunity to achieve a national recovery so that jabs, jabs jabs becomes jobs, jobs, jobs.\"\nAmong the planned new laws are:\nMissing from the government's programme was a specific bill on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, although the speech said legislation will be introduced.\nAnd trade unions accused the government of \"rowing back\" on a promise to protect workers' rights.\nDowning Street said an Employment Bill would be introduced \"when the time is right\", citing the pandemic as the reason for the delay.\nMr Johnson committed to setting up a \"full, proper\" public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic, which could begin in the coming year, in response to a question from Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey.\nSir Ed also raised concerns about plans to introduce voter ID for future general elections, which he said would hit the disadvantaged and ethnic minorities, and were \"straight from the Donald Trump playbook\".\nAnd he echoed criticism of planning reforms by former Prime Minister Theresa May, who said they would hand too much power to developers and \"see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places\".\nThe SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told the prime minister there was a fresh mandate for a Scottish independence referendum after Thursday's elections. \nHe also attacked \"further power grabs\" by the Westminster government in the Queen's Speech.\nOne of the pleasures of the Queen's Speech for journalists is hearing Her Majesty reading out the political slogans of the government of the day. \nSo 15 seconds in there was mention of the prime minister's favourite: plans to \"level up\" the country. \nThe meaning of the phrase is gradually being refined but the agenda is still vast and encompasses jobs, schools, health, policing, industry, productivity, civic pride, the strength of local leadership and the quality of life. \nBut the real detail in this area will come later this year when the government publishes a White Paper where it will spell out much more detail about what levelling up means and the \"bold\" action that ministers will take to achieve it. \nSo for now the government is trumpeting what it's already doing: a \u00a34.8bn fund for infrastructure projects, \u00a3830m for redeveloping High Streets, along with eight freeports and 40 new hospitals in England. \nAnd where there are such big promises, Labour stands ready to highlight pledges that go unmet. \nThis year's speech also included changes to the policing of protests, including setting time and noise limits. A previous discussion of this by MPs earlier this year led to angry demonstrations.\nCritics say the measures impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest - but ministers say the proposals will respect human rights and will only affect very disruptive gatherings.\nA ban on so-called conversion therapy - attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity - is also planned.\nThe Queen's Speech is part of the State Opening of Parliament, normally the grandest of Westminster occasions.\nBut it was pared back this year because of Covid, with fewer MPs and peers than normal gathering in the House of Lords to hear it - and the Queen arriving by car rather than the usual carriage.\nIt was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh."

      "text": "The deadly exchange of fire between Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli military has escalated significantly, with the UN fearing a \"full-scale war\".\nMore than 1,000 rockets have been fired by Palestinian militants, Israel says.\nIsrael has carried out hundreds of air strikes on Gaza, destroying three tower blocks and killing senior Hamas officials.\nSince Monday at least 65 Palestinians and six people in Israel have died.\nThat includes 16 Palestinian children caught up in the conflict. \nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \"gravely concerned\" by the ongoing violence.\nIn a phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken condemned Hamas rocket attacks but said Israel had an obligation to avoid civilian casualties.\nHe said he had sent Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hady Amr to meet both sides. \nThe fighting erupted on Monday night after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by Muslims and Jews.\nViolent unrest in towns in Israel with mixed Jewish and Arab populations has led to hundreds of arrests. Lod near Tel Aviv is under a state of emergency.\nMr Netanyahu said the government would use all its strength to protect Israel from enemies on the outside and rioters on the inside.\nBut the Palestinian Authority condemned Israel's \"military aggression\" in a tweet, saying it was \"traumatizing an already beleaguered population of 2 million people\".\nMilitants in Gaza began firing rockets into Israel on Monday night, and Israel responded by hitting targets in the territory.\nOn Wednesday Israel said it had killed senior officials of the Hamas group in Gaza, and was also targeting missile launching sites.\n\"This was only the beginning. We will inflict blows on them that they have never dreamed of,\" said the Israeli prime minister.\nHamas - which runs Gaza - confirmed the death of its commander in Gaza City and other \"warriors\".\n\"Thousands of leaders and soldiers will follow in their footsteps,\" Hamas said in a statement reported by Reuters news agency.\nBut the Russian foreign ministry in a statement quoted a Hamas spokesman as saying the movement was ready for a ceasefire if Israel stopped \"violent acts\" in East Jerusalem and \"illegal measures in respect of its native Arab residents\".\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that more than 360 people have been injured there since the conflict began, as well as the 65 who have died.\nThe Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday that their strikes on Gaza were the largest since the conflict in 2014.\nOn Wednesday a third high-rise building in Gaza was destroyed. \nHamas said it was incensed by \"the enemy's targeting of residential towers\". \nResidents had been warned to evacuate the buildings before fighter jets attacked; however health officials said there were still civilian deaths.\nFive members of one family were killed in an air strike on Tuesday, including two young brothers, according to AFP news agency.\nAn 11-year-old resident of Gaza, Yasmine, told Save the Children Tuesday had been the worst night of her life.\n\"I had pain in my stomach from the fear and my parents were trying to comfort me and tell me the bombing was far away but I could feel that it was close,\" she told the charity. \"Tomorrow is Eid and we won't be celebrating because of this conflict.\"   \nMillions of Israelis were heading to bomb shelters on Wednesday evening, according to the IDF, as sirens warning of rockets sounded across the country.\nOn Wednesday morning an Israeli soldier was killed by an anti-tank missile fired from Gaza into Israel, authorities said.\nThere were conflicting reports on the fate of a six-year-old boy hit in a rocket attack on the town of Sderot, with some saying he had died in the attack.\nTwo people, a man and his teenage daughter, were killed in Lod when a rocket hit their car. They were both Israeli Arabs.\nIsraeli police reported what they called violent riots in dozens of areas of the country overnight, with 270 people arrested.\nSynagogues and businesses in Lod were set on fire.\nMr Netanyahu described the riots as \"unbearable\" and said they reminded the Jewish people of their past.\nIsraeli police said that Lod would be placed under curfew from 20:00 local time on Wednesday until 04:00 on Thursday to preserve the safety and property of residents.\nThe fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. \nThe site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded.\nPalestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April.\nIt was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day.\nThe fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. \nPalestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own.\nAre you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

      "tags": "Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Downing Street is seeking to cancel a county court judgement against Prime Minister Boris Johnson that cites an unpaid bill of \u00a3535.\nThe order was made against Mr Johnson, of 10 Downing Street, on 26 October, according to a judgement database.\nThe creditor and nature of the debt, which was first reported by Private Eye magazine, is not yet known.\nA Downing Street spokesperson said the claim against the PM was without merit.\n\"An application will be made for an order to set aside the default judgement, to strike out the claim and for a declaration that the claim is totally without merit,\" the spokesperson added. \nThe BBC understands the case relates to a defamation claim against Mr Johnson.\nCounty court judgements are issued in England and Wales when people fail to repay money they owe.\n\"If you get a judgement, this means that the court has formally decided that you owe the money,\" according to a government website.\nA bailiff \"may visit your home if you do not pay your debts\", the website warns.\nBanks and loan companies can also use the information to decide whether to issue credit or loans.\n\"If you're late with your payments, you could be taken back to court and you may have to pay extra costs,\" the website adds.\nAnyone who has had a county court judgement (CCJ) against them can apply for it to be cancelled - or \"set aside\" in the legal language - but they must convince the court that there is a good reason for this to happen and they have also acted promptly in launching their challenge.\nThat could include the judgement having been issued in error - perhaps because the debt had actually been paid, or because there was never a debt in the first place. \nSometimes, people seek to have a CCJ cancelled because they genuinely did not know about it - or they can show the court that it has acted incorrectly in making the order.\nThat can happen when the court has been provided with the wrong address for a debtor who only later learns of the judgement when they discover it has damaged their credit score. \nThe official rules for applications to set aside a judgement state: \"Most applications will require a hearing and you will be expected to attend. The court will allocate a hearing date and time for the application. Please indicate in a covering letter any dates that you are unavailable within the next six weeks.\"\nThe application must come with some kind of \"statement of truth\", explaining why the judgement should be set aside. \nThe prime minister could instruct a lawyer to appear for him.\nApplicants can also ask the court to consider waiving the \u00a3100 fee if it would cause them \"undue hardship\". \nThe prime minister's personal finances have been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.\nIn particular, he has faced questions about how renovations to the flat, above 11 Downing Street, that he shares with fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds were paid for.\nHe has insisted he personally paid for the work, but has declined to say whether he received an initial loan.\nThe Electoral Commission is investigating whether any spending on the flat falls within its remit, and whether any donation to the Conservative Party was properly declared.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the prime minister's spokesman said the court judgement had nothing to do with the Downing Street estate refurbishment, saying: \"All bills have been paid by the government or the prime minister, personally.\" \nAsked if Number 10 had only become aware of the judgement when it was first reported earlier on Wednesday, the spokesman said it was something they are \"looking into currently\".\nAnd on being asked whether there should be concerns about the prime minister's personal finances, Mr Johnson's press secretary said: \"You should not be concerned, no.\""

      "text": "Tributes have been paid to a nine-year-old boy who died after being struck by lightning during a football coaching session.\nThe child, who has been named locally as Jordan Banks, was injured when a thunderstorm hit as he was on a playing field in Blackpool on Tuesday evening.\nFlowers, footballs and messages of condolence have been left at the scene.\nJordan played for Clifton Rangers Junior Football Club, who described him as \"an extraordinary young man\".\nIn a Facebook post, the club said the keen Liverpool FC fan was \"a shining light and an inspiration to everyone that he met\" and \"a strong, determined and courageous young man, who will be missed by everyone\".\n\"We cannot begin to imagine the grief of the family. Our thoughts, prayers, love and hugs go out to them all and to his teammates, friends and coaches who are devastated by the loss,\" it added.\nThe club said it would be working with the FA to support the family and anyone affected by his death.\nLancashire Police said officers were called at about 17:00 BST and Jordan was taken to hospital but died a short time later.\nThey said although enquiries were ongoing it was believed he was struck by lightning.\nFamily members have been among those who have been to the playing field in Common Edge Road to pay tribute.\nMessages of condolence have been written on football shirts and placed at the side of the playing field.\nPeople have also been posting nine footballs on social media in honour of Jordan, using the hashtag #RIPLittleMan.\nOne of Jordan's best friends, CJ, and his father laid flowers and a football on the field.\nThe nine-year-old said: \"We were best friends, we were in the same class.\n\"He was very kind and caring. Football was very important to him. He loved it. He played it every day and at school with me.\"\nAt the scene, BBC correspondent Nick Garnett\nThroughout the day flowers, footballs and football shirts have been left in remembrance of a life snatched away playing the game Jordan Banks loved so much.\nHis family and friends have described him as a \"superstar footballer\", telling me he lived for football and played at every single opportunity he could. \nHe came here after school with a small group of people for specialist training.\nGrassroots football is coming to the end of the season and there were some crucial matches coming up and he was absolutely determined to play.\nJordan raised \u00a33,000 for a mental health charity for his late uncle earlier this year, running 30 miles in 10 days. \nTwo crowdfunding pages have been set up in Jordan's memory, raising more than \u00a320,000.\nOne of them praised his charity work, adding: \"There are no words that could possibly be written to begin to explain the pain the family of Jordan must be feeling.\"\nIt said it was \"time for us to come together as a community and help give back to such an incredibly, thoughtful and caring young lad who has been taken way too soon in a tragic incident\".\nSpirit of Youth Junior FC, which uses the field at the end of School Road in South Shore, said Jordan was understood to have been taking part in a private coaching session.\n\"We are entrenched in the local community, and we will give whatever support is required to both the family and to those that were with him at the time,\" the club added.\nBlackpool Council, which owns the playing fields, said it was flying the town hall's flag at half-mast in tribute to Jordan.\nBlackpool South's MP Scott Benton said he was \"incredibly sorry to hear this tragic and heartbreaking news\".\n\"I'm sure I speak for the whole community when I say that everybody in Blackpool will be thinking of the boy's family and friends at this sad time,\" he said.\nAndy Mellor, from the Blackpool branch of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said the school Jordan attended was a \"very strong school\". \n\"The head and deputy will be making every effort to support pupils and I know the governors will be rallying round as well,\" he said. \nTraining on the playing field has been cancelled until further notice.\nWhile more are injured, on average in the UK two people are killed by lightning every year.\nBBC Weather meteorologist Simon King said lightning was not uncommon, especially during the spring and summer months.  \nThere were an estimated 3,000 lightning strikes across northern England between 16:00 BST and midnight on Tuesday.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Tel Aviv,Palestinian territories",
      "text": "\"Civil war has broken out in Lod.\"\nThat is how Mayor Yair Revivo described the situation after violence exploded in the mixed Arab-Jewish Israeli town, lying 15km (9 miles) south-east of Tel Aviv.\nProtests by Israeli Arabs in the town turned into full-scale riots on Tuesday night. Demonstrators clashed with police and set cars and buildings ablaze, the day after a funeral for a man allegedly shot dead by Jewish residents.\n\"This is a complete loss of control,\" Mr Revivo told Israel's Channel 12 News. \"Synagogues are being burned. Hundreds of cars set alight... The situation is incendiary.\"\nViolence also flared in other cities and towns with sizeable Arab populations - including neighbouring Ramle, Acre, Jaffa, Jisr al-Zarqa and Umm al-Fahm. Police arrested 270 people.\n\"The sight of the pogrom in Lod and the disturbances across the country by an incited and bloodthirsty Arab mob, injuring people, damaging property and even attacking sacred Jewish spaces is unforgiveable,\" President Reuven Rivlin said on Wednesday.\nHe added: \"The silence of the Arab leadership about these disturbances is shameful, giving support to terrorism and rioting and encouraging the rupture of the society in which we live and in which we will continue to live once all this has passed.\"\nA number of Israeli Arab politicians have called for an end to the rioting. \n\"Protests in Arab society are moving in a very dangerous direction, as popular protests have escalated into violence,\" Raam party leader Mansour Abbas was quoted as saying in Haaretz newspaper on Wednesday. \"I call on everyone to behave responsibly and to adhere to the rule of law.\"\nThe unrest follows days of high tensions in Jerusalem, with clashes between Israeli police and Palestinians at a key holy site, and escalating hostilities between Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip and the the Israeli military since Monday night that have left more than 50 people dead.\nIn recent days, Israeli Arabs have staged protests in sympathy with Palestinians in Jerusalem and Gaza. \nDuring protests on Monday in Lod - a third of whose population is Arab - an Arab resident in his 30s, Musa Hassuna, was shot dead and another person seriously injured.\nHaaretz cited a Jewish resident as saying an \"Arab crowd tried to break into the neighbourhood\", and that his neighbours \"were forced to shoot in the air\" because they felt in danger. \nMr Hassuna's father said his son had not gone to protest and that he had been passing through the area when \"they shot him at point-blank\". \nPolice arrested three suspects, who said they had acted in self-defence. \nHundreds attended Mr Hassuna's funeral on Tuesday. Clashes soon broke out with the police, and Israeli media reported that two officers were injured and a police car was set on fire. \nAs night fell the violence escalated and synagogues and businesses were attacked. Reuters news agency said there were also reports of Jews stoning a car driven by an Arab.\nSocial media footage allegedly showed protesters firing on police with an automatic weapon. Officers responded with live rounds. \n\"This is the first time we've seen local residents using weapons, opening fire, and the response from our units has been also using live fire in order to prevent anyone from being killed,\" police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said.\nHaaretz newspaper reports that 12 people were injured in the unrest, with one in a serious condition. \nSeparately, a 52-year-old father and his 16-year-old daughter were killed when a Palestinian rocket fired from Gaza hit their car in Lod. Khalil and Nadin Awad were both Israeli Arabs.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now declared a state of emergency in Lod, granting police more powers there. It is reportedly the first time since 1966 the government has used emergency powers over an Arab community. \n\"It's anarchy from rioters and we cannot accept it,\" Mr Netanyahu told reporters on a visit to the town early on Wednesday, vowing to \"restore law and order with an iron fist\".\n\"I don't feel safe exiting my home,\" Jewish resident Lior Benisti told Channel 12. \"We wanted to go to my sister, we have two small daughters and we decided to stay in tonight even though we don't have a rocket-proof room. Better take the risk of rockets than the mayhem outside.\"\nIn total, about 21% of Israel's population are Israeli Arabs - about 1.96 million people, according to a December report by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. \nDuring the war that surrounded the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, hundreds of thousands of Arabs were forced from or fled their homes. Those who stayed in what became Israel, and their descendants, have been granted citizenship and are known as Israeli Arabs.\nAbout 80% of Israeli Arabs are Muslim, with the rest identifying as either Christian or Druze. Most identify strongly with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, with many calling themselves \"Palestinian citizens of Israel\".\nIsrael's government says its Arab citizens have equal social and political rights, although they are exempt from compulsory military service. \nBut Israeli Arabs themselves say they are treated as second-class citizens who face legal, institutional and social discrimination.\nAuthorities in Lod built a 3m-high (10ft) wall through a part of the town in 2010, separating the Jewish and Arab communities. Officials said it was to reduce crime, but Israeli Arabs said it was an attempt at enforcing segregation."

      "text": "Staff felt intimidated about speaking out on failings at a city council and there were \"credible\" fears for their safety if they did, an inspector says.\nMax Caller told the BBC his report into problems at Liverpool City Council left out the names of those who spoke to him because they worried about reprisals.\nThe report was published in March, and a police investigation continues.\nThe council has said it accepts all the report's findings and it was one of the most difficult periods in its history.\nSetting out its response to the government, the council said it would work with commissioners appointed to oversee parts of the authority.\n\"Although this is one of the most difficult periods in the council's recent history, it is also an opportunity to reset the council as a leading local authority,\" it said.\n\"It provides a platform to shine a light on, and remove, practices and behaviours of both officers and members which have no place in our council.\"\nGovernment inspectors were sent to investigate the Labour-run council after five men were arrested by police investigating allegations of fraud, bribery, corruption, misconduct in public office and witness intimidation at the council. \nThey included then Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson, who has since stood down. All the men deny the allegations.\nOn Saturday, Joanne Anderson - no relation to Mr Anderson - was declared as the city's new mayor.\nMr Caller's review found a dysfunctional council, which frequently did deals that did not provide good value for taxpayers. However, the subsequent report did not include a list of the people who had spoken to the inspection team, which is highly unusual.\nIn his first full interview since the release of the report, Mr Caller told BBC News the need to protect the identity of council staff \"really weighed quite heavily on what we did\". \nStaff \"felt that if they came forward and were named, there would be retribution\", Mr Caller said, adding: \"I came to the conclusion that to protect the individuals I could publish no names.\"\nHe described it as \"serious people\" who had \"serious concerns\", who were \"seriously worried about the outcomes if they were identified as coming forward\".\nTo reassure staff they could talk to his team in confidence, Mr Caller made it known they didn't have to meet him inside the council building, where he was running his investigation.   \nHe said: \"I made it clear to people that we would meet them on street corners. That we would meet them on Zoom. That they didn't have to be seen coming into any meeting room where I was at.\"\nThe BBC has also spoken to council officials who don't want to be identified. They said during the years in question, there was a \"small cabal of people\" ruling the roost at the council. \nThey talked of insidious intimidation, of pressure being put on some staff to make questionable decisions, and of colleagues leaving on the grounds of stress.\nThe government inspection ran alongside a Merseyside Police criminal investigation. It meant Mr Caller wasn't able to publish all of his findings publicly, for fear of prejudicing those proceedings. But he was able to supply the police with material he had uncovered. \nMr Caller is now helping the council work on its recovery plan. He believes there is a hard road ahead, with further setbacks likely, and more revelations to \"creep out of the woodwork\". \nBut he says he is optimistic the council will get back on its feet and \"signal that it's committed to being back in the mainstream of local government\".\nThe council said it would take forward his recommendation to move away from annual elections and to all-out elections every four years. And it said it was considering a motion to bring forward the date of the proposed referendum on a city mayor from 2023 to 2022.\nThe measures will be debated at an extraordinary meeting of the city council next week.\nFollow Judith on Twitter"

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nUp to six people from different households will be able to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales from Monday. As Wales' Covid case rate continues to fall, its first minister, Mark Drakeford, has confirmed indoor hospitality can reopen from 17 May - in line with similar rules in England and Scotland. Mr Drakeford said extra funding will also be made available for hospitality businesses still affected by Covid restrictions to \"support firms and safeguard jobs\". Check Covid rules where you live.\nNext week will see the most significant lifting of restrictions yet in England, with indoor mixing to be allowed. The rest of the UK is making similar steps. It means the onus is increasingly shifting on to the vaccines, rather than social distancing and restrictions, to keep the virus at bay. How well do they work? And is there now enough immunity in the population to protect us all?  Our health correspondent Nick Triggle considers these questions.\nCovid-19 restrictions led to the sharpest fall in violent crime for at least 20 years, a report suggests. Violence was down by a third in England and Wales in 2020 compared with the previous year, according to research by Cardiff University. But the report also found that the easing of restrictions was \"accompanied by rapid increases\" in violence.\nThe BBC's Vikas Pandey has called Delhi home for more than a decade - but life in India's capital has changed beyond recognition under a deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections. In the video below, Vikas and his colleague Anshul Verma take us on a journey through the city, and the daily struggle of finding medical care, oxygen cylinders and even a space at a crematorium. \nFor a 4,000-strong audience, it was the first chance to see live music in more than a year - as The Brits returned to London's O2 Arena on Tuesday. The lights dim, the titles roll, the crowd goes nuts. And then... wait, what? After a year of being forced to watch live music on a screen due to the pandemic, The Brits is opening by... er, making us watch some live music on a screen, says the BBC's music reporter Mark Savage. Take a look how the pilot for the post-Covid era went.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWe'll soon be able to eat and drink inside pubs, restaurants and cafes again but there will still be some restrictions in place.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There will be a public inquiry into the government's handling of the Covid pandemic in the current parliamentary session, Boris Johnson has pledged.\nSpeaking on the first day of a new session of Parliament, the prime minister told MPs he had already made it clear an inquiry was \"essential\".\nHe was responding to a question from Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey \"on behalf of bereaved families\". \nMr Johnson had previously only said there would be an inquiry in future.\nA session of Parliament is typically a year, but can be longer, with one recent session lasting two years.\nThe question about the inquiry came in the Commons debate after the Queen's Speech, which sets out the government's programme for the coming year.\nMr Johnson said: \"I can certainly say that we will do that within this session. Yes, that's absolutely.\n\"I have made that clear before. I do believe it's essential that we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic.\"\nIt was first time Mr Johnson had put a timeframe on when a public inquiry will be held and comes a day after he had confirmed the government had met its four tests for easing lockdown restrictions in England next week. \nThe prime minister said deaths and hospitalisations had dropped to their lowest level since last July.\nThe latest government data released on Tuesday shows a further 20 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there have been 2,474 new cases.\nA total of 18,088,385 people have now received both doses of a vaccine, while 35,587,348 - 67.6% of all adults - have had a first jab.\nLast month, Downing Street told a campaign group there was was \"simply no capacity\" for the government to divert resources to an \"intensive\" inquiry at the current time.\nThe Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group has been lobbying Mr Johnson since last summer to meet them and to launch an urgent independent investigation into the pandemic.\nJo Goodman, co-founder of the group, said: \"An inquiry must begin this summer. The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. \n\"Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future.\"\nShe also urged Mr Johnson to commit to holding a statutory inquiry, where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence under oath.\nDeputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: \"We welcome this commitment and will hold the prime minister to it.\n\"It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework.\"\nThe All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus urged the prime minister to set out a specific timeline and remit for the inquiry, with its vice-chairman, Tory MP Dan Poulter, calling for one focus to be Covid-related deaths in care homes."

      "text": "Hospitality businesses in a town experiencing a fresh spike in Covid cases have told of their concern as pubs and cafes prepare to open indoors.\nBolton has one of the highest instances of the Indian variant in the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s.\nAs lockdown rules prepare to ease on Monday, pubs and restaurants in the town are sounding a note of caution.\nSome are worried about a return to the surges seen in the area last year.\nAngela Baker, owner of Baker's cafe, said over the last week she was increasingly concerned about whether she will be prevented from reopening.\n\"Bolton was shut down last year when rates were high,\" the 40-year-old said. \n\"It raises the question of how long are we going to be open for? It does worry me as I cannot protect my staff.\"\nAlex McVey, owner of Odessa, said he was \"very nervous\" about the situation. \n\"It's sad. I can't believe it,\" he said. \n\"We can't plan anything and our staff, suppliers and customers all feel very uneasy about it. \n\"But we need to reopen, we need to keep going. I'm asking myself again - why Bolton?\"\nJon Peek, the general manager of the Cross Guns Inn, said his team had \"worked tirelessly to meet and exceed all the guidance\".\nMr Peek said he would be reopening, albeit a little later, in June.\n\"We've adapted at every turn to ensure that all our guests can drink and dine in an environment that is safe and secure,\" he said. \n\"We can't wait to welcome people through our doors safely,\" he added.\nThis spike is related to international travel, particularly with people returning to Bolton from India. \nThe cases are now in the community and it seems to be located around the south and south-west parts of the town. \nInterestingly, the cases are very much stacked in those under the age of 25.\nThere were 721 cases reported yesterday in those aged five to 25. \nPart of this is because secondary school children are testing twice a week, but it is very much present in that younger age group.\nThe Greyhound pub's owner, who preferred not to be named, said the rise in cases was \"so daunting\".\n\"You keep on going but then it could change overnight and you've wasted all that money. I'm still planning to open, but I haven't planned as much as I did last year,\" he said.\n\"We are just going to have to run with it. It's so uncertain.\"\nOn Tuesday, Mayor Andy Burnham appealed to the government to allow everyone over the age of 16 in the region to get a vaccine.\nMeanwhile, Bolton Council has urged everyone who is eligible to get the jab.\nThe authority also said more testing sites and a renewed push for vaccine take-up was being rolled-out over the weekend.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "A former English National Ballet principal dancer has been found guilty of sexually assaulting his students.\nYat-Sen Chang attacked girls and women at the English National Ballet and Young Dancers Academy in London between December 2009 and March 2016.\nThe 49-year-old was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault and one count of assault by penetration. He was cleared of one offence.\nHe will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on 18 June.\nJudge Edward Connell told Chang his offending had \"escalated in seriousness\" and warned him he faced a \"lengthy custodial sentence\".\nThe offences related to four females, aged between 16 and 18 at the time, who accused the dancer of touching them inappropriately during massages at the schools.\nThe jury was told Chang, who now lives in the German city of Kiel, had \"used his position\" as a \"famous and revered\" ballet dancer to abuse his students.\n\"For his part, he trusted that his fame and his position would protect him from complaint, or from consequences of his actions,\" prosecutor Joel Smith said.\nChang had denied all the allegations, saying he had \"no idea\" why they had been made.\nAccording to a profile on the Theatre Kiel website, Chang joined the English National Ballet in 1993 and was a principal dancer until 2011. He performed in productions including The Nutcracker, Coppelia and Sleeping Beauty. \nThe Met Police said two of his victims contacted the force in 2016 about assaults that had taken place during private ballet tuition lessons at either his home, the dance school or the ballet school.\nThe other two complainants came forward later with further allegations.\nSpeaking after the court hearing, Det Con Helen Larson described the ballet dancer as \"a dangerous and predatory individual\".\n\"He abused his position of trust and power to prey on them when they were most vulnerable,\" she added.\nChang was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing."

      "tags": "Belfast,The Troubles,Ballymurphy inquest,British Army",
      "text": "More legal action is expected over the deaths of 10 people killed in the Ballymurphy shootings of August 1971.   \nOn Tuesday, an inquest found that ten people killed in west Belfast almost 50 years ago in the wake of an Army operation were \"entirely innocent\".\nThey included a priest trying to help the wounded and a mother of eight.\nNorthern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the UK government must apologise to the families of the victims as a \"bare minimum\".\nShe said the government has been \"exposed for covering up for 50 years the fact that they killed Irish citizens on our streets\".\nStormont Justice Minister Naomi Long and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood have also called for a government apology.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said whatever legacy process is put in place in the future must apply to all families.\nShe said the approach to legacy has to be \"careful\" and must include \"everybody\". She added that other families deserve access to justice and truth \"just as the Ballymurphy families did\".\nSolicitor Paddy Murray, who represents nine of the 10 victims' families, said further legal action is being planned.\n\"One of those avenues is civil proceedings against the Ministry of Defence and, in parallel with the inquest, the families initiated those proceedings,\" he told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"They were stalled pending the outcome of these findings. Given the very critical commentary by the coroner we will be moving forward with some vigour in relation to the civil action.\"\nEileen McKeown, whose father Joseph Corr was one of those shot dead in Ballymurphy, said police should now investigate the killings.\n\"I think it's now in the hands of the police and I think they now need to do what they should have done 50 years ago.\n\"I think the police need to do the job that they're paid to do and investigate the murders.\"\nIn a statement issued after the announcement, a government spokesperson said it would now \"take the time to review the report and carefully consider the conclusions\".\nThe shootings happened after an operation in which paramilitary suspects were detained without trial.\nNine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said. \nHowever, they could not definitively rule who shot the tenth victim, John McKerr.\nMrs Justice Keegan, who delivered her findings over the course of more than two hours, said the deaths took place during Northern Ireland's Troubles in a \"highly charged and difficult environment\".\nThe killings happened over three days immediately following the introduction of internment - the arrest and detention of paramilitary suspects without trial.\nMrs Justice Keegan noted that during that time there was widespread disorder. \nAcross Belfast alone on 9 and 10 August 1971, it was recorded that there were approximately 12 explosions, 59 shooting incidents, 17 reported deaths, 25 reported injuries, 13 incidents of rioting, 18 reports of arson and other reports of civil disorder of various kinds.\nBut Mrs Justice Keegan concluded, to a round of applause: \"What is very clear, is that all of the deceased in the series of inquests were entirely innocent of any wrongdoing on the day in question.\"\nMs O'Neill said the UK goverment must respond and the families \"deserve access to justice\", while Mrs Long said the UK government needed to \"step up and formally apologise\".\n\"We saw how much a similar apology in relation to Bloody Sunday meant to the families there, and I encourage the government to acknowledge the courage of the Ballymurphy families with a similar statement,\" she said.\nSpeaking in parliament, Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said: \"Will this prime minister now finally apologise for what those British forces did by murdering 10 entirely innocent people, or will he continue to pursue an amnesty for their killers?\"\nFormer UK veterans minister Johnny Mercer said that what had happened to the families was \"not fair\" and he welcomed the coroner's findings.\n\"I think we should have a serious look at what happened and I would support an apology to the families of those who died for the way in which they have had to fight to have their loved ones declared innocent,\" he said.\nMr Mercer said he did not support the idea of amnesties, but that the evidential threshold for cases going to court must be looked at \"to avoid the scenes that we saw in the court in Belfast last week\" when the trial of two soldiers accused of murdering Official IRA man Joe McCann collapsed.\nHe said it was a challenge and a standard \"that should be met by any country that wants to call itself a democracy\".\nUlster Unionist Party assembly member Doug Beattie said an an apology by the prime minster \"would be a small step but it would go an awful long way\". \nHe added: \"These families have the absolute right to seek justice. Without a shadow of a doubt, the families, if they want to go down a legal route, they should be allowed to go down that legal route.\"\nLord Dennett, a former head of the Army, said an apology \"was not inappropriate\". However, he added it was not for him \"to say that\".\nMrs Justice Keegan said the effects of the killings on the families of the 10 victims had been \"stark\". \nInquests were held into the deaths in 1972, but they were separate and returned open verdicts. \nThe new inquests, which began in November 2018, have been held together.\nThe court heard almost 100 days of evidence from more than 150 witnesses. \nThese included more than 60 former soldiers, more than 30 civilians and experts in ballistics, pathology and engineering.

      "text": "Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, is to serve the rest of his life sentence in a British jail.\nThe Foreign Office said he would be transferred to a UK prison from a UN detention unit in the Netherlands.\nKaradzic, 75, was also found guilty at his 2016 criminal tribunal of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nHis original 40-year sentence was increased at an appeal hearing in 2019.\nHis conviction for genocide related to his responsibility for the murder of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995. \nIt was considered one of the worst massacres in Europe since World War Two.\nJudges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia also held Karadzic responsible for the siege of Sarajevo, a campaign of shelling and sniping which lasted more than three years and led to the deaths of an estimated 10,000 civilians.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"Radovan Karadzic is one of the few people to have been found guilty of genocide...\n\"We should take pride in the fact that, from UK support to secure his arrest, to the prison cell he now faces, Britain has supported the 30-year pursuit of justice for these heinous crimes.\"\nMr Raab described Srebrenica as \"the darkest moment in European history since the Holocaust\".\n\"I think we have got a moral duty and I think we have a sense of national purpose in trying to hold to account the perpetrators of the very worst crimes,\" Mr Raab said.\n\"Back since Nuremburg [the trials of Nazi leaders in the German city after World War Two] we have played that role.\"\nHe added: \"If we want to deter these kind of crimes from happening, if we want to give justice to the many thousands of victims, I think it is right we do our bit.\" \nThe UK was one of the signatories to enforcement agreements with the United Nations for sentences passed by its tribunals related to the former Yugoslavia.\nUN officials confirmed they had asked the UK to \"enforce the sentence\".\nThey did not provide a date for the move but said \"all necessary measures\" should be taken \"to facilitate Karadzic's transfer... as expeditiously as possible\".\nThe conflict in the former Yugoslavia stemmed from tensions among ethnic groups, following the death of President Tito in 1980.\nCalls for more autonomy led in 1991 to declarations of independence in Croatia and Slovenia and fighting with the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army. \nBosnia, with a complex mix of Serbs, Muslims and Croats, was next to try for independence. Bosnia's Serbs, backed by Serbs elsewhere in Yugoslavia, resisted.\nKaradzic, a former psychiatrist, was president of the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War in the 1990s.\nAfter the war, he hid for years - masquerading as an expert in alternative medicine - before his eventual arrest in Serbia in 2008.\nIn November 2017, former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic was sentenced to life in prison on similar charges of war crimes and genocide. A ruling in an appeal against his conviction is to be announced next month in The Hague.\nBritain was involved in the hunt, trial and conviction of Radovan Karadzic. And now it is taking responsibility for enforcing the sentence handed down to him. \nBritish intelligence played a role in his capture in Belgrade in 2008 after 13 years on the run. British judges and lawyers were involved in the trial against him at a United Nations tribunal that the UK helped to set up. \nOne of the young lawyers who drafted the legal procedure to transfer Karadzic to the UK was a certain Dominic Raab, who is now the Foreign Secretary - and who ultimately agreed to the request from the UN that the former Bosnian Serb leader should serve out his term in a British jail. \nOfficials say the reason the UK agreed is because it is on the list of UN members willing to detain those found guilty of global crimes, and it wished to show its continued support for the international rules-based order. \nThe UK will bear the costs of Karadzic's detention but any decision about whether he is released before his death would be a matter for the UN authorities in The Hague. \nKaradzic will not be the first foreign national convicted of war crimes to have been held in a UK prison.\nFive men convicted of war crimes by the tribunals for the former Yugoslavia have been sent to British high-security prisons in the past. \nThey included former Bosnian-Serb general Radislav Krstic, who was stabbed by three Muslim prisoners at Wakefield jail in 2010 in apparent retaliation for Srebrenica.\nKrstic was moved to a prison in Poland in 2014.\nThe UK had also offered to jail the former President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, when he was on trial in The Hague on charges of war crimes and genocide. But he died in 2006 before the legal proceedings were completed.\nIn a separate arrangement, ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor is serving a 50-year war sentence in the UK following a war crimes conviction by a UN-backed special court, for aiding rebels who committed atrocities in Sierra Leone during its civil war."

      "text": "A search has begun to find the family of a soldier executed by German troops in a cemetery during World War Two.\nThe soldier, who was a 51st Highlander, had managed to evade capture by hiding with a local family after the Battle of St Valery-en-Caux in June 1940.\nHowever, after several weeks he was found by German troops who marched him through the French town, forced him to dig his own grave then shot him.\nOne of the few clues to his identity is the name Keller Len Scott.\nIt was written on a piece of paper by the family who gave the soldier refuge, but its meaning is not clear. \nEfforts to find out who the soldier was and trace anyone of that name or surviving family have so far proved fruitless, prompting a public appeal for help.\nWhat was known about the soldier was that he was married and had two daughters at the time of his death.\nThe battle in the French port of St Valery-en-Caux followed the mass evacuation of British and Allied troops at Dunkirk.\nTroops of the 51st Highland Division mounted a \"last stand\" before being killed or forced to surrender by the Germans.\nAfter the war, what is believed to be the soldier's body was moved, along with other casualties of the battle, to a Franco-British military cemetery in the town. \nThe executed Highlander was eventually buried as an unknown soldier.\nThe piece of paper bearing the name Keller Len Scott was passed into the care of Patrick Prieur, a 65-year-old St Valery resident whose grandparents and father lived in the town during the war.\nMr Prieur's family played a part, along with others, in trying to keep the soldier hidden.\nMr Prieur said: \"His death deeply upset the townspeople - who had been aware of his hiding - and especially my father, who was only 11 at the time.\n\"His grave is marked as 'Known unto God', and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.\"\nHe added: \"My father had been gifted a piece of paper on which the soldier's name was written, and this became his prized possession.\n\"He desperately wanted to find the soldier's family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest.\"\nFollowing his own attempts to learn more about the soldier, Mr Prieur contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces' and Cadets' Association for help in tracing the soldier's relatives.\nThe organisations, along with veterans charity Legion Scotland, have taken their search as far as they can and have now appealed to the public for help.\nMichelle McKearnon, of the Highland Reserve Forces' and Cadets' Association, said: \"We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier's identity but only got so far. \n\"We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.\"\nShe added: \"We're now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.\" \nThe Battle of  St Valery-en-Caux\nIn January 1940, the 51st Highland Division landed in France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).\nIn the months that followed, the BEF, along with elements of the French army, were pushed back to northern France by attacking German forces.\nThe Highland division became separated from the BEF and while hundreds of thousands of expeditionary soldiers headed for Dunkirk, the 51st was ordered to \"hold the line\" with the French army in St Valery.\nOver the course of a few days, almost 340,000 British and French troops were famously evacuated from the beach at Dunkirk.\nThe 51st, meanwhile, was fighting a losing battle.\nOn 12 June 1940, about 10,000 men from the 51st Highland Division were captured, along with French soldiers. Soldiers of the division were forced marched to prisoner of war camps, where most spent the rest of the war.\nVeterans included Donald Smith, the sole survivor of a group of friends who joined the Seaforth Highlanders, which was part of the 51st.\nHe told BBC Scotland last year: \"I get very emotional when I think of them.\n\"They were true friends. To think I was the only one to come back is hard to describe unless you are in my shoes.\"\nMr Smith, originally from Yorkshire and lived in Forres, Moray, died earlier this year at the age of 100."

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel",
      "text": "Israel has declared a state of emergency in the central city of Lod after rioting by Israeli Arabs, as conflict between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants intensified.\nCars were set alight and a father and daughter - both Israeli Arabs - died when a rocket from Gaza hit their car.\nPalestinian militants fired hundreds of rockets deep into Israel, while Israel carried out heavy air strikes on Gaza.\nAt least 40 people have died in some of the worst violence in years.\nIsrael's military says it is targeting militants in Gaza in response to rocket attacks on Jerusalem and other areas.\nMore than 1,000 rockets have been fired towards central and southern Israel by Palestinian militants since Monday evening, when hostilities suddenly escalated, the Israeli army said.\nThe Palestinian militants said they targeted the Israeli city of Tel Aviv after an Israeli air strike demolished a tower block in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday.\nA second tower block collapsed in the territory after another Israeli strike.\nResidents were warned to evacuate the 12-storey al-Jawhara Tower. However, health officials say there were still civilian deaths.\nMore than 200 rockets were fired at Tel Aviv and Beersheba after the tower attack, Palestinian militants said\nThe fighting came after weeks of rising tensions that were stoked by violent confrontations between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters at a site in Jerusalem that is holy to both Muslims and Jews.\nThe international community has urged both sides to end the escalation. The UN's Middle East peace envoy, Tor Wennesland, said they were \"escalating towards a full-scale war\".\nAt least 35 Palestinians, including 10 children, and five Israelis have been killed in the violence so far, according to health officials and medics.\nProtests by Israeli Arabs broke out in Lod, a city near Tel Aviv, and escalated to full-scale rioting, with protesters throwing rocks at police, who responded with stun grenades. \nThe protests followed the funeral of an Israeli Arab man who died during unrest in the city a day earlier.\nAt least 12 people were injured in the clashes, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported. As night fell, the situation degenerated in Lod, police said. \nOn Wednesday morning, a 52-year-old father and his 16-year-old daughter were killed when a rocket fired from Gaza hit their car, also seriously injuring the mother, according to the Times of Israel.\nIsraeli media reported that synagogues and several businesses had been set on fire, while Reuters news agency said there were reports of Jews stoning a car that was being driven by an Arab resident.\nOn Tuesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod. Israeli border police have been brought in from the West Bank.  \nThe Times of Israel said this was the first time the government had used emergency powers over an Arab community since 1966.\nThe conflict between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants in Gaza has stirred unrest among the Arab minority inside Israel, leading to protests. \nThere has also been unrest in other cities with a large Israeli Arab population, as well as in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. \n\"All of Israel should know, this is a complete loss of control,\" Lod Mayor Yair Revivo was quoted as saying by the Times of Israel newspaper. \"Civil war has erupted in Lod.\"\nMr Netanyahu, who went to the city to call for calm, said he would impose a curfew if necessary.\nAfter two days of hostilities, rocket fire by Palestinian militants and air strikes by the Israeli military continued unabated on Wednesday morning.\nIn a tweet, Israel's military said it had struck \"a number of significant terror targets\" across the Gaza Strip in response to hundreds of rockets. The strikes were the biggest since 2014, it said.\nA high-rise building, homes and offices used by Palestinian militant leaders in Gaza were among the targets hit by fighter jets, Israel's military said.\nMeanwhile, Palestinian militant groups continued to fire rocket barrages into Israel. Loud booms and air-raid sirens were heard across targeted cities, which included Tel Aviv, Ashkelon, Modiin, and Beersheba.\nFor days, Palestinian militants have been launching hundreds of rockets towards Israeli cities in an apparent attempt to overwhelm missile defences.\nEarlier on Tuesday Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, said it had launched rockets at Tel Aviv and its suburbs in response to \"the enemy's targeting of residential towers\". \nVideo footage from the city shows rockets streaking through the night sky, some exploding as they are hit by Israeli interceptor missiles.\nIn the Tel Aviv suburb of Holon, a rocket hit an empty bus, Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld told AFP news agency. A girl of five and two women, one 50 and one 30, were injured in the town.\nBen Gurion airport briefly halted flights on Tuesday and an energy pipeline between the cities of Eilat and Ashkelon was hit.\nThe rockets were launched after the destruction of the Hanadi Tower in Gaza, which houses an office used by the political leadership of Hamas.\nIsraeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said the Israeli strikes were \"just the beginning\".\n\"Terror organisations have been hit hard and will continue to be hit because of their decision to hit Israel,\" he said. \"We'll return peace and quiet, for the long term.\"\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said the group was \"ready\" if Israel chose to escalate.\n\"If [Israel] wants to escalate, we are ready for it, and if it wants to stop, we're also ready,\" he said in a televised address. \"There is a new balance of force.\"\nThe fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. \nThe site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded.\nPalestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in mid-April.\nIt was further fuelled by an expected court ruling on the fate of the families in Sheikh Jarrah - ultimately postponed because of the unrest - and Israel's annual celebration on Monday of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day.\nThe fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. \nPalestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own.\nAre you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

I have now been advised that this is not the case, and that I am disqualified as a PCC candidate. I have therefore withdrawn,\" he said.\nLiberal Democrat candidate Liz Webster, who came second after securing 17% of the vote in the first round and a combined total of 27%, said she wanted to know when the Conservative Party knew Mr Seed was ineligible to stand.\n\"It's going to cost the taxpayer \u00a31.4m to re-run the election, and there will obviously have to be a further police inquiry and, depending on the outcome, it may be a case for the Crown Prosecution Service,\" she said.\nA Conservative spokesman said: \"As there are ongoing police enquiries into this matter, we will not be commenting further at this stage.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Police are searching for a body at a cafe in Gloucester linked to a girl feared to have been murdered by serial killer Fred West. \nMary Bastholm, 15, went missing on 6 January 1968 and has not been found. \nOfficers were called to The Clean Plate by filmmakers working on a documentary. West was a regular customer when the teenager worked at the cafe.\nThe film crew told police on Friday they had found evidence that a body could be buried within the property. \nOfficers could be at the site \"for a number of weeks\" and excavation work is yet to begin, Gloucestershire Police said.\nAssistant Chief Constable Craig Holden said: \"This could be a significant development on a case which has gained a lot of public interest over the years.\n\"On the basis of the information provided to us, we consider this to be new and potentially important evidence in the case of Mary Bastholm, however further detailed assessments will take place over the following few days to determine the extent of excavation needed.\n\"First and foremost our thoughts are with Mary's family and we would ask that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.\"\nIn a statement released via the force, Miss Bastholm's family said: \"We are aware of the ongoing developments around Mary's disappearance and are being kept up to date and supported by Gloucestershire Police family liaison officers.\n\"At this time please may we ask for privacy so we can grieve for Mary.\"\nA white tent has been set up outside the building in Southgate Street and officers are stationed at the scene. \nThe cafe is close to Cromwell Street, where officers found the bodies of West's victims at the home he shared with his wife Rosemary.\nA spokesperson for The Nelson Trust, a women's charity that owns The Clean Plate, said: \"As soon as we were made aware of the situation, we have done everything we can to accommodate the investigation.\n\"The Clean Plate will remain closed until all necessary activity is complete. \"It is an extraordinary twist of fate that this building, now associated with a story as tragic as that of the victims of Fred and Rosemary West, is part of a charity working to support women at risk from violence.\"\nBy Andrew Plant, BBC News\nMary Bastholm disappeared at a bus stop on her way to meet her boyfriend.\nThere has been no trace of her since. It's been a mystery for 53 years.\nThe cafe has been there for decades and has been under several different names.\nOne of its waitresses was Mary, who was 15 at the time when Fred West was a regular customer and was known to him.\nIt was also known he was a builder at the time renovation was needed on the cellar and the toilets at the cafe - work he was believed to have carried out in 1968.\nA lot of people locally put two and two together and suggested that perhaps he was responsible for her disappearance and that was where she ended up.\nPolice say their activity will take place over a number of weeks and there will be disruption for some time.\nIn 2012, a petition was set up calling for a fresh investigation into Miss Bastholm's disappearance but it was rejected by then Chief Constable Tony Melville.\nIn 1994, West admitted murdering his daughter Heather.\nThe confession came as police began to search 25 Cromwell Street, where they found the bodies of nine girls and young women. \nHe and his wife Rose were jointly charged with nine murders and he was charged with a further three.\nWest took his own life while awaiting the murder trial the following year."

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The UK economy shrank by 1.5% in the first three months of 2021, but gathered speed in March as lockdown restrictions began to ease, official figures show. \nThe reopening of schools and strong retail spending helped the economy grow 2.1% in March, its fastest monthly growth since last August.\nBut the economy is still 8.7% smaller than it was before the pandemic.\nHowever, March marked a possible turning point, economists suggested.\nTej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, predicted the UK economy was now on course for a bumper bounce-back this year.\n\"The first quarter should mark the low point for the economy in 2021,\" said Mr Parikh. \"The lockdown, and added costs of navigating new trading terms with the EU, limited many businesses' trading activities at the start of the year.\"\nThe UK economy suffered a  record annual slump in 2020 as coronavirus restrictions hit output and 2021 started off equally downbeat.\nThe reintroduction of restrictions in January led to a fall in business investment and household consumption expenditure, according to the ONS.\nHowever, schools reopening on 8 March triggered an uplift in retail sales and sectors such as construction and manufacturing remained resilient, growing strongly in March. \nBusinesses also continued to adapt and make themselves Covid secure.\nThe vaccine rollout, the extension of support measures at the Budget, and the roadmap to reopen the economy have led to expectations that the UK economy will rebound strongly this year.\nBut there are concerns about long term damage. \nSuren\u202fThiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"The first quarter decline should be followed by a robust rebound in the second quarter as the effects of the release of pent-up demand, as restrictions ease and the strong vaccine rollout, are fully felt. \n\"However, with the longer-term economic damage caused by coronavirus likely to increasingly weigh on activity as government support winds down, the recovery may be slower than many, including the Bank of England, currently predict.\"\u202f \nAlpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, said that households and businesses have adapted better to working and living under Covid restrictions \"despite the brutal cost of doing so\".\nBut Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Samuel Tombs pointed out that the UK's economic growth was still the slowest of the Group of Seven (G7) rich countries, for the fourth quarter in a row.\nGDP looks on course to grow by 5% between April and June \"which should mean that the UK finally hands over the wooden spoon to another G7 economy\", he added.\nOn Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the the BBC the economy was \"getting back on track\".\n\"Despite a difficult start to this year, economic growth in March is a promising sign of things to come,\" he added.\nEarlier this month, the Bank of England said it expected the UK economy to enjoy its fastest growth in more than 70 years this year, as restrictions are lifted.\nBut it cut its forecast for 2022 from 7.25% to 5.75%, suggesting the government was likely to raise taxes to pay for its huge pandemic-support programmes. \nOfficial trade figures, published at the same time as growth figures, showed a shift away from trading with EU countries since Brexit.\n\"Imports from Europe remained sluggish in the first three months of the year, being outstripped by non-EU imports for the first time on record,\" said ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan.\nNew Brexit trading rules between the EU and the UK came into effect at the beginning of January.\nIn the January to March quarter, the UK's exports to the EU fell 18.1% to \u00a332.2bn, while exports to non-EU countries rose by 0.4% to \u00a341.1bn, compared with the previous quarter.\nThe value of imports from the EU fell by 21.7% to \u00a350.6bn, and imports from non-EU countries fell by 0.9% to \u00a353.2bn.\nThe ONS said the UK's total trade deficit, excluding precious metals, narrowed by \u00a38.4bn to \u00a31.4bn.\nMr Sunak told the BBC the government has invested \"hundreds of millions of pounds to help businesses adjust to those new trading arrangements and support them in the process\".\n\"We've always said there will be a period of adjustment and that's what you're seeing,\" he added.\nIn ordinary times a 1.5% quarterly hit would be considered a considerable economic fall. In context of a further national shutdown, it shows some resilience in the UK economy. \nBusinesses, particularly manufacturing and construction, were beginning to work out how to cope with pandemic restrictions. The good news is that by the end of the quarter the rebound was starting.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is not getting carried away with euphoria about the fastest growth in decades. The Treasury is well aware that this is mostly the arithmetic consequence of the bounce back from a sharp hit in 2020. \nThe ONS showed that the economic hole in the UK caused by the pandemic still does not compare favourably with other major economies, with the US, for example, having recovered all lost output. \nMr Sunak points to the much better than expected unemployment figures as the result of the furlough scheme. There is still uncertainty about how the global economy will respond to new waves of the pandemic. The chancellor is not changing the plan for tax rises on business. "

      "tags": "Social media,Ofcom",
      "text": "Social media firms will have to remove harmful content quickly or potentially face multi-billion-pound fines under new legislation.\nThe government's Online Safety Bill, announced in the Queen's Speech, comes with a promise of protecting debate.\nIt is \"especially\" geared at keeping children safe and says \"democratically important\" content should be preserved.\nBut campaigners say the plans will lead to censorship, while others warn fines do not go far enough.\nThe draft legislation, previously known as the Online Harms Bill, has been two years in the making.\nIt covers a huge range of content to which children might fall victim - including grooming, revenge porn, hate speech, images of child abuse and posts relating to suicide and eating disorders.\nBut it goes much further, taking in terrorism, disinformation, racist abuse and pornography, too.\nLate additions to the bill include provisions to tackle online scams, such as romance fraud and fake investment opportunities.\nIt will not include fraud via advertising, emails or cloned websites.\nDigital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the \"ground-breaking laws\" would usher in \"a new age of accountability for tech\".\nAnd Home Secretary Priti Patel added the scam provisions would help fight \"ruthless criminals who defraud millions of people\".\nNew details published about the government's Online Safety Bill again emphasise its commitments to enforce social media sites to better protect users from online harm. That includes child sexual exploitation, racist abuse, terrorism - and harmful disinformation on social media. \nI've spent the past year investigating the very real-world harm myths and conspiracy theories shared online - about the pandemic, vaccines, and elections - can cause offline. \nUnder the proposals, social media sites will be required to act on harmful content like this - even when legal. Otherwise, they'll find themselves at risk of fines or even criminal action from regulator Ofcom. \nThe line between free speech and harm posed by misleading posts online has been a tricky one to tread for tech companies - and with a nod to the on-going debate, the bill highlights the importance of freedom of expression on social media.\nWhile more concrete plans will be welcomed by critics of the social media giants, the government has come under fire for repeated delays to this legislation. \nBut those who I've interviewed - who have already been impacted by online conspiracies - would argue this comes too late to protect them and their loved ones. \nThe government has added a new duty of care for social-media sites to protect content defined as \"democratically important\". This includes content promoting or opposing government policy or a political party ahead of a vote, election or referendum.\nContext will also need to be taken into account when moderating political content.\nWhile content on news publishers' websites is not part of the legislation, articles shared on social media are. \nSocial-media firms should offer a fast-track appeals process if journalistic content is removed, both from professional and \"citizen\" journalists, it says.\nBut campaigners remain unhappy.\nRuth Smeeth, the chief executive of the Index on Censorship who has personal experience of online abuse, described the bill as a \"censor's charter... outsourced to Silicon Valley\".\nThe former Labour MP added that \"targeting the platforms rather than the perpetrators of hate seems a strange proposed solution\".  \nJim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, warned the idea that speech was \"inherently harmful\" and needed to be controlled by private companies was \"very dangerous\".\nThe government said companies would need to \"put in place safeguards for freedom of expression\" and have effective routes for users to appeal. \nUsers will also be able to appeal directly to Ofcom.\nOfcom will issue codes of practice outlining the systems and processes that companies need to adopt in order to be compliant.\nThe government has already published codes on terrorism and child sexual exploitation because of their serious nature.\nThe largest and most popular social-media sites - described as category-one services - will need to state explicitly in their terms and conditions how they will address so-called legal harms.\nOfcom will be able to issue fines of up to \u00a318m or 10% of global turnover, whichever is higher, if firms fail to comply with the new rules.\nIt will also have the power to block access to sites in the UK, the government said.\nSome campaigners do not think so. \nTech entrepreneur Belinda Parmar said: \"The ambition is great. The regulator is going to have teeth, but no codes of practice for non-legal harms have yet been published, and it is all very vague.\"\nOthers have said fines do not go far enough, including the NSPCC which has called for the senior managers of tech firms to be made criminally liable for harmful content. \nLabour called the proposals \"watered down and incomplete\" and said the new rules would do \"very little\" to ensure children are safe online.\nThe government has reserved the powers for Ofcom to pursue criminal action \"if tech companies fail to live up to their new responsibilities\". A review will take place two years after the new regime is operational.\nIan Russell, father of Molly, who killed herself in 2017 after viewing thousands of posts about suicide and self-harm on social media, said he hoped the new law would \"focus the minds of the tech platforms\" to change their corporate culture and to reduce online harms. \nThere has been frustration that the legislation, first conceived by Theresa May's government back in April 2019, has taken a long time to come to fruition.\nThe bill will now be examined by MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, whose chairman, Julian Knight, said it would be pressing for the legislation \"to be given top priority\"."

      "text": "Around a million text messages are being sent to 38 and 39-year-olds in England, inviting them to book an appointment for a Covid vaccine.\nBooking will open from 07:00 on Thursday on the NHS website.\nPregnant women will be directed to centres offering Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, NHS England says.\nNearly three-quarters of people in their 40s have had one dose, while a third of all adults have had two doses.\nIn line with guidance from the UK's vaccines committee last week, NHS England said people 39 and under without an underlying health condition would be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, as an alternative to AstraZeneca.\nThe decision came after a review found younger people had a slightly higher risk of an extremely rare blood clot after receiving a first dose of the AZ vaccine. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said adults aged 18-39 could be offered an alternative \"if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nThe committee advised that pregnant women should be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines where available, at the same time as other people their age, because data on these jabs had not raised any safety concerns.\nBut pregnant women have complained that booking an appointment to get those vaccines was a struggle.\nThere is currently a lack of data on the AstraZeneca vaccine in pregnancy - but this could change in the future.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"I urge everybody to get the vaccine as soon as they are eligible to protect yourself and your loved ones.\"\nPeople can book their appointment at a vaccination centre, pharmacy or GP site available through the national booking service.\nText invitations will appear as an alert from 'NHSvaccine' and include a link to the NHS website.\nThose who cannot go online can call the service on 119 to book a jab.\nIn Scotland, people aged 40 and over are being vaccinated while, in Wales, some health boards are invited people in their 30s.\nIn Northern Ireland, people aged 30-39 can book their first dose appointment."

      "title": "Covid: Lessons to be learned from spring 2022 public inquiry - PM",
      "tags": "Coronavirus public inquiry,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government is \"fully committed to learning the lessons at every stage\" of the pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nHe told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022.\nThe inquiry would place \"the state's actions under the microscope\", he added, and take evidence under oath.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the inquiry could not start earlier, such as later in 2021.\nBut addressing the Commons, the prime minister said the inquiry could not \"inadvertently distract\" those within the NHS and government advisers, who were continuing to deal with the pandemic. \nThe inquiry's terms of reference have not yet been defined but would be published in \"due course\", he said, adding that the devolved administrations would be consulted. \nOn Wednesday the UK reported another 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 2,284 coronavirus cases.\nMr Johnson acknowledged many bereaved families would want the inquiry to begin sooner, but said because of the threat of new variants and a possible winter surge in infections, spring next year would be the \"right moment\".\nHe said the \"new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here\".\n\"Should these [variants] prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January.\"\nBolton has one of the highest instances of the Indian variant in the UK and is seeing a particularly sharp rise in cases among unvaccinated under-25s.\nHealth officials in Glasgow have expressed concern about a rising number of Covid cases in the city - the latest public case rate is 58.3 per 100,000, well above a key threshold for easing restrictions. \nMore than 127,600 people have died in the UK with coronavirus, making it one of the worst affected countries by number of deaths.  \nThe inquiry is expected to examine the government's handling of the pandemic, including the timing of its decision to impose lockdowns. \nMr Johnson told MPs the inquiry would be established on a \"statutory basis\" - where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence and provide relevant material under oath.  \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for clarification on whether the inquiry would be formally opened in spring next year or whether that will be when work begins to establish the inquiry.\nIn response, Mr Johnson said the preparatory work to establish the terms of reference and the inquiry chairman \"will happen before the spring of next year\".\nMr Johnson - who has set out plans to ease some of England's coronavirus restrictions on 17 May - said: \"The end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic.\"\nHe added: \"The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year.\"\nA WHO report released on Wednesday said the organisation should have declared a global emergency earlier than it did, and that individual governments failed to act quickly enough. \nMost leading healthcare systems struggled to get to grips with Covid in the early stages. France, Italy and Spain had similar challenges to the UK.\nThe inquiry will look at the extent to which the experience here mirrored that of other countries and how decisions and policies affecting outcomes were different. \nKey questions will include preparedness and why before last year health chiefs only \"war-gamed\" a serious flu epidemic. \nWhy were PPE supplies so inadequate and why then was procurement so flawed? \nWhy was testing and tracing dropped because of lack of capacity in the early stages of the pandemic? \nThere will be intense scrutiny of the decision to fully lock down only on 23 March last year when dire warnings about the NHS being potentially overwhelmed had come more than a week earlier. \nDifferent approaches to opening up in the UK's nations will be considered. \nThe biggest question is likely to be why the UK had one of the highest Covid death rates relative to the population of any major economy. \nThe inquiry will need to consider whether this might be the result of misguided official decision making - or a consequence of underlying inequalities and poor health in disadvantaged communities, and perhaps under-investment in public health. \nThe Liberal Democrats, who were calling for a public inquiry in June 2020, said the planned timing of the inquiry meant the government were \"getting away from\u2026 early accountability\".  \nMeanwhile, Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the inquiry must involve families from the start, allowing them to help to choose the chair as well as determining the terms of reference.\nShe said spring 2022 was \"simply too late to begin\".\n\"It sounds like common sense when the prime minister says that an inquiry can wait until the pandemic is over, but lives are at stake with health experts and scientists warning of a third wave later this year.\n\"A rapid review in summer 2020 could have saved our loved ones who died in the second wave in winter.\"\nAlong with the Lib Dems, the campaign group called on the government to release an internal \"lessons learned\" investigation into its handling of the pandemic.\nDowning Street confirmed an \"informal\" review of its response has been carried out but declined to say whether it would be published.\nFran Hall, who had only been married three weeks to her long-term partner when she lost him to Covid last year, called for a \"rapid review\".\nShe told the BBC: \"That is something that can be done in a matter of weeks, that wouldn't tie up people's time to the degree that a full judge-led inquiry would.\n\"That would hopefully begin to get some quick answers to some of the very pressing questions.\"\nDame Deirdre Hine - the author of the independent review into the swine flu pandemic - told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"Looking at what will have to be the terms of reference and the ground it [the inquiry] has to cover; I can't see it reporting in less than two to three years.\"\nProfessor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired an inquiry into the deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery, warned against placing a time limit on the inquiry.\nHe told the BBC's Newscast podcast: \"What's got to be worked out are the mechanics. Who's going to chair it? Is he or she going to sit with others? Is it going to be time limited? That would be a disaster. It must be done as expeditiously as possible, but never put a time limit on it because you never know what circumstances will arise.\"\nIn the Commons, Mr Johnson also confirmed a commission on Covid commemoration is to be established to help remember those who lost their lives during the pandemic.\nHe added he \"wholeheartedly\" supported the plan for a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, describing it as \"a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital\".\nIn response to a question from Conservative MP Felicity Buchan on the government's work-at-home advice, Mr Johnson said it was \"certainly\" the intention to lift the guidance on 21 June, but the government would \"say that with more clarity a bit later on\".\nEveryone who can work from home must do so under the current government advice.\nOn Thursday, England's Covid vaccination programme will open to those aged 38 and 39, with the NHS website to be updated at 07:00 BST.\nPregnant women will also be able to book through the national booking service from Thursday and will be directed to vaccination centres offering Pfizer and Moderna in their local area - in line with guidance from the UK's vaccine advisers.\nMore than 18.4m people - 35% of the adult population - have now received both doses of a vaccine, with 35.7m people having received one jab."

      "tags": "Ovarian cancer,Cancer",
      "text": "A major trial to detect one of the most elusive and deadly cancers - ovarian - has failed to save lives, after two decades of work. \nThe researchers, at University College London, said the results were a disappointment - and thanked the 200,000 people who participated. \nThe trial had looked promising, with annual blood tests detecting cases of ovarian cancer earlier.\nBut routine screening for the cancer is now a distant prospect. \nOvarian cancer is tricky to diagnose because the symptoms are easily mistaken for less serious health problems. \nThey include:\n\"Some women are diagnosed so late they are too sick to start treatment,\" the trial's lead investigator,  Prof Usha Menon, said. \nAnd two out of every three patients die within a decade of diagnosis.\nThe UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening - the largest in the world - tracked levels of CA125, a chemical released by ovarian tumours, in the blood and sent participants in whom they were rising for an ultrasound scan.\nAnd this led to:\nBut the final results, published in the Lancet medical journal, showed the screening had failed to save lives. \nProf Menon told BBC News: \"I was hoping there'd be something in this - it is disappointing news.\n\"It is about not giving up at this point - we have suffered a setback and need to get up and march forward again.\"\nThere is some evidence the cases detected earlier than usual were still highly aggressive and hard to treat. \nAnd the researchers say they may need to find cancers even earlier and in even more women to affect survival rates. \nScientists hoping to detect ovarian cancer early are now looking at other chemicals in the blood, fragments of DNA released by tumours and exosomes - microscopic fatty spheres break off cancerous cells.\nBut these would have to go through the same long-term, large-scale trials. \n\"Realistically, this means we have to reluctantly accept that population screening for ovarian cancer is more than a decade away,\" Prof Ian Jacobs, from the University of New South Wales, said.\n\"This is deeply disappointing and frustrating given the hope of all involved that we would save the lives of thousands of women.\"\nAbout 4,000 people die from ovarian cancer every year in the UK alone. \nCancer Research UK chief executive Michelle Mitchell said people needed to be more aware of the symptoms. \n\"Symptoms of ovarian cancer can be quite vague [so] whether it's needing to go to the toilet more often, pain, bloating or something else, raise it with your GP,\" she said.\n\"In most cases it won't be cancer - but it's best to get it checked out.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"
