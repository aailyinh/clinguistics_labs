      "text": "An estimated 170,000 car insurance claims in 15 months are suspected to have been linked to \"crash for cash\" gangs, investigations suggest.\nCrash for cash is the name given to a fraud when criminals deliberately cause a road collision to claim compensation.\nThe Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), which shares intelligence within the sector, said that parts of Birmingham were the centre of these cases.\nInsurers said the fraud cost meant premiums increased for all motorists.\nThe IFB said there were 2.7 million motor insurance claims across the UK from October 2019 to the end of last year, of which 170,000 could be linked to suspected crash for cash networks.\nIt said the main hotspots were the B25, B34 and B8 postcode areas of Birmingham, and the BD7 and BD3 areas of Bradford.\nIt hoped that by pinpointing crash for cash hotspots, people would be encouraged to be vigilant as more drivers start to take to the roads. \nMany innocent drivers are caught up in these collisions.\nIFB investigations have found single gangs can be behind thousands of orchestrated collisions in some areas, with the combined value of their fraudulent claims running into the millions.\nJames Dalton, director of general insurance policy at the Association of British Insurers (ABI), said: \"These criminal gangs are often highly organised and put lives at risk. \n\"The amounts that they fraudulently claim can be huge, and can impact on the motor premiums paid by honest motorists.\"\nBetween 2011 to 2018, more than 150 people were convicted in south Wales for submitting bogus claims, as part of a \u00a32m car insurance scam.\nThe Yandell family's \"crash for cash\" swindle went undetected for years due to the sheer number of people they roped into the scam.\nIt centred around using vehicles in staged accidents so the fraudsters could submit bogus and exaggerated insurance claims."

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Most of Scotland will move to level two next Monday in the latest easing of Covid restrictions.\nThe new changes mean that three households will be be able to mix indoors and pubs can serve alcohol inside.\nHowever, cases have begun to rise slightly in recent days and health officials are dealing with a serious outbreak in north-east Scotland.\nHere are five figures which indicate the state of the pandemic in Scotland.\nThe emergence of the Kent Covid variant in the weeks before Christmas drove a massive spike in cases in Scotland.\nAt the beginning of the year, the number of weekly cases per 100,000 people in Scotland almost reached 300, triggering a full lockdown which lasted almost four months.\nCases have mainly been falling since January, although there was a small rise in mid-March after Scotland's primary school pupils returned to classrooms.\nHowever, the decline has been flattening and has actually begun to increase in recent days.\nOn Monday, the rate was 24 weekly cases per 100,000 people in Scotland - the fifth day in a row the rate has risen. The Scottish government believes this increase is \"largely driven\" by the Moray outbreak.\nDespite the recent increase, Scotland is still categorised as having a \"moderate\" level of community transmission, using a World Health Organization (WHO) system for measuring infection levels, with the rate sitting just above the \"low\" threshold.\nLooking at a local authority breakdown of case rates across Scotland, there is one stand-out exception.\nInfection levels have been rising in Moray since the beginning of April and the rate was almost 94 cases per 100,000 on 7 May - well above the 50-case threshold for level three.\nThe area has seen relatively low levels of Covid throughout most of the pandemic, but the rate in Moray is more than four times the Scotland-wide rate.\nHealth officials have said the area is experiencing \"uncontrolled, sustained community transmission\" of the virus and it is not yet clear if the outbreak has peaked.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was \"highly probable\" that Moray would remain in level three from 17 May, with travel restrictions in and out of the area,\n\"Unless the situation were to materially improve over the next few days, it would simply not be safe or sensible to ease restrictions there,\" she said.\nAs of 7 May, there were 12 local authorities with infection rates above the Scotland-wide level, but only Moray is above the level three threshold.\nThe Scottish government also takes into account other measures, like pressure on local health services, when deciding the local authority levels.\nLooking at Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the number of new deaths is at a similar level to where it was at the end of the summer.\nOnly one death has been registered since the beginning of the month, giving Scotland a Covid death rate of 0.018 deaths per 100,000 people.\nThis rate has come down from a peak of eight weekly deaths per 100,000 in January as the Kent variant was spreading rapidly.\nA total of 7,661 people have died in Scotland following a positive test for Covid-19.\nHowever, if you count all death certificates that mention Covid-19, the death toll is 10,097, according to the National Records of Scotland.\nThe Scottish government says this sustained decline in the death rate has been achieved through a combination of people sticking to lockdown rules, and the vaccination of those most vulnerable to becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19.\nAccording to the WHO thresholds, the death rate in Scotland indicates \"low\" levels of community transmission.\nIn the week up to 28 April - the most recent figures available from Public Health Scotland - 62 people were admitted to Scottish hospitals for Covid treatment.\nThe last time the figure was this low was 9 September, but then the trajectory was very much up rather than the sustained decline seen now.\nThe number of weekly admissions never reached zero over the summer, but did get down to eight in mid-July before beginning to rise again.\nThe rate of admissions per 100,000 is currently 1.1, giving Scotland a \"low\" level of community transmission according to the WHO thresholds.\nAccording to Scottish government figures, close to three million people had received a first dose of a Covid vaccine by 9 May - almost 65% of the total population aged 16 or over.\nAbout 1.5 million people are now fully vaccinated having received both doses of a vaccine.\nIt's clear from the chart below that there's been a big push on second doses in recent weeks, completing the vaccination of the many thousands who were given a first dose in February.\nHowever, the daily number of first doses being administered appears to be on the rise again. \nThe Scottish government also says that everyone in the nine priority groups, as set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has now been offered a vaccine.\nVaccination targets in the 60-64, 70-74 and 75-79 age groups have been met and are close to completion in the 55-59, 65-69 and 85-plus age groups.\nPeople in their 40s should now be receiving their vaccination invitations in the post. The Scottish government is aiming to offer a vaccine to everyone aged 16 or over by the end of July.\nThe WHO outlines five \"situational levels\" ranging from level zero, when there should be \"no restrictions\" on daily activities, up to level four which requires a full lockdown to tackle an \"uncontrolled epidemic\".\nUsing measures like Covid deaths, cases and hospital admissions, the WHO system indicates that Scotland is likely to be in level one.\nThat's where the organisation recommends that \"basic measures\" should remain in place to prevent Covid infections spreading, but any disruptions to social and economic life should be \"limited and transient\".\nThere are a couple of important caveats to note about the WHO guidelines, which were published in November.\nFirstly, they were written before vaccines were approved for use and so do not take into account a country's vaccination programme.\nSecondly, the advice also came out before the widespread emergence of new strains of Covid-19, which can be more transmissible and in some cases more deadly too."

      "text": "Indoor hospitality and household mixing are set to return from next Monday, as the PM is due to confirm the next stage of lockdown easing in England.\nBoris Johnson is expected to say the data supports a further relaxation of measures at a 17:00 BST Downing Street news conference later.\nIt could also include guidance that it is now safe to hug friends and family.\nHealth Minister Nadine Dorries said she was \"hopeful\" hugging could be allowed but urged people to act \"cautiously\".\nAhead of the Downing Street briefing, the UK reduced its Covid alert level from level four to three, meaning the virus is in general circulation but transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially, so restrictions can be gradually reduced.\nUnder the next stage of the government's road map for lifting England's lockdown, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors.\nPeople are also likely to be allowed to stay overnight with those not in their household or bubble. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues such as cinemas and soft play areas are set to be permitted to reopen indoors.\nA government science adviser said that if the guidance does allow hugs, they should be selective, brief, and should avoid face-to-face contact to minimise the risk of spreading the virus.\nBut Ms Dorries said \"the data is looking extremely positive\" when she was asked if the guidance would be relaxed to allow hugging between friends and family.\n\"We've all missed the hugs, we've all missed the close and intimate contact we've had with friends and family and so I'm hopeful that we will be hugging and kissing again indoors,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nShe stressed that people should take this step \"a little bit cautiously\" to protect people who may be vulnerable and avoid a resurgence of the virus, however.\nIt is a sign of how successful the country has been in getting infection rates down that there is no doubt that the next unlocking will take place.\nAllowing indoor mixing was always the step that concerned experts the most in the roadmap - given how much easier the virus spreads indoors compared to outdoors. \nModelling earlier this year warned there could be a deadly summer surge - but that now looks overly pessimistic.\nLockdown and social distancing has done most of the hard work in getting infection levels low, but now the vaccines are going to take the load.\nFrom the evidence gathered so far, they are more than up to the job in combating the dominant virus in the UK.\nEarly signs are also promising for the variants.\nSome scientists are even suggesting the UK could be on brink of reaching herd immunity.\nAs always with this virus, it would be foolish to get too far ahead of ourselves. But the signs look very promising.\nAs part of other measures set to be relaxed, the rest of the accommodation sector is to reopen, along with indoor group sports and exercise classes.\nAnd up to 30 people are to be allowed to attend weddings, receptions and wakes, as well as funerals.\nForeign holidays will also return. On Friday, the government announced that 12 destinations would be placed on England's travel green list, meaning anyone returning from those areas will not need to quarantine from 17 May.\nMonday's announcement of lockdown easing will be stage three of the road map announced by the government in February, with the final stage scheduled for 21 June, when the government hopes to remove all legal restrictions on social contact.\nEach stage has been separated by a gap of several weeks to allow scientists to assess the impact of previous changes, which in stage two included the reopening of non-essential shops and outdoor service in pubs and restaurants.\nThe government has to be satisfied that its four tests have been met before progressing to the next stage.\nThese tests rest on the successful rollout of vaccines; evidence that jabs are reducing serious illness and death; infection rates being under control and the risk from coronavirus variants not changing.\nThe government said the latest data suggested that easing restrictions from 17 May was unlikely to risk a resurgence in infections. It said infection rates were at the lowest level since September 2020 and hospital admissions were continuing to decrease.\nOn Sunday, the UK recorded another two deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and a further 1,770 cases.\nMr Johnson said: \"The data reflects what we already knew - we are not going to let this virus beat us.\n\"The roadmap remains on track, our successful vaccination programme continues - more than two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had the first vaccine - and we can now look forward to unlocking, cautiously but irreversibly.\"\nMore than 35.3 million people have received one Covid vaccine dose and 17.6 million people have had both doses.\nProf Cath Noakes, a member of the Sage committee that advises the government, told the BBC on Sunday that if people hugged their friends every time they see them, it would \"perpetuate an awful lot of additional close contact that could spread the virus\".\nBut she said the risk from grandparents who are fully vaccinated hugging their grandchildren was likely to be low in most cases.\nThe devolved nations are working to their own timeframe for easing restrictions.\nIn Wales, indoor hospitality such as pubs, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and museums are expected to reopen from 17 May. All tourist accommodation is due to reopen and wedding receptions can have up to 30 people indoors and 50 outdoors.\nIn Scotland from 17 May, indoor hospitality venues are expected to resume with alcohol being served until 22:30.

      "text": "Council leaders from across the political divide in England are urging ministers to make good their promise to \"fix social care\" by setting out plans in Tuesday's Queen's Speech. \nThe Local Government Association has sent a cross-party letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, saying failure to act now would be \"a bitter blow\". \nThe government says improving social care \"remains a priority\". \nThe promise was made by Boris Johnson on his first day as prime minister.\nMinisters have previously said plans will be brought forward this year and, when quizzed, have maintained that cross-party agreement on social care reform will be vital - the LGA's letter shows that at work. \nIt comes amid increasing concern that long-promised reform will only get the briefest of mentions in the Queen's Speech, where the government sets out its legislative programme for the coming year. \nIn the letter, council leaders from across the political spectrum call on the government to put the reform and funding of the adult care system at the centre of its thinking on how we emerge from the pandemic. \nLocal authorities fund many care services and they want investment which moves the system from being based around care homes and hospitals, to one which focuses on prevention and community support. \nThe letter says reform needs to pool the risk of having high care costs after developing a condition such as dementia, with funding provided through taxation or a social-care premium. \nIt argues that this is an investment in people, rather than \"a cost that is too difficult or too high\".\nIt urges the government to: \n\"All of us in local government, across the political divide, want to see the Queen's Speech finally set out the plans we have been waiting for,\" said LGA Chairman James Jamieson. \n\"This is about an investment in people, in all of us. \n\"A failure to act will be a bitter blow to everyone connected to social care.\"\nThe pandemic has increased pressure on an already fragile care system, which provides support for older and disabled people in care homes and in their own homes. \nResidential and nursing homes saw a particularly high number of deaths in the first wave of Covid-19. \nThe pandemic also highlighted existing problems, such as the low pay and long hours of care staff in a sector that struggles to recruit enough workers. \nA government spokesperson said: \"Improving the adult social care system remains a priority for this government and we are committed to ensuring every person receives care that provides the dignity they deserve. \n\"Throughout the pandemic we have provided almost \u00a31.8bn in specific funding for adult social care including infection prevention and control measures. \n\"We've also provided free PPE and additional testing and prioritised health and care workers for the vaccine.\"\nThe LGA letter coincides with polling for a care charity which suggests there is public support for greater focus on social care by government.\nResearchers for MHA, which runs care homes and community services, questioned just over 2,000 UK adults online and, of these, found: \nMHA chief executive Sam Monaghan said the devastating effect of Covid-19 on care homes had made people question \"what's important and the kind of society we want to be\". \n\"What we now need is decisive action from government...\n\"We have a growing population of older people who deserve respect and certainty for the future.\"\nFiona Carragher, director of research at Alzheimer's Society, called on the government \"to completely overhaul our social care system\".\nShe said she wanted to see \"free, personalised care... on an equal footing with the NHS\", together with plans to develop a workforce with the skills \"to deliver the best care\" for people with dementia.

      "text": "Labour's deputy Angela Rayner has been sacked from her roles as party chair and campaign coordinator following poor results in the English local elections.\nThe party lost control of several councils and suffered defeat to the Tories in the Hartlepool by-election.\nLeader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to reshuffle his frontbench team in the next few days.\nMs Rayner will remain deputy leader of the party as it is a position directly elected by the party members. \nShe is also expected to be offered another shadow cabinet role. \nA Labour source said: \"Keir said he was taking full responsibility for the result of the elections - and he said we need to change. \n\"That means change how we run our campaigns in the future. Angela will continue to play a senior role in Keir's team.\"\nBut Labour's former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the decision to sack Ms Rayner was a \"cowardly avoidance of responsibility\" and accused Sir Keir of \"scapegoating everyone apart from himself\".\nAnd shadow cabinet source said they were \"totally shocked\", adding, \"everyone is gobsmacked\".\nLabour's shadow schools ministers Wes Streeting said he had a lot of respect for Ms Rayner adding that she had a \"big responsibility\" along with Sir Keir to \"lead the party to victory at the next general election\".\nHe said it was \"time to take a cold hard look at ourselves to make sure we are changing Labour for the good\". \nLabour's Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham spoke out against Sir Keir's decision to sack Ms Rayner, tweeting: \"I can't support this.\"\nSpeaking after his re-election on Saturday,  Mr Burnham warned that Labour was still too \"London-centric\".\nMr Burnham said the party needed to connect with voters differently, and support more powers for English regions.\n\"I'm getting a bit fed up of saying this to them, but they really do now need to listen and make real changes,\" he added.\nThe results in England contrast to Wales, where Mark Drakeford led Labour to its best performance in elections to the Welsh Parliament, falling just short of an overall majority by one seat.\nLabour has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years.\nThursday's votes, including council and mayoral elections in England, are Labour's first major test since its crushing defeat at the 2019 general election. \nInstead of recovering ground, the party suffered a series of setbacks in England, including losing overall control of councils including Durham, Sheffield and Plymouth.\nThe Conservatives also picked up control of several councils, including Nottinghamshire and Basildon, as well as winning Harlow from Labour.\nIn former heartland Tees Valley, Labour suffered a huge defeat to incumbent Tory mayor Ben Houchen, who increased his share of the vote to 73%.\nBut Labour did win mayoral contests in a number of areas, including taking the West of England from the Tories, while retaining others including London, Liverpool, Liverpool City Region, Doncaster and Salford.\nOn Saturday, the party's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour had to do more to listen to voters who had abandoned the party. \nHe added that the party needed to \"accelerate\" changes under Sir Keir's leadership, and would be launching a \"root and branch policy review\".\nHe contrasted the party's performance in England to a better showing in elections to the Welsh Parliament, where he said as a party in power it had a \"credible, radical policy offer\" to put to voters.\nSpeaking on Friday, Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had \"lost the trust of working people.\"\nHe added the party had \"not made a strong enough case to the country\", but he took responsibility for \"fixing things\".\nFigures on the left of the party have accused him of not doing enough to challenge the government since taking over as leader last year. \nQuestioned about leadership ambitions, Mr Burnham said he loved the job he had just been re-elected to do and that was his priority.\nHe added: \"I'm not just going to put myself forward unless they needed me one day in the future. But we're not at that day.\"\nThe Labour leadership's response to poor results in England will be both political and organisational.\nThere will be a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet, and more staff will be moved out of London to regional offices.\nThe policies Sir Keir Starmer inherited from his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn will also be formally reviewed.\nLabour peer Lord Mandelson - who has advised Sir Keir's team - called for this review and envisaged the process running for 18 months to two years.\nLabour sources say that Sir Keir could use the exercise not just to distance himself  from the 2019 manifesto, but to move away from some of the policy pledges he made in last year's leadership contest - which had been designed to appeal to the party's left.\nAmong those to criticise the party's direction under Sir Keir is Khalid Mahmood, who quit as a shadow defence minister around a month ago. \nSpeaking on Friday, he said Labour had been \"captured\" by a \"London-based bourgeoisie\" and had \"lost touch with ordinary British people\".\nThe Birmingham Perry Barr MP said the party needed to focus on supporting jobs, particularly in advanced manufacturing, in areas that felt left behind.\nAnd former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been suspended as a Labour MP under Sir Keir, said the party needed to present a \"real, radical alternative\".\n\"Offering nothing, offering insipid support for the government, causes people either to vote for somebody else or simply to stay home and disappear,\" he said."

      "text": "Face masks will no longer be required in secondary school classrooms in England after 17 May, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed.\nFace coverings have been recommended since the return to school in March - but that will end as part of the phasing out of lockdown measures.\nThere have been concerns that masks obstruct communicating and learning.\nBut head teachers warned the decision to remove masks was \"hard to reconcile\" with the evidence on safety.\nThe prime minister's briefing also confirmed the return of students to university campuses in England from 17 May - although surveys suggest that in practice most students have already returned to their term-time addresses.\nAbout half of students have been studying online since January - and they will be able to return to face-to-face teaching, although some courses might already have effectively stopped teaching by this stage of the university year.\nThe next stage of relaxing lockdown measures in England, to be implemented from 17 May, will mean that pupils will no longer be expected to wear face coverings in classrooms and in communal areas of schools.\nMr Johnson suggested the improving picture on the pandemic meant that the roadmap for unlocking could go ahead as planned.\nThe Department for Education said \"the latest data shows infection rates continuing to decrease\" and not having to wear masks would \"improve interaction between teachers and students\".\nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: \"It is obviously better for communication and learning if we don't need to have children wearing face masks in classrooms.\n\"But any decision to this effect must follow the scientific advice, and it is very worrying that the government's decision appears to contradict the published evidence.\"\n\"We don't understand why the government is in such a rush over this issue,\" said Mr Barton.\n\"Parents, pupils and staff will want to understand why removing the requirement for face coverings in classrooms is considered appropriate when it is not for other enclosed spaces,\" said Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers.\nBut the Children's Commissioner, Rachel de Souza, welcomed the decision.\n\"Wearing a mask during lessons has been one of many sacrifices children have made over the last year in our fight against the pandemic and I know they will welcome this latest step towards a return to normal school life,\" Dame Rachel said.\nLast week a group of scientists and unions, including the National Education Union, wrote to the Department for Education to say they were \"extremely concerned\" at the prospect of face coverings no longer being required in secondary schools.\nThey argued that masks were still required in shops and public transport and there was a lack of evidence that it was time to withdraw their use in schools.\nKevin Courtney of the National Education Union said schools \"should be permitted to retain mask wearing in the classroom if they think it necessary\".\nJohn Simpson of Public Health England, said: \"It's important to strike a balance between Covid-19 protection and student well-being\" and that \"scientific studies show that Covid-19 transmission in schools remains low\".\nEngland's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the latest steps meant people would be able to mix indoors again - and \"in line with the latest data, we no longer need to recommend that face coverings are worn in the classroom.\n\"Over the past year we have always put the wellbeing of pupils and staff first, and this step is now the right one,\" said Mr Williamson."

      "text": "Boris Johnson is being investigated by the MPs' standards watchdog over the funding of a Caribbean holiday in 2019.\nCommons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone has confirmed she is looking into whether the prime minister correctly declared how the trip was paid for.\nMr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth \u00a315,000, covered by Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross.\nDowning Street said the prime minister had acted correctly and transparently.\nBut Labour said there were \"questions\" over Mr Ross's \"generosity\".\nThe commissioner normally investigates whether MPs have failed to declare a financial interest, not declared it correctly, or declared it late.\nMr Ross initially said he had not paid \"any monies\" for the trip Mr Johnson took with his partner Carrie Symonds to the private island of Mustique - part of St Vincent and the Grenadines - between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020.\nHe later clarified that he had \"facilitated\" accommodation for the prime minister.\nMr Ross added that Mr Johnson's declaration of a \"benefit in kind\" in the February 2020 MPs' register of MPs' interests had been \"correct\".\nBut Labour asked for the standards commissioner to investigate, saying Mr Johnson's entry appeared \"to be incorrect\".\nOn Monday, Ms Stone confirmed that the prime minister was among nine MPs currently being investigated for potential breaches of the MPs' code of conduct.\nShe is examining whether Mr Johnson followed Commons rules on declaring financial interests relating to trips outside the UK.\nThese state that MPs have to register visits costing more than \u00a3300, where these have not been wholly covered by MPs themselves or the taxpayer. \nMs Stone will report her findings to the Commons Standards Committee, which can order MPs to apologise or pay back money if they are found in breach of the code.\nIn extreme cases it can recommend MPs are suspended, although this requires approval from the whole Commons and has only happened a handful of times. \nLabour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: \"The public have a right to know who paid for Boris Johnson's luxury Caribbean holiday and the renovation of his flat. Most importantly, we need to know what these donors were promised or expected in return for their generosity.\"\nBut a Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister transparently declared the benefit in kind in the Commons register of interests.\"\nHe added: \"Clearly the rules are set out and it's important that everyone abides by them, as the prime minister has done throughout.\"\nLabour has also asked Ms Stone to investigate the prime minister over how a renovation of his official Downing Street flat was initially paid for.\nIn April 2019, Mr Johnson was rebuked by the parliamentary commissioner for standards for failing to register a share of a Somerset property within 28 days of acquiring it."

      "title": "Thousands recruited to front UK firms in 'tax dodge'",
      "tags": "Employment,HM Revenue & Customs",
      "text": "More than 40,000 people from the Philippines have been recruited to front British companies as part of schemes costing the UK \"hundreds of millions of pounds\" in lost taxes.\nBBC Radio 4's File on 4 discovered more than 48,000 of these companies have been created in the past five years.\nSome staff at Covid test centres run by G4S have been employed by subcontractors in this kind of scheme. \nG4S said that, when this came to its attention, HMRC was notified.\nThe company said it was taking steps to ensure that all agency workers were employed directly and not via a subcontractor.\nAt the start of the pandemic, \"John\" - not his real name - was looking for employment.  \nAs the pandemic grew, he saw an advert for staff at his local Covid testing site run by G4S. \nHe rang an employment agency called HR GO, got the job, and - as the second wave of infections hit - started to work. The job was stressful, he says, but the money wasn't bad - \u00a310 an hour.\nIt wasn't until his payslip arrived that he noticed something odd was happening. \nHe had not been paid by G4S or HR GO, the agency that recruited him. Instead, he had been paid by a company he had never heard of.\nHe looked it up on Companies House and found it had been only set up a month before he had started his job - and its director was from the Philippines.\nHe started to think something \"sketchy was happening\". So why was John employed in such a convoluted way?\nEmployers pay 13.8% in National Insurance contributions on most of their employees' earnings, if the employee earns more than \u00a3170 a week.\nBut File on 4 discovered the way in which John is employed is used by recruitment agencies to cut their National Insurance bill.  \nIt works by exploiting the government's Employment Allowance - an annual discount of \u00a34,000 per company on National Insurance contributions. The allowance was meant to encourage companies to take on more workers.\nHowever, recruitment agencies exploit the allowance by employing temporary workers through a series of mini umbrella companies - or \"MUCs\". \nEach individual MUC has only a small number of workers and qualifies for the tax relief. These kind of arrangements can cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions in lost tax revenue a year. \nHMRC warned against them as early as 2015, saying schemes designed to exploit the Employment Allowance were \"too good to be true\" and \"simply did not work\". \nA G4S spokesperson said: \"To deliver these services, G4S works with employment agencies which are Recruitment and Employment Confederation accredited and members of the government's Crown Commercial Service (CCS) Framework.\"\nIt said their payments to agencies include all of the appropriate national insurance contributions - and all staff working on the G4S contracts pay their national insurance contributions correctly. \nHR GO said they were satisfied that the way they have managed their supply chain is \"legal and in harmony with the guidance on supply chain management issued by HMRC Threat Response Unit\".\nFile on 4 found that more than 48,000 \"mini umbrellas\" have been created in the UK in the past five years, each following a particular pattern.  \nThe companies are originally incorporated with a British director recruited via private groups on Facebook. They resign as directors after a short period of time and a Filipino director is appointed in their place. \n\"Emma\", who did not want to use her real name, lives in south-east England and says she was at her lowest ebb when she took part. \n\"At the time, I had broken up with my son's dad. And he left me in the flat with all the bills to pay. And I only had a part-time job because I had a six-month-old baby,\" she said. \n\"I started doing it just purely to sort of pay the bills.\"\nEmma signed up to the scheme four times, each time being paid \u00a3150 for \"fronting\" six companies.\nHer only job was to upload letters she received by post from HMRC and Companies House to an online portal run by a company called WRS Formations.\nShortly after that, she would resign as the director of the six businesses and start all over again.\nOn the same day she resigned, a Filipino director would be appointed to \"front\" these companies. It can be harder for HMRC to pursue companies with directors in other jurisdictions. \nFile on 4 discovered that tens of thousands of Filipinos from some of the poorest regions in the country are being recruited through Facebook and word of mouth.\nThe only qualifications to get the job are an internet connection, a mobile phone number, an email address and an ID document.\nThey have to review and sign the British company's documents through an online portal run by a company called Compass Star Limited.\nOne Filipino director - who didn't want to be named for fear of losing his income - said he signed up last year to support his wife and a baby.\nHe said it was \"really very easy\" and the extra cash was \"a big help\". It paid his bills and daily expenses.\nBut he couldn't remember the name of the company he is the director of and doesn't know what the company does. \nWhen its name was disclosed to him by File on 4, he said: \"Ah yes\u2026 I've seen it [in the portal].\"\nThousands of companies fronted by Filipinos are then used to employ workers in the UK, including supply teachers and Covid testers.\nCompass Star Limited and WRS Formations did not respond to the BBC's letters.  \nJo Maugham, a tax QC and the founder of the campaigning group the Good Law Project, said the number of companies File on 4 discovered were set up in this way was \"staggering\". \n\"It's not as though this is some tiny piece of tax avoidance - you know, where your local minicab firm isn't declaring all of the fares that it receives. This is industrial scale tax abuse,\" he said.\n\"I mean it's really absolutely extraordinary, hundreds of millions of pounds if not billions of pounds is likely to have been lost due to HMRC's apparent disinclination to tackle this abuse.\" \nAnneliese Dodds, former shadow chancellor, called upon HMRC and the government to do more to tackle these schemes.\n\"We do need to see greater action being taken by HMRC\u2026 and the Conservative government really should have been facing up to this, because certainly, the alarm bell has been rung by many over many years,\" she said.\nHMRC said it was using both its criminal and civil powers to challenge what it called \"MUC fraud\" - and recently deregistered more than 22,000 mini umbrella companies thought to be involved in such schemes. \nIt says it has made a number of arrests and taken steps to recover unpaid tax from businesses which knew or should have known about fraud in their supply chain.\nAdditional reporting by Gillian Schonrock and Richard Smith.\nClarification: This story has been updated to make clear G4S works with employment agencies which are Recruitment and Employment Confederation accredited and members of the government's Crown Commercial Service (CCS) Framework."

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Jerusalem",
      "text": "Palestinian militants say they fired 130 missiles at the Israeli city of Tel Aviv after an Israeli air strike felled a tower block in the Gaza Strip. \nThe 13-storey building was attacked an hour and a half after residents and local people were warned to evacuate, Reuters news agency reports.\nIsrael's military says it is targeting militants in Gaza in response to earlier rocket attacks.\nAt least 31 people have died in some of the worst violence in years.\nThe international community has urged both sides to end the escalation, which follows days of unrest in Jerusalem. \nMilitants had already fired hundreds of rockets towards Jerusalem and other areas. \nThree people have been killed in Israeli areas while at least 28 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier that the main militant group, Hamas, had \"crossed a red line\" by firing rockets towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. \nHamas, which controls Gaza, says it has been acting to defend Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque from Israeli \"aggression and terrorism\" after the site, which is holy to Muslims and Jews, saw clashes between Israeli police and Palestinians on Monday that left hundreds injured. \nThe past few days have seen the worst violence in Jerusalem since 2017. It followed mounting Palestinian anger over the threatened eviction of families from their homes in occupied East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers. Tension had already been stoked by a month of altercations between protesters and police in the predominantly Arab part of the city.\nHamas said it had launched rockets at Tel Aviv and its suburbs in response to \"the enemy's targeting of residential towers\". \nVideo footage from the city shows rockets streaking through the night sky, some exploding as they are hit by Israeli interceptor missiles.\nA 50-year-old woman was killed by a rocket in Rishon LeZion, near Tel Aviv, Israeli official said. \nIn the Tel Aviv suburb of Holon, a rocket hit a bus just after it had been evacuated. A girl of five and two women, one 50 and one 30, were injured.\nIn Tel Aviv itself, pedestrians ran for shelter and diners streamed out of restaurants while others flattened themselves on pavements as the sirens sounded, according to Reuters. \nBen Gurion Airport briefly halted flights and an energy pipeline between the cities of Eilat and Ashkelon was hit.\nThe rockets were launched after the destruction of the Hanadi Tower in Gaza, which houses an office used by the political leadership of Hamas.\nHours after the collapse, there were still no reports of casualties.\nThere are reports that a second high-rise building was also destroyed by the Israelis after a warning to evacuate.  \nIsraeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said the Israeli strikes were \"just the beginning\".\n\"Terror organisations have been hit hard and will continue to be hit because of their decision to hit Israel,\" he said. \"We'll return peace and quiet, for the long term.\"\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said the group was \"ready\" if Israel chose to escalate.\n\"If [Israel] wants to escalate, we are ready for it, and if it wants to stop, we're also ready,\" he said in a televised address. \"There is a new balance of force.\"\nThe UN Security Council will meet privately on Wednesday to discuss the conflict, diplomats said.\nThe fundamental reason for the renewed violence does not change. It is the open wound of the unresolved conflict between Jews and Arabs that has blighted and ended Palestinian and Israeli lives for generations. \nThis latest episode has happened because of tension in Jerusalem, the sharpest part of the conflict. The holy sites in the Old City are national as well as religious symbols. Crises affecting them have often ignited violence. \nThe triggers for what has happened this time include heavy-handed Israeli policing of Palestinians during Ramadan and controversial efforts in the Israeli courts to evict Palestinians from their homes.\nBut other events could have had the same effect. This was a crisis waiting to happen, in a conflict that, once again, has been left to fester. \nLeaders on both sides have concentrated on safeguarding their own positions. \nThe biggest challenge, of making peace, has not been addressed seriously for years. \nEarlier on Tuesday, two women, one in her 60s and the other in her 80s, were killed in a rocket attack on the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, with one other person seriously injured, medics say.\nHamas said it had fired 137 rockets at Ashkelon and nearby Ashdod in the space of five minutes, and warned it had \"many surprises\" prepared if the fighting continued.\nAt least 95 people received treatment in Israeli hospitals as a result of the attacks.\nThe Israeli military said earlier that 90% of rockets had been intercepted by its Iron Dome missile defence system.\nAmong the \"terror targets\" in Gaza it said it had struck were two attack tunnels being dug under the border with Israel.\nAmong those killed by Israeli air strikes was the head of the Islamic Jihad group's special rocket unit, Samah Abed al-Mamlouk, and the commander of a Hamas anti-tank missile unit is also said to have been killed. \nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported that at least 28 Palestinians, including 10 children, had been killed in Israeli strikes and more than 150 others had been injured.\nVictims included a 59-year-old woman and her disabled son and seven members of one family, including three children, in Beit Hanoun. \nThe fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. \nThe site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. \nThe fate of Jerusalem, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. \nPalestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own."

      "title": "Elections 2021: Labour insiders on Starmer, what went wrong and how to fix it",
      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Labour Party",
      "text": "Ever since his election as Labour leader a year ago Sir Keir Starmer has emphasised that the party has an electoral mountain to climb. He conquered the foothills pretty quickly - stressing new leadership and even suspending the former leader.  \nThe early emphasis was on eliminating negatives - in particular the stain of anti-Semitism. As long as the new leader continued making steady if slow progress, most of the internal grumbling - or downright opposition - was likely to be limited to the party's left. And not even all of them.\nBut slipping back down the mountain has led to nervousness, and restlessness among those he leads.\nStarmer faced his first electoral test on Thursday with the Hartlepool by-election. It is a seat Labour has held since it was created in 1974, and defended even as its other red wall constituencies fell in 2019. But, by Friday morning the coastal town in North East England, had switched to Boris Johnson's Conservatives.\nInsiders say the party performed worse than its internal polling had suggested on Thursday - and it wasn't very positive. But it wasn't the only significant loss. There was Harlow council in Essex, and in Sunderland it lost ground. \nWhile the pandemic has blunted Starmer's ability to oppose the government outright, some who supported his leadership are wondering why he is stumbling in much more favourable political weather when it should have been the government that was on the back foot, over \"sleaze\". \nOne of them told us that Starmer's task now, is \"to incinerate the politics of the far left\". Meanwhile some on the left are calling for \"radical change\". \nThe majority in Hartlepool was always vulnerable. The last time this parliamentary seat was fought, in 2019, the now-defunct Brexit Party took more than 10,000 votes. Many of these were looking for a new home. But it raises questions over Labour's approach.\nSir Keir Starmer has stressed his patriotism and accepted the Brexit deal. Yet that doesn't seem to have been enough to detoxify the party's image among some former Labour, pro-Brexit voters.\nBut there were other factors.\nA prominent politician who spent some time campaigning in Hartlepool blamed the hollowing out of the party during the Corbyn era, with strong organisational, as much as political expertise and experience, lost. Another, who spent a lot of time on the town's doorsteps, said the party was afflicted by the phenomenon of \"long Corbyn\".\nOne frontbencher said at least people weren't angry with Labour any more. They just weren't particularly inspired either.  \nThis, he assessed, was a weird election where people were interested in vaccines and the lifting of restrictions. \"People ask me 'Is the Tory sleaze stuff cutting through?' The honest answer is virtually nothing is cutting through.\"\nOthers heap blame on Labour's candidate in Hartlepool - Dr Paul Williams - and how he was chosen.\nSelecting an NHS doctor as a candidate amid the Covid crisis seemed like the perfect remedy to Labour's red wall blues.  But first Williams had to apologise for sexist social media posts from a decade ago. Then, the Conservatives accused him of playing a part in decisions that removed services from Hartlepool's hospital, though he pointed to his recent efforts to bring them back.\nBut the means by which Williams was picked has given critics of Starmer's office added ammunition. Williams was chosen from a one-person shortlist. He campaigned for Remain in the referendum and lost in a nearby seat in the last general election.\nSeveral Labour MPs - from different wings of the party - are blaming Starmer's political secretary, Baroness Chapman, for the decision. One told us: \"He is her mate but putting him in was a mind boggling decision since Hartlepool is the centre of Planet Brexit.\"\nThe problem for Labour is that Friday's election results suggest Hartlepool is not exceptional.\nIn a range of councils covering areas outside the big metropolitan centres, and where a majority voted for Brexit, Labour has slipped back rather than edging forward. \nSome majorities were lost but in others - such as Sunderland - they were eroded. One council leader in northern England told us: \"The party nationally is just saying to people 'I'm on your side'. We are not bringing stuff forward to help really transform the lives of people in the North. The party still looks and sounds like a metropolitan, middle class party.\"\nHe confided he has raised \"the lack of a message for the North\" with the leadership, but \"it's like banging my head against a brick wall\".\nConcerns over the apparent lack of a message aren't confined to northern English councillors. An MP who campaigned in Hartlepool and various council contests, had a confession: \"I was hoping you weren't going to ask me to recite precisely what the message is because I think I'd struggle to tell you that.\n\"This is a fairly bland, vanilla messaging, which seems [aimed at] maximising the minimum number of people who it will offend. What's our plan to unlock the huge potential of the North? That is still a bit of a blank canvas. And that is a bit of a problem\u2026 [I]t doesn't give us the ammunition that people need on the doorstep.\"'\nAn MP representing a seat in north-east England put it even more bluntly: \"People think we don't know our arse from our elbow.\"\nSo much for the message - what of the messenger himself? \nThose involved in the election campaigns, from all sides of the party, report Starmer has not made enough impact. Many are understanding and like him. Some praise his move away from the Corbyn era and commend his prime ministerial persona. But they say his image with crucial target voters must improve.\n\"People get a sense of who Boris is and what he's about,\" said one Yorkshire MP. \"You know they've got the measure of him. The problem with Keir is that people don't have the measure of him yet.\"\nThis chimes with the view among some in Starmer's office that the pandemic prevented him - someone who has an interesting backstory and a record of achievement as a lawyer - from being properly introduced to the public. Some of his own MPs believe, though, it's also about leaving a lasting impression.\n\"He is hugely capable but in the end, politics is not a meritocracy,\" said one, \"and it's not always the best person who prevails. It's a battle of wills and ideologies. We need to up our game.'\nThere are harsher verdicts. An MP who is by no means on the left of the party confesses: ''I just don't know what Keir stands for.\" A Labour colleague of theirs from northern England reports this from the doorsteps: 'Where people comment, they think he is boring.'\nPeople from across the party are - remarkably - in agreement about the nature of the difficulties. But there's not the same consensus around potential solutions. As Starmer struggles with his electoral mountain, it's like some in the party are shouting \"We need crampons!\" while others say \"Let's crack open the Kendal Mint Cake and take stock of where we are.\"\nSome shadow ministers tell us of difficulties in getting access to the leadership, whether it is to give advice or get \"attack lines\" signed off. They are privately calling for changes to the \"engine room\" - the Leader of the Opposition's office - but can't agree them.\nSome on the left want Jenny Chapman, once a leading light in the centrist Progress group, removed, and the departure of Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. Interestingly, though, a shadow minister not on the left agrees that Starmer needs a chief of staff who can \"really hold things together- a more respected political figure\".\nOthers who want to see changes in Starmer's office believe Chapman and McSweeney have been outstanding for providing direction, and haven't baulked at taking difficult decisions. McSweeney is credited by some for aiding Anas Sarwar to stand as party leader in Scotland, rather than await a potentially poorer result under his predecessor, Richard Leonard. They want different changes among the leader's staff.\nSir Keir Starmer will be very well aware of the \"mumbles and grumbles\"  - as one of his top team put it - around his leadership. That's why shadow communities secretary Steve Reed was sent round the broadcast studios on Friday morning to assert the problem wasn't Starmer, but the party. And the leader will \"push harder\" to change the party, not vice versa.\nInsiders say as a reaction to the election results, two things are likely to happen. First, changes in staffing at the Labour HQ, including a strengthening of the communications team. Second, a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet.\nA long-standing Labour MP told me that would be a \"wily move [helping] stifle criticism in the wake of the elections, as who is going to speak out if they think their job is at risk?\"\nThere is a feeling that many shadow ministers haven't made enough impact collectively or, in some cases, individually. One frontbencher pointed to some of the \"big figures\" when Labour was in opposition in the 1990s - Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, Jack Straw - and said Starmer needed five or six \"star players\" in the top team.\n\"There will be no leadership challenge,\" a leading left-winger told us.\nThis is partly due to there being no agreement on who a challenger would be. A prominent colleague of his on the left predicted that if Starmer were to go, it would be due to private pressure from those on the other wing of the party. But installing - for want of a better description - an anti-Corbyn, or more centrist leader, without a contest wouldn't be straightforward.  Not least because the current deputy leader, Angela Rayner, who is popular among members and seen as more left-wing than Starmer, would stand.\nThis might mean putsch wouldn't come to shove.\nThere do not seem to be fully fledged leadership campaigns, but there is a great deal of chatter.\nA frontbench supporter of Starmer believes he is safe for now and that the shadow cast by the pandemic has been a long one. But once it dissipates, this backer said \"if we are no further forward in a year's time he is in trouble - we could be just a year away from an election\".\nSome on what is seen as the party's \"soft left\" are pondering a return to Westminster for Andy Burnham, despite his likely re-election as mayor of Greater Manchester on Friday. Some say they would urge him to consider another tilt at the leadership if the polls haven't improved in the new year. Others are suggesting Yvette Cooper should offer herself as - at the very least - a caretaker leader, taking the party into the next election campaign.\nStarmer doesn't want to be bogged down by too much baggage as he tries to climb his electoral mountain. So he won't be spending the summer writing an election manifesto.\nBut Lord Mandelson, a leading light in the Tony Blair's New Labour movement, has told the BBC it is time to conduct a policy review, to thin out the bulky 2019 manifesto, and, in the process, develop ideas that may be attractive to target voters. \nPolicy work has been going on under the radar but internal critics say it lacks definition.\nAnd there is a danger that each solution simply brings another problem.\nAn analysis by the former shadow cabinet member Jon Trickett, a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, suggests as Starmer tries to woo former voters by stressing his patriotism, he is inadvertently encouraging some more radical, middle class supporters, including former Corbyn supporters, to defect to the Greens.\nIndeed, early results show Labour losing some council wards in north-east England to Green candidates. Though this exodus isn't huge, it could - he argues - cost the party marginal Westminster seats in the North.  \nTrickett told the BBC \"the public have put the leadership on notice\". He has research suggesting many voters in seats that turned blue in 2019 actually share -economically if not culturally - left-wing values, such as agreeing the state should narrow wealth inequalities welfare should be more generous and that corporate greed was a problem.\nBut a shadow minister, not on the left of the party, said: \"Boris Johnson is occupying so much of our territory. He has actually paid people not to go out to work. The state-run NHS has delivered his vaccination programme.\"\nAnd at a virtual seminar for Labour-supporting business figures, a prominent pollster told the audience that the party's (likely) success in London was a double-edged sword. The pollster argued it simply reinforced the perception that Labour was no longer for once-traditional voters in Northern towns.\nThat perception - rather than policies - was proving a near impenetrable problem.\nThese difficulties transcend personalities and would provide a challenge for any leader. \nBut for now it is Starmer and his team who must devise a means of addressing them."

      "title": "Labour: Messy reshuffle knocks Sir Keir Starmer's authority",
      "tags": "Angela Rayner,Keir Starmer,Labour Party",
      "text": "Was it worth it?\nReshuffles are moments when leaders have a chance to assert their authority - to show they are in charge.\nEven the most ardent political obsessive would acknowledge (probably) that opposition reshuffles are not necessarily noticed by the public.\nBut they matter to the mood and atmosphere of parties and Parliament.\nAnd for a party to win favour with voters over time, it needs to show the public trusted and favourite faces, to give the impression of an organisation ready for government - a group of people who we can all imagine in charge.\nSir Keir Starmer's first reshuffle, however, has been a very messy affair.\nIt began badly with a bust up with his deputy, Angela Rayner, who was being moved from one of her roles - in charge of campaigns.\nHer allies said she was being sacked. Sir Keir's team said she was being moved. They can't both be telling the whole truth.\nBut there was a late night howl of backlash to the notion she was being ousted, putting pressure on the leader to find a way to make her stay.\nIt took all day for the two to agree. That may seem astounding given that Sir Keir is meant to be the boss.\nRemember, however, that Ms Rayner's position as deputy leader is an elected one, and even the suggestion of her losing part of her role had already provoked outrage.\nClearly, she was in no mood to compromise.\nWhether it was settled in the end by an arm wrestle, a staring match, or screaming and shouting, the length of time it took created a massive vacuum - which Sir Keir's critics on the left of the party filled, almost with glee, to push him for a change in direction.\nAnd even some of his backers felt anxious, cross about the delays, concerned about the competence of the so called \"brains trust\" - a nickname for his team of advisers, not always used in a very complimentary way. \nAfter a day of dispute and delay, in the end, the list emerged. \nSome important changes, but not a sweeping recasting of the team - you can read about the changes here. \nMs Rayner did stay in the end, with a prominent job, and - according to her allies - a newfound confidence.\nWithin minutes, they were briefing that her power has been boosted, implying she was the victor in the stand-off with the boss.\nOne of her supporters said: \"On Friday Keir couldn't answer a simple question about what Labour's vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the voters in our heartland seats. \n\"Angela can answer that question and is the best person to lead the fight back in the Red Wall.\"\nAlthough an accommodation of sorts has been reached over her job, it doesn't seem like the two have reached a truce. \nIt's easy for moments like these to be overplayed as seismic and massively significant, when in a few months, the mood calms, events fade. \nBut these last few days have been an important political test for the Labour leader.\nIn a statement, Sir Keir said: \"The Labour Party must be the party that embraces the demand for change across our country. That will require bold ideas and a relentless focus on the priorities of the British people.\n\"Just as the pandemic has changed what is possible and what is necessary, so Labour must change too.\"\nThe election results were expected to be grim, but the handling of the reshuffle was a mess that could have been avoided - and a knock to his authority he didn't need.

      "tags": "Television,Scarlett Johansson,Film,Golden Globes,Hollywood,Tom Cruise",
      "text": "Tom Cruise has handed back his three Golden Globes in protest at a lack of diversity among the body that runs the glittering annual Hollywood awards.\nHe is the latest star to join a growing chorus of criticism. NBC, which has aired the event since 1996, has said it won't broadcast the ceremony next year.\nNBC said it wanted to see \"meaningful reform\" from the organisers, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.\nThe Golden Globes are second only to the Oscars in terms of profile.\nTime's Up, a leading advocate for industry reform, described NBC's move as a \"defining moment for Hollywood\".\nWarnerMedia, Netflix and Amazon Studios are also refusing to participate in HFPA-related events. , \nThe HFPA, whose members vote on the awards, has faced months of criticism stemming from a Los Angeles Times report back in February that revealed it had not had a single black member for 20 years.\nOn Tuesday, the HFPA published a timeline of reforms, saying it wanted to implement \"transformational changes as quickly - and as thoughtfully - as possible\", adding that \"systemic reform... is long overdue\".\nIt added that it was committed \"to achieving these goals with extreme urgency\".\nThe plans will widen the HFPA's membership, with an emphasis on recruiting black members and the hiring of diversity advisers. It has pledged to increase its membership by 50% over the next 18 months.\nThe association also indicated it would loosen its cloak of secrecy and strict admission rules by publishing its membership list and accepting foreign entertainment journalists who are based across the US, not just in California.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion training will be given to all members, as well as sexual harassment awareness training. And members will be barred from accepting promotional items from film and TV studios.\nTime's Up described the proposals as \"window-dressing platitudes\".\n\"Any organisation or sponsors that set themselves up to pass judgement on our vibrant community of creators and talent must do better,\" said Time's Up president Tina Tchen.\nScarlett Johansson, who has been nominated for five Golden Globes, has urged others in the film industry to boycott the organisation unless it makes significant internal changes.\nThe 36-year-old recalled facing \"sexist questions and remarks by certain HFPA members that bordered on sexual harassment\".\nHer Avengers co-star Mark Ruffalo wrote that the HFPA's reforms were \"discouraging\".\n\"Now is the time to step up and right the wrongs of the past,\" he said. \"Honestly, as a recent winner of a Golden Globe, I cannot feel proud or happy about being a recipient of this award.\"\nThe main issues appears to be that the implementation of changes isn't fast enough.\nAccording to Variety, organisations will continue to boycott the Globes and other HFPA events until the reforms are actually enacted.\nThe timeline published by the HFPA states that a new board and new members will be in place by the first week of August.\nIn a statement on Monday, NBC said: \"Change of this magnitude takes time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. As such, NBC will not air the 2022 Golden Globes.\n\"Assuming the organisation executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023.\"\nThe TV network's decision also follows a steep drop in viewing figures for the Globes, which hit a 13-year low this year. That is a trend for film award shows in general - particularly during the pandemic, with many ceremonies eschewing the red carpet and conducting their events virtually.\nSam Asi, who works for BBC Arabic and is a member of the HFPA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he found it \"bizarre\" that Hollywood was \"suddenly shocked\" about the lack of black members of the HFPA \"when this has been the case for 20 years\".\n\"HFPA members are seen every day by Hollywood talent, executives and publicists\u2026 why the sudden shock?\"\nHe added: \"Once the tide turned against the HFPA, everyone wanted to jump on the wagon and benefit from it. It's a political game.\"\nHe said publicists had told him privately that they knew they also lacked diversity in their field and said he had been in Hollywood for 15 years but had never met a black publicist.\nIn February Chadwick Boseman was awarded a posthumous Golden Globe for his performance as a jazz musician in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom."

      "text": "Campaigners have called on the government to stop delaying the ban of so-called conversion therapy.\nThe ban for England and Wales was announced in the Queen's Speech - but it will be preceded by a consultation.\nIt will consider religious freedoms and how to protect accredited professionals in a move welcomed by some groups.\nA document signed by a number of health groups defined conversion therapy as the attempt to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity.\nSome campaigners were disappointed that the government did not announce an immediate and wide-ranging ban on the practice. \nLGBT rights charity Stonewall says the practice must be banned in all forms \"including religious and faith-based settings\", and that any delay leaves LGBT groups \"at further risk of abuse\". \nJayne Ozanne, a former government equality adviser who underwent conversion therapy, agrees.\n\"We've had three years of talking,\" she said.\n\"What we really need is action that will protect young and old LGBT people right now, not this Groundhog Day of constantly being told that we're going to consult and listen.\" \nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists said it would be taking part in the consultation to \"highlight why conversion therapy is both unacceptable and harmful\" and to \"ensure clinicians can still help people fully explore their gender identity where appropriate\".\nThe ban - which was first pledged in 2018 - is set to include both sexuality and gender identity in its definition, and will protect people from \"coercive and abhorrent practices\".\nBut the government has said the short consultation will be held before the legislation is published, asking the public and interested parties how best to address the problem while still \"protecting the medical profession, defending freedom of speech, and upholding religious freedom\".\nIt also said it wants \"legitimate forms of pastoral support\" to be allowed to continue, including prayer to help someone explore their sexual orientation or gender identity. \nThe Evangelical Alliance, which represents 3,500 churches, said it welcomed the consultation process.\n\"We want to avoid the situation where a person can be accused of conversion therapy for praying with someone who freely chooses and asks for prayer,\" Peter Lynas, the group's UK director, said.\nA number of health organisations and patient groups signed a document in 2017 warning all forms of conversion therapy were \"unethical and potentially harmful\".\nThe practice can take many forms, some of which - like \"corrective\" rape - are already illegal. \nAbout 5% of the 108,000 people who responded to a 2018 LGBT government survey said they had been offered some form of conversion therapy, while 2% had undergone it.\nMore than half said it was conducted by a faith group, while one in five received it from healthcare professionals.\nAs well as the ban in England and Wales, a support fund for victims of the practice will be made available. \nNorthern Ireland has passed a non-binding motion calling for a ban on gay conversion therapy \"in all its forms\".\nThe Scottish government \"fully supports moves by the UK government to end conversion therapy\", a spokesperson said."

      "text": "Face masks will no longer be required in secondary school classrooms in England after 17 May, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed.\nFace coverings have been recommended since the return to school in March - but that will end as part of the phasing out of lockdown measures.\nThere have been concerns that masks obstruct communicating and learning.\nBut head teachers warned the decision to remove masks was \"hard to reconcile\" with the evidence on safety.\nThe prime minister's briefing also confirmed the return of students to university campuses in England from 17 May - although surveys suggest that in practice most students have already returned to their term-time addresses.\nAbout half of students have been studying online since January - and they will be able to return to face-to-face teaching, although some courses might already have effectively stopped teaching by this stage of the university year.\nThe next stage of relaxing lockdown measures in England, to be implemented from 17 May, will mean that pupils will no longer be expected to wear face coverings in classrooms and in communal areas of schools.\nMr Johnson suggested the improving picture on the pandemic meant that the roadmap for unlocking could go ahead as planned.\nThe Department for Education said \"the latest data shows infection rates continuing to decrease\" and not having to wear masks would \"improve interaction between teachers and students\".\nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: \"It is obviously better for communication and learning if we don't need to have children wearing face masks in classrooms.\n\"But any decision to this effect must follow the scientific advice, and it is very worrying that the government's decision appears to contradict the published evidence.\"\n\"We don't understand why the government is in such a rush over this issue,\" said Mr Barton.\n\"Parents, pupils and staff will want to understand why removing the requirement for face coverings in classrooms is considered appropriate when it is not for other enclosed spaces,\" said Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers.\nBut the Children's Commissioner, Rachel de Souza, welcomed the decision.\n\"Wearing a mask during lessons has been one of many sacrifices children have made over the last year in our fight against the pandemic and I know they will welcome this latest step towards a return to normal school life,\" Dame Rachel said.\nLast week a group of scientists and unions, including the National Education Union, wrote to the Department for Education to say they were \"extremely concerned\" at the prospect of face coverings no longer being required in secondary schools.\nThey argued that masks were still required in shops and public transport and there was a lack of evidence that it was time to withdraw their use in schools.\nKevin Courtney of the National Education Union said schools \"should be permitted to retain mask wearing in the classroom if they think it necessary\".\nJohn Simpson of Public Health England, said: \"It's important to strike a balance between Covid-19 protection and student well-being\" and that \"scientific studies show that Covid-19 transmission in schools remains low\".\nEngland's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the latest steps meant people would be able to mix indoors again - and \"in line with the latest data, we no longer need to recommend that face coverings are worn in the classroom.\n\"Over the past year we have always put the wellbeing of pupils and staff first, and this step is now the right one,\" said Mr Williamson."

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Jerusalem",
      "text": "Israel has launched air strikes against militant targets in the Gaza Strip, after rockets were fired from the territory towards Jerusalem.\nThe Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said 20 people, including children, had died in the strikes.\nIn Jerusalem, the rocket fire caused Israel's parliament to be evacuated as sirens sounded. \nTensions between Israel and the Palestinians spiralled in recent days. \nGaza's Hamas rulers had threatened to strike after hundreds of Palestinians were injured in clashes with Israeli police in Jerusalem on Monday.\nIsrael said it had killed at least three Hamas militants. \"We have started, and I repeat started, to attack military targets in Gaza,\" Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus told reporters.\nHamas sources told the BBC a commander of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed Abdullah Fayyad, had been killed. \nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had \"crossed a red line\" and that Israel would respond \"with great force\". \nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Hamas needed to end the rocket attacks \"immediately\", adding: \"All sides need to de-escalate.\"\nThe past few days have seen the worst violence in Jerusalem for years, with more than 300 Palestinians wounded in confrontations with Israeli police outside the al-Aqsa mosque on Monday.\nA planned march by Israeli nationalists which was due to pass through Muslim areas of East Jerusalem's Old City was called off over fears it could stoke unrest. \nThe Jerusalem Day event marks Israel's capture of East Jerusalem - home to the Old City and its holy sites - in 1967, and usually sees hundreds of flag-waving Israeli youth make their way through the Muslim Quarter via Damascus Gate, chanting and singing patriotic songs. \nIt is regarded by many Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. This year's march would also have taken place in the final days of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.\nThe latest violence follows days of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police in the nearby Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem, with the possible eviction of Palestinian families from their homes there by Jewish settlers a focal point for Palestinian anger.\nIsrael's Supreme Court had been due to hold a hearing in the long-running case on Monday, but the session was postponed because of the trouble.\nFears had mounted that it would be a tense day in Jerusalem and so it turned out. The confrontation started first thing in the morning.\nAs I passed the Old City walls beneath the glittering Dome of the Rock, heavily armed Israeli police had entered the compound and were firing volleys of stun grenades at Palestinians who were throwing stones and other objects at them. Ambulances screamed past ready to ferry away the wounded.\nThe site holy to Muslims and Jews lies at the core of the region's conflict.\nHundreds of Jewish activists had planned to go there in the morning, but were ultimately stopped by police. Muslim worshippers had stayed in al-Aqsa all night - ready, they said, to defend their mosque. \nThe city's surging tensions stem from several causes. Among them, the threatened eviction of several Palestinians families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers.  \nThat case is now on hold for several weeks after Israel's government intervened. But despite the growing international calls for calm, today has seen more fuel poured on an already volatile mix.\nIsrael's police force said thousands of Palestinians had barricaded themselves in the building overnight with stones and Molotov cocktails in anticipation of a confrontation during the Jerusalem Day Flag March, which was scheduled to start at about 16:00 (13:00 GMT). \nOfficers were ordered to enter the mosque compound to \"repel the rioters using demonstration dispersal methods\" on Monday morning after a police post was attacked and stones were thrown towards a nearby road, it added. \nFor over an hour, police fired stun grenades, rubber bullets and tear gas at Palestinians, who threw stones and other objects.\nVideo posted on social media showed crowds running for cover and some of the stun-grenade canisters landing inside the mosque. \nThe al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, is located on a hilltop complex known by Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and by Jews as the Temple Mount. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and it is the holiest site in Judaism.\nDuring clashes outside the Old City walls, a car was pelted with stones before crashing into bollards and hitting a man.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said 305 Palestinians had been injured in the clashes, and that 228 had been taken to hospital for treatment. Seven of them are in a critical condition.\nThe Israeli police force said 21 officers had been injured and that three had required hospital treatment.\nMr Netanyahu defended the police. \"This is a battle between tolerance and intolerance, between lawless violence and order,\" he said.\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the Israeli actions.\n\"The Israeli occupation forces' brutal storming and assault on worshippers in the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and its courtyards is a new challenge to the international community,\" spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said.\nConfrontations between Palestinians and Israelis were also reported in the northern Israeli city of Haifa, and near the West Bank city of Ramallah. \nKing Abdullah II of Jordan, which is the custodian of Jerusalem's Islamic and Christian holy sites, condemned \"Israeli violations and escalatory practices at the blessed al-Aqsa mosque\".\nJordan assumed custody of the sites when it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1948 Middle East war, and was allowed to continue the role after the areas fell to Israel in 1967.\nThe Quartet of Middle East negotiators - the US, the EU, Russia and the UN - has also expressed deep concern over the violence, urging all sides to show restraint.\nThe city, with its sacred sites, is the most sensitive place of all in the decades-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. \nAlongside its religious importance are national claims - Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by most other countries.\nPalestinians claim the eastern half as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own.\nThe hilltop compound containing the al-Aqsa mosque and buttressed by the Jewish holy site of the Western Wall is especially sensitive, with both Israel and Palestinians wary of each other's intentions and activities there.\nIsrael says the current violence there was planned \"well in advance\" by Palestinian extremists, though a series of events has driven unrest in Jerusalem.\nPalestinian anger fuelled in the past few days by the uncertain fate of the families in Sheikh Jarrah came after a month of escalating tensions in the city. \nAfter Ramadan began in mid-April, clashes erupted nightly between police and Palestinians protesting against security barriers outside Damascus Gate, worsening after a march by ultra-nationalist Jewish extremists angry over assaults by Palestinians on ultra-Orthodox Jews.\nMeanwhile rare Palestinian elections planned for this month were called off by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who blamed restrictions on Palestinian voting rights in East Jerusalem, in a move which further angered Palestinians. Critics suggested Mr Abbas feared a victory by Hamas."

      "text": "Afghan families have been burying their children who were killed in explosions outside a secondary school in the capital, Kabul, on Saturday.\nMore than 60 people, mostly girls, are now known to have died in the attack that hit students as they left class. \nNo-one has admitted carrying out the attack in Dasht-e-Barchi, an area often hit by Sunni Islamist militants. \nThe Afghan government blamed Taliban militants for the attack, but the group denied involvement.\nThe exact target for Saturday's bloodshed is unclear. The blasts come against a backdrop of rising violence as the US looks to withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan by 11 September.\nThe neighbourhood in western Kabul where the blasts occurred is home to many from the Hazara minority community, who are of Mongolian and Central Asian descent and are mainly Shia Muslims.\nAlmost exactly a year ago, a maternity unit at the local hospital was attacked, leaving 24 women, children and babies dead.\nHeather Barr, who works for Human Rights Watch, tweeted a series of videos and photos of what she said was the school in Kabul - including a tour of the site given by one of the students. Ms Barr said the group had filmed a documentary there in 2017.\nNobel Prize winner and activist Malala Yousafzai - who was shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012 - posted about the \"horrendous attack\" on Twitter. \n\"My heart is with the Kabul school victims' families,\" she wrote.\nThe first burials took place at \"Martyrs Cemetery\", where Hazara victims are laid to rest.\nMourners in a state of shock watched in grief as the girls' bodies in wooden coffins were lowered into graves, AFP news agency reported.\nOne of the residents of the area was quoted by AFP as saying: \"I rushed to the scene and found myself in the middle of bodies. All of them were girls. Their bodies piled on top of each other.\"\nThe explosions are believed to have been caused by a car bomb and two improvised explosive devices planted in the area.\nOne survivor, Zahra, told reporters she was leaving the school as the blasts took place. \n\"My classmate died. A few minutes later there was another explosion, and then another. Everyone was screaming and there was blood everywhere,\" she said. \nMore than 150 people were injured in the attack. Reports from Kabul say the city was busy with shoppers ahead of celebrations for Eid al-Fitr this coming week. \nThe Taliban announced on Sunday that they would observe a three-day ceasefire for the Muslim festival, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan.\nThe insurgents said they would be \"halting all operations against the enemy to provide a peaceful and secure atmosphere\". \nThe Afghan government is expected to reciprocate with a truce. \nAfghanistan is seeing increasing violence as the US and Nato prepare to pull out all remaining forces from the country on 11 September. \nOn Saturday the US state department condemned \"the barbarous attack\" outside the school.\n\"We call for an immediate end to violence and the senseless targeting of innocent civilians,\" it said.\nThe European Union's mission in Afghanistan said on Twitter that \"targeting primarily students in a girls' school, makes this an attack on the future of Afghanistan\".\nAnalysis by Secunder Kermani, BBC Afghanistan correspondent\nSo many places in Afghanistan have endured so much pain, but the Dasht-e-Barchi neighbourhood in Kabul has suffered horrendously. \nThe neighbourhood is populated by members of Afghanistan's Hazara ethnic minority. As followers of Shia Islam, the Islamic State group (IS) views them as heretics, and has carried out a vicious campaign, attacking the softest of targets. \nDozens have been killed in bombings at sports halls, cultural centres, and places of education in particular. \nLast year, and in 2018, IS suicide bombers struck tuition centres in the area killing more than 70 people. IS is not part of the peace talks between the Taliban and Afghan government, which in any case are currently stalled. \nAs of yet, there's been no claim for the attack on Saturday. However, IS continues to carry out assassinations and bombings in Kabul and the city of Jalalabad, despite having recently lost much of the territory it once controlled in the east of the country.\nYou may also be interested in..."

But neither do I want a border in the Irish Sea,\" Mr Beattie said. \nEarlier, outgoing leader Mr Aiken said unionism needed to \"get its act together\" and there was now a time for reflection. \nMr Aiken will remain in charge temporarily until his successor is found. \nA virtual meeting of the party's ruling executive will be held on Tuesday night to discuss the leadership process.\nMr Aiken has been in charge since November 2019.\nMr Aiken said the UUP continued to do what was right not only for unionists but for all in Northern Ireland. \nHe said his resignation as party leader was a \"bittersweet moment\". \n\"I am, however, self-aware enough to realise that our party, despite our strengths, is not breaking through,\" he said. \n\"I am also very aware of my limitations. And despite the successes over the last 19 months, I realise that a change of leadership is needed.\"\nMr Aiken said the UUP was a team in which all parts needed to work effectively.\n\"Quite frankly, it hasn't been working as well as it should be. That is down to me,\" he said. \n\"Rather than being the perceived problem, I want to be part of the solution.\"\nParty chairman Danny Kennedy thanked Mr Aiken for his leadership, describing him as a \"dedicated Ulster Unionist\". \nLagan Valley assembly member Robbie Butler, who is the party's chief whip, has also been mentioned as a possible contender.\nIn his letter of resignation, Mr Aiken said he had taken the party as far as he could.\nHe said it had been a \"privilege to lead in these difficult and trying times\" and he took pride in the party's decision to take on the challenging health minister portfolio when Stormont was restored in 2020.\nHis departure follows the resignation of Arlene Foster as DUP leader and first minister after an internal revolt.\nMore than 20 DUP NI Assembly members and four MPs signed a letter voicing no-confidence in her leadership.\nResponding to Mr Aiken's decision to step down, Mrs Foster said she found him \"very straightforward and honourable\" as a fellow party leader."

      "text": "As the dust settles on a bumper crop of elections, a chance to sit back and try and work out exactly what happened.\nFrom fresh questions about Scottish independence to the lingering impact of the Brexit vote, what do we know now that we didn't on Thursday?\nIn Scotland, the SNP held on to power for an historic fourth term, but fell just one seat short of an overall majority.\nThat means, together with the Scottish Greens, there is now a majority of 15 in favour of independence in the Scottish Parliament.\nBut analysis by Professor Sir John Curtice suggests this is not the whole story. \nIn Scotland, people have two votes - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot, where additional MSPs are allocated from party lists depending on how many votes the parties get.\nIn the constituency vote 49.0% backed pro-independence parties, and in the list vote it was 50.1%.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said her focus in government would be on leading the country through the pandemic and keeping people safe from Covid.\nBut she added that \"when the crisis has passed, it is to give people in Scotland the right to choose their future\" in a referendum.\nBut the UK government is fighting this, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove saying the SNP could not expect one to be approved as the party did not secure a majority in the Scottish Parliament.\nTraditionally, voters use Westminster by-elections and other polls between general elections, to give the sitting government a kicking, particularly when they've been in power a while. \nBut the performance of the Conservatives in England means we might need to re-think that idea.\nOne of the first results to come in was the by-election to select the new Hartlepool MP.\nConservative Jill Mortimer won a seat that had been in Labour hands since its creation in 1974, and by a significant margin as well - 23.2%, or nearly 7,000 votes.\nThis was only the second by-election gain for a governing party since Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives won amid the backdrop of the Falklands War in 1982.\nAnd things didn't get much better for Labour in the council elections.\nThe Conservatives took Harlow council in Essex - sometimes seen as indicator of the national mood - and continued to make gains in both councils and council seats across the rest of England throughout the weekend.\nThey now control over a dozen more councils than they did before and there are more than 200 extra Tory councillors.\nIn contrast, Labour lost control of eight councils and more than 300 seats. One of the councils the party lost, County Durham, had been under Labour control for more than 100 years, since 1919. It was the first council the Labour Party ever ran.\nThe only areas where there may be some cause for Conservative concern is among their traditional heartlands of the shire councils in the south - lots of the areas coloured white on the map above because they lost seats or failed to gain any.\nIt hasn't been damaging enough yet to actually lose control in many councils - only Cambridgeshire, the Isle of Wight and Tunbridge Wells - but something to keep an eye on perhaps.\nAs well as the Conservatives in England and the SNP in Scotland, Labour in Wales bucked the trend of long-standing parties of power struggling at election time, in the context of handling a massive international crisis and the immediate boost of a world-leading vaccine programme.\nWelsh Labour equalled their record of securing 30 out of the 60 Senedd seats.\nFirst Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford, whose profile has been prominent as part of the Welsh Covid response, increased his personal majority by more than 10,000 votes, from 3.7 percentage points to 30.7.\nLabour also gained the seat of former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Rhondda, but they lost Vale of Clwyd to the Conservatives, by fewer than 500 votes.\nThis left them just short of an outright majority - a feat no party has yet achieved in Wales.\nAnother area Labour supporters can look to for positives are the mayoral elections in some of England's biggest city regions.\nLabour's success here gives an idea where their new heartlands might be, as the political map is still being redrawn following the Brexit vote of 2016.\nSadiq Khan won again in London, from second preference votes after a first round that was closer than expected. Tory candidate Shaun Bailey came second.\nAndy Burnham won easily in Manchester with an increased majority, and Labour took control of the West of England and Cambridgeshire & Peterborough from the Conservatives.\nThey also held on to the combined authority mayoralties in Liverpool, the West of England and won all five single authority mayors that were up for grabs. The party also won the newly created Mayor of West Yorkshire.\nThe Conservatives did win two mayoral elections. Andy Street won in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen got a whopping 73% of the vote in the Tees Valley.\nThey also won 30 of the 39 Police and Crime Commissioner elections declared so far, including ten gains.\nThere have now been two general elections since the June 2016 EU referendum, both of which saw the Conservatives' support increase among Leave voters while Labour performed better with Remainers, according to analysis from Professor Curtice.\nBut for some council wards Thursday's vote was the first new election since May 2016, one month before Britain voted to leave the EU.\nIf we look just at those areas, there was a swing from Labour to the Conservatives of six percentage points overall.\nBut the swing was just one point in areas that voted Remain, compared to 11 points in the most heavily pro-Leave places.\nIn pro-Remain places which last voted in 2017, there was a swing to Labour of three points. In Leave areas there was a two-point move in the Conservatives' direction.\nAs well as the Scottish Greens gaining two seats, the Greens in England increased their presence in every region.\nIn total they won more than 80 seats -  but were unable to control any individual council.\nThey also finished ahead of the Lib Dems in London as the third party. Professor Curtice says they are now the fourth party in the UK.\nFor the Lib Dems on the whole it was more of a muted success. They took control of St Albans Council and held on to the six they were defending.\nThey lost a seat in Scotland but won one in the London Assembly. And in terms of councillors, their gains and losses in different areas more or less balanced each other out.\nData journalism by Daniel Dunford, John Walton, Will Dahlgreen, Ed Lowther, Christine Jeavans, Becky Dale, Maryam Ahmed, Wesley Stephenson and Alison Benjamin.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People in England will be allowed to hug loved ones and enjoy indoor hospitality from next Monday, the PM has said - whilst urging people to \"exercise caution and common sense\".\nBoris Johnson said this was the \"single biggest step\" to unlocking society but that people should remain vigilant.\nIndoor mixing and overnight stays in groups of up to six people or two households will also resume.\nLeisure venues such as cinemas, museums and children's play areas will reopen.\nSpeaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said the further relaxation of England's lockdown would go ahead on 17 May as the government had met its four tests for easing restrictions.\nThese tests relied on the success of the vaccine rollout, evidence that the jabs were reducing serious illness and death, infection rates remaining under control and the risks from new Covid variants not changing.\nThe prime minister said the latest data showed deaths and hospitalisations had dropped to their lowest level since last July.\nZero coronavirus deaths were announced in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Monday, while Wales recorded four deaths.\nMore than two-thirds of adults across the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine,  with almost 18 million people having had their second dose.\nThe UK's four chief medical officers said earlier that the UK's Covid alert level should be lowered from level four to three. \nIt means that although coronavirus is in general circulation, transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially, so restrictions can be gradually reduced. \nMr Johnson said that all the data supported the latest easing of restrictions, which he said amounted to \"a considerable step on the road back to normality\".\n\"And today we're taking a step toward that moment when we learn to live responsibly with Covid, when we cease eventually to rely on detailed government edicts and make our own decisions based on the best scientific advice about how best to protect our families and those around us.\"\nHe added that, as part of the latest lockdown easing, the government would update its guidance on close contact between close family and friends shortly.\nThe advice would explain the risks involved so people could make informed choices, he said.\n\"This doesn't mean that we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. We all know that close contacts such as hugging is a direct way of transmitting this disease,\" he said.\n\"So I urge you to think about the vulnerability of your loved ones.\"\nMr Johnson said social distancing should still be followed when people are not with their friends and family in workplaces, shops, pubs, restaurants and other settings.\nHe also confirmed that the wearing of face masks in secondary school classrooms in England will not be required after 17 May.\nCare home residents will be able to have up to five named visitors, he said, and greater freedoms to enjoy low- risk visits outside their home without having to isolate on their return. \nThis next unlocking is - as the prime minister and his scientists stressed - the most significant step yet.\nIndoors is, after all, where transmission is most likely to take place, which explains why quite a sober tone accompanied the confirmation that restrictions would lift.\nIt means vaccines are going to have to do most of the work in terms of controlling infection levels - during the winter it has been lockdown and social distancing that has played a key role in getting cases down.\nThe good news is that all the evidence is pointing to the vaccines being incredibly effective.\nIt means the threat of the NHS being overwhelmed and lockdowns reimposed has gone - unless a new variant comes along that can evade the vaccines in a significant way (considered unlikely by most experts).\nBut cases could still creep up and there could be local outbreaks that need intervening on.\nIt's why the key message is proceed with caution.\nThe devolved nations are working to their own timeframe for easing restrictions.\nUnder current plans in Wales, indoor attractions, cinemas and theatres will open alongside pubs and restaurants serving customers inside on 17 May.\nIn Scotland, indoor hospitality venues are expected to resume with alcohol being served until 22:30. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls should reopen and indoor group exercise restart.\nMore restrictions might be lifted in Northern Ireland on 24 May, including the reopening of indoor hospitality, B&Bs and hotels. \nThe prime minister said subject to the impact of the latest easing on the data, England was still on track to progress to step four of the government's roadmap from 21 June - when it is hoped that all legal limits on social contact will be removed.\nAsked by BBC Health editor Hugh Pym if the final stage of unlocking would be brought forward, Mr Johnson said every time restrictions are relaxed, \"we give ourselves breathing space\" to make sure that cases are not rising too much due to more social contact being allowed.\nThe easing of measures next week is the most significant step, he added, saying that businesses want to get ready for the next planned relaxation on 21 June with the \"biggest certainty\" they can have.\nIn order to give businesses time to prepare, further details will be released later this month \"about what the world will look like and what role there could be, if any, for certification and social distancing\", Mr Johnson said.\nMeanwhile, new data published by Public Health England shows that a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab reduces the risk of death with Covid by 80% compared with unvaccinated individuals. \nResearchers also found the two doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine reduced the risk of death by 97%.\nIn other key developments:\nIs there someone you have been waiting until the guidance changes to hug?

      "tags": "Asia,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The bodies of at least 40 people have washed up on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, officials say.\nThe discovery, near the border between the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, was confirmed to the BBC on Monday.\nIt is not clear how the bodies came to be there, but local media reports suggest they may be Covid-19 victims.\nSome media reports say as many as 100 bodies have been found, and that their condition suggests they may have been in the river for several days.\n\"There is a possibility that these bodies have come out of Uttar Pradesh,\" a local official, Ashok Kumar, told the BBC after questioning local residents.\nHe said the remains would be buried or cremated. \nOfficials said the bodies appeared to be bloated and partially burnt, and that they may have ended up in the river as part of the practice of cremating victims of coronavirus along the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh, India's NDTV news channel reported. \nSome local residents and journalists told BBC Hindi a shortage of wood for cremations and the rising costs associated with funerals were leaving some families with no option but to put the bodies of loved ones who had died from coronavirus directly into the river.\nLocal resident Chandra Mohan said: \"Private hospitals are looting people. Common people are not left with money to pay a priest and spend more on cremation at the river bank. They are asking 2,000 rupees [\u00a320; $27] just to get the corpse out of the ambulance. The river has become their last recourse so people are immersing corpses in the river.\"\nUttar Pradesh is India's most populous state. \nA second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of India, with deaths rising significantly in recent weeks. Most of the country's crematoriums have run out of spaces.\nThe country is now the epicentre of the global pandemic.\nIndia has recorded more than 22.6 million coronavirus cases and 246,116 Covid-related deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data. \nExperts believe the real death toll could be far higher."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Actor Scarlett Johansson has joined criticism of the body behind the Golden Globe Awards over how it plans to tackle discrimination.\nGolden Globe organisers the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) has been accused of a lack of diversity and shadowy workings.\nEarlier this week the body voted in reforms to widen its membership.\nBut Ms Johansson is among stars and industry figures who say it still needs \"fundamental reform\".\nThe Golden Globes are second only to the Oscars in terms of profile, but organisers have been accused of discriminatory practices, accepting \"freebies\" and other ethical lapses.\nIn February, an expos\u00e9 in the Los Angeles Times revealed there were no black people among the organisation's 87 members who vote for the awards.\nThis week, the HFPA outlined a package of reforms to how it works in a bid to make the organisation more inclusive.\nThey include widening its membership, with an emphasis on recruiting black members, and hiring diversity advisers. It also said it would loosen its cloak of secrecy and strict admission rules.\n\"Today's overwhelming vote to reform the Association reaffirms our commitment to change,\" said HFPA president Ali Sar in a statement on Thursday.\nMany high-profile Hollywood figures have said the initiatives are not good enough.\nMs Johansson, who has been nominated for five Golden Globes, urged others in the film industry to boycott the organisation unless it makes significant internal changes. \nThe 36-year-old recalled facing \"sexist questions and remarks by certain HFPA members that bordered on sexual harassment\".\n\"Unless there is necessary fundamental reform within the organization, I believe it is time that we take a step back from the HFPA and focus on the importance and strength of unity within our unions and the industry as a whole,\" she said.\nMs Johansson's Avengers co-star Mark Ruffalo joined her, writing that the HFPA's reforms were \"discouraging\" in a social media post on Friday. \n\"Now is the time to step up and right the wrongs of the past,\" he said. \"Honestly, as a recent winner of a Golden Globe, I cannot feel proud or happy about being a recipient of this award.\"\nMeanwhile, Netflix and Amazon studios said they would stop doing business with the HFPA until it goes further with its reform plans.\nNetflix chief executive Ted Sarandos said he was putting their relationship on hold \"until more meaningful changes are made\".\nCriticism of the HFPA burst into the open in February when the LA Times wrote its expos\u00e9 detailing alleged ethical conflicts and other misconduct.\nFollowing the story, more than 100 Hollywood PR firms threatened to advise the stars they represent not to work with the HFPA if changes were not made.\nThey accused the organisation of \"discriminatory behaviour, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption\".\nThe same group have said that despite this week's changes it will continue boycotting the HFPA. \nThe HFPA did not respond to the BBC's request for comment."

Its destination: the asteroid Bennu, some 185m miles (297m km) away.\nThe probe has been mapping the surface of Bennu since 2018, breaking the record for the closest ever orbit of a planetary body by a spacecraft.\nIts historic \"touch-and-go\" sample grab from the ancient asteroid's surface in October 2020 lasted only a few seconds but left scientists \"exuberant\".\nThey hope the debris from this very primitive object will tell them more about the chemistry that brought the Sun and the planets into being more than 4.5bn years ago.\nBennu, first discovered in 1999, is about half a kilometre wide at its equator - only just wider than the Empire State Building's height, according to Nasa. It makes a close approach to Earth every six years.\nWith its payload now secured, the spacecraft will circle the Sun twice so it can catch up to Earth and then deposit its debris capsule into Earth's atmosphere.\nNasa says this departure sequence will be its \"most significant manoeuvre\" since it arrived on the asteroid. The craft must change velocity by 595mph (958 km/h) in order to intersect Earth, and will eventually travel 1.4bn miles (2.3bn km) on its journey home.\n\"There is no straight path back to Earth,\" the space exploration agency said in a statement. \"Like a quarterback throwing a long pass to where a receiver will be in the future, Osiris-Rex is travelling to where the Earth will be.\"  \nOnce the capsule touches down, it will be taken to Nasa's Johnson Space Center facility in Houston, Texas for further study. \nNasa says it plans on keeping 75% of the samples for future generations to study \"with technologies not yet created\"."

      "text": "Scotland's first minister has told Prime Minister Boris Johnson that a second independence referendum is \"a matter of when - not if\".\nNicola Sturgeon spoke directly with Mr Johnson for the first time since the SNP won an emphatic victory in Thursday's Holyrood election. \nEarlier, Ms Sturgeon said she did not expect the debate to end up in court.\nA senior UK government minister appeared to suggest it would not mount a legal challenge to her plans. \nDuring a phone call with Mr Johnson on Sunday afternoon, the first minister pledged to work with the UK government on steering the country through the Covid pandemic towards recovery.\nThe SNP said the leaders also agreed the importance of both governments working together \"closely and constructively\" to make the forthcoming UN climate conference in Glasgow a success.\nBut a party spokeswoman added: \"The FM also re-iterated her intention to ensure that the people of Scotland can choose our own future when the crisis is over, and made clear that the question of a referendum is now a matter of when - not if.\"\nThe UK Government said Mr Johnson spoke to the first minister to \"congratulate her on her party's success\" in the Scottish Parliament election.\nA spokesman said the prime minister emphasised \"the importance of focusing on Covid recovery at this time\".\nHe added: \"They both agreed that their immediate focus should be on working together to build back from the pandemic.\n\"The Prime Minister reiterated his invitation for the first minister to join a summit meeting to discuss our shared challenges on Covid recovery and how we can overcome them.\"\nMeanwhile, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Nicola Sturgeon was questioned whether she would introduce a referendum bill as early as next spring based on predictions that the UK will have recovered in terms of coronavirus circulation and GDP.\nShe said: \"That would certainly work for that timescale of within the first half of the parliamentary term.\n\"I desperately hope those predictions are correct but we have to judge that as we go through this year. We've still got significant challenges ahead. I wouldn't rule that out but I'm not sitting here saying that is the timescale.\"\nMr Johnson earlier invited Ms Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford to a summit to discuss a UK-wide approach to recovery from the pandemic. \nHe has said it would be \"reckless and irresponsible\" to have a referendum right now, and the UK government is not currently expected to grant formal consent for a vote to be held - as it did ahead of the 2014 referendum.\nThere has been speculation that the row could end up with the courts being asked to rule on whether the Scottish government has the power to hold a referendum without the UK government's agreement.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said she did not believe either side wanted a legal battle over the issue. \nShe said: \"The UK government knows that if we ever get into a situation where this is being determined in the courts then actually what the UK government is arguing is that there is no democratic route for Scotland to have independence.\n\"The implications of that would be very grave indeed. If the argument of the unionist side is that Scotland is trapped it strikes me that that is one of the strongest arguments for independence.\"\nMs Sturgeon also said it would be \"absurd and completely outrageous\" if the UK government went to court over the issue and that it was \"up to the Scottish people\" to decide the country's future.\nHer party stood on a manifesto to steer the country out of the pandemic, and to then hold a referendum, which she said people had \"voted overwhelmingly for\".\nShe added: \"The fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK government has demonstrated for quite some time now.\"\nAlso appearing on the programme, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he would \"not go near\" the issue of the UK government potentially challenging a referendum bill in court.\nHe said: \"Whatever parties we come from, the priority at the moment is not court cases, it's not independence legislation - it is recovery from the pandemic.\"\nWhen asked if Scotland was allowed to leave the UK, he said: \"Of course it is, through a legal referendum which would allow people to make that choice.\"\nBut he also insisted that the SNP's failure to win an overall majority showed that the people of Scotland were not \"agitating\" for a referendum.\nThe SNP finished on 64 seats in Thursday's Scottish election - one short of a majority but one more than it won in 2016 - while the Conservatives won 31, Labour 22, the pro-independence Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four.\nBut Mr Gove said a majority of voters - 51% - had backed parties that were opposed to independence in the constituency ballot - although the same percentage voted for pro-independence parties in the regional list ballot.  \nBBC Scotland's Sunday Show later asked Mr Gove to clarify the indication he gave to Marr that the UK government would not mount a legal challenge to a Scottish independence referendum bill.\nMr Gove said: \"We are not going to go down the route of talking about independence or legal challenges or anything like that now when our principal focus and exclusive attention is going on pandemic recovery.\n\"At the moment all we want to do is work with the first minister to concentrate on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic and the need to recover and build back better.\"\nMr Gove denied he was giving the Scottish government a green light to pass a referendum bill, saying \"we are concentrating on recovery at the moment\".\nIn her victory speech, Ms Sturgeon said her priority was leading the country through the pandemic - but said she still intended to hold an independence referendum once the crisis has passed.\nIn a letter to Ms Sturgeon published on Saturday night, the prime minister invited Ms Sturgeon to \"discuss our shared challenges\", adding \"we will not always agree - but I am confident... we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve.\"\nMr Johnson said the country needed to \"show the same spirit of unity and co-operation that marked our fight against the pandemic\" in engineering a Covid-19 recovery.\nBut he warned it would be a \"difficult journey\", adding: \"The broad shoulders of the UK have supported jobs and businesses the length and breadth of the country, but we know that economic recovery will be a serious shared responsibility.\""

      "text": "The Queen has fondly remembered becoming the first young person in the Commonwealth to receive a junior lifesaving award from the Royal Life Saving Society.\nAs Princess Elizabeth, she was 14 years old when she earned the junior respiration award in February 1941.\nHer Majesty, 95, learnt she was the very first to receive the award during a call last week with the society.\nWhen told 80 years had since passed, she proclaimed: \"That's terrible!\"\nThe Queen smiled and looked in good spirits during last Thursday's virtual meeting, just days after she began official engagements following the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.\nIt comes as she prepares to carry out her first major public ceremonial duty since Prince Philip's death in April, when she attends a scaled-back and Covid-secure state opening of Parliament on Tuesday.\nThe fact she was the first young person to receive that particular award appeared to have been news to the monarch, who responded with surprise during the call with the society.\nShe said: \"I didn't realise I was the first one. I just did it, and had to work very hard for it. It's a very long time ago, I'm afraid, I think it's changed a lot.\"\nClive Holland, deputy Commonwealth president of the society, told her: \"Your Majesty, when you say it was a long time ago, it was in fact 80 years ago.\"\nThe monarch also met Sarah Downs, a 20-year-old student who saved a child's life when she was on duty as a lifeguard at a swimming pool in Exeter in 2018.\nMs Downs asked the Queen about her experience of qualifying as a junior lifesaver, training for which took place at a private members' club in Mayfair, central London.\nThe Queen said: \"Well, it's a very long time ago. I do remember it was of course all done in the Bath Club in the swimming pool.\n\"And I suppose I didn't really actually realise quite what I was doing, you know, because I think I must have been 12 or something, 12 or 14, or something like that.\n\"But it was a great achievement and I was very proud to wear the badge on the front of my swimming suit. It was very grand I thought.\"\nMs Downs, a physiotherapy student at Manchester Metropolitan University, won the society's Russell Medal for resuscitating a boy at the Middlemoor Pool in Exeter.\nThe Russell Medal is awarded annually to someone under 18 for displaying bravery and quick-thinking under pressure.\nMs Downs said that a boy had a fit underwater as she was getting some arm bands.\nShe added: \"So when I came back to the shallow end, being notified of this child under the water and then getting him out of the pool, I completed CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on him to resuscitate and bring him back around.\"\nThe monarch also praised the bravery of another young lifesaver, Tanner Gorille, from Cape Town, South Africa, and congratulated Dr Stephen Beerman, from Canada, for his outstanding contributions to the prevention of drownings.\nThe Queen is patron of the Royal Life Saving Society, which was founded in London in 1891."

      "text": "The only way for there to be a successful referendum on Scottish independence is if both sides agree. \nThat's how they did it in 2014 with the Edinburgh agreement and the alternatives are messy and risky for both sides. \nIf the current stand-off between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson cannot be resolved, the first minister intends - at some point - to pass a referendum bill at Holyrood. \nShe dares the UK government to challenge the legislation in court which it may feel obliged to do because it considers such a vote to be beyond devolved powers. \nThe UK constitution - including the union between Scotland and England - is a matter reserved to Westminster by law. \nHowever, it could be argued that reservation does not explicitly prevent Holyrood from consulting the public on independence. \nThen again, a \"yes\" vote in any referendum would create an expectation that major constitutional change would follow, as it did in the advisory vote on Brexit. \nThese are the arguments the UK Supreme Court would have to work through. \nAt the weekend, both the UK cabinet minister Michael Gove and the first minister downplayed the prospect of a legal battle but that is what would inevitably happen unless the two sides make a deal. \nUK government sources have made clear that just because they are not seeking to take legal action does not mean they would not go to court if a specific referendum proposal emerged. \nEven if the UK government did not challenge, somebody surely would. The whisky industry tied up minimum alcohol pricing legislation in court for five years. \nIf the court ruled in Nicola Sturgeon's favour, that might enable a referendum but it could still face a unionist boycott which would de-legitimise the outcome. \nIf the court ruled in Boris Johnson's favour, that would thwart a referendum because Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would not hold an illegal vote. \nHowever, Nicola Sturgeon could argue in those circumstances that the union was being held together by force of law rather than consent which would be a rotten look for the UK. \nThat might lead to a rise in support for independence. \nThe UK government could pass legislation to explicitly prevent Holyrood from having a referendum or to organise its own vote - options that carry similar risks. \nThe UK strategy for the moment seems to be to play for time by arguing that there can be another referendum at some unspecified point in the future but not now. \nThey make the case that it would be irresponsible to have a referendum while we are still in a pandemic. \nOn that point, Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon agree and appear to be in tune with Scottish public opinion. \nThere are other reasons the first minister is not in a rush. She wants to win a referendum and so would prefer to see support for independence running higher. \nPolls suggested there was a sustained majority for a \"yes\" vote throughout much of last year but that has dipped in recent months. The country appears split down the middle. \nIt also became clear during the election that the Scottish government needs time to work out detailed plans for what independence would mean for trade and borders in the aftermath of Brexit. \nIn short, they are not ready to fight a referendum however desperate some in the independence movement are for it to happen. \nNicola Sturgeon has told Boris Johnson she considers indyref2 a matter of \"when - not if\". Officially she still favours having the vote by the end of 2023. \nThere is unlikely to be any immediate effort by the Scottish government to begin preparations. The SNP is likely to start working on refreshing the independence case before civil servants are given instructions. \nAs Holyrood returns to business, expect to see the SNP and Greens demonstrate the majority they now have for indyref2 in a symbolic way at an early stage. \nWith 64 SNP votes and eight from the Greens, support for independence is as high as it has ever been in the 129-seat parliament, matching the \"yes\" majority after the 2011 election. \nThe two parties made explicit commitments to hold a referendum in their election manifestos. The two parties have more votes and seats than before. \nThat is their mandate for indyref2. By contrast, pro-UK parties got 51% of the constituency vote in this election which they take as a mandate to oppose it. \nAny referendum legislation would need to be certified as within Holyrood's powers by Scotland's top law officer, the lord advocate, and parliament's presiding officer who is elected on Thursday. \nThe choice of a new minister for the constitution and external affairs to replace Mike Russell will also be significant when the first minister gets round to a reshuffle. \nHer immediate priority is a review of Covid rules to be announced on Tuesday. \nThe election result means there will be a big wrangle over indyref2 in the next few years. It could be resolved through negotiation and agreement or a showdown in the courts. \nThis constitutional clash is not immediate. The dispute is deferred. Pandemic first will be the mantra on all sides in the period ahead. "

      "title": "Covid-19: Hugging to be allowed in England as UK alert level drops",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning.\nBoris Johnson has confirmed people in England will be able to hug loved ones, dine inside restaurants, drink inside pubs, and go abroad on holiday from next Monday. Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, he said the 17 May easing was the \"single biggest step\" on the roadmap so far. On hugging, people should consider the vulnerability of their loved ones and use common sense, the PM added. Zero coronavirus deaths were announced in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Monday, while there were four in Wales. It is likely that there were deaths since Sunday and these could be accounted for in the coming days, however. Meanwhile, people in Scotland will be able to travel to some international destinations without having to quarantine on their return, the BBC understands. The move will come into effect on 24 May. And here's some more on the science of why we've been missing hugs.\nThe UK's coronavirus alert level is being lowered from four to three on the advice of experts. The new level means although the virus is in general circulation, transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially. The UK moved to the highest Covid alert level - five - in January as the nation was put into lockdown and there was a real risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed. By late February, the alert was lowered to four. Level three means there is a gradual easing of restrictions - as is happening now. You can find out more on how the UK plans to ease restrictions here. \nThe wearing of face masks in secondary school classrooms in England will not be required after 17 May, the government has confirmed. Face coverings have been recommended since students returned in March, but there have been concerns they get in the way of communicating and learning. A group of scientists and teachers' unions has argued the measure should stay. Twice weekly home testing will remain to control infection rates. The government also confirmed that remaining students will return to university campuses from next Monday too, with half of students having been studying online since January.  \nWhen millions of devout Hindus gathered last month in the Himalayan town of Haridwar to participate in the Kumbh Mela festival - even as India battled a devastating second wave of coronavirus - many feared that it would turn out to be a \"super-spreader event\". Those fears, it now seems, are coming true, with reports of Kumbh returnees testing positive - and possibly spreading the infection - coming from many parts of the country. Epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant said \"huge groups of mask-less pilgrims sitting on the river bank singing the glories of the Ganges\" created an ideal environment for the virus to spread rapidly, adding: \"We already know that chorus singing in churches and temples are known to be super-spreader events.\" Read more here. Meanwhile, 1,000 pieces of life-saving equipment will be sent from Wales to hospitals in India to help with the Covid crisis - there's more on that here.\nWorking from home has become a way of life for many (and if you're sick of Zoom calls, you're not alone - HSBC is to ban them on Fridays to give staff a break). But with many offices now gradually inviting staff back, we wanted to know how people are feeling about their return. Alexander Holland, a computer chip designer from Oxford, says one of the toughest challenges was the proximity of the biscuit tin. \"Working from home for over a year, at a desk only a few meters away from the TV and the kitchen, with very little natural self-control hasn't been good for my waistline or my time management,\" he says. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nTravel is set to return for England from next Monday. Click here for a reminder of the countries on the green list so far, meaning there are the fewest restrictions for travel. \nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Martin Lewis and Sir Richard Branson are the celebrities whose names are used most in fake endorsement scams, a report has found.\nThe National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) removed more than 730,000 websites running the tricks in 2020. \nMr Lewis, founder of the website Money Saving Expert, said the whole issue sickened him.\nExperts at the cyber-agency, which is part of intelligence agency GCHQ, say it's a growing problem.\nCriminals create fake news articles claiming that celebrities are backing new investment schemes. \nThe articles are spread through mass email campaigns, SMS texts, or adverts on social media.\nThey come with a link to websites which encourage victims to invest in the unscrupulous programmes.\nAlthough the theme of these attacks is often cryptocurrency, the template can be used to promote any type of fake investment opportunity. \nMr Lewis said: 'It's the worst flattery I've ever had. These thieves and con artists leach off the reputation for trust I've built up by trying to help and protect consumers, in order to try and steal money off vulnerable people.\n'The concept makes me feel nauseous. We must step up our fight to stop these scams which destroy millions of people's finances and mental health.'\nThe news comes from the NCSC's annual Active Cyber Defence report which outlines the actions the agency took to prevent fraud, scams and cyber-attacks.\nThe NCSC says it began taking action against the websites in April 2020, and by the end of the calendar year it had taken down 286,322 separate campaigns across 731,080 URLs. \nThe cyber-agency says the relatively new scams are a global issue.\nUK victims see curated content with recognisable British figures, but if you were to view the same article from France, the content served would probably appear as an article in a fake French newspaper featuring a celebrity from the country. \nIan Levy, the NCSC's technical director, said Mr Lewis and Mr Branson made up \"a decent chunk\" of all the celebrity endorsement scams they discovered. \n\"They're really convincing and it's no surprise that people fall for them. Criminals use both newspaper brands and celebrities combined to make these articles look really good,\" he said. \n\"Martin Lewis and Sir Richard Branson are used because they are famous and because they are related to money. It must be horrible for them.\"\nMr Lewis is urging the government to reverse its decision not to include scams in the future Online Safety Bill, which is expected to be in the Queen's Speech this week. \nIn 2019 Mr Lewis agreed to drop legal action against Facebook for allowing his name and photo to be used in fake adverts on the platform.\nIn return, Facebook agreed to donate \u00a33m to set up an anti-scam programme.\nElsewhere in the NCSC's report, it says it carried out a 15-fold increase in campaign takedowns in total.\nThe agency it took action against nearly 1.5 million web addresses from fake shops to phishing sites pretending to be government services."

      "text": "A pub and restaurant group is calling for all significant restrictions on trading to be lifted before July.\nMark Drakeford's cabinet discussed which Covid restrictions to lift next when it met for the first time since Labour's Welsh election win.\nAllowing pubs and restaurants to serve customers indoors from 17 May is the next Covid rule set to be relaxed.\nBut a group representing the hospitality sector says social distancing rules should be scrapped.\nThe outcome of Monday's cabinet meeting will not be known until later in the week, with the latest plans for lockdown restrictions due to be announced in the Welsh government's next three-week review on Friday.\nMr Drakeford is to lead a Labour-only Welsh government after the party won half of the Welsh Parliament's 60 seats.\nHe is to be formally sworn in as Wales' first minister when the Senedd returns on Wednesday.\nWales' Covid infection rate of 8.6 cases for every 100,000 people is the lowest since August.\nPatients in Welsh hospitals with coronavirus are at record lows and more than a quarter of the Welsh population have now had both doses of a Covid vaccine.\nUnder current plans and providing rates remain low, on 17 May indoor attractions, cinemas and theatres will open alongside pubs and restaurants serving customers inside.\nIn an open letter to ministers, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective (WIRC) renewed its call for Covid restrictions to be eased on the hospitality sector and for financial support at least matching that available in England and Scotland.\nThe group, representing more than 400 cafes, pubs, restaurants and hotels, urged the Welsh government to allow any six people to sit together indoors and to scrap the 2m social distancing rule.\nThe letter said it was \"not a case of following England for its own sake, but a recognition that the science is the same there as it is here\".\n\"The closer we align our rules across the UK, the easier it is to communicate those rules to an increasingly confused public,\" it added.\nThe letter also said there should be \"an immediate announcement to signal a restart grant at least as generous as those in Scotland and England\".\n\"That support needs to acknowledge that in Wales we have been under the heaviest trading restrictions of any of the UK nations and that the gap in funding that has persisted since March 31 needs to be filled,\" the letter added.\nMinisters were expected on Monday to decide what to ease next from Wales' lockdown rules.\nLocal Government Minister Julie James said discussing restrictions around foreign holidays was also \"very much part of the package of discussion for Monday\".\nThe UK government has announced plans in England to allow tourists to visit a green list of 12 destinations, including Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar. \nThe Welsh government is yet to confirm if they will align with the plans or take a different approach.\nWales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales the risks he saw around international travel centred on \"too rapid a relaxation of the social distancing rules, and possibly around waning in immunity\".\nHe added: \"We can do things about these, but some of them, we just have to be cautious, bide our time, keep to our low rates, and that will keep Wales safe.\"\nMeanwhile, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the recovery of the NHS from Covid was \"going to be a huge task\" that he thought would \"take a full Senedd term\".\nSpeaking at a distribution centre in Newport that was preparing to send life-saving equipment to India, he said the pandemic was \"not quite over yet\", with ongoing pressure from long Covid, for example.\nThe NHS was also facing a huge backlog of treatment and operations that had been delayed because of coronavirus, he said.\nMr Gething said: \"You simply can't recover in a matter of months - and that's the level of honesty I think we need with the public and with our staff.\"\nHe warned the recovery of the NHS would take time \"partly because of capacity but importantly because our staff need to be cared for as well\".\nWelsh Labour has budgeted to spend at least \u00a31bn extra on NHS recovery.\nMr Drakeford said on Saturday that Wales' response to the Covid pandemic had been a major part in Labour's election win as they were returned as the largest party for the sixth successive time since devolution in 1999.\n\"A government I lead will continue to follow the science to do what our medical advisers tells us we should do, and that does mean doing things in a way that continues to keep Wales safe,\" he said.\nThe Welsh government controls Wales' Covid response and the relaxing of restrictions - such as meeting inside pubs and restaurants and travel rules - has tended to have been more cautious in Wales.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that people from different households would be able to meet up and hug from 17 May in England.\nIt is up to individuals whether they socially distance with close family and friends from that date in England.\nThe UK government said it wanted to let people in England exercise personal judgement as more of life returns to normal, but people are still urged to remain cautious and remember some people are more vulnerable to Covid than others.\nAddressing the issue of hugging in Wales, Dr Atherton said: \"Prevalence rates are really quite low at the moment, and being close to a member of your family is less risk now - but with strangers, I would be very cautious still.\n\"I think there are other ways to greet people than to give everybody a hug, so there are ways to do that and to do it safely - don't spend too long making face-to-face contact, make it a brief hug.\n\"But to be honest, I think it is quite right - I understand that grandparents want to hug their grandkids, of course they do, and that's only natural.\n\"But we have learned over the last year that there are other ways to interact socially, and perhaps\u2026 hug cautiously.\"\nThe new Senedd is meeting for the first time on Wednesday to elect a presiding officer and deputy presiding officer to conduct proceedings. \nThen, once those posts are filled Labour will then be able to re-nominate Mr Drakeford as first minister - with no significant challenge from the opposition expected to his reappointment.\n\"We have demonstrated over a number of governments that you can govern successfully on 30 seats, but I'm open to working with any party where there is common ground between us,\" he said.\nLib Dem leader Jane Dodds, their only Senedd member, has ruled out joining the Welsh government like her predecessor Kirsty Williams did.

      "tags": "Angela Rayner,Keir Starmer,Labour Party",
      "text": "Was it worth it?\nReshuffles are moments when leaders have a chance to assert their authority - to show they are in charge.\nEven the most ardent political obsessive would acknowledge (probably) that opposition reshuffles are not necessarily noticed by the public.\nBut they matter to the mood and atmosphere of parties and Parliament.\nAnd for a party to win favour with voters over time, it needs to show the public trusted and favourite faces, to give the impression of an organisation ready for government - a group of people who we can all imagine in charge.\nSir Keir Starmer's first reshuffle, however, has been a very messy affair.\nIt began badly with a bust up with his deputy, Angela Rayner, who was being moved from one of her roles - in charge of campaigns.\nHer allies said she was being sacked. Sir Keir's team said she was being moved. They can't both be telling the whole truth.\nBut there was a late night howl of backlash to the notion she was being ousted, putting pressure on the leader to find a way to make her stay.\nIt took all day for the two to agree. That may seem astounding given that Sir Keir is meant to be the boss.\nRemember, however, that Ms Rayner's position as deputy leader is an elected one, and even the suggestion of her losing part of her role had already provoked outrage.\nClearly, she was in no mood to compromise.\nWhether it was settled in the end by an arm wrestle, a staring match, or screaming and shouting, the length of time it took created a massive vacuum - which Sir Keir's critics on the left of the party filled, almost with glee, to push him for a change in direction.\nAnd even some of his backers felt anxious, cross about the delays, concerned about the competence of the so called \"brains trust\" - a nickname for his team of advisers, not always used in a very complimentary way. \nAfter a day of dispute and delay, in the end, the list emerged. \nSome important changes, but not a sweeping recasting of the team - you can read about the changes here. \nMs Rayner did stay in the end, with a prominent job, and - according to her allies - a newfound confidence.\nWithin minutes, they were briefing that her power has been boosted, implying she was the victor in the stand-off with the boss.\nOne of her supporters said: \"On Friday Keir couldn't answer a simple question about what Labour's vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the voters in our heartland seats. \n\"Angela can answer that question and is the best person to lead the fight back in the Red Wall.\"\nAlthough an accommodation of sorts has been reached over her job, it doesn't seem like the two have reached a truce. \nIt's easy for moments like these to be overplayed as seismic and massively significant, when in a few months, the mood calms, events fade. \nBut these last few days have been an important political test for the Labour leader.\nIn a statement, Sir Keir said: \"The Labour Party must be the party that embraces the demand for change across our country. That will require bold ideas and a relentless focus on the priorities of the British people.\n\"Just as the pandemic has changed what is possible and what is necessary, so Labour must change too.\"\nThe election results were expected to be grim, but the handling of the reshuffle was a mess that could have been avoided - and a knock to his authority he didn't need.

      "text": "People in Scotland will be able to travel to some foreign destinations without the need to quarantine on their return, the BBC understands.\nIt will be part of a traffic lights system, similar to that in England, and will come into effect on 24 May.\nCountries are to be classified as green, amber and red and a review will take place every four weeks.\nThe Scottish government said a Covid briefing would take place on Tuesday and it would not comment on reports.\nIf the system is like that of England then the categorisation of countries will be based on both Covid cases and vaccine rates. \nThe green list - operational down south from 17 May - includes Portugal, Israel, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Iceland, Gibraltar, Falkland Islands, Faroe Islands, South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands, St Helena, Tristan de Cunha and Ascension Island. A passenger locator form is necessary plus pre-departure testing but no hotel quarantine or self-isolation is needed on return.\nThe England approach for the amber list also involves form filling, testing and no hotel stay, but self-isolation for 10 days would be required. Red countries would involve hotel quarantine.\nThe current Scottish government guidance is that you should only go abroad if you have \"an essential reason to do so. You must not travel abroad on holiday\".\nPeople who do need to travel have to isolate in a hotel, at a cost of about \u00a31,750, or at home for at least 10 days after arriving back.\nAt the moment you can travel anywhere in Scotland and stay in holiday accommodation but you cannot be overnight in someone else's home. Travel to England, Wales and Northern Ireland is also permitted.\nResponding to the news of a traffic lights travel system for Scotland, Linda Hill, of LAH Travel in Ayrshire, told Radio Scotland's Drivetime: \"It is light at the end of the tunnel and as an industry we welcome this. \n\"I think consumer confidence is still very low and I don't see a surge in bookings as it's still quite a difficult process to go on holiday in terms of tests before you go and when you come back.  \n\"I absolutely want a four nations approach, I think it is the most sensible thing to do when it comes to international travel.\"\nNational clinical director Prof Jason Leitch told the programme a decision on changes to the foreign travel rules had not been made yet. \nHe said: \"The UK Government has announced what those green, red amber countries are, around what will be allowed, and the first minister and her cabinet will be making that decision tonight and tomorrow, and she will announce it tomorrow lunch time.\"\nProf Leitch said the \"vaccination programme has changed the equation a little\" on overseas travel compared to last summer but there was concern \"about variants in particular\" and said that was why the English green list of countries was so small.

      "text": "The US has authorised the Pfizer vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds amid a push to get the shot into more Americans' arms.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it was \"a significant step in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic\".\nFDA Commissioner Dr Janet Woodcock said the move was aimed at \"bringing us close to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic\".\nAbout 250 million doses have been given in the US, but demand has been falling.\nMs Woodcock added in her statement: \"Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our Covid-19 vaccine emergency use authorisations.\"\nMonday's announcement expands an emergency use authorisation that already allowed the Pfizer jab to be administered to people as young as 16 in the US. \nThe decision follows a clinical trial by Pfizer and BioNTech involving 2,260 children aged 12-15. The participants received either two doses of the vaccine, or a placebo.\nThere were 18 cases of symptomatic coronavirus infection in the placebo group and none among the children who received the vaccine, found the trial.\nThe FDA's seal of approval is not the final regulatory hurdle. An advisory panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will review the data soon.\nImmunisations could begin straight away if, as expected, the CDC committee approves the vaccine's use in adolescents.\nSome of New York and Oregon's biggest universities have meanwhile joined a\u00a0growing number of higher education institutions requiring students and staff to have Covid-19 vaccinations before they can return to classes this autumn.\nThe rules were announced on Monday by State University of New York, the City University of New York, the University of Oregon and Western Oregon University.\u00a0\nLast week, US President Joe Biden announced a plan to get at least one dose of vaccine administered to 70% of the nation's population by 4 July.\nMask mandates are being loosened across the country, and most states have reopened their economies, or are doing so within the next month.\nBut dwindling demand for the shot has been prompting states across the country to refuse their full allocation of doses from the federal government.\nWisconsin, Iowa, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina and Washington are all among states that reduced their requests.\nThe risk of children becoming seriously ill from the virus is tiny, health data shows. \nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), as of this month 3.85 million US children have tested positive for Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic, just over 10% of total cases nationwide.\nBetween 0.1%-1.9% of all child Covid-19 cases resulted in the patient being admitted to hospital, found the organisation's report.\nNo more than 0.03% of all child Covid-19 cases resulted in death, according to the AAP.\nThe risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared with Covid-19, according to the CDC.\nPfizer has been one of a number of vaccine manufacturers testing jabs on children. The aim of vaccinating them - particularly older children - would be to keep schools open, reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and protect vulnerable children with conditions which put them at increased risk. \nModerna and Johnson & Johnson are currently testing their vaccines on those aged 12-18, with Moderna's data expected soon. \nModerna and Pfizer are also testing their jabs on younger children between six months and 11 years old. \nIn the UK, AstraZeneca is testing its vaccine on 300 child volunteers. Researchers will assess whether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17. \nLast week President Biden said he planned to back a World Trade Organization waiver that would take away intellectual property rights from vaccine manufacturers. If approved, the waiver would allow production of vaccines to be ramped up and provide more affordable doses for less wealthy countries. \nThe head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described Mr Biden's backing as a \"monumental moment in the fight against Covid\".

      "text": "Average house prices have climbed about \u00a320,000 in the last year, the Halifax says, as the buying frenzy prompted by the stamp duty holiday continues.\nPrices are up 8.2% in the last 12 months, the highest annual growth rate for five years, it said. \nAltura mortgage broker Rob Gill said \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO) was driving the surge. \n\"There's a fear among buyers that they could miss out if they don't hurry up and buy before prices spiral,\" he said.\nThe Halifax said that prices rose sharply in April, up by 1.4% compared with March. The average price of a UK home hit \u00a3258,204, a record high.\nAt the Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the stamp duty holiday to June. The property purchase tax has been suspended on the first \u00a3500,000 of all sales in England and Northern Ireland since July to support the market.\n\"The stamp duty holiday continues to add impetus to an extremely active market, magnifying the current shortage of available homes as buyers aim to take advantage of the Government scheme,\" said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\nHe predicted that the influence of the stamp duty holiday will fade gradually over the coming months as it is tapered out but that low stock levels, low interest rates and continued demand is likely to continue to underpin prices in the market.\nKirsty Kirby is a first-time buyer in South Yorkshire who has been planning to move house since 2018. But the 37-year-old pharmaceutical worker says even getting a viewing for a property is a challenge.\n\"I ring for many properties,\" she says. \"I'm like a hawk on Rightmove, I must refresh it several times an hour, just to see what's on.\"\nKirsty says most homes she enquires about already have multiple viewing bookings within minutes of appearing online and estate agents warn her the house will be going to 'best and final' offers.\nBest and final is a system where buyers put in one offer for the seller to choose from, in order to avoid a bidding war between prospective home-owners.\nKirsty says, in her experience, anytime a property goes to best and final \"it goes way above the asking price because people get crazy\".\nRead more\n\"This market isn't standing still for a second,\" said analyst Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton. \"The feeding frenzy for property was already feeling pretty ferocious but then along comes another big leap in the annual rate of [house price] growth.\"\nShe said the current state of the market means timing is crucial for buyers and not wasting time is essential.\n\"In a blazing hot seller's market like this, most buyers don't even compare prices locally to make their offer, they work out what they can afford and they go for it.\"\nNicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country, said: \"Buyers need to be incredibly determined to succeed in a market like this.\"\nShe predicted that the market rally will continue with optimism being complemented by improving weather, the imminent loosening of Covid restrictions, low interest rates, a yearning for more space and the fact that many homeowners have saved thousands of pounds not being able to go anywhere. \n\"This won't be the last record high we'll see this year by a long stretch,\" she said."

      "tags": "Swansea,Newport,Neonatal care,Islam,Coronavirus pandemic,Pregnancy",
      "text": "A woman who was in a coma with Covid while pregnant has told how she woke up the day after her baby was born.\nWhen Marriam Ahmad went into the Grange hospital in Cwmbran in January after testing positive for Covid, she left her overnight bag at home as she did not expect to be in for long.\nAt only 29 weeks pregnant, she and husband Usman had not even decided on a name for their second child.\nBut Marriam's condition quickly went downhill.\nThe 27-year-old paralegal, who has asthma, found herself in a \"very scary\" situation.\n\"All of a sudden, my oxygen mask was on a much higher setting - I couldn't hear properly,\" she said.\n\"It was very loud. I had someone washing my face, looking after me. I was very weak.\"\nIt was then that her doctor started to talk about a Caesarean section and initially said that Marriam would be conscious throughout.\nBut she was told that her baby may not be strong enough to survive.\nAs the day went on, the medical team decided Marriam needed to be put into a coma. The doctor held her hand as he told her she \"may not come back\".\n\"It just happened so quickly,\" she said. \"It was within about five minutes, they told me 'you're going on a ventilator, you're having a c-section, the baby's going to come out, you'll be unconscious, you might not make it. Say goodbye'.\"\nMarriam called her parents in Swansea and the doctor rang her husband, who was at home in Newport with their one-year-old son Yusuf.\n\"I didn't even speak to my husband or my son - I have never left my son, not even for a night,\" she said.  \n\"I Facetimed my parents and I was crying. It was only like a two-minute phone call - my Mum was like 'what are you talking about?'. I was lonely and I was scared.\"\nMarriam's baby was born on 18 January at 20:27 BST. Known as 'Baby Ahmad' for the first few days of her life, she weighed about as much as a bag of sugar - 1.17kg (2.5lbs).\nAmazingly, and despite the doctor's warnings, by midday the next day Marriam had woken up from the coma.\n\"I had no idea what happened,\" she said. \" I woke up. Obviously I could see there was nothing in my stomach anymore and I was in a lot of pain.\" \nFor the next week she was not able to see her baby. The nurses took photos and videos to show Marriam, who was trying to recover herself, by now out of intensive care and in the hospital's high dependency unit.\nAll the staff at the hospital were keen to keep up-to-date on how the two were getting on.\n\"Even the cleaner from ICU remembered me,\" she said.\n\"He used to come up and say 'how are you doing, how is Baby Ahmad? What are you going to call her? Call her something special, call her something special'.\"\nAnd so, as Marriam and Usman prepared to meet their daughter after nearly a week, they decided on a name - Khadija.\n\"In the Islamic faith, Khadija is a very strong, independent woman,\" said Marriam.  \n\"From my point of view, my Khadija was very strong. She didn't have issues, for someone being preterm at 29 weeks. They were telling me all the complications. She didn't have any of those. It was a miracle.\"\nSo how did it feel to finally see and hold her baby daughter?\n\"I just found her so beautiful,\" she said. \"Even though she was covered in all these wires and just in a nappy. I just thought 'this is my baby'. It felt very natural.\"\nKhadija was then transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit at Singleton hospital in Swansea so Marriam could be closer to her extended family.\nThe weeks that followed were just as \"intense\", with Marriam determined to try and breastfeed her daughter, meaning constant deliveries of milk to the hospital.\nAfter eight weeks in hospital, Khadija is now home. At three-and-a-half months, she is happy, healthy and feeding well - now weighing nearly 4kg (8.8lbs).\nMarriam admits that life with a newborn and a 16-month-old means she \"hasn't really had time to think\" about what has happened.\n\"I am just so grateful - that she's still alive, that I am still alive. \n\"Even though it was such a horrific, traumatic experience, I just found myself being even more grateful for the little things. Just spending time with family.    \n\"Make the most of every opportunity and be grateful - that's what I've taken from it.\""

      "tags": "Scottish Parliament election 2021",
      "text": "As the dust settles after a marathon two-day count and the winners prepare for life at Holyrood, we look at the facts and figures behind the story of the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.\nThe SNP has been handed a fresh five-year term in government at Holyrood, their fourth in a row.\nBy the time it is up in 2026, the party will have been in government for 19 years - and Nicola Sturgeon may be asking for votes from people who were born after she first entered government.\nThe proportional representation system used for Holyrood elections essentially did its job of producing a parliament which roughly mirrors the way people voted as a whole across Scotland.\nThe SNP took just under half of the vote, and won just under half of the seats in parliament.\nThe Conservatives took 23.5% of the \"peach party vote\" they based much of their campaigning on, and were rewarded with 24% of the seats.\nLabour meanwhile had 19% of the regional list vote and 17% of the seats, while the Greens got 8% of the vote and 6% of the seats.\nThe Lib Dems took all four of their seats from constituency contests, but still based on list tallies across Scotland ended up with 3% of the seats from 5% of the vote.\nThis has been an election where not much has changed - only three of the 73 constituencies changed hands, compared to 18 in 2016.\nRanking the results by how narrow the winning margin was, there were 16 seats with a single-digit majority - generally considered a \"marginal\" seat.\nThis is the same number as there were before the election, and indeed 10 of them are the very same seats. We may spend election night in 2026 talking about Eastwood, Aberdeenshire West and Dumbarton all over again.\nThe difference is that after 2016, nine of the 10 most marginal seats were SNP targets. Now, only three are - and they are defending the other seven.\nIt may seem an obvious point given they now hold the lion's share of constituencies, but there are fewer easy targets for Nicola Sturgeon's party in future - and far more wobbly seats to defend, including the country's most marginal in Ayr which they won by just 170 votes.\nAs previously, these close contests are mostly SNP-Conservative affairs. Labour was not in second place in a single constituency with a single-digit majority before the election, and they only have one now - East Lothian, the seat they lost to the SNP.\nThis means there is little in the way of obvious target seats for Anas Sarwar to start building towards challenging in 2026.\nOne striking change between the 2016 and 2021 results was that in Shetland - which has gone from the safest seat in Scotland, with a 44.3% majority to the ninth most marginal, with a cushion of just 6.8%.\nThese figures exclude the fact there was a by-election midway through the term, but it is still a big shift in a Lib Dem stronghold.\nThe safest seat now belongs to Shona Robison in Dundee City East with a 41.4% majority - with her Dundee City West neighbour Joe Fitzpatrick in second spot on 40.2%.\nFinance Secretary Kate Forbes has also constructed something of a fortress in Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, with the biggest majority in terms of raw votes - 15,861 of them.\nPerhaps the rise of tactical voting in this election means we need a new way to talk about \"safe\" seats, though. Contests have increasingly become a race between the SNP and whichever other party is best placed locally to challenge them.\nOn that front, there were 29 seats where the SNP won more than 50% of the vote - so much that even if the opposition clubbed together and backed one candidate, they would still not win.\nThe Conservatives only had one seat with a margin this wide - Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire - and Labour had none.\nOddly though, the smallest party, the Lib Dems, had three. And their fourth seat was not far behind, on 48.6%. They seem to have become the party of extremes, because they also lost their deposit in 50 of the 73 constituencies, by polling under 5% of the vote.\nWhile nothing much has changed in the makeup of the parliament, the existing parties rather entrenched their positions.\nThere was a lot of talk of smaller parties during the campaign, with Alex Salmond launching the Alba Party to great fanfare, but ultimately they barely made a dent in the figures with 1.7% of the regional ballot.\nGeorge Galloway's All for Unity group similarly flopped, managing 0.9% of the vote.\nAnd UKIP - now dedicated to shutting down Holyrood - secured just 3,848 list votes, 0.1% of the 2.7m cast around Scotland - and behind the rather more bluntly-titled Abolish the Scottish Parliament Party on 0.3%.\nOne of the big stories across Scotland was how many people came out to vote.\nTurnout hit a record high for a Holyrood election, at 63.2%. It was up in every single constituency, and indeed at least half of the registered electorate took part in every seat.\nIt was over 60% in 54 of the 73 constituencies, and over 70% in four.\nThe overall figure is ten points up on the average of the five previous Holyrood elections, and well in advance of the previous high of 59% in 1999.\nHowever it still lags behind the levels recorded in recent general elections north of the border - turnout was 68.1% for the Westminster election in December 2019 - and a good way off the massive engagement in the 2014 referendum, which was 84.6%.

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Jerusalem",
      "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended police action against Palestinian protesters after two nights of clashes in Jerusalem.\nHe said Israel \"shall not allow any radical element to undermine the calm\" in the city amid growing concerns over the spiralling violence.\nThe US, the EU, Russia and the UN on Saturday all expressed alarm.\nThe clashes follow a month of tensions, with the threatened eviction of Palestinian families a focal point.\nThe latest came on the eve of an expected hearing in the Israeli Supreme Court of the years-long case of the families, comprising more than 70 people, appealing against an eviction order in favour of a Jewish settler organisation in East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah district.\nBut the hearing was cancelled on Sunday following a request from Israel's attorney-general. A new date will be set in the next 30 days.\nMeanwhile, there are growing concerns that the annual Jerusalem Day Flag March - which traditionally sees thousands of Zionist youth march through the Muslim Quarter of East Jerusalem's Old City - could lead to more violence. \nA former high-ranking defence official, Amos Gilad, called for the march to be cancelled or re-routed, warning Army Radio: \"The powder keg is burning and can explode at any time.\"\nThe two nights of clashes took place around Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque complex, a frequent flashpoint for violence. It is one of Islam's most revered sites, but its location is also the holiest site in Judaism, known as the Temple Mount. \nSaturday's violence began after tens of thousands of worshippers had prayed at the compound on Laylat al-Qadr, the most holy night in the Muslim month of Ramadan. \nProtesters hurled stones at police at the Damascus Gate entrance to the Old City, and officers responded with stun grenades, rubber bullets and water cannon.\nAlmost 100 were injured, according to Palestinian medics.\nThe night before saw some of the worst clashes in the city in years, with more than 200 Palestinians and at least 17 Israeli police were wounded in skirmishes near the mosque, emergency workers and police said.\nA number of international voices have expressed concern over what was happening in East Jerusalem, including The Quartet of Middle East negotiators - the US, the EU, Russia and the UN.\n\"Violence only generates violence. Let's stop these clashes,\" Pope Francis said to the crowds in St Peter's Square, calling on all sides to respect Jerusalem for its multicultural identity.\nNeighbouring Jordan, custodian of Muslim holy sites in East Jerusalem, has condemned the actions of Israeli security forces in and around the mosque as \"barbaric\". Egypt, Turkey, Tunisia, Pakistan and Qatar - as well as Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, which normalised relations with Israel last year - have all also sharply criticised Israel.\nBut in a televised address to mark his country's capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, Mr Netanyahu defended Israeli police - as well as his government's decision to build Jewish settlements. \n\"We firmly reject the pressure not to build in Jerusalem. To my regret, this pressure has been increasing of late,\" he said.\nTensions have escalated in East Jerusalem since the start of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan in mid-April, with a series of events driving the unrest. \nAs Ramadan began, clashes erupted nightly between police and Palestinians protesting against security barriers outside Damascus Gate which had prevented them from gathering there during the evening. Palestinian anger was further exacerbated by a march by ultra-nationalist Jewish extremists close to the same area held in protest at a spate of videos posted on social media showing Palestinians assaulting ultra-Orthodox Jews in the city, and by revenge assaults on Palestinians by Jewish extremists.\nAmid an already febrile atmosphere, Palestinians have been rallying round the cause of four Palestinian families facing eviction in Sheikh Jarrah after Israeli courts ruled the land belonged to a Jewish settler organisation in a long-running and bitter legal case.\nIsrael's Supreme Court was due to hear the appeal of the families, who could be forcibly removed from the properties, a prospect which has caused an international outcry. The district had seen nightly violence between police and Palestinians ahead of the expected decision. Palestinian militant groups have warned of retaliation if the families are forced out.\nThe fate of East Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, with both sides claiming the right to it. Israel effectively annexed East Jerusalem in 1980, in a move not recognised by the vast majority of the international community, and considers the entire city its capital.\nPalestinians claim East Jerusalem as the future capital of a hoped-for independent state."

      "text": "Boris Johnson is promising a skills \"revolution\" for England, with loans for adults wanting to retrain and more powers to deal with failing colleges.\nThe measures are being unveiled in the Queen's Speech, which sets out the government's programme for the next year.\nIt includes 30 bills with pledges to overhaul the asylum system and reform planning laws in England.\nMPs are set to debate the proposed new laws this afternoon.\nThe Queen's Speech is part of the State Opening of Parliament, normally the grandest of Westminster occasions.\nBut it was pared back this year because of Covid, with fewer MPs and peers than normal gathering in the House of Lords to hear it - and the Queen arriving by car rather than the usual carriage.\nIt is the monarch's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.\nLabour has called for detailed plans to fix the \"broken\" social care system. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the government would \"bring forward a long-term plan to strengthen and reform social care\". \nThe government says its main focus is on helping the country recover from the pandemic, after the economy shrank by 9.9% last year., and spreading opportunity more evenly across the UK.\nA range of bills will aim to help industrial and post-industrial areas in particular, where the Conservatives have been picking up support recently.\nThe speech, written by ministers but delivered by the monarch, will promise to bring in a \"lifetime skills guarantee\".\nPart of this will be allowing all adults to get a \"flexible loan\" for higher-level education and training at university or college, \"useable at any point in their lives\".\nThis will be used to provide the equivalent of up to four years' study and can be used for full-time or part-time courses.\nBusinesses and trainers will be encouraged to target \"local needs in sectors including construction, digital, clean energy and manufacturing\".\nLabour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the government had \"lots of talk but little action\" about levelling up and creating jobs.\nShe said: \"It's great to hear that they want people to be able to retrain, but where are the jobs that people need...the good-quality jobs that allow people to earn decent money to look after their families, and to be able to spend in their local communities and on their high streets?\"\nAhead of the speech, the prime minister said: \"These new laws are the rocket fuel that we need to level up this country and ensure equal opportunities for all. We know that having the right skills and training is the route to better, well-paid jobs.\n\"I'm revolutionising the system so we can move past the outdated notion that there is only one route up the career ladder, and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to retrain or upskill at any point in their lives.\"\nThe government will introduce the Skills and Post-16 Education Bill - detailing the plans - next week.\nThe Queen's Speech will include 30 pieces of legislation, although several of them are carried over from the previous session.\nLabour and local government leaders have demanded detailed plans for the reform of social care. \nFormer health secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a \"live debate\" going on inside No 10 and the Treasury and tensions over the costs of changing the system, including introducing a cap on people's care costs. \nBut the Conservative chair of the Commons Health and Social Care Committee added that \"this is not about the immediate problem in public finances caused by pandemic because the costs will build up later\" and said the government needed to come up with \"a comprehensive solution\". \nMr Hancock said strengthening the social care system was \"close to the prime minister's heart\" but the pandemic had meant the government \"weren't able to put as much focus on [plans] as we would have done\". \nOn his first day as prime minister Boris Johnson made a promise to \"fix social care\" and shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has told the Daily Mirror that the Queen's Speech would be a test as to whether he \"delivers on his word\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"We must also see detail on long-promised plans to fix the broken social care system, reduce the shocking levels of violent crime and narrow the gap between different parts of the country.\n\"For 11 years we have had lots of rhetoric and the endless promise of jam tomorrow. That must now be turned to action.\"\nThis year's speech will also include changes to the policing of protests, including setting time and noise limits. A previous discussion of this by MPs earlier this year led to angry demonstrations.\nCritics say the measures impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest - but ministers say the proposals will respect human rights and will only affect very disruptive gatherings.\nThe speech is expected to include a bill restricting the future prosecution of British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.\nAnd there is likely to be a Sovereign Borders Bill, aimed at dissuading asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel.\nA ban on so-called conversion therapy - attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity - is proposed too. This will be preceded by a public consultation, the BBC understands.\nThe speech will include a commitment to introducing voter ID for future general elections, which has raised concerns among many MPs and civil rights groups.\nLegally binding environmental targets are also expected to feature, as is a planning bill to ease controls in England and increase housebuilding.\nMany Conservative MPs are concerned this legislation will leave people in some areas with less say over new developments.\nNational Trust director general Hilary McGrady has warned the prime minister over plans to drive development of homes, saying that \"the stakes are high and reforms need to be carefully considered\".\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph she said: \"The planning system is the most important tool that we have for shaping our physical environment. \n\"It is a mistake to characterise it as simply a blocker to new homes, growth and development in general.\""

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "text": "The family of a woman who took a fatal overdose after her benefit payments were cut say they have begun a legal claim against the government.\nPhilippa Day, 27, was found collapsed at her Nottingham home beside a letter rejecting her request for an at-home benefits assessment in August 2019.\nIt comes amid calls for a wider inquiry into the Department for Work & Pensions' handling of cases.\nThe DWP said: \"When, sadly, there is a tragic case we take it very seriously.\"\nCases where people claiming benefits died or came to serious harm have led to more than 150 government reviews since 2012, a BBC investigation found.\nInternal reviews are held by the DWP when it is alleged its actions had a negative impact, or when it is named at an inquest. \nCalling for an inquiry, Labour MP Debbie Abrahams said: \"It needs to be taken out of the hands of the DWP.\"\nMs Abrahams, who previously read out in the Commons the names of 29 people who have died, said: \"There needs to be an independent inquiry investigating why these deaths are happening and the scale of the deaths needs to be properly understood.\"\nThe DWP said it had established a new Serious Case Panel in 2019 to consider themes identified from serious cases, which included independent members.\nMs Day's family are one of three hoping to take the DWP to court in separate cases within weeks.\nMs Day, 27, who had been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder, had previously said her benefit claim left her feeling \"inhuman\", her sister told the BBC.\nAn inquest concluded in January that authorities made 28 errors in managing her case.\nThe assistant coroner issued a so-called Prevention of Future Death (PFD) report to the DWP and private contractor Capita, requiring them to explain what action they might take to improve. That was the fourth PFD sent to the DWP by coroners since 2013.\nIn response, the department said it would give all of its call handlers training in mental health and introduce a tracking system to identify vulnerable people across its systems.  Earlier internal reviews had established the inability to identify a vulnerable claimant as a problem.\nPhilippa's sister Imogen told the BBC her family had now begun a legal claim against the DWP and Capita including a claim under the Human Rights Act for violation of the right to life over their handling of the case. \nImogen said: \"We were incredibly close. In her eulogy at her funeral I described her as my soulmate. I spoke to her [Philippa] almost daily about it [her benefit claim].\n\"She talked about how it disempowered her and made her feel inhuman.  \n\"It was like watching a car crash in slow motion... we helped her emotionally, financially and practically and we could see the tragedy in front of us but couldn't do anything more to stop it.\" \nErrol Graham starved to death in 2018 while seriously mentally ill. His benefits were stopped when he failed to attend a work capability assessment and did not respond to calls, letters or home visits from the DWP.  \nWhen his body was found, Mr Graham weighed four-and-a-half stone (30kg) and his family said he had used pliers to pull out his teeth.\nHis family submitted an application for permission to go to the Court of Appeal in April, after losing a judicial review against the DWP's safeguarding policy. \nLeigh Day, the family's solicitors, had argued the government guidance failed to impose a duty of care on decision-makers to investigate when mentally-ill claimants did not engage with the system. \nAlison Turner, fianc\u00e9e of Mr Graham's son, said: \"I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. It's got to stop. They are not just damaging one person, there's a ripple effect on families.\"\nJodey Whiting, 42, took her own life after her benefits were stopped. \nHer family are due to attend the High Court on 22 June to argue she should have a second inquest to consider the DWP's role in her 2017 death. \nMs Whiting's mother, Joy Dove, of Norton, Stockton-on-Tees, won permission to request the new inquest.  New evidence was submitted including an independent inquiry's conclusions that mistakes were made by the DWP.\nThe family received a letter endorsing the decision Ms Whiting's benefits should be stopped and saying she was fit to work while she was in a mortuary ahead of her burial, her mother said.\nFollowing her death, one of Jodey Whiting's twins Cory Bell died at the age of 19 from a drug overdose. \n\"We've had that second death in the family and I blame the DWP too,\" Ms Dove said, describing him as a \"lost soul\".\nThe DWP said its condolences were with the families.\nIt's been 11 years since the government was first made aware there was a problem with the tests it used to assess benefit claims after a coroner wrote to the DWP following the suicide of a man.  \nDuring all that time, the government has simply marked its own homework, doing internal reviews.  \nIn a clear sign that these assessments are of limited use, in Scotland from next year, claimants for the main disability benefit will only have to undergo a test if any doubts remain about their claim following a review of their medical records.  \nFor the vast majority of people, the expectation is that they won't have to undergo a test - removing from the process what has long been a source of extreme stress for many people.  \n'Tip of the iceberg'\nIn 2012, internal reviews by the DWP took the form of so-called \"peer reviews\" and the DWP carried out 49 of them into deaths and 11 into further serious incidents between February 2012 and November 2014, according to the Disability News Service. \nSince 2015, the DWP has held so-called \"internal process reviews\" instead. In July 2019 Justin Tomlinson MP, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work said there had been 84 held since 2015 and a further six would be \"conducted shortly\".\nSeparately, the BBC has collated press reports naming 82 individuals to have died after some alleged DWP activity such as termination of benefits. Mental health vulnerabilities were a contributing factor in 35 of those people's deaths.\nThe reviews are not routinely published and bereaved families are not routinely informed when they begin.\nMs Abrahams, the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said she thought the known cases were \"the tip of the iceberg\".\nShe said: \"That there has been such a lack of openness and transparency to enable us to properly examine reports on all deaths is a disgrace.\"\nKen Butler, welfare rights adviser at the charity Disability Rights UK, said people had their benefits cut and suffered \"fear and anxiety\" due to \"poor and inaccurate medical assessments\" carried out on behalf of the DWP by the private contractors Capita, the Independent Assessment Services (formerly called Atos) and Maximus.\nThe DWP maintains its disability assessors are \"all trained and qualified health professionals... with significant experience\" and their work is \"subject to stringent ongoing quality monitoring\".\n'Devastating consequences'\nSecretary of State for Work and Pensions Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey told the Work and Pensions Committee in February the DWP \"did not have a duty of care or statutory safeguarding duty\".\nTessa Gregory, partner at Leigh Day solicitors, said there was a \"dissonance\" between the DWP's legal stance and its role in providing the sole income for vulnerable people.\n\"There seems to be a real issue with the DWP failing to make reasonable adjustments for claimants who due to their mental health issues struggle with responding to official letters or participating in assessments,\" she said.\n\"When DWP decision making goes wrong it can, as we have seen in far too many cases, have devastating and sometimes fatal consequences... the case for reform is clear.\"\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has meanwhile backtracked on assurances it previously gave to Ms Abrahams' MP it would conduct an inquiry into the WCA process and Personal Independence Payment (PIP) benefit for disabled claimants. \nAs yet it has also ruled out reviewing deaths allegedly linked to some DWP activity such as termination of benefits or following DWP sanctions, which Ms Abrahams said was \"very disappointing\".\nIn a statement, the commission said the \"landscape had changed considerably in the past year\".\n\"We and others have undertaken relevant work in this area and it is too early to say whether an inquiry would be the best approach on this issue,\" it added.\nThe DWP said: \"We support millions of people a year and our priority is they get the benefits to which they are entitled promptly and receive a supportive and compassionate service.\n\"In the vast majority of cases, this happens, but when, sadly, there is a tragic case we take it very seriously.\n\"In those circumstances, it's absolutely right we carry out an internal review to check if the correct processes were followed and identify any lessons learned to inform future policy and service.\"  \nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nFor more information on methodology, click here.

      "title": "Coronavirus: Expert urges caution over hugs as lockdown eases",
      "tags": "Michael Gove,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "People should take precautions when hugging others, says an expert, amid expectations of a further easing of England's Covid restrictions this week.\nProf Cath Noakes said hugs should be selective, short, and avoid face-to-face contact.\nCabinet Office minister Michael Gove said No 10 wants to see \"friendly contact\" between people restored.\nHe said the PM will on Monday confirm an easing of England's rules from 17 May.\nUnder the next stage of the government's roadmap for lifting England's lockdown, people can meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people, or two households, can meet indoors.\nPeople will also be allowed to stay overnight with those not in their household or bubble. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues will be permitted to reopen indoors.\nSome foreign holidays are set to be allowed. On Friday, the government announced that 12 countries would be added to England's travel green list, meaning anyone returning will not need to quarantine from 17 May.\nOn Sunday, the UK recorded another two deaths within 28 days of a positive test and a further 1,770 cases.\nProf Noakes, a member of the Sage committee that advises the government, said the risks of grandparents who are fully vaccinated hugging their grandchildren are likely to be low in most cases.\nSpeaking in a personal capacity,  she said it would worry her \"if we were advocating we could hug all of our friends every time we meet them again\" as it would \"perpetuate an awful lot of additional close contact that could spread the virus\".\n\"The reality is that when you hug someone you are very close to them and we know the virus is in people's breath and you are very close to that breath at that moment.\"\nShe advised that if people are going to hug others, it should be restricted \"to very small numbers of close family who perhaps you really value a hug from. \n\"I think don't hug too frequently, keep it short, try and avoid being face to face, so perhaps turn your face away slightly, and even wearing a mask could help,\" she said.\nProf Noakes warned that, even after vaccination, someone could get infected and could transmit it to others while unaffected themselves,\n\"So that's why we still need to be a bit cautious for a while yet. We've come a long way with this. The virus, although it's now very low prevalence, hasn't gone away.\"\nThe scientists and engineers advising the government realise that their caution about hugging might not be popular.\nThey know how many people see hugs as an essential form of bonding with their nearest and dearest.\nBut they've also studied how the virus spreads - how an infected person releases it in their breath.\nThat means that if someone gets very close, there's an increased chance of them inhaling the infectious particles floating in the air.\nThe tips for reducing those risks won't be popular - they go right against the grain of human instinct.\nBasically, hug as few people as possible and don't linger over it. And maybe wear a mask if someone is vulnerable.\nThat's why the prime minister talks of us using common sense about this. \nBut in the excitement of reunions, after so long apart, that might not be easy.\nCurrent social distancing rules advise people to stay 2m (6ft) away from those they don't live with, or are in a social bubble with.\nIn England, if it's not possible to stay 2m apart, the \"one-metre plus\" guidance means people should be at least 1m (3ft) apart with extra precautions in place (such as face coverings).\nEarlier, Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that \"all being well\" Prime Minister Boris Johnson would confirm on Monday that there will be a relaxation of restrictions starting 17 May.\nHe also hinted that closer contact between family and friends could soon be allowed.\n\"Without prejudice to a broader review of social distancing, it is also the case that friendly contact, intimate contact, between friends and family is something that we want to see restored,\" he said.\nMeanwhile Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine institute, told Andrew Marr that he believed it is the right time to ease England's restrictions. \nAsked whether it would be safe for family and friends to hug on 17 May, he said the country has seen the \"extraordinary success\" of both the Covid vaccine rollout and the \"prolonged\" lockdown.\n\"I think it is time to start, based on the very careful modelling that's been done, relaxing some of those restrictions,\" he said.\n\"That means we're in a very fortunate position here in the UK.\""

By late February, the alert was lowered to four.\nThe alert system, which follows recommendations by the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC), is independent from government decisions on easing or tightening restrictions.\nIn stage three of the government's road map for lifting England's lockdown, starting on 17 May, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors.\nPeople will also be allowed to stay overnight with those not in their household or bubble. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues, such as cinemas and soft play areas, will be permitted to reopen indoors.\nAnd up to 30 people are to be allowed to attend weddings, receptions and wakes, as well as funerals.\nForeign holidays will also return. On Friday, the government announced that 12 destinations would be placed on England's travel green list, meaning anyone returning from those areas will not need to quarantine from 17 May.\nEach stage on the roadmap out of lockdown has been separated by a gap of several weeks to allow scientists to assess the impact of previous changes, which in stage two included the reopening of non-essential shops and outdoor service in pubs and restaurants.\nThe government is satisfied that its four tests have been met:\nThe devolved nations are working to their own timeframe for easing restrictions.\nIn Wales, indoor hospitality such as pubs, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and museums are expected to reopen from 17 May. All tourist accommodation is due to reopen and wedding receptions can have up to 30 people indoors and 50 outdoors.\nIn Scotland from 17 May, indoor hospitality venues are expected to resume with alcohol being served until 22:30. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls should reopen and indoor group exercise restart.\nMore restrictions may be lifted in Northern Ireland on 24 May, including the reopening of indoor hospitality, B&Bs and hotels. Indoor group exercise could resume and wedding receptions and funeral wakes restart. "

      "text": "A juvenile minke whale that became stranded in the River Thames has been put down.\nHundreds of people gathered along riverbanks in south-west London after the whale was first spotted on Sunday.\nIt was first freed from Richmond Lock but became stranded a second time in Teddington.\nRescuers earlier said the mammal's condition had deteriorated \"rapidly\" and a vet team had been working to \"end its suffering\".\nA vet from the Zoological Society of London administered the injection shortly after 18:00. \nThe whale is now being moved and a post-mortem examination is due to be carried out.\nThe minke, which measured between 3m (10ft) and 4m (13ft), was first spotted near Barnes Bridge and became stranded on Richmond Lock's boat rollers at about 19:00 BST on Sunday.\nRNLI teams managed to remove it but it escaped as it was being towed and was seen swimming between Richmond and Teddington earlier on Monday before becoming stuck.\nBritish Divers Marine Life Rescue previously said the whale had been having difficulty swimming as its \"strength reserves seem to be compromised\".\nThey said a veterinary team had been \"on stand by to euthanise the animal to end its suffering\".\nJulia Cable, national co-ordinator of the BDMLR, said the mammal had not been \"acting the way it did last night\" and had \"basically lost any energy that it had left in it\".\nShe added: \"It's also got another stranding injury which along with ones from yesterday all adds up really.\"\nDan Jarvis, also of BDMLR, said: \"It's for a very good reason they've come ashore. Sometimes it is by accident, they do get stranded, but usually sadly it is the case that they're already seriously ill or badly injured.\n\"And there's not a great deal we can do in that situation.\"\nLiz Sandeman, co-founder of Marine Connection, said the whale's welfare had to be considered as it was not just a case of getting it back to sea if it was a young animal.\n\"It wouldn't know how to feed. It learns everything from its mother - how to navigate, how to hunt,\" she said.\nMinke whales are the smallest of the great whales, growing to about 33ft (10m), and are usually found throughout the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\nTheir range extends from the ice edge in the Arctic during the summer to near the equator during winter.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "Council leaders from across the political divide in England are urging ministers to make good their promise to \"fix social care\" by setting out plans in Tuesday's Queen's Speech. \nThe Local Government Association has sent a cross-party letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, saying failure to act now would be \"a bitter blow\". \nThe government says improving social care \"remains a priority\". \nThe promise was made by Boris Johnson on his first day as prime minister.\nMinisters have previously said plans will be brought forward this year and, when quizzed, have maintained that cross-party agreement on social care reform will be vital - the LGA's letter shows that at work. \nIt comes amid increasing concern that long-promised reform will only get the briefest of mentions in the Queen's Speech, where the government sets out its legislative programme for the coming year. \nIn the letter, council leaders from across the political spectrum call on the government to put the reform and funding of the adult care system at the centre of its thinking on how we emerge from the pandemic. \nLocal authorities fund many care services and they want investment which moves the system from being based around care homes and hospitals, to one which focuses on prevention and community support. \nThe letter says reform needs to pool the risk of having high care costs after developing a condition such as dementia, with funding provided through taxation or a social-care premium. \nIt argues that this is an investment in people, rather than \"a cost that is too difficult or too high\".\nIt urges the government to: \n\"All of us in local government, across the political divide, want to see the Queen's Speech finally set out the plans we have been waiting for,\" said LGA Chairman James Jamieson. \n\"This is about an investment in people, in all of us. \n\"A failure to act will be a bitter blow to everyone connected to social care.\"\nThe pandemic has increased pressure on an already fragile care system, which provides support for older and disabled people in care homes and in their own homes. \nResidential and nursing homes saw a particularly high number of deaths in the first wave of Covid-19. \nThe pandemic also highlighted existing problems, such as the low pay and long hours of care staff in a sector that struggles to recruit enough workers. \nA government spokesperson said: \"Improving the adult social care system remains a priority for this government and we are committed to ensuring every person receives care that provides the dignity they deserve. \n\"Throughout the pandemic we have provided almost \u00a31.8bn in specific funding for adult social care including infection prevention and control measures. \n\"We've also provided free PPE and additional testing and prioritised health and care workers for the vaccine.\"\nThe LGA letter coincides with polling for a care charity which suggests there is public support for greater focus on social care by government.\nResearchers for MHA, which runs care homes and community services, questioned just over 2,000 UK adults online and, of these, found: \nMHA chief executive Sam Monaghan said the devastating effect of Covid-19 on care homes had made people question \"what's important and the kind of society we want to be\". \n\"What we now need is decisive action from government...\n\"We have a growing population of older people who deserve respect and certainty for the future.\"\nFiona Carragher, director of research at Alzheimer's Society, called on the government \"to completely overhaul our social care system\".\nShe said she wanted to see \"free, personalised care... on an equal footing with the NHS\", together with plans to develop a workforce with the skills \"to deliver the best care\" for people with dementia.

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,UK government,Boris Johnson,Scottish independence,Scottish Parliament,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "The only way for there to be a successful referendum on Scottish independence is if both sides agree. \nThat's how they did it in 2014 with the Edinburgh agreement and the alternatives are messy and risky for both sides. \nIf the current stand-off between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson cannot be resolved, the first minister intends - at some point - to pass a referendum bill at Holyrood. \nShe dares the UK government to challenge the legislation in court which it may feel obliged to do because it considers such a vote to be beyond devolved powers. \nThe UK constitution - including the union between Scotland and England - is a matter reserved to Westminster by law. \nHowever, it could be argued that reservation does not explicitly prevent Holyrood from consulting the public on independence. \nThen again, a \"yes\" vote in any referendum would create an expectation that major constitutional change would follow, as it did in the advisory vote on Brexit. \nThese are the arguments the UK Supreme Court would have to work through. \nAt the weekend, both the UK cabinet minister Michael Gove and the first minister downplayed the prospect of a legal battle but that is what would inevitably happen unless the two sides make a deal. \nUK government sources have made clear that just because they are not seeking to take legal action does not mean they would not go to court if a specific referendum proposal emerged. \nEven if the UK government did not challenge, somebody surely would. The whisky industry tied up minimum alcohol pricing legislation in court for five years. \nIf the court ruled in Nicola Sturgeon's favour, that might enable a referendum but it could still face a unionist boycott which would de-legitimise the outcome. \nIf the court ruled in Boris Johnson's favour, that would thwart a referendum because Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would not hold an illegal vote. \nHowever, Nicola Sturgeon could argue in those circumstances that the union was being held together by force of law rather than consent which would be a rotten look for the UK. \nThat might lead to a rise in support for independence. \nThe UK government could pass legislation to explicitly prevent Holyrood from having a referendum or to organise its own vote - options that carry similar risks. \nThe UK strategy for the moment seems to be to play for time by arguing that there can be another referendum at some unspecified point in the future but not now. \nThey make the case that it would be irresponsible to have a referendum while we are still in a pandemic. \nOn that point, Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon agree and appear to be in tune with Scottish public opinion. \nThere are other reasons the first minister is not in a rush. She wants to win a referendum and so would prefer to see support for independence running higher. \nPolls suggested there was a sustained majority for a \"yes\" vote throughout much of last year but that has dipped in recent months. The country appears split down the middle. \nIt also became clear during the election that the Scottish government needs time to work out detailed plans for what independence would mean for trade and borders in the aftermath of Brexit. \nIn short, they are not ready to fight a referendum however desperate some in the independence movement are for it to happen. \nNicola Sturgeon has told Boris Johnson she considers indyref2 a matter of \"when - not if\". Officially she still favours having the vote by the end of 2023. \nThere is unlikely to be any immediate effort by the Scottish government to begin preparations. The SNP is likely to start working on refreshing the independence case before civil servants are given instructions. \nAs Holyrood returns to business, expect to see the SNP and Greens demonstrate the majority they now have for indyref2 in a symbolic way at an early stage. \nWith 64 SNP votes and eight from the Greens, support for independence is as high as it has ever been in the 129-seat parliament, matching the \"yes\" majority after the 2011 election. \nThe two parties made explicit commitments to hold a referendum in their election manifestos. The two parties have more votes and seats than before. \nThat is their mandate for indyref2. By contrast, pro-UK parties got 51% of the constituency vote in this election which they take as a mandate to oppose it. \nAny referendum legislation would need to be certified as within Holyrood's powers by Scotland's top law officer, the lord advocate, and parliament's presiding officer who is elected on Thursday. \nThe choice of a new minister for the constitution and external affairs to replace Mike Russell will also be significant when the first minister gets round to a reshuffle. \nHer immediate priority is a review of Covid rules to be announced on Tuesday. \nThe election result means there will be a big wrangle over indyref2 in the next few years. It could be resolved through negotiation and agreement or a showdown in the courts. \nThis constitutional clash is not immediate. The dispute is deferred. Pandemic first will be the mantra on all sides in the period ahead. "

      "tags": "Rail travel,Great Western Railway,First Hull Trains",
      "text": "Travel disruption caused by the discovery of cracks in some high-speed trains is expected to continue this week.\nRobert Nisbet, of the Rail Delivery Group, said initial inspections of 183 trains taken out of service on Saturday should conclude by the end of Sunday.\nBut he warned that disruption was expected to \"carry on for a few days\".\nGWR advised against travel on Monday, while LNER urged people with bookings to check before they travelled.\nHitachi Class 800 trains used by the firms were taken out of service for safety inspections. \nAndrew Barr, CEO of Hitachi Rail, apologised to passengers and said the trains were withdrawn because of cracks found on the metal that linked the train's body with the underside of the train, known as the bogie.\nOn Sunday evening, the UK government asked Hitachi to set out a comprehensive plan to identify the extent of the cracking and outline a longer term repair strategy.\nWhile this sort of problem doesn't affect the structural integrity of the train - so it's not a danger to passengers - I'm told the risk is more about the possibility of something falling off.\nGWR is the most affected network. As the first operator in the country to introduce the Hitachi 800 in 2017, its trains are older.\nIts fleet of 93 is also much bigger than other operators', meaning more trains to check and fix.\nSome are already back in service - and we're told inspections should be done by the end of Sunday.\nAnd Hitachi Rail's boss told me the company would periodically reinspect the trains while a permanent solution is found.\nDisruption on long distance routes will go on for at least the next few days. That's partly because some trains and crew won't be in the right place. \nAlso, some carriages won't be able to go straight back into use because they need repairing. We don't yet know precisely how many yet. It's possible some which aren't yet showing a crack might also need remedial work.\nMr Nisbet, whose organisation represents train operators and Network Rail, also apologised for the disruption.\nHe told BBC Breakfast that rail firms were running as many services as possible, including rail replacement services, putting on extra staff at affected stations, relaxing ticket acceptance rules and offering compensation for delays.\nHe said it was \"gratifying to see the speed\" at which initial inspections were taking place but said it was impossible to say how long the checks would take. \"We don't want to rush it,\" he said.\nMr Nisbet said the cracks - measuring millimetres - \"didn't pose any particular danger to passengers\" but had the potential to develop if left untreated.\nThe Department for Transport said independent safety regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) will be closely involved in overseeing Hitachi's plans for safety inspections for the Class 800 fleet.\nRail Minister Chris Heaton Harris said: \"I expect operators to explore all options for replacement services to help people complete their journeys.\" He thanked passengers for their patience in the meantime.\nInstagram photographer Anna Celac hoped to travel from Cardiff to London Paddington to see a friend she hadn't seen since last year.\nWhen she bought her ticket on Saturday night, she said the website she booked with didn't report any disruption.\nShe says she was disappointed when she had to cancel her trip, as the replacement bus service would have left her with too little time in the capital.\nOnly around 10% of Great Western Railway's long-distance services ran on Sunday, with a similar service expected on Monday, the operator said.\nGWR said customers for long-distance services should not travel on Monday and refunds would be issued.\nLocal services have been running, but they were expected to be very busy and rail replacement services were limited.\nThe company earlier said cracks were detected on \"more than one\" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet were being inspected as a precaution.\nIt comes after six of the trains were taken out of service by GWR last month after hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. \nLondon North Eastern Railway apologised to customers, saying it was experiencing \"significant disruption\" due to the checks.\nIt is running a limited service on the East Coast Main Line, between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London, and will be unable to run trains between Edinburgh and Inverness/Aberdeen until Saturday 15 May at the earliest.\nLNER added that some services would also be cancelled on Monday - and passengers should check before setting off to the station.\nHull Trains said checks on its trains had been completed and services would resume as normal.\nBut the operator added it expected services to be \"extremely busy\" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. Refunds were being offered for its Sunday morning services, according to its website.\nTransPennine Express said it was now running a normal service, but advised customers travelling between York and Newcastle to check for any knock-on impact before travelling.\nLNER passengers affected by cancellations can use their tickets on the following operators' services instead:\nRail replacement coaches are operating at York, Newcastle and Edinburgh, and also between Doncaster and Peterborough.\nLNER says affected customers' tickets will be valid up to and including Sunday 16 May, though new reservations will need to be made. \nGWR passengers can use their tickets on the following services:\nAre you a passenger who was due to travel on one of the affected trains?

Nobody else. I lead the Labour Party and it is entirely on me.\"\nSir Keir said that his deputy, Ms Rayner, had \"a big, new role, taking the fight to the Tories\".\nShe later tweeted that she was \"looking forward to rolling my sleeves up and getting to work\" in order to \"reconnect with the voters that have lost faith in the Labour Party, especially in our traditional heartlands\".\nBut the reshuffle, announced late on Sunday following hours of wrangling behind closed doors, is already facing criticism from figures within the party. \nThe moves came after Labour lost control of eight councils overall in English local elections, and suffered an historic defeat to the Conservatives at a by-election in Hartlepool. \nThe party fared better in Wales, where it won half the seats in Welsh Parliament elections, as well as in several mayoral races in England. \nLabour also took the West of England and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoral posts off the Tories, and prevailed in the first race for the new West Yorkshire mayor. \nLabour MP and former actress Tracy Brabin - the first woman to become a metro mayor - has stepped down from her role in Westminster to take up the new post.\nBut this means the party will soon face another by-election in her seat of Batley and Spen, which has been held by Labour since 1997.\nLabour was also re-elected in Greater Manchester, where its successful mayoral candidate Andy Burnham urged the party to learn the lessons of its victories.\nHe added that the party was too focused on a \"civil war\" between figures from different factions, which would prove \"absolutely pointless and destructive.\"\nLabour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, Shabana Mahmood, has taken on Ms Rayner's other former role as campaign coordinator. \nShe told BBC Breakfast the party had to \"immerse ourselves in the communities that we currently represent - and that we want to represent once again - and to earn their trust\".\nBut Ms Rayner remains deputy leader of the party as it is an elected post voted for by members - and will be given additional duties to focus on the future of work and \"levelling up\".\nFormer shadow home secretary Diane Abbot hit out at the \"drawn-out\" reshuffle, which she said \"hasn't been fantastically successful\".\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said Ms Rayner's removal from her campaign role was a sign Sir Keir was trying to make her \"carry the can for the poor results\".\nAnd Labour's Liverpool Riverside MP Kim Johnson called the decision a \"despicable act of cowardice\" from the Labour leader.\nAn ally of Ms Rayner said she had come out \"significantly more powerful, both in terms of the party and policy\", while a Labour insider told the BBC: \"Who would want to be national campaign coordinator in name only with no power when you're just made the scapegoat for the failures of Keir's team?\"\nIn response to the change in role, Ms Rayner tweeted: \"I will work tirelessly to reform our party and deliver a policy agenda that will enable us to reconnect with the voters that we need to win, especially in our traditional heartlands, and show that the Labour Party speaks for the working class.\"\nShe also thanked \"friends from all across the Labour Party and our movement\" who had contacted her over the weekend, adding: \"United we stand, divided we fall.\"\nSir Keir Starmer's first reshuffle has been a very messy affair.\nIt began badly with a bust up with his deputy, Angela Rayner, who was being moved from one of her roles - in charge of campaigns.\nHer allies said she was being sacked. Sir Keir's team said she was being moved.\nThey can't both be telling the whole truth. But there was a late night howl of backlash to the notion she was being ousted, putting pressure on the leader to find a way to make her stay.\nRead more from Laura here.\nOther movements in the reshuffle include:\nLisa Nandy is expected to remain as shadow foreign secretary, while Jonathan Ashworth will stay in his role as shadow health secretary.\nA spokesman for Mr Brown - who was chief whip under five Labour leaders - said the MP thought it was \"a reasonable time for Nick to move on\", adding he and Sir Keir had \"parted on good terms, with mutual respect\".\nThe party confirmed there would be no further appointments announced."

      "text": "An actor is suing TikTok for using her voice in its text-to-speech function.\nIt converts writing into speech, which can then be played over videos uploaded to the app, often for comedic effect.\nBev Standing recorded about 10,000 sentences of audio for the state-backed Chinese Institute of Acoustics research body to use in translations, in 2018.\nThe legal action claims her voice can now be heard in viral videos featuring \u201cfoul and offensive language\u201d, causing her reputation \u201cirreparable harm\u201d.\nStanding, from Ontario, Canada, told BBC News no permission had been given for these recordings to be used in any other applications or resold.\n\u201cMy voice is my product - it's my business,\" she said.\n\"You can\u2019t just use it and not reimburse me for what I do.\n\u201cIf you want to use someone's voice, pay for it.\"\nStanding, who does not use TikTok, felt \"violated\", after several videos were sent to her by friends, family and colleagues.\n\u201cWhen I realised you could get me to say anything you want... that's when I kind of got upset,\u201d she said, describing the content as \u201ctotally against brand.\u201d\n\u201cI'm certainly hoping it doesn't affect my business in a negative way.\n \"Clients may stop hiring me because they recognise that voice.\"\nRobert Sciglimpaglia, the lawyer representing Ms Standing, told BBC News: \u201cThe technology exists where anyone's voice can be replicated through artificial intelligence.\n\u201cThis is not an issue just about celebrities or voice actors, who of course will be hugely impacted because their livelihood is literally being taken away from them. \n\u201cThis is also about ordinary people.\"\nNeither TikTok nor parent company Bytedance had responded to the legal filing, issued in New York last week, he added.\nStanding\u2019s voice is used on the North American version of the app. \nBut in other regions, local accents - a British male voice in the UK, for example - are used. \nA TikTok representative told The Telegraph, which first reported the story, it did not comment on continuing litigation. \nThe company told BBC News it had nothing further to add.\nThe Chinese Institute of Acoustics did not respond to a request for comment.\n\"Actors' performances, including vocal performances, are protected by copyright,\" Jowanna Conboye, intellectual property and technology partner at Spencer West, said.\n So a voice artist should have a claim under copyright if their performance is used without their permission\n\"A key question is where the voice artist's content was obtained from. \n\"In commercial situations, copyright is often assigned to another business.\n\"But even if that is the case, the voice artist or actor normally retains moral rights, which should ensure that they are recognised as the person performing.\""

      "text": "The SNP has won 64 seats in the Scottish Parliament election - one short of a majority but one more than it won in 2016. \nNicola Sturgeon hailed her party's fourth consecutive victory as a \"historic and extraordinary\" result.\nWe look at the picture across Scotland and the shape of the new Scottish Parliament.\nScotland's electoral map gives you a pretty good idea of who has won the election - it is swathed in SNP yellow. But look closely and you can see why they fell just short of an outright majority.\nThe seats they failed to win are islands in regions otherwise dominated by the SNP, meaning it was all but impossible for them to win seats back from the regional list, in the swings and roundabouts of the Holyrood system.\nTwo of the constituencies they did gain, in Ayr and East Lothian, were in a region where they already had list seats, two of which were subsequently lost.\nThe small strongholds that other parties have scattered across Scotland ultimately proved decisive.\nThe fact the SNP did not win a majority will make a real difference to the next five years at Holyrood. A minority government needs support from other parties to pass budgets and all its major reforms. \nIf it had been a majority, we could have put every other manifesto in the bin and taken the SNP's manifesto to be the definitive guide to the term ahead.\nThe Scottish Greens in particular - who were the SNP's partner of choice last term - will be looking forward to potentially having some of their policy priorities passed in return for crucial votes.\nIt also means the SNP will not have a majority on any Holyrood committee, meaning their legislation will not necessarily sail through the parliament with ease.\nThe Scottish Conservatives retained their position in second place in a vindication of the party's strategy to target the \"peach vote\" - the colour of the regional list ballot paper\nThere were initially some nerves that they might have neglected the \"lilac\" constituency vote, but they ultimately held their key seats with the help of transfers from other pro-union parties.\nTactical voting may have had a huge impact overall - every seat seems to have become a race between the SNP and the party that was judged most likely to beat them locally.\nLabour - the party which may have the most to do to come up with a convincing answer to the constitutional question - finds itself marooned in third place again.\nThe Lib Dems meanwhile have slumped to just four seats due to their failure to pick anything up from the regional lists.\nThey have a number of strongholds in different parts of Scotland, but these are so tightly focused that the party's constituency wins in those areas make it very hard for them to pick up list seats too.\nIn an election of continuity, there was one surprise result which was quite different from previous years - turnout.\nSome 63% of the electorate came out to vote, a full ten percentage points above the average for previous Holyrood polls.\nIt is hard to say exactly why this happened, but a number of factors will likely have been at play. \nThe rise in postal vote registrations could be one, as could the expansion of the franchise to new groups including refugees.\nAnd the pandemic may have ultimately boosted turnout, rather than held it down, as many had predicted.\nPeople might have had more time to engage with activists or go out to vote due to lockdown.\nIndeed lockdown itself may have encouraged some to vote, having been a very clear example of the powers that governments can exercise.\nHolyrood's diverse representation had somewhat stalled in recent years - but that has all changed now.\nThe class of 2021 includes a record number of 58 female MSPs. The SNP now has 34 women, Labour have 10, the Conservatives have eight, the Scottish Greens have five and the Lib Dems have one female MSP.\nIt has chiefly been driven by the SNP's policy of having all-women shortlists for many seats where male MSPs were retiring - meaning a lot of older male MSPs have effectively been replaced by younger women.\nAmong those are the first women of colour elected to Holyrood, the SNP's Kaukab Stewart and Pam Gosal of the Scottish Tories.\nLabour's Pam Duncan-Glancy became the first wheelchair user returned to Holyrood, in what may be the most diverse parliament to date."

      "text": "Average house prices have climbed about \u00a320,000 in the last year, the Halifax says, as the buying frenzy prompted by the stamp duty holiday continues.\nPrices are up 8.2% in the last 12 months, the highest annual growth rate for five years, it said. \nAltura mortgage broker Rob Gill said \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO) was driving the surge. \n\"There's a fear among buyers that they could miss out if they don't hurry up and buy before prices spiral,\" he said.\nThe Halifax said that prices rose sharply in April, up by 1.4% compared with March. The average price of a UK home hit \u00a3258,204, a record high.\nAt the Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the stamp duty holiday to June. The property purchase tax has been suspended on the first \u00a3500,000 of all sales in England and Northern Ireland since July to support the market.\n\"The stamp duty holiday continues to add impetus to an extremely active market, magnifying the current shortage of available homes as buyers aim to take advantage of the Government scheme,\" said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\nHe predicted that the influence of the stamp duty holiday will fade gradually over the coming months as it is tapered out but that low stock levels, low interest rates and continued demand is likely to continue to underpin prices in the market.\nKirsty Kirby is a first-time buyer in South Yorkshire who has been planning to move house since 2018. But the 37-year-old pharmaceutical worker says even getting a viewing for a property is a challenge.\n\"I ring for many properties,\" she says. \"I'm like a hawk on Rightmove, I must refresh it several times an hour, just to see what's on.\"\nKirsty says most homes she enquires about already have multiple viewing bookings within minutes of appearing online and estate agents warn her the house will be going to 'best and final' offers.\nBest and final is a system where buyers put in one offer for the seller to choose from, in order to avoid a bidding war between prospective home-owners.\nKirsty says, in her experience, anytime a property goes to best and final \"it goes way above the asking price because people get crazy\".\nRead more\n\"This market isn't standing still for a second,\" said analyst Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton. \"The feeding frenzy for property was already feeling pretty ferocious but then along comes another big leap in the annual rate of [house price] growth.\"\nShe said the current state of the market means timing is crucial for buyers and not wasting time is essential.\n\"In a blazing hot seller's market like this, most buyers don't even compare prices locally to make their offer, they work out what they can afford and they go for it.\"\nNicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country, said: \"Buyers need to be incredibly determined to succeed in a market like this.\"\nShe predicted that the market rally will continue with optimism being complemented by improving weather, the imminent loosening of Covid restrictions, low interest rates, a yearning for more space and the fact that many homeowners have saved thousands of pounds not being able to go anywhere. \n\"This won't be the last record high we'll see this year by a long stretch,\" she said."

      "tags": "Companies,Cyber-attacks,United States,Oil & Gas industry,Cyber-security",
      "text": "A cyber-criminal gang that took a major US fuel pipeline offline over the weekend has acknowledged the incident in a public statement.\n\"Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society,\" DarkSide wrote on its website.\nThe US issued emergency legislation on Sunday after Colonial Pipeline was hit by a ransomware cyber-attack.\nThe pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day - 45% of the East Coast's supply of diesel, petrol and jet fuel.\nThe operator took itself offline on Friday after the cyber-attack. Work to restore service is continuing.\nOn Monday, the FBI officially confirmed that DarkSide was responsible for compromising Colonial Pipeline's networks, saying that it was continuing to work with the firm and other government agencies on the investigation. \nDuring a speech about the economy at the White House on Monday, US President Joe Biden said that he was being \"personally briefed\" on the situation with the pipeline each day.\n\"The agencies across the government have acted quickly to mitigate any impact on our fuel supply,\" he said. \n\"We're prepared to take additional steps depending on how quickly the company is able to bring its pipeline back up to capacity.\"\nA number of cyber-security researchers, including firms contacted by the BBC, have speculated that the cyber-criminal gang could be Russian, as their software avoids encrypting any computer systems where the language is set as Russian.\nMr Biden said that the US government was concerned about this aspect of the cyber-attack. \n\"I'm gonna be meeting with President Putin and so far there is no evidence, based on our intelligence people, that Russia is involved,\" he said. \n\"Although, there's evidence that the actors' ransomware is in Russia - they have some responsibility to deal with this.\"\nDarkSide posted a statement on its website on Monday, describing itself as \"apolitical\". \n\"We do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for... our motives,\" the group said.\nThe group also indicated it had not been aware that Colonial was being targeted by one of its affiliates, saying: \"From today, we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.\"\nUS fuel prices at the pump rose six cents per gallon on the week to $2.967 per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, the American Automobile Association (AAA) said on Monday, while Wall Street shares in US energy firms were up 1.5%.\nThe AAA said prices were heading towards their highest level since 2014. \nOn Sunday, the US government relaxed rules on fuel being transported by road to minimise disruption to supply. This allowed drivers in 18 states to work extra or more flexible hours when transporting refined petroleum products.\nHowever, there are fears that this could change if the shutdown is prolonged. \nIndependent oil market analyst Gaurav Sharma told the BBC a lot of fuel was now stranded at refineries in Texas.\n\"Unless they sort it out by Tuesday, they're in big trouble,\" said Mr Sharma. \"The first areas to be hit would be Atlanta and Tennessee, then the domino effect goes up to New York.\"\nHe said oil futures traders were now \"scrambling\" to meet demand, at a time when US inventories are declining.\nDemand - especially for fuel for cars - is on the rise as consumers return to the roads and the economy recovers.\nThe temporary waiver issued by the Department of Transportation enables oil products to be shipped in tankers up to New York, but this would not be anywhere near enough to match the pipeline's capacity, Mr Sharma warned.\nSources said the ransomware attack was likely to have been caused by a cyber-criminal gang called DarkSide, who infiltrated Colonial's network and locked the data on some computers and servers, demanding a ransom on Friday.\nThe gang stole almost 100 gigabytes of data hostage, threatening to leak it onto the internet.\nThe FBI and other government agencies worked with private companies to respond - the cloud computing system the hackers used to collect the stolen data was taken offline on Saturday, Reuters reported.\nOn Sunday, Colonial said that although its four main pipelines remained offline, some smaller lines between terminals and delivery points were now operational.\n\"Quickly after learning of the attack, Colonial proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat. These actions temporarily halted all pipeline operations and affected some of our IT systems, which we are actively in the process of restoring,\" the firm said.\nIt added it would bring its full system back online \"only when we believe it is safe to do so, and in full compliance with the approval of all federal regulations\".\nThe incident highlights the risk ransomware can pose to critical national industrial infrastructure, not just businesses.\nIn addition to a notice on their computer screens, victims of a DarkSide attack receive an information pack informing them that their computers and servers are encrypted. \nThe gang lists all the types of data it has stolen, and sends victims the URL of a \"personal leak page\" where the data is already loaded, waiting to be automatically published, should the company or organisation not pay before the deadline is up. \nDarkSide also tells victims it will provide proof of the data it has obtained, and is prepared to delete all of it from the victim's network. \nAccording to Digital Shadows, a London-based cyber-security firm, DarkSide operates like a business.\nThe gang develops the software used to encrypt and steal data from companies.\nIt then provides ransomware to \"affiliates\" who pay DarkSide a percentage of their earnings from any successful attacks. \nWhen it released new software in March that could encrypt data faster than before, the gang issued a press release and invited journalists to interview it. \nIt even has a website on the dark web where it lists all the companies it has hacked and what was stolen, and an \"ethics\" page where it says which organisations it will not attack. \nDarkSide also works with \"access brokers\" - nefarious hackers who work to harvest the login details for as many working user accounts on various services as they can find.\nRather than break into these accounts and alert users or the service providers, these brokers sit on the usernames and passwords and sell them off to the highest bidders - cyber-criminal gangs who want to use them to carry out much larger crimes.\nDigital Shadows thinks the Colonial attack was helped by the coronavirus pandemic, with more engineers remotely accessing control systems for the pipeline from home.\nJames Chappell, co-founder of Digital Shadows, believes DarkSide could have bought account login details for remote desktop software such as TeamViewer and Microsoft Remote Desktop.\nHe says it is possible for anyone to look up the login portals for computers connected to the internet on search engines like Shodan, and then \"have-a-go\" hackers just keep trying usernames and passwords until they get some to work.\n\"We're seeing a lot of victims now, this is seriously a big problem,\" said Mr Chappell.\n\"The amount of small businesses that are falling victim to this... It's becoming a big problem for the economy globally.\"\nDigital Shadows' research shows the cyber-criminal gang is likely to be based in a Russian-speaking country, as it avoids attacking companies in post-Soviet states including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan."

      "text": "Labour is set to stay in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result, with exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament.\nThe Tories took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour, and Brecon and Radnorshire from the Liberal Democrats.\nLabour held firm in other Tory target seats and took Rhondda back from Plaid Cymru.\nLeader Mark Drakeford, who extended the majority in his seat, vowed to form a \"stable and progressive\" government.\nWith 52 of the 60 seats declared, Labour is on 30 with the Conservatives on 12, Plaid Cymru nine and the Liberal Democrats one.\nIt is unlikely Labour will gain further seats when votes for the regional lists in South Wales Central and South Wales East are counted on Saturday, after the party won the lion's share of constituency seats there.\nCurrent first minister Mr Drakeford, who raised his majority in his Cardiff West seat by 12.7 points and more than 6,000 votes, told BBC Wales he would \"do whatever I can\" to ensure Wales has a \"stable and progressive\" government.\nHe added he would prefer to be in a position \"where you have a government that is able to command a majority for the action that it needs to take on the floor of the Senedd\".\nHe added: \"Without trying to rush a decision at this time on a Friday we'll take a couple of days to make sure that we make the best decision that we can for Wales.\"\nLabour also regained Rhondda from Plaid Cymru, toppling its former leader Leanne Wood.\nHer win there in 2016 was one of the major upsets of the last Senedd election but Labour's Buffy Williams overturned it with a 19% swing and a majority of more than 5,000.\nBen Lake, the Plaid Cymru MP for Ceredigion, said losing the Rhondda seat was a \"terrible blow for the party\".\nAsked if the party could still play a role in a coalition with Labour if required, he said it was a \"dead duck\".\n\"The people of Wales have sent a very clear message at the election, and I can't see it being feasible or indeed desirable on the part of either party,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\nPlaid Cymru has won five constituency seats, holding on to Arfon, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Ynys Mon, Ceredigion, and Carmarthen East and Dinefwr.\nWith three of the five regional list results declared so far, Plaid has won four list seats, the Conservatives four, Labour three and the Liberal Democrats one.\nThe Conservatives held on to Montgomeryshire, Aberconwy, Clwyd West, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and Preseli Pembrokeshire.\nThe party also kept Monmouth where ex-Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox is its new incumbent following the deselection of Nick Ramsay.\nBut the Tories failed to capture the Vale of Glamorgan, another Labour-held target seat which is Conservative at Westminster.  \nThe Labour seats of Alyn and Deeside, Gower, Swansea East, Swansea West, Neath, Aberavon, Ogmore, Bridgend, Cynon Valley, Pontypridd, Cardiff Central, Cardiff North, Cardiff South and Penarth, Cardiff West, Caerphilly, Islwyn, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Newport West and Torfaen have also remained red.\nLabour also held on to the Plaid Cymru target seat of Llanelli, with Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters being re-elected.\nFollowing his victory, Mr Waters said Mark Drakeford was \"definitely an asset\", due to his leadership during the pandemic.\n\"He may not be flashy, he may be a bit nerdy, a bit boring, he's a university professor, but thank God for him,\" he said.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething also paid tribute to his party leader, saying: \"The recognition of the way Mark has run the Welsh government in this extraordinary time was undoubtedly a factor in the way that people have voted.\"\nDespite the challenges of the pandemic, more than 1.1 million people voted, making it the highest-ever turnout for a Senedd election at 46.6%.\nThis beat the previous record of 46.3% at the first Senedd election in 1999, but is still significantly lower than turnout for general elections.\nLaura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said Labour had \"performed better than most people expected\".\n\"After 22 years in power, with a Conservative Party that was really strongly tipped to make significant breakthroughs, and of course Plaid Cymru biting its ankles as well, that's some achievement.\"\nPolitical commentator Prof Roger Awan-Scully said: \"I think it's been an astonishingly resilient performance by the Welsh Labour Party, amidst disasters for Labour elsewhere in the UK.\n\"The Conservatives are also performing strongly, but not quite bringing it home in terms of the number of constituency victories that they might have expected.\n\"For Plaid Cymru I think this has to be said to be a deeply disappointing election.\"\nThe Vale of Clwyd was the only Conservative gain in Labour's \"red wall\" of seats in north Wales where the Tories had enjoyed success in the 2019 General Election.\nWinning candidate Gareth Davies, an NHS physiotherapist, said: \"It's a magnificent achievement. \n\"In 1999 I was a small boy, and now I'm in my 30s and I never thought back then I'd ever be in this position. So I feel really humbled.\"\nAndrew RT Davies, leader of the Tories in the Senedd, said the result in the Vale of Clwyd was \"fantastic\".\nNorth Wales has been a fiercely contested battleground, with re-elected Aberconwy Tory MS Janet Finch-Saunders saying she had been \"horrified\" by personal attacks which had hurt her family during the campaign.\nLabour's win in Alyn and Deeside represents the last of the red wall seats that the Conservatives had hoped to take in north east Wales.\nIt's the last brick in the wall.\nBut they have only managed in this election to take Vale of Clwyd in that region - by a small amount.\nSo it counts as a disappointing set of results for the Conservatives.\nLabour, which has been in charge of the Welsh government for 22 years, is now set to remain in power for a sixth term with exactly half the seats in the Senedd chamber.\nOf the 60 members of the Senedd (MSs) being elected, 40 will serve constituencies and 20 will be elected to represent larger regional areas of North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East.\nA party needs to win 31 seats to claim a majority but it has never happened, with Labour last time having 29 seats.\nIt previously won 30 seats in 2003 and 2011.\nFor Plaid Cymru, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts painted a gloomy picture for their hopes of making inroads into Labour's grip on the south Wales valleys. \nShe said the pandemic had meant \"ministers in the governments, both in Westminster and Cardiff, have had an immense platform over the last year\".\nIt had been an \"extraordinarily different\" election, Ms Saville Roberts said, \"to anything that anybody has been used to, and it's been difficult for a party like Plaid to get the same sort of platform\". \n\"At the same time there's a real sense that our policy, our offer of policies, has offered something that was progressive and new and is, I hope, really the seeds for something in the future,\" she added.\nAdam Price, who held Carmarthen East and Dinefwr with a reduced majority, said he would not stand down as Plaid Cymru leader.\nDespite no gains, Mr Price said the party had increased its share of the vote and its stance on independence had been a \"net positive\".\n\"I'm not walking away from anything, because this is the moment when Wales needs leadership,\" he said.\n\"This is a historic challenge, because of the way that the politics is moving in this island, but it's also a historic opportunity for us.\n\"We can move our nation forward and I'm looking forward to playing my part, it's not something that anyone can do on their own.\n\"I have a role to play, we all have a role to play and that's what's exciting about politics at the moment. Wales is on the move Wales is on the march. I'm going to be part of that.\"\nMeanwhile, the Welsh Liberal Democrats lost their constituency seat in Brecon and Radnorshire but won a list seat in Mid and West Wales with party leader Jane Dodds heading for the Senedd.\nLiberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Randerson said she did not think Welsh Labour would need the support of Ms Dodds to run a government as had happened with her predecessor, former Education Minister Kirsty Williams who stood down prior to the elections.\n\"I think Labour will have the numbers to just about manage on their own,\" said Baroness Randerson.\nIan Price, director of CBI Wales, congratulated Labour. \n\"This is a critical time for the Welsh economy and the new parliament must have a laser-like focus on rebuilding from the devastating impact of the pandemic,\" he said.\n\"That means all parties pulling together and working with business to protect jobs, rebuild livelihoods and create a fair and sustainable recovery that addresses the longstanding structural challenges our economy faces.\"\nThe Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party was also hoping to make a breakthrough in the regional lists.\nVoting also took place for four police and crime commissioners, with those votes to be counted on Sunday.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage"

      "text": "A pub and restaurant group is calling for all significant restrictions on trading to be lifted before July.\nMark Drakeford's cabinet discussed which Covid restrictions to lift next when it met for the first time since Labour's Welsh election win.\nAllowing pubs and restaurants to serve customers indoors from 17 May is the next Covid rule set to be relaxed.\nBut a group representing the hospitality sector says social distancing rules should be scrapped.\nThe outcome of Monday's cabinet meeting will not be known until later in the week, with the latest plans for lockdown restrictions due to be announced in the Welsh government's next three-week review on Friday.\nMr Drakeford is to lead a Labour-only Welsh government after the party won half of the Welsh Parliament's 60 seats.\nHe is to be formally sworn in as Wales' first minister when the Senedd returns on Wednesday.\nWales' Covid infection rate of 8.6 cases for every 100,000 people is the lowest since August.\nPatients in Welsh hospitals with coronavirus are at record lows and more than a quarter of the Welsh population have now had both doses of a Covid vaccine.\nUnder current plans and providing rates remain low, on 17 May indoor attractions, cinemas and theatres will open alongside pubs and restaurants serving customers inside.\nIn an open letter to ministers, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective (WIRC) renewed its call for Covid restrictions to be eased on the hospitality sector and for financial support at least matching that available in England and Scotland.\nThe group, representing more than 400 cafes, pubs, restaurants and hotels, urged the Welsh government to allow any six people to sit together indoors and to scrap the 2m social distancing rule.\nThe letter said it was \"not a case of following England for its own sake, but a recognition that the science is the same there as it is here\".\n\"The closer we align our rules across the UK, the easier it is to communicate those rules to an increasingly confused public,\" it added.\nThe letter also said there should be \"an immediate announcement to signal a restart grant at least as generous as those in Scotland and England\".\n\"That support needs to acknowledge that in Wales we have been under the heaviest trading restrictions of any of the UK nations and that the gap in funding that has persisted since March 31 needs to be filled,\" the letter added.\nMinisters were expected on Monday to decide what to ease next from Wales' lockdown rules.\nLocal Government Minister Julie James said discussing restrictions around foreign holidays was also \"very much part of the package of discussion for Monday\".\nThe UK government has announced plans in England to allow tourists to visit a green list of 12 destinations, including Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar. \nThe Welsh government is yet to confirm if they will align with the plans or take a different approach.\nWales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales the risks he saw around international travel centred on \"too rapid a relaxation of the social distancing rules, and possibly around waning in immunity\".\nHe added: \"We can do things about these, but some of them, we just have to be cautious, bide our time, keep to our low rates, and that will keep Wales safe.\"\nMeanwhile, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the recovery of the NHS from Covid was \"going to be a huge task\" that he thought would \"take a full Senedd term\".\nSpeaking at a distribution centre in Newport that was preparing to send life-saving equipment to India, he said the pandemic was \"not quite over yet\", with ongoing pressure from long Covid, for example.\nThe NHS was also facing a huge backlog of treatment and operations that had been delayed because of coronavirus, he said.\nMr Gething said: \"You simply can't recover in a matter of months - and that's the level of honesty I think we need with the public and with our staff.\"\nHe warned the recovery of the NHS would take time \"partly because of capacity but importantly because our staff need to be cared for as well\".\nWelsh Labour has budgeted to spend at least \u00a31bn extra on NHS recovery.\nMr Drakeford said on Saturday that Wales' response to the Covid pandemic had been a major part in Labour's election win as they were returned as the largest party for the sixth successive time since devolution in 1999.\n\"A government I lead will continue to follow the science to do what our medical advisers tells us we should do, and that does mean doing things in a way that continues to keep Wales safe,\" he said.\nThe Welsh government controls Wales' Covid response and the relaxing of restrictions - such as meeting inside pubs and restaurants and travel rules - has tended to have been more cautious in Wales.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that people from different households would be able to meet up and hug from 17 May in England.\nIt is up to individuals whether they socially distance with close family and friends from that date in England.\nThe UK government said it wanted to let people in England exercise personal judgement as more of life returns to normal, but people are still urged to remain cautious and remember some people are more vulnerable to Covid than others.\nAddressing the issue of hugging in Wales, Dr Atherton said: \"Prevalence rates are really quite low at the moment, and being close to a member of your family is less risk now - but with strangers, I would be very cautious still.\n\"I think there are other ways to greet people than to give everybody a hug, so there are ways to do that and to do it safely - don't spend too long making face-to-face contact, make it a brief hug.\n\"But to be honest, I think it is quite right - I understand that grandparents want to hug their grandkids, of course they do, and that's only natural.\n\"But we have learned over the last year that there are other ways to interact socially, and perhaps\u2026 hug cautiously.\"\nThe new Senedd is meeting for the first time on Wednesday to elect a presiding officer and deputy presiding officer to conduct proceedings. \nThen, once those posts are filled Labour will then be able to re-nominate Mr Drakeford as first minister - with no significant challenge from the opposition expected to his reappointment.\n\"We have demonstrated over a number of governments that you can govern successfully on 30 seats, but I'm open to working with any party where there is common ground between us,\" he said.\nLib Dem leader Jane Dodds, their only Senedd member, has ruled out joining the Welsh government like her predecessor Kirsty Williams did.
