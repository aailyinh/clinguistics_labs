      "title": "Coronavirus: EU and UK try to end row with 'win-win' on vaccines",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The UK and the European Union have said they are working together to improve their relationship, after weeks of tensions over Covid vaccine supplies.\nIn a joint statement, they said they wanted to \"create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all\".\nThe European Commission earlier proposed tougher export controls on vaccines, amid tensions over supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson warned that \"blockades\" were not \"sensible\".\nThe joint UK-EU statement said that \"openness and global co-operation\" would be key to tackling the pandemic.\n\"We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,\" it said. \"We will continue our discussions.\"\nBut there was little harmony earlier on Wednesday when the Commission announced plans for all vaccine shipments to be assessed on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and exports. The proposals, which will be put before EU leaders on Thursday, are seen as focused on the UK and US in particular.\nThe tone of the EU-UK statement was positive, but actual progress between the two sides was described to me by an EU diplomat as \"slow, cumbersome and difficult\". On both sides. \nThat doesn't mean impossible, but at their summit on Thursday, some EU leaders - along with the European Commission - will still be pushing for tougher controls on vaccine exports. And they could hit the UK. \nEU insiders say they had hoped never to use the controls. They say they want them as a means of exerting pressure on vaccine companies and on countries with vaccine production sites that are not exporting to the EU. \nWith a third wave of the pandemic hitting much of mainland Europe, EU leaders are coming under increasing pressure to show voters they are taking action to ramp up both the supply of jabs and their vaccine rollout, on both of which they are trailing behind the UK.\nEU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides rejected a suggestion that the aim was to punish the UK. \"We're dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries,\" she said.\nAsked whether the UK might retaliate, Mr Johnson told MPs he did not believe \"that blockades of either vaccines or of medicines, of ingredients for vaccines\" would be \"sensible\". Companies might draw conclusions about future investments \"in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed\", he added.\nMeanwhile, in other developments:\nThe tougher export controls are most like to affect countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. \nThe key criteria for the proposed regulations are \"reciprocity\" and \"proportionality\":\nThere will be no outright export bans, which are opposed by countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. \nVaccine manufacturers would be assessed to see if they were fulfilling their contract with the EU, although no specific algorithm is planned.\nIn an interview with the BBC, the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton insisted the bloc's issues were with AstraZeneca and not the UK government. \"I know that there's some tension... but as long as we have transparency, I think [relations] will be able to be normalised,\" he said.\nHe said if AstraZeneca had provided the agreed 120 million doses to the EU, member states would have been at the same rate of vaccination as the UK: \"We have been heavily penalised and we just want to understand why\". \nAstraZeneca denies that it is failing to honour its contract with the EU.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We are all fighting the same pandemic. Vaccines are an international operation; they are produced by collaboration by great scientists around the world. And we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout.\"\nLast week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen complained that the EU had exported more than 10 million doses to the UK, but the UK had so far exported none in return.\nHer colleagues added that this had to be seen in the context of the EU being both a global Covid hotspot and also the biggest exporter of vaccines. Since the end of January, EU countries have exported 43 million doses of vaccine to 33 countries not subject to export authorisation, they say.\nUK sources insist vital components are being sent to the continent, for example for the Pfizer vaccine, and they have emphasised the UK's role in investing early in vaccine development, BBC correspondent Nick Beake reports."

      "title": "Covid vaccine: AstraZeneca updates US vaccine efficacy results",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,United States,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "AstraZeneca has updated the efficacy result of its coronavirus vaccine trial in the US, after health officials insisted they wanted to include the latest information. \nThe Anglo-Swedish firm has now adjusted the efficacy rate of its vaccine from 79% to 76%.\nFurther data from the US trial showed efficacy among the over 65s rose from 80% to 85%. \nAstraZeneca said it now looked forward to getting US regulatory approval.\nThe company said the trial results confirm the vaccine \"is highly effective in adults\" and it remains 100% effective at preventing severe cases of the disease.\nThe US trials of the AstraZeneca jab had involved more than 32,000 volunteers, mostly in America, but also in Chile and Peru.\nIn the results announced on Monday, the company said the vaccine was found to be 79% effective. But the next day, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said it had been informed by data and safety officials monitoring the trial that information may have been used that provided an \"incomplete view of the efficacy data\".\nDr Anthony Fauci, the White House's Chief Medical Advisor, then warned reporters the firm would \"likely come out with a modified statement\".\nAstraZeneca's revised results now incorporate for the latest data from the trials.  \nAfter the initial release of data the company received a highly unusual public rebuke from independent scientists overseeing the trial, who said the company may have given \"outdated information\" that gave an \"incomplete view\" of the vaccine's effectiveness. \nIt is now clear that the numbers have not moved by much and it begs the question why such a row over data was not conducted in private. AstraZeneca has risked reputational damage as a result of the public ticking off and senior figures are privately dismayed by the row.\nSo why didn't AstraZeneca simply wait? I'm told that the company felt a duty to publish results on Monday as soon as the agreed threshold of cases had been passed.  A key reason was that there was a specific analysis showing there were no safety issues regarding blood clots. Given that a few EU countries are still not using the vaccine because of concerns over clots, this information would provide reassurance.  \nThis is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, over dosing, efficacy in the elderly, clots and supplies to the EU.  \nThe key point to remember is that this is a highly effective vaccine with a strong safety record. Regulators in the UK and EU have said its benefits far outweigh any side effects.  \nWhile other companies are set to make billions from their Covid vaccines, AstraZeneca is producing theirs at cost throughout the pandemic.  \nUnlike Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines, the AstraZeneca jab can be stored at fridge temperature, and it will play a vital role in immunisation in low and middle income countries.  \n\"We look forward to filing our regulatory submission for Emergency Use Authorization in the US and preparing for the rollout of millions of doses across America,\" Mene Pangalos, an executive vice president at AstraZeneca, said on Thursday.\nThe US had ordered 300 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine when it emerged as a frontrunner in the global race to immunise people against Covid-19.\nBut delays and controversies have seen three other vaccines beat it to a US rollout."

      "tags": "Television,UK TV licence fee,UK government,BBC,BritBox,Netflix,Radio",
      "text": "The government will be forced to rely on the current BBC TV licence fee model until 2038, a group of MPs has said.\nA report from a Commons select committee suggests the failure to find a viable alternative form of funding meant the licence fee must remain for the term of the next charter.\nA government spokeswoman said the licence fee would be reviewed before the current charter ends in 2027. \nThe BBC said it \"welcomed this thorough and detailed report\".\nThe corporation added: \"We welcome the conclusion that the licence fee is the best way of funding a universal BBC.\"\nThe BBC announced last month that the annual licence fee will increase from \u00a3157.50 to \u00a3159 from April 2021. It came after three million over-75s lost their free TV licence entitlement.\nThe report, which was published by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee on Thursday, focused on the future of public service broadcasting.\nIt concluded that the government's failure to put in place the necessary broadband infrastructure, which would allow for other funding mechanisms, meant it had no option but to stick with the licence fee for the next 10-year charter period.\nCurrently, a move to a digital system would result in 1.8 million households losing access to public service broadcasting because of a lack of broadband access and digital skills, the report said.\n\"It's clear that the BBC TV licence fee has a limited shelf life in a digital media landscape,\" said DCMS Committee Chair and Conservative MP Julian Knight.\n\"However, the government has missed the boat to reform it. Instead of coming up with a workable alternative, it has sealed its own fate through a failure to develop a broadband infrastructure that would allow serious consideration of other means to fund the BBC.\"\nThe committee said it had \"explored existing alternatives\" to the licence fee but said none was \"sufficiently attractive to justify recommending... not least given the disruption and expense of doing so\". It added: \"On balance, the licence fee remains the preferred option for that period.\"\nThe BBC's current charter runs until 31 December 2027. The new recommendations from the DCMS committee refer to the next charter period, which will be 2028-2038.\nThe report also said the government should end speculation about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, in order to prevent further funding losses.\nIt suggested the current uncertainty was likely to boost licence fee evasion rates and lead to a further drop in funding.\nEarlier this year, the government announced it had decided not to move ahead with plans to decriminalise non-payment of the  licence fee, but said the issue would \"remain under active consideration\".\n\"The government is effectively allowing the BBC to haemorrhage funds through non-payment of the licence fee as a result of continued speculation over decriminalisation of licence fee evasion, a situation it must bring to an end,\" said Mr Knight.\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \"Decriminalisation of the licence fee remains on the table.\n\"The government continues to believe that criminal sanctions for non payment is increasingly disproportionate, but we need to be careful that any alternative enforcement mechanism does not result in heavier penalties.\"\n\"We have said we will keep the licence fee until 2027 but, ahead of that point, will review how the BBC is funded.\"\nThe DCMS select committee is a group of MPs from different political parties who scrutinise the spending, policies and administration of the government's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\nAs such, they do not have any policy-making power, but they can make recommendations and hold ministers to account.\nMr Knight said ministers must now legislate to enable public service broadcasters to compete in a digital world, adding that the likes of BBC, ITV and Channel 4 should also be pooling resources so they can compete with streaming giants like Netflix.\nHe continued: \"The collaboration by the BBC and ITV on BritBox is a striking example of how they can work together to create a one stop shop for video on demand content - a model for future work.\"\nBBC director general Tim Davie said this week that the corporation \"is not here to beat Netflix\", adding: \"We need to do something radically different.\"\nMr Davie noted his own \"healthy paranoia about the sustainability\" of the BBC's licence fee funding model, and said the corporation must be \"distinctive\".\nMr Davie also unveiled plans last week to move key departments and staff outside of London to make the corporation more reflective of the UK as a whole.\nMr Knight also called on Mr Davie to provide updated figures on rates of licence fee evasion, in light of concerns that the numbers are significantly higher than those previously published.\nThe BBC's Annual Report estimated an evasion rate of between 6.5% and 7.5%. However, Mr Knight said the BBC had recently provided more detailed information to Lord Botham regarding licence fee figures for people aged over 75.\n\"We've heard that current rates are significantly higher than the figures it has published to date,\" Mr Knight said. \"When we asked for this information we were pointed to published annual reports that were nowhere near as detailed as what appears to have been sent to Lord Botham about the over-75s. We are left asking whether there is something to hide.\"\nIn response, the BBC said: \"The overwhelming majority of people in the UK are correctly licensed. A small minority evade and this figure has remained broadly steady over the past five years.\n\"The over-75s are entirely separate. We are giving people time to transition to the new system and it is misleading to link these two issues.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Lockdown: Boris Johnson unveils plan to end England restrictions by 21 June",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new four-step plan to ease England's lockdown could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met.\nShops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality could reopen on 12 April in England under plans set out by the PM.\nFrom 17 May, two households might be allowed to mix in homes, while the rule of six could apply in places like pubs.\nIt requires four tests on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants to be met at each stage.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the plan aimed to be \"cautious but irreversible\" and at every stage decisions would be led by \"data not dates\".\nThere was \"no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world\", he said.\nMr Johnson later told a Downing Street news conference the coming spring and summer would be \"seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all\".\nHe described the plan as a \"one-way road to freedom\" but said he could not guarantee it would be irreversible \"but the intention is that it should be\".\nIt comes as the first data on the UK's coronavirus vaccine rollout suggested it was having a \"spectacular\" impact on stopping serious illness.\nAs part of the first step of the plan for easing lockdown in England:\nSecondary school pupils can access tests and will be required to wear face coverings in classrooms and shared spaces like corridors.\nThere will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed.\nThe second step from 12 April would see major parts of the economy permitted to reopen:\nBut wider social contact rules will continue to apply in all settings - meaning no indoor mixing between different households will be allowed.\nMr Johnson confirmed the end of hospitality curfews - and requirements to eat a substantial meal alongside alcohol.\nHe said a review of international leisure travel restrictions would be announced by 12 April at the earliest.\nFunerals continue with up to 30 people, and weddings with up to 15 guests.\nThe third step will come from 17 May - if the data allows - and will see the \"rule of six\" abolished for outdoor gatherings, replaced with a limit of 30 people:\nUp to 30 people will be able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes.\nMr Johnson said this step would also \"consider the potential role of Covid status certification\" - which could refer to so-called \"vaccine passports\" - in helping indoor venues to reopen safely.\nBefore the fourth step, ministers will carry out a review into social distancing and other \"long-term measures\" designed to reduce transmission, including the \"one metre plus\" rule and the wearing of face coverings.\nThey will also consider whether to lift the \"work from home\" guidance, which the government says people should continue to follow until the review has been completed.\nThe fourth step from 21 June will potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs.\nThe government hopes that - from this date - restrictions on weddings and funerals will also be abolished.\nMusic and events leaders called for more financial support for the sector, with the boss of one live music trade body saying his industry is \"at the back of the queue to re-open\" once restrictions are lifted.\nMPs will vote on the roadmap in late March.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers.\nProf Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said he thought the roadmap struck the \"right balance\" - but warned reopening schools risks increasing the number of cases reported each day.\nSpeaking later at the Downing Street briefing, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was \"very important\" to leave a gap of five weeks between the changes in the roadmap to avoid \"flying blind\".\nSir Patrick also said \"baseline\" measures - such as face coverings in certain situations, hand washing, and self-isolation - may be necessary next winter.\nThe vaccines are working well and infection levels have fallen to a fifth of what they were since the start of the year.\nSo why, many may ask, is there such caution?\nThe answer lies in the mountain of data published by the government as it unveiled its roadmap.\nAmong the documents was modelling done by Imperial College London.\nIt showed a rapid easing of restrictions could lead to surge in deaths over the summer and a total of 80,000 deaths by the middle of 2022.\nThere is much uncertainty about scenarios like this - for one thing it did not take into account any seasonal impact that the warmer weather could bring by reducing spread of the virus.\nThe gradual lifting could, by comparison, reduce that to around 30,000. That would bring it in line with the sort of deaths we could see during a bad flu winter.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says that should be the context in which we judge Covid now.\nThe devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions but have largely moved in the same direction, though at different speeds, during the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased.\nIt means different parts of the country could be under different rules. Ms Sturgeon added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. \nIn Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the \"stay-at-home\" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. \nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster wants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schools following Mr Johnson's announcement in England.\nThe prime minister addressed the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs tonight.\nHe faced criticism of what some saw as slow progress in removing restrictions.\nOne participant suggested he was talking \"gibberish\" when he compared his routemap to a motorway journey.\nAnother said the PM had been \"rattled\".\nWhat annoyed some MPs was an apparent lack of flexibility in the plan with restrictions not being lifted \"before\" certain dates.\nHe was urged to keep open the possibility of bringing these dates forward if data allowed but there was \"no backtracking\" on the five-week wait between steps.\nThe prime minister also said that \"a debate had to be had\" on domestic vaccine passport certificates.\nIt came as a further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMore than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according to latest government figures."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pub goers could be asked to provide a vaccine certificate, Boris Johnson has told MPs, saying it \"may be up to individual publicans\".\nA review is looking into whether people should have to prove they have been vaccinated, as lockdown measures ease. \nA government source told the BBC that the option of allowing people to show a negative test was also being looked at.\nBut Tory MP Steve Baker said it was a \"ghastly trap\" and unfairly penalised those advised not to have a vaccine.\nMeanwhile, MPs will vote later on new coronavirus laws for England's roadmap out of lockdown.\nThey will also be asked to approve the government's plan to renew emergency coronavirus powers for another six months. The Coronavirus Act was introduced in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.\nThe government review of vaccine certification could report in May to coincide with the wider reopening of hospitality in England, according to a senior government source.\nThe review is looking at how people's vaccination and testing status could be stored securely and displayed on a mobile phone, and the circumstances under which such a system could apply.\nThe idea of asking pub goers to show a vaccine certificate was raised at Wednesday's House of Commons Liaison Committee hearing, when Conservative William Wragg asked Mr Johnson if vaccine certificates were \"compatible with a free society such as ours\".\nMr Johnson said the concept \"should not be totally alien to us\" as doctors already have to have hepatitis B jabs.\nMr Wragg then asked, what about \"ordinary citizens going to the pub?\" and the prime minister replied: \"That's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans.\"\nPushed further, Mr Johnson said: \"I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it\" adding that the public \"want me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them\".\nMr Johnson also said it seemed \"wholly responsible\" for care companies to require their workers to be vaccinated and \"the principle is there\" in terms of professions requiring certain vaccines when \"entrusted with care of a patient\".\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Jonathan Neame, chief executive of the Shepherd Neame pub chain, said his company would not insist on vaccine certificates.  \nHe said: \"The whole essence of a pub is that they are diverse and inclusive environments, where everybody, and families in particular, are extremely welcome.\"\nHe added: \"It's absolutely fine to exclude people where there is a situation of bad behaviour or drunkenness, and that's already enshrined in law, but if you're going to exclude people for what they are, or what they have not done, that's a wholly different issue which does touch on discrimination, civil liberties, and in this case data protection issues.\"\nPeter Marks, from nightclub owner the Deltic Group, said a vaccine certificate \"could work\" for the sector and would probably be accepted by customers already used to carrying IDs to get into venues. However, he said he was concerned introducing such a measure could delay the reopening of businesses.  \nMinisters, and the devolved administrations, have set out plans for how the rules they imposed will be rolled back.\nBut there are still question marks over what will take the place of the laws we have lived with for so long.\nMr Johnson was happy to sketch out how that question could in part be answered, in a way that not all of his party will like.\nHe made clear that he was willing to countenance the idea of \"jabs for jobs\" and held open the possibility that bars might ask for \"papers for pints\".\nWhen tests are widely available, proof of a negative test, is also being considered as a tool to help venues open up\nThe government is reluctant to make any of this compulsory for everyone.\nBut it seems that proving our Covid status, through the vaccination, or a test, is likely to be part of our lives in the medium term.\nRead more from Laura here. \nAt the Liaison Committee hearing, senior Tory backbencher Mr Baker strongly rejected the suggestion of requiring pub goers to show proof they had been vaccinated, saying: \"First they said we'll need them to watch the football, and today that it may be papers for the pub.\"\nHe warned that such a situation would prevent pregnant women - who have been advised not to take the vaccine - from \"taking part in society\".\nHe also expressed concern that business would be able to turn away customers \"from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine\".\n\"We must not fall into this ghastly trap,\" he said. \nDowning Street later pointed out that pregnant women are not specifically being advised to avoid having a Covid vaccination, but to discuss it with their GP.\nKate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the sector should not be \"subject to mandatory vaccination certification\".\n\"It is simply unworkable, would cause conflict between staff and customers and almost certainty result in breaches of equality rules,\" she added."

The furthest is five miles, it said.\n\"All are within half a mile of at least two free-to-use ATMs and one mile of the nearest Post Office,\" it added.\nIn the two years before the beginning of the pandemic, the number of transactions handled in branches fell by a third, the bank said. Last year, it declined by a further 50%.\nMeanwhile, mobile and online transactions have grown 20% each year with more than two-thirds of transactions now completed without customers visiting a branch. \nThe bank also plans to move its headquarters from London to Milton Keynes and reduce the amount of space it rents in the capital.\nIt will close offices in Bootle, Newcastle, London and Manchester before the end of the year.\nThe 5,000 office staff affected will be asked to work from home more often or travel in to one of its six remaining offices in Belfast, Bradford, Glasgow, London and Sheffield, as well as its new headquarters.\n\"The pandemic has accelerated the existing trend towards greater flexible working, and our colleagues have told us this has brought significant benefits for many of them,\" Santander's UK boss Nathan Bostock said.\n\"At the same time, physical spaces remain very important and our sites around the UK will provide our colleagues with first-class facilities fit for the future.\"\nThe decision to reduce the number of offices it rents and ask staff to work from home more often follows an announcement from building society Nationwide which told its 13,000 office staff that they could choose where they work.\nUnder the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two."

      "text": "North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles into the sea to its east, say the US and Japan, the first such test since Joe Biden became US president. \nPyongyang is banned from testing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions.\nBoth Japan and South Korea, which call it the Sea of Japan and East Sea respectively, have condemned the test. \nIt comes just days after North Korea reportedly fired two non-ballistic missiles into the Yellow Sea.\nJapan said no debris had fallen within its territorial waters. \nThe US Pacific Command, which oversees military forces in the Asia-Pacific region, said on Thursday that the test highlighted \"the threat that North Korea's illicit weapons programme poses to its neighbours and the international community\".\nMr Biden is yet to officially comment. \nOn Tuesday, he played down a non-ballistic missile launch which took place over the weekend, saying the US did not consider it a provocation. Those short-range missiles were thought to be either artillery or cruise missiles, which are not banned under the UN Security Council resolutions on North Korea.\nThursday's test also comes days after the US received its first North Korean in custody after Mun Chol Myung was extradited from Malaysia. Mr Mun is a businessman accused of laundering money through the US financial system to provide luxury items to North Korea.\nThe incident angered North Korea so much it cut off diplomatic ties with Malaysia. \nThis is a bigger deal for the US and its allies.\nThe test at the weekend of either artillery or cruise missiles can be shrugged off. But this ballistic missile test is a clear violation of United Nations Security sanctions.\nHaving said that, Mr Biden's predecessor Donald Trump did wave off any questions regarding similar weapons tests in 2019. \nThe deal between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un reached in Singapore in 2018 was that Pyongyang would not test long-range ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons.\nAt that time, the White House did not concern itself with smaller tests.\nBut Mr Biden's team is just back from Japan and South Korea, and promised that \"America was back\" and supporting its allies.\nPerhaps then, the administration will have to say something about a weapons test which threatens its friends in North East Asia.\nWashington will also be aware that Pyongyang has bigger weapons in its arsenal which it has not tested since late 2017.\nNorth Korea has spent more than a year in isolation. It even cut off most trade with its closest ally China amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, and its economy is thought to be in a dire state.\nNow that the weapons tests appear to be making a return, many are wondering just how far is Kim Jong-un willing to go to get the attention of the White House.\nJapanese officials said North Korea fired the two missiles after 07:00 local time on Thursday (20:00 GMT Wednesday). They flew 420km and 430km respectively before landing in waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone. There was no damage inflicted to ships or aeroplanes.\nNorth Korea last fired ballistic missiles, considered threatening weapons, a year ago amid stalled relations between then-US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\nThe Biden administration says it has unsuccessfully tried to make diplomatic contact with North Korea. \nPyongyang has yet to acknowledge that Mr Biden is now in office, and the two countries remain at loggerheads over the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "Ursula von der Leyen,Coronavirus vaccines,Emmanuel Macron,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "European Union leaders have stopped short of banning vaccine exports after a protracted row with the Anglo-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca.\nAt a summit on Thursday they gave backing in principle for toughening export controls.\nBut a post-summit statement emphasised the importance of global supply chains needed to produce vaccinations. \nElements of the AstraZeneca vaccination are manufactured in a number of EU states.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said AstraZeneca must \"catch up\" on deliveries to the EU before exporting doses elsewhere. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told reporters this marked \"the end of naivety\" from the EU.\nVaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering promised doses. AstraZeneca has denied that it is failing to honour its contract.\nThe EU is expecting to receive about 30 million AstraZeneca doses by the end of March, less than a third of what it was hoping for. \n\"I think it is clear that first of all the company has to catch up,\" Mrs von der Leyen told a news conference after the virtual leaders' summit.\n\"[It] has to honour the contract it has with European member states before it can engage again in exporting vaccines,\" she said. \"We want to explain to our European citizens that they [can] get their fair share.\"\nThe EU was accused, primarily by the UK and the World Health Organization (WHO), of so-called vaccine nationalism after it introduced export controls on jabs produced within the bloc.\nIn response, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that \"blockades\" were not \"sensible\".\nHe said a ban would imperil the UK's vaccination drive, which has so far been more successful than EU member states' vaccine programmes.\nMr Johnson also warned that a ban that extended beyond AstraZeneca's disputed supply could also block jabs produced for BioNTech/Pfizer in Belgium. \nFrance's foreign minister said on Friday that the EU \"shouldn't be paying the price\" for the UK's vaccination policy.\n\"One can't play with blackmail, having given a lot of first jabs and then run into problems with the second,\" Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio.\nMrs von der Leyen said on Thursday that EU was the \"region that exports most vaccines worldwide\" and invited other countries to \"match our openness\". \nHer comments came a day after the EU issued a joint statement with the UK in which both sides pledged to work together after weeks of tensions over the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nMeanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron backed the EU's export controls. \n\"I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don't respect their commitments with Europeans,\" he said.\nEarlier, he expressed frustration at the slow pace of much of Europe's vaccine rollout. \"We didn't shoot for the stars,\" he told the Greek television channel ERT before the summit. \"We were wrong to lack ambition.\"\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said while his fellow leaders had found the Commission's tougher export measures \"acceptable\", he hoped they would never be used - a message echoed by his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo.\nBoth those two countries are home to factories involved in the production of the AstraZeneca shot, which it's suggested may soon be sending increased supplies to European nations - a move that may assuage some EU anger, BBC Brussels correspondent Nick Beake reports.\nMr Rutte said an agreement with the UK over AstraZeneca components produced in the Netherlands could be announced this weekend.\nFollowing the virtual summit, the EU's 27 member states agreed to try and ramp up the production of vaccines within the bloc.\n\"Accelerating the production, delivery and deployment of vaccines remains essential and urgent to overcome the crisis. Efforts to this end must be further intensified,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\"We underline the importance of transparency as well as of the use of export authorisations,\" they added.\nThe EU also called on vaccine manufacturers to \"ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines\".\nUS President Joe Biden also attended the virtual meeting, in an effort to repair ties with the EU after the strained relationship between the bloc and his predecessor, Donald Trump.\nAhead of Thursday's meeting, a former president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, urged the bloc to avoid a \"stupid vaccine war\" with the UK.\n\"We are not in war, and we are not enemies,\" he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme.\nHe added that threats of export bans could cause \"major reputational damage\" to the EU.\nA third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe.\nEU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000.\nYet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US.\nSpeaking earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to \"a new pandemic\".\n\"The situation is serious,\" she said. \"Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again.\"\nLockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there is particular concern over eastern EU states.\nPoland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged."

I want to give sectors sufficient warning, but I don't want to be suggesting that we can see the future that far ahead sufficiently precisely.\"\nThe relaxation of rules on who and how many people you can meet outdoors means Deio, Gwenlli and Osian will be able to meet their grandparents - at a safe distance - for the first time since Christmas Day.\nThe children live near Llanbrynmair, Powys, while their grandparents live about 40 miles (64km) away in Llangwyryfon, Ceredigion.\n\"It's been very, very difficult not seeing them,\" said Osian, 15.\n\"I'm looking forward to seeing family and friends, and hopefully getting back to playing football and things like that.\"\nGwenlli, 10, said it had been \"sad\" not being able to see her grandparents, but she understood it was for a good reason.\n\"I would love to go shopping again and do gymnastics in my gymnastics club,\" she added.\nDeio, 12, said it had been \"hard\" but was looking forward to going on a picnic with his grandparents.\nThe ending of Wales' Covid travel restrictions coincides with the Easter school holiday and a spell of warmer weather.\nWelsh beaches \"were much busier last year\" as more people took holiday staycations because of coronavirus travel restrictions abroad, and lifeguards are expecting this year to also be busy.\nBut people who may be considering heading to the beach have been warned they could get in difficulty with cold seas and many unseen strong currents.\n\"The sea around the Welsh coast has still not warmed up,\" said Matt Childs, the RNLI's lifesaving manager for south Wales.\n\"It is really cold and you're likely to get yourself into difficulty with cold water shock hitting you. The sea only needs to be 13 to 15 degrees to be in trouble and its much colder than that now.\"\nHuw Pendleton, the managing director of Celtic Holiday Parks in Pembrokeshire, said he expected to be \"extremely busy\" at the weekend. \nHe said all three of his parks were fully booked and they were expecting up to 600 people to arrive over the weekend.\n\"We will be very grateful to let people back into the business,\" he said.\n\"We hope that people will act responsibly because health comes first. But these communities are very reliant on tourism.\"\nKevin Burt of Llandegfedd Visitor and Watersports Centre, near Pontypool, said: \"We know that people have been desperate to get out, to enjoy the countryside, to enjoy the walks and to take it all in.\n\"We're really excited to welcome our customers back, but we are very conscious as well that it needs to be safe for them and for the people who work here as well.\"\nLeighton Phillips, is the owner of Aeron Coast Holiday Park in Aberaeron, Ceredigion, which has 200 static caravans and space for 100 tourers. \nAbout 90% of the statics are owned by people from south Wales, many of whom have been calling Mr Phillips, asking when they can come back.\nThe park's shared facilities - the club, children's playroom, gym and pool - have to stay closed, but Mr Phillips is expecting a busy weekend.\n\"I suppose from one minute past 12 they could come, but they will be coming I'm sure from eight o'clock on in the morning,\" he said.\n\"I think mainly they want to be able to just get out, have a stroll around and see people at a distance. \n\"They're so used - as we all have been - to being locked in at home and looking at the garden wall or what's outside. Now they really want to see their friends and they're a very very close community here.\"\nTegryn Jones, chief executive of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, told BBC Radio Wales \"there is concern\" about an influx of visitors, and urged people to \"act responsibly\".\nMeanwhile, the chief executive of North Wales Tourism welcomed the further easing, but said it was \"a great shame\" that many attractions and hospitality businesses will not be allowed to reopen at the same time.\n\"There is still a real and palpable sense of frustration in the sector, as it feels that the Welsh government haven't been listening to the mood on the ground,\" said Jim Jones.\n\"If they had, then we would have a plan to take us forward post April.\u00a0\n\"It is very difficult to understand why they won't map this out, especially as the other three home nations have now done so.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Wales' Breakfast programme, Mr Drakeford said people in England were expected to be able to travel from 12 April, and if those restrictions are lifted they will be able to come to Wales.\nIn the meantime, people taking bookings are expected to ensure they are only taking them from people living in Wales.\nMr Drakeford said: \"Avoid crowded places. We are such a lucky country, we've got so many fantastic places people can explore and visit. Look for those other opportunities, respect other people, keep a distance.\n\"If there are people knowingly and deliberately breaking the law then action will be taken.\"\nHe added vaccine passports for entering pubs was something which \"we should be exploring\".\nNot at the moment. Travel in and out of Wales is not permitted unless you have a reasonable excuse which includes:\nThere is also a list of reasons deemed \"reasonably necessary\", which include accessing education or childcare when \"there is no practicable alternative\".\nWhen the next review of the regulations takes place on Thursday, Welsh ministers will consider allowing people to travel outside of Wales from 12 April.\nEngland's travel restrictions are also expected to end on 12 April so, subject to law changes in by both governments, travel into England could be possible. \nThe same goes for Scotland and Northern Ireland - in Scotland, travel to other parts of the UK should be permitted from 26 April or soon after and in Northern Ireland the stay-at-home message is expected to be relaxed from 12 April.\nRetailers may be allowed to fully reopen, and teaching of pupils not yet back in school could restart, from 12 April.\nPrimary schools and some secondary school children have already resumed classes.\nA decision on whether to permit pubs, restaurants and cafes to reopen outdoors will not be taken until at least 22 April.\nThe UK government does not plan to ease stay at home restrictions in England until 29 March, but ministers will urge people to remain local as much as possible.\nIt plans to allow trips to self-catering accommodation from 12 April.\nThe Welsh government said the level of restrictions was \"starting\" to move from alert level four to alert level three. \nMembers of the Welsh Hospitality industry are backing an appeal for money to fund a legal challenge to the rules on the reopening of pubs and restaurants in Wales.\nThe chairman of Cardiff Licensees forum said he was \"100%\" behind a bid to raise money for a judicial review of the Welsh government's timeline. \nIt follows a similar challenge of the UK government's rules in England. \nNick Newman, chairman of Cardiff Licensees Forum, said he has had \"a terrific response\" to a crowdfunding proposal by Matt Connolly, the owner of a restaurant in Cardiff.\nDylan's, which has restaurants in Menai Bridge, Criccieth and Llandudno, has called for a road map of of lockdown for the industry.\nMaria McLean from the company said: \"Hospitality is at the heart of a lot of what we do in north Wales and we run the risk of undoing all that good work we've done to promote this fabulous destination over the last 10 or so years. \n\"If we're not open and the destination across the border are, it makes it very difficult for us to compete on an even footing.\" \nCerys Furlong, who owns two pubs and a restaurant in Cardiff, called for more financial support for the sector. \n\"It really is urgent, funding is running out in five days for many businesses and people are really, really feeling the strain,\" she told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales. \n\"To fail at this last hurdle, to provide this support that is necessary, would just be catastrophic.\" \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: \"It's a difficult balance to strike... but I think one of the areas I don't think the Welsh government are getting it right is giving sufficient forewarning to businesses.\n\"Having a series of dates as far out as June is excessive... but businesses tell us the one thing they need is notice.\"\nCalum Davies, from the Welsh Conservatives, said: \"This change is very welcome, better late than never, really, but this is the first step of what businesses need to hear especially in the tourism industry.\n\"We still need more clarity and detail in other areas.\nJane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: \"This will come as welcome news to many who have been cut off for a long time.\n\"The public have a duty to follow these new rules carefully as the virus is still very much circulating amongst us. I hope this will the start of the end of our final lockdown.\"\nStay local rules were in place for just two weeks, replacing a stay-at-home order - in place since the start of the third national Welsh lockdown.\nLockdown was imposed in Wales at the end of December after a rise in cases increased pressure on the Welsh NHS.\nWales' case rate has been below 50 cases per 100,000 people - the threshold used as the guide for bringing areas into lockdown last year - for the past 21 days.\nAt the moment it is 38.5 per 100,000 over the past seven days compared to the peak on 17 December, when it was 636 per 100,000.\nThe rate that tests are coming back as positive is the lowest point since mid-September, at 3.1%"

In a joint statement yesterday the UK and the EU said they wanted to \"create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all\", adding \"the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important\".\nAs lockdown measures look set to ease, a plan being mooted is that pub goers could be asked to provide a vaccine certificate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs, saying it \"may be up to individual publicans\". A government source told the BBC that the option of allowing people to show a negative test was also being looked at. Plans are being considered as part of a review into whether people should have to prove they have been vaccinated, as lockdown measures ease. But Tory MP Steve Baker said it was a \"ghastly trap\" and would unfairly penalise those advised not to have a vaccine.\nNHS staff in Scotland are to be offered a pay rise of at least 4%, the Scottish government has confirmed. Nurses, paramedics and domestic staff are among those who could receive the boost to their salaries. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says the offer - which does not apply to doctors - recognised the \"service and dedication\" of staff during the pandemic. The settlement will be backdated to 1 December 2020 in recognition of an \"exceptional year of significant pressure\". The rise is higher than the 1% increase proposed for some NHS staff in England.\nMiddle-aged women experience the most severe, long-lasting symptoms after being treated in hospital for Covid-19, two UK studies suggest. Five months on, 70% of patients studied were still affected by everything from anxiety to breathlessness, fatigue, muscle pain and \"brain fog\". But the researchers say there is no obvious link with how ill people originally became. How women's bodies fight off illness could explain their poorer recovery.\nAs the Number 18 bus wove through the London traffic, two passengers were deep in conversation. What they agreed on the pre-lockdown roads near Euston would change the course of the pandemic and possibly the future of medicine. It would unite researchers, the NHS and 40,000 Covid patients in an endeavour uniquely suited to a national public health service. It would save the lives of hundreds of thousands of Covid patients around the world. It would create the UK's Recovery trial, where existing drugs were tested on Covid patients to see if they had an effect on the disease. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "text": "Northern Ireland's fishermen say they have been short-changed in a UK share-out of extra Brexit fish. \nThey say they got only \u00a314m of the \u00a320m-a-year worth of additional quota they believe they were due.\nA spokesman for one of the two main fishing organisations, Alan McCulla, said Northern Ireland's Brexit fish dividend had been \"plundered\".\nHe warned last week that the government intended to give the bulk of the Brexit fish to Scotland.\nMr McCulla claimed it was part of a ploy to shore up support for the Conservative candidates ahead of key elections there in May, in order to see off a future Scottish independence referendum.\nA Department of Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson said: \"We have worked closely with the devolved administrations to make sure that the additional fishing quota we have secured for the UK is allocated fairly.\n\"For the majority of Northern Ireland priority stocks, such as haddock, fishers receive a higher share than they did last year.\"\nThe UK negotiated a return of fish previously caught by EU boats in UK waters as part of the Brexit deal.\nIt was left to Whitehall to decide how to share it out in consultation with the devolved nations.\nThe detail of the share-out was quietly published on Wednesday.\nMr McCulla said Northern Ireland had got a fair share in the Irish Sea, but pointed out that 60% of the fleet's catch by value was taken in wider UK waters.\nHe said his members had been \"mugged\" of new opportunities in those areas.\n\"The London government's spin that the Brexit fisheries boost is distributed across the UK may be true, but the fact is that distribution has been rigged to favour some areas more than others,\" he said.\nNorthern Ireland's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said: \"I am disappointed with the secretary of state's decision to allocate additional quota gained from the EU in 2021, using a method based on track record and geographical zonal attachment. \n\"I and the NI industry had argued strongly for allocation based on the existing system of fixed quota allocation units as this would have delivered the greatest gain in additional quota for Northern Ireland.\n\"Our industry fishes not just in the Irish Sea but all round the UK and any element of geographical zonal attachment in the apportionment calculation works to our disadvantage. I will continue to press for a fair share of additional fishing quota for 2022 and beyond.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,United States,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "AstraZeneca has updated the efficacy result of its coronavirus vaccine trial in the US, after health officials insisted they wanted to include the latest information. \nThe Anglo-Swedish firm has now adjusted the efficacy rate of its vaccine from 79% to 76%.\nFurther data from the US trial showed efficacy among the over 65s rose from 80% to 85%. \nAstraZeneca said it now looked forward to getting US regulatory approval.\nThe company said the trial results confirm the vaccine \"is highly effective in adults\" and it remains 100% effective at preventing severe cases of the disease.\nThe US trials of the AstraZeneca jab had involved more than 32,000 volunteers, mostly in America, but also in Chile and Peru.\nIn the results announced on Monday, the company said the vaccine was found to be 79% effective. But the next day, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said it had been informed by data and safety officials monitoring the trial that information may have been used that provided an \"incomplete view of the efficacy data\".\nDr Anthony Fauci, the White House's Chief Medical Advisor, then warned reporters the firm would \"likely come out with a modified statement\".\nAstraZeneca's revised results now incorporate for the latest data from the trials.  \nAfter the initial release of data the company received a highly unusual public rebuke from independent scientists overseeing the trial, who said the company may have given \"outdated information\" that gave an \"incomplete view\" of the vaccine's effectiveness. \nIt is now clear that the numbers have not moved by much and it begs the question why such a row over data was not conducted in private. AstraZeneca has risked reputational damage as a result of the public ticking off and senior figures are privately dismayed by the row.\nSo why didn't AstraZeneca simply wait? I'm told that the company felt a duty to publish results on Monday as soon as the agreed threshold of cases had been passed.  A key reason was that there was a specific analysis showing there were no safety issues regarding blood clots. Given that a few EU countries are still not using the vaccine because of concerns over clots, this information would provide reassurance.  \nThis is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, over dosing, efficacy in the elderly, clots and supplies to the EU.  \nThe key point to remember is that this is a highly effective vaccine with a strong safety record. Regulators in the UK and EU have said its benefits far outweigh any side effects.  \nWhile other companies are set to make billions from their Covid vaccines, AstraZeneca is producing theirs at cost throughout the pandemic.  \nUnlike Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines, the AstraZeneca jab can be stored at fridge temperature, and it will play a vital role in immunisation in low and middle income countries.  \n\"We look forward to filing our regulatory submission for Emergency Use Authorization in the US and preparing for the rollout of millions of doses across America,\" Mene Pangalos, an executive vice president at AstraZeneca, said on Thursday.\nThe US had ordered 300 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine when it emerged as a frontrunner in the global race to immunise people against Covid-19.\nBut delays and controversies have seen three other vaccines beat it to a US rollout."

Despite concerns about coronavirus, health officials from the CDC have said these facilities can open at 100% capacity."

There's a handful of broken branches.\n\"There was a strong smell of fuel when I first arrived but that's gone now.\"\nTina Searle, who lives on a farm near St Martin, said: \"I thought it was a bit low but I just thought they're doing a manoeuvre or something. \n\"Then a few minutes later I saw the emergency service vehicles screaming down.\n\"My heart skipped a few beats when I read the news.

I heard a clunking sound. It flew on over our fields and then there was a loud crack and we saw two pilots ejecting.\n\"I watched as their parachutes opened.\n\"I then saw the plane bank left and over the top of a hill before hearing a very loud bang.

      "text": "European countries must not turn on each other amid growing tensions over Covid vaccine supplies, the president of the EU Parliament has said.\nThe call for unity comes as EU leaders hold virtual talks to discuss supplies and improving distribution across the bloc's 27 member states.\nSome countries have complained that doses have not been distributed fairly.\nThe meeting on Thursday will also see EU leaders decide whether to approve proposals to toughen export controls.\nSuch controls could affect supply to the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned against imposing \"blockades\".\nEuropean Commission head Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that the summit would \"ensure that Europeans get their fair share of vaccines\". She also said the EU had exported some 77 million doses to 33 countries since December, making the bloc the world's largest vaccine exporter.\nSome EU states, led by Austria, are calling for a revision in the bloc's distribution method after failing to obtain enough doses earlier this year.\n\"There is no sense in us turning on each other, just as there is no sense in thinking that others are doing much better,\" European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said at a press conference on Thursday. \n\"The more unity we show, the more trust we will inspire,\" he added. \"Salvation lies in working together.\"\nVaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. The company has denied that it is failing to honour its contract.\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel is hosting the video conference with EU leaders, as tensions rise over how to distribute doses among member states.\nAustria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is heading a campaign with five Eastern European nations to address what they say has been an uneven distribution of vaccines.\n\"If no solution is found here it could cause damage to the European Union the likes of which we have not seen in a long time,\" Mr Kurz said ahead of the summit.\nThe EU is also divided over plans to introduce new export controls on vaccines in an effort to boost its own supply.\nSome member states fear the controls would disrupt global supply chains and damage already strained relations with the UK after Brexit, the BBC's Katya Adler says.\nThe proposals are most likely to affect vaccine-exporting countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US.\nWhen considering whether to limit exports, the EU would consider the state of the pandemic in that country, its vaccination rate, and whether the country is itself exporting vaccines.\nThere would, however, be no outright export bans.\nA site in Belgium produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and another in the Netherlands is expected to increase supplies of the jab in the EU. \nOn Thursday, an EU official told the AFP news agency that 21 million vaccines had been sent from the bloc to the UK but none had been sent the other way.\nA draft of the summit's conclusions, seen by various news media including AFP and Reuters, reportedly says EU leaders will stress \"the importance of ... export authorisations\" while emphasising that vaccine producers must respect agreed delivery deadlines. \nAhead of Thursday's meeting, the former president of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker urged the bloc to avoid a \"stupid vaccine war\" with the UK.\n\"This cannot be dealt with in a war atmosphere,\" he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme. \"We are not in war, and we are not enemies.\"\nHe added that threats of export bans could cause \"major reputational damage\" to the EU.\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for the EU to boost its capacity for vaccine production.\n\"We can see clearly that British facilities are producing for Great Britain,\" she said. \"The United States isn't exporting, and therefore we are dependent upon what can be produced in Europe.\"\nMrs Merkel also defended the EU's decision to procure coronavirus vaccines jointly, before warning that the impact of the pandemic could go \"far beyond this year\".\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron expressed frustration at the slow pace of much of Europe's vaccine rollout. \"We didn't shoot for the stars,\" he told the Greek television channel ERT before the summit. \"We were wrong to lack ambition.\"\nIn another development, Denmark suspended its use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab by a further three weeks and said it was still looking at a possible link to blood clots. \nEurope's medicines regulator declared that the jab was \"safe and effective\" last week, and is convening a group of experts to explore the issue further on Monday. There is no evidence that the jab is connected to the reports of clots.\nOn the eve of this meeting, a ghost of summits past visited with a warning. \nJean-Claude Junker's concern that the EU's reputation could be damaged by threatening export bans is shared, in part, by some member states. The Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland and Belgium are worried about the impact on supply chains. \nItaly - which has already blocked a consignment of AstraZeneca doses - and France believe tougher action is needed to ensure the EU gets its fair share. \nThere are also smaller divisions over the distribution of the jabs the EU has actually managed to get hold of. Austria is leading a handful of disgruntled Eastern European nations who want a bigger portion. \nThe way the European Commission unveiled its proposals for stricter controls on exports has meant there has been little time for members to consider them. So, while we may see some degree of unity in a non-specific joint statement, clear agreement on the best and quickest way to tackle the EU's vaccination crisis does not seem imminent. \nA third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe.\nEU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000.\nYet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US.\nSpeaking earlier this week, Mrs Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to \"a new pandemic\".\n\"The situation is serious,\" she said. \"Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again.\"\nLockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there is particular concern over eastern EU states.\nPoland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged."

      "text": "India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, foreign ministry sources have told the BBC.\nThey said rising cases meant domestic demand was expected to pick up in the coming weeks, and so the doses were needed for India's own rollout.\nThe move - described as a \"temporary squeeze\" by officials - is expected to affect supplies until the end of April.\nSome 190 countries under the Covax scheme are likely to be affected.\nThe scheme, which is led by the World Health Organization (WHO), aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations.\nIndia's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India (SII), has delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to several countries in recent days, including the UK and Brazil. \nIndia has exported more than 60 million vaccine doses to 76 countries so far, with the majority of these being the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nThe decision comes as India faces a surge in coronavirus cases. On Wednesday it recorded its sharpest daily rise this year, with more than 47,000 new cases and 275 deaths.\nIt is opening up vaccinations for those over the age of 45 from 1 April, and officials expect demand for vaccinations to increase.\n\"[The export hold] is a temporary measure. Domestic demand will have to take precedence,\" one foreign ministry source told the BBC's Soutik Biswas.\nThey said there was likely to be a squeeze on vaccine supplies until April, but the situation could ease come May when at least one additional vaccine is expected to be given emergency approval.\nThere have been no exports from India since Thursday, according to the foreign ministry's website.\n\"Everything else has taken a backseat, for the time being at least,\" one source at the ministry told Reuters news agency. \"No exports, nothing [until] the India situation stabilises.\"\nThere has been no official comment from the government or the SII on the decision.\nThe SII - the world's largest vaccine manufacturer - has already delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Morocco.\nLast week, the BBC reported that a delivery of five million doses had been held up by four weeks.\n\"We will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India,\" an SII spokesperson said at the time.\nThe SII has said it will produce one billion doses this year for low- and middle-income countries.\nAnd in January, it said it could turn out between 60 and 70 million vaccine doses a month. This figure included the AstraZeneca vaccine as well as the US-developed Novavax jab, which is not yet licensed for use in India.\nThat month, the SII also told the BBC that it was aiming to boost its monthly production to 100 million doses from March. However, a recent check revealed production was still at 60 to 70 million doses and had not increased.\nThe Indian government began its vaccination programme on 16 January, and so far has inoculated over 47 million people amid fears of a possible second wave.\nThe authorities are hoping to administer 600 million doses within seven months - about 85 million doses a month."

Final choices will be determined by who registered first. \nTravellers will be tested before and after their trip. If anyone develops Covid during the trip they will have to quarantine at a Greek Covid hotel but their costs will be covered by the tour company.\nSunweb says it has drawn up safety guidelines for the entire trip, which have been approved by the Dutch public health agency, the RIVM.\nThe visitors will be given exclusive use of a hotel on Rhodes, with staff the only other people there. They will have the use of the hotel's swimming pools and restaurants but will not be allowed to go out on to the beach.\nCorina Gouderjaan, 51, told Dutch broadcaster RTL Nieuws why she had applied for a ticket: \"First I got corona and got very sick. Then I lost my job. So now what? I'm looking forward to doing absolutely nothing at a resort and recovering from this turbulent year.\""

      "text": "The electorate have now cast their votes to elect members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). \nThe poll is now held every five years, and this will be the sixth election in its history.\nIt was established in 1999 to debate issues and make laws for Scotland.\nA total of 129 MSPs are elected to the Parliament - often referred to as Holyrood, after the area of Edinburgh where the parliament building stands.\nThey debate and pass laws on devolved issues - these include most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as education, health and transport. \nSCOTLAND ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nHolyrood also has control over some taxes, most notably income tax, and some areas of the welfare system.\nThe UK Parliament at Westminster can pass laws on reserved matters, which are generally those with a UK-wide or international impact - such as defence, foreign policy and immigration.\nAnyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election and have not been legally excluded from voting (for example because they are serving a prison sentence of longer than 12 months).\nThey must also be a British or Irish citizen or a citizen of another country living in Scotland who has permission to enter or stay in the UK, or who does not need permission.\nPeople have two votes - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot.\nThere are 73 Constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency.  \nIn the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. \nThere are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are: \nThis means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region.\nThe Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. \nIt is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance.\nIn previous elections, votes were counted as soon as the polls closed at 22:00, with the results being announced overnight. \nThe pandemic means that the votes in this election will not start to be counted until the morning after, with a final result not expected until the weekend of 8/9 May.\nThe SNP, led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, lost its overall majority in the 2016 election, but continued in power after forming a minority government.\nThe Scottish Conservatives - led by Ruth Davidson - finished second after overtaking Scottish Labour for the first time, while the Scottish Greens were fourth - ahead of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. \nThe SNP has won every Scottish Parliament election since 2007.\nThe election campaign is likely to be dominated by the question of whether there should be another referendum on Scottish independence. \nThe SNP has already said it wants to hold a vote once the Covid pandemic ends - if the election returns another pro-independence majority.\nThe Scottish Greens also back independence, but the Scottish Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats are all opposed and say the country's focus should be on recovering from the pandemic rather than the constitution.\nHealth, education, the environment and the economy are among the other important issues for voters, and all are likely to feature prominently during the campaign.\nSocial distancing rules mean the campaign will look and feel very different to normal.\nParty campaigners will not be able to knock on doors, for example, and there will be no large gatherings for set-piece events such as TV debates or manifesto launches. \nMuch of the campaign is likely to play out online instead, with BBC Scotland planning to hold two virtual debates. \nIt is also expected that more people than ever before will choose to vote by post rather than going to a polling place. \nThere are three ways to vote:\nThe deadline to register to vote is Monday 19 April.\nThe deadline to register for a postal vote is 6 April.\nThe deadline to register for a proxy vote is 27 April.\nYou can register to vote online.\nUse our concise manifesto guide to compare where the parties stand on key issues like Covid-19, independence and the environment."

      "text": "Santander has announced plans to close 111 branches across the country due to the shift to mobile and online banking.\nThe bank said it had taken the decision because fewer customers were choosing to bank in branch.\nAbout 840 staff will be affected by the closures, although Santander promised to try to find them other jobs within the business.\nSantander said the reduction in branch visits was a long-term trend that had been accelerated by the pandemic.\n\"Branch usage by customers has fallen considerably over recent years so we have made the difficult decision to consolidate our presence in areas where we have multiple branches relatively close together,\" said Adam Bishop, head of branches at Santander.\nThe move will reduce Santander's High Street presence to 452 branches.\nBut the bank said the majority of closing branches were within three miles of another Santander branch. The furthest is five miles, it said.\n\"All are within half a mile of at least two free-to-use ATMs and one mile of the nearest Post Office,\" it added.\nIn the two years before the beginning of the pandemic, the number of transactions handled in branches fell by a third, the bank said. Last year, it declined by a further 50%.\nMeanwhile, mobile and online transactions have grown 20% each year with more than two-thirds of transactions now completed without customers visiting a branch. \nThe bank also plans to move its headquarters from London to Milton Keynes and reduce the amount of space it rents in the capital.\nIt will close offices in Bootle, Newcastle, London and Manchester before the end of the year.\nThe 5,000 office staff affected will be asked to work from home more often or travel in to one of its six remaining offices in Belfast, Bradford, Glasgow, London and Sheffield, as well as its new headquarters.\n\"The pandemic has accelerated the existing trend towards greater flexible working, and our colleagues have told us this has brought significant benefits for many of them,\" Santander's UK boss Nathan Bostock said.\n\"At the same time, physical spaces remain very important and our sites around the UK will provide our colleagues with first-class facilities fit for the future.\"\nThe decision to reduce the number of offices it rents and ask staff to work from home more often follows an announcement from building society Nationwide which told its 13,000 office staff that they could choose where they work.\nUnder the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two."

      "tags": "Companies,Flexible working,Nationwide Building Society",
      "text": "Nationwide is to allow 13,000 office staff to choose where they work under a new flexibility scheme.\nThe UK's biggest building society said its \"work anywhere\" plan would allow employees more control of their lives.\nUnder the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two.\nOther UK staff may be able to work from their local High Street branch if they prefer, rather than travel to offices. \nIn a Nationwide survey of staff, 57% said they wanted to work from home full-time after lockdown ends. More than a third - 36% - said they preferred a mix of home and office-based work.\nJoe Garner, chief executive of Nationwide, said: \"The last year has taught many of us that 'how' we do our jobs is much more important than 'where' we do them from.\n\"We are putting our employees in control of where they work from, inviting them to 'locate for their day' depending on what they need to achieve.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Garner said that research suggested staff made better decisions when working from home.\n\"A third of our people are saying they have an even greater consideration of the human impact of their decisions,\" he said.\n\"And perhaps that's not surprising because people are in their home environment, they're seeing other people's children on the screen - [as well as] cats, dogs, etc.\"\nNevertheless, he said the office would still play an important role, but people would not be told how often they have to travel into work.\n\"People do want to go,\" he said. \"They just don't want to be compelled to go every day.\"\nThe move towards flexible working will see a change to the configuration of offices, with more collaboration spaces and fewer meeting rooms, as well as introducing quiet areas and designated walking and cycling routes.\nThe building society said that although its branch-based staff were less able to work flexibly, it is looking at ways to \"help them better manage their working day around their home lives\".\nNationwide, which employs 18,000 staff, is also trialling an initiative in five sites where traditional office-based employees can work alongside branch colleagues.\nThe move comes as companies across the UK consider how to tackle the issue of remote versus office working once lockdown ends, with many backing a hybrid model.\nOn Thursday, Santander announced plans to reduce the amount of office space it rents in London and move its headquarters from the capital to Milton Keynes. It will close a number of its offices across the country and ask staff to work from home more often or travel in to one of its remaining offices.\nThe bank also said it would close 111 branches.\nNationwide had already indicated it would not force people to return to the office if they have been successfully able to work from home during the pandemic.\nOil giant BP has told office-based staff they can spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease.\nBanks HSBC and Lloyds are among many other companies looking into split working arrangements. And British Airways is considering the sell-off of its huge headquarters at Heathrow Airport as part of a move to flexible arrangements for about 2,000 staff.\nEarlier this month the boss of IWG, which provides office space across the world, told the BBC he expected hybrid working \"to become the norm\" for many companies.\nMark Dixon said: \"It works for companies, because it's a lot cheaper. It's also much, much better for the environment.\"\nNationwide's survey of staff found that almost all of its workers believed they were at least as good at prioritising decisions in the interests of customers when working from home, while three-in-10 said they were better.\nNationwide added: \"People won't be forced to return to an office, but anyone who needs a desk in an office can have one - for whatever reason.\n\"Our offices will become hubs where teams can meet for creativity, social connection and collaboration.\"\nIn a separate report compiled with Ipsos Mori, Nationwide found that 90% of those working from home wanted to continue doing so at least one day a week, with 60% saying it gave them a better work-life balance.\nBut the report - which sought views from a raft of major organisations including American Express, Visa, B&Q owner Kingfisher and NatWest Group - also suggested that 43% of remote workers needed some face-to-face time with colleagues to do their job effectively.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Apps,NHS,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "As the UK gets closer to easing its coronavirus lockdowns, attention is turning to how we might safely mix again and what role tech might play.\nAnd despite previous denials that a \"Covid passport\" app was being considered, it is now on the agenda.\nAfter all the hoo-ha and costs involved in creating the contact-tracing apps last year, you might think that a very brave decision.\nBut earlier this week The Times reported that the facility would be built into the existing NHS app used to access health services in England.\nIt is distinct from the NHS Covid-19 app used by England and Wales to warn people if they might have recently been infected, and fewer people have downloaded it.\nBut according to Google's own figures, it has been installed on more than one million Android devices (Apple does not share stats for iOS), which represents a decent start.\nOfficially, Downing Street says the matter is still under review and it does not want to pre-empt anything by speculating on the subject.\nBut it's clear there would be several benefits.\nFirstly, the NHS app, which serves patients in England only, already links up to users' GP services to give smartphone owners access to their medical records.\nIn fact, it can already provide a record of whether some people have been given one of the coronavirus jabs, if the GP surgeries involved have shared the information.\n(Confusingly, this sometimes appears under the Medicines tab rather than the Immunisations one if you've had an injection and want to check yourself).\nSo health chiefs would not need to build new IT infrastructure to get at the information.\nSecondly, the app has already tackled many of the security issues involved.\nTo set it up you must provide your NHS number, email address, phone number and then upload either an image of your passport or driving licence.\nThe smartphone then takes a scan of your face to check it matches the characteristics on the image on your official identification.\nAnd then, as a supplement to the automated checks, a human review takes place before you are granted access.\nHowever, there are still issues to be addressed.\nPeople would need to get to the certificate without having to hunt around several menus - possibly via a button at the bottom of the screen.\nAnd then the information would have to be presented in a format that someone else could verify quickly and easily.\nAnother health pass app points the way to how that might be done.\nTested.me displays a scannable barcode over an image of the user's face to provide employers with a means of keeping track of the health status of their staff.\nOf course, if the NHS app adopts a similar scheme, it will require other software to be developed so that establishments can verify a person's barcode when they present it.\nAnd there are further hurdles to overcome to prevent people who have yet to be vaccinated from simply passing off a screenshot of someone else's code, with their own face edited in, to access a venue.\nThat presupposes that it would be acceptable for businesses and other organisations to deny people access to a venue or their workplace if they have not been vaccinated.\nAnd one must bear in mind that while vaccines reduce the risk of someone getting seriously ill from at least some of the Covid-19 variants, it is still unknown how much impact they will have on people becoming infected and passing the virus on.\nSo the point of having such an app might only be to demonstrate that you would be unlikely to get seriously ill by entering an area, rather than proving you do not pose a threat to others.\nA further consideration is that these \"passports\" would probably not be used for travel abroad.\nThe World Health Organization is exploring what specifications an international scheme would require to work across borders and support different countries' immunisation programmes. \nIt already oversees an International Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate.\nAnd the requirements of such a scheme might be different from those used by the NHS app.\nOne last issue is whether the government would allow third-party apps to tap into its system to offer specialised vaccine certificates of their own. \nThese would be customised for use in certain workplaces or leisure activities, where the details could be stored alongside ticketing or other relevant non-health-related data.\nIdentity-check technology provider iProov, whose face-scanning software is already integrated into the NHS app, is among those keen to do this.\nIts chief executive, Andrew Bud, pointed out that the NHS already had a mechanism to allow private apps to tap into GP records subject to strict security requirements.\nBut whether ministers would want to complicate matters by allowing there to be multiple ways to present a vaccine passport is another matter.\nIn any case, speaking to sources within NHSX - the division likely to be responsible for any digital certificate involving the NHS app in England - one thing becomes apparent: discussions about what would be involved are at a very early stage. \nAnd that means it will be many months before the idea of presenting an app to door staff to prove you have been jabbed has any chance of becoming a reality."

      "text": "Victims of IRA bombs have expressed anger at news the UK government cannot use frozen Libyan assets for compensation.\nThe father of a 12-year-old boy killed in the 1993 Warrington bomb has also questioned the government's rejection of calls to publish a report commissioned to examine the issue. \nColin Parry's son Tim died in 1993 alongside three-year-old Jonathan Ball.\nLibyan-supplied Semtex explosive was thought to have been used. \nSpeaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Parry said the public \"may never know\" the reasons behind the government's refusal to compensate the victims of Libyan-backed terrorism. \n\"It's not as if it's a financial block - it's clearly a political decision,\" he said. \n\"It's a decision I can only imagine is based on the multi-layered complexity when it comes to historical issues related to Northern Ireland terrorism.\nThe government has said it would be against international law to use some \u00a312bn in frozen Libyan assets to compensate victims.\nOn Wednesday, it emerged that a report examining compensation options, completed last year by government investigator William Shawcross, will not be published. \nMr Parry asked why William Shawcross was given the remit to look into the issue \"if [the government] weren't prepared to act upon what he might say\".\n\"It's easily resolved through seized Libyan assets, but for reasons we may never know, the government is sitting on this report. I can only conclude that the government fears it will open up all sorts of matters which have been buried deep for some time now.\"\nMervyn Lewers, from Londonderry, who lost his legs following an under-car booby-trap bombing in 1988, said the government \"wants all victims to die off and go away\".\nHe said his life is \"a continuing battle\".\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme: \"It's 33 years since I was injured and I'm heading again to Musgrave Hospital today.\" \nCompensation would have \"meant a lot\", he said, as he has to pay someone to assist with \"ordinary things around the house\". \nFormer Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime supplied large amounts of weapons and explosives to the IRA during the Troubles.\nMr Lewers questioned why William Shawcross, who was appointed by the government to look into the issue of compensation, met representatives of Sinn F\u00e9in, but not victims, before filing his report.\n\"It's public knowledge that members of Sinn F\u00e9in were convicted terrorists. For me, it's wrong.\"\nMr Shawcross, who appeared before the NI Affairs Committee on Wednesday, said he could not disclose details of his own report. \nIn a written statement to parliament on Tuesday, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly said the \"internal scoping report\" was commissioned to provide advice to ministers and draws on \"private and confidential conversations\". \nHe said the \"frozen assets may not be seized by the UK government\".\nHe also ruled out using public funds to pay compensation to victims and then recouping the money from the Libyan government.\nHe said the responsibility for providing compensation lies with the Libyan state and the government had urged the authorities at the \"highest level\" to engage with UK victims.\nUnionist peer Lord Empey described the refusal to use the assets to compensate victims as \"a very murky business\".\n\"Other countries - the United States, France and Germany - all of them have got compensation for their victims. The United Kingdom hasn't even asked for it. So there's something wrong.\"\nKenny Donaldson, of Innocent Victims United, said: \"For two years the UK government has been responsible for heaping further pain upon those already treated so shamefully. \n\"The Shawcross Report can't even be described as a 'whitewash' because it continues to be held back from victims, the full contents remain hidden.\""

      "tags": "Johnny Depp,High Court ,Amber Heard",
      "text": "Johnny Depp has been refused permission to appeal against a High Court ruling that he assaulted his ex-wife Amber Heard.\nLast year, the US actor lost his libel case against the publisher of The Sun over an article that labelled him a \"wife beater\".\nMr Depp asked the Court of Appeal for permission to challenge the ruling.\nBut on Thursday, a judge refused his application and said his appeal had \"no real prospect of success\".\nThe Sun's article, published in April 2018, was the focus of a three-week trial in July last year.\nThe 57-year-old sued News Group Newspapers (NGN) - the publisher of The Sun - over the accusation that he was violent towards Ms Heard, but the newspaper maintained its article was accurate.\nThe Hollywood star's libel claim was dismissed by Mr Justice Nicol, who found The Sun's accusation to be \"substantially true\" and ruled in the publisher's favour.\nThe judge found Mr Depp, 57, had assaulted Ms Heard, 34, on a dozen occasions and put her in \"fear for her life\" three times.\nThe verdict was not made public until November.\nDays after the ruling was announced, Mr Depp announced he had been asked by Warner Brothers to resign from his role in the Harry Potter spin-off franchise Fantastic Beasts.\nThe US actor asked the Court of Appeal to grant permission for him to challenge the High Court's ruling, with the aim of having its findings overturned and a retrial ordered.\nAt a hearing last week, Mr Depp's lawyers asked the court to consider fresh evidence relating to what they said was Ms Heard's claim that she gave her $7m (\u00a35.5m) divorce settlement to charity.\nMr Depp's barrister Andrew Caldecott QC told the court that claim was a \"calculated and manipulative lie\".\nAfter the couple divorced in 2016, Ms Heard said she would split the $7m between the Children's Hospital Los Angeles and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\nBut Mr Caldecott said the hospital wrote to Mr Depp's business adviser in 2019 to say Ms Heard had not made \"any payments\".\nThe court heard $100,000 (\u00a372,000) was donated to the hospital and $450,000 (\u00a3322,000) to the ACLU, but Ms Heard claimed she made a further $500,000 (\u00a3358,000) donation to the second charity anonymously.\nMs Heard's legal team has previously said: \"Amber has already been responsible for seven figures in donations to charitable causes and intends to continue to contribute and eventually fulfil her pledge.\"\nBut Adam Wolanski QC, representing The Sun's publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN), said the new evidence Mr Depp wanted to rely on \"would not have had any impact\" on the result of the libel trial.\nOn Thursday, the court refused permission for Mr Depp to appeal.\nSpeaking at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Lord Justice Underhill said: \"We refuse Mr Depp's application to admit further evidence in support of his proposed appeal and we conclude that the appeal has no real prospect of success and that there is no other compelling reason for it to be heard.\n\"We accordingly refuse permission to appeal.\" \nIn a statement after the ruling, a spokeswoman for The Sun said: \"The Sun had every confidence that this leave to appeal application would not be granted and are pleased with today's decision.\n\"The case had a full, fair and proper hearing, and today's decision vindicates the courageous evidence that Amber Heard gave to the court about domestic abuse, despite repeated attempts to undermine and silence her by the perpetrator.\"\nA spokeswoman for Amber Heard said in a statement: \"We are pleased - but by no means surprised - by the court's denial of Mr Depp's application for appeal. The evidence presented in the UK case was overwhelming and undeniable.\"\nShe added: \"Mr Depp's claim of new and important evidence was nothing more than a press strategy, and has been soundly rejected by the court.\"\nIn a statement, Mr Depp's solicitor Joelle Rich from the law firm Schillings said: \"The evidence presented at last week's hearing further demonstrates that there are clear and objective reasons to seriously question the decision reached in the UK court.\n\"Mr Depp looks forward to presenting the complete, irrefutable evidence of the truth in the US libel case against Ms Heard, where she will have to provide full disclosure.\" \nWhile Thursday's ruling effectively brings to an end Mr Depp's UK court case, the actor is embroiled in a separate libel battle in the US. \nHe is suing Ms Heard personally over a 2018 Washington Post opinion piece in which she claimed to be a victim of domestic abuse, but did not mention the actor by name.\nMr Depp's $50m (\u00a335m) US case against Ms Heard was recently delayed until April 2022."

      "text": "Nationwide is to allow 13,000 office staff to choose where they work under a new flexibility scheme.\nThe UK's biggest building society said its \"work anywhere\" plan would allow employees more control of their lives.\nUnder the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two.\nOther UK staff may be able to work from their local High Street branch if they prefer, rather than travel to offices. \nIn a Nationwide survey of staff, 57% said they wanted to work from home full-time after lockdown ends. More than a third - 36% - said they preferred a mix of home and office-based work.\nJoe Garner, chief executive of Nationwide, said: \"The last year has taught many of us that 'how' we do our jobs is much more important than 'where' we do them from.\n\"We are putting our employees in control of where they work from, inviting them to 'locate for their day' depending on what they need to achieve.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Garner said that research suggested staff made better decisions when working from home.\n\"A third of our people are saying they have an even greater consideration of the human impact of their decisions,\" he said.\n\"And perhaps that's not surprising because people are in their home environment, they're seeing other people's children on the screen - [as well as] cats, dogs, etc.\"\nNevertheless, he said the office would still play an important role, but people would not be told how often they have to travel into work.\n\"People do want to go,\" he said. \"They just don't want to be compelled to go every day.\"\nThe move towards flexible working will see a change to the configuration of offices, with more collaboration spaces and fewer meeting rooms, as well as introducing quiet areas and designated walking and cycling routes.\nThe building society said that although its branch-based staff were less able to work flexibly, it is looking at ways to \"help them better manage their working day around their home lives\".\nNationwide, which employs 18,000 staff, is also trialling an initiative in five sites where traditional office-based employees can work alongside branch colleagues.\nThe move comes as companies across the UK consider how to tackle the issue of remote versus office working once lockdown ends, with many backing a hybrid model.\nOn Thursday, Santander announced plans to reduce the amount of office space it rents in London and move its headquarters from the capital to Milton Keynes. It will close a number of its offices across the country and ask staff to work from home more often or travel in to one of its remaining offices.\nThe bank also said it would close 111 branches.\nNationwide had already indicated it would not force people to return to the office if they have been successfully able to work from home during the pandemic.\nOil giant BP has told office-based staff they can spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease.\nBanks HSBC and Lloyds are among many other companies looking into split working arrangements. And British Airways is considering the sell-off of its huge headquarters at Heathrow Airport as part of a move to flexible arrangements for about 2,000 staff.\nEarlier this month the boss of IWG, which provides office space across the world, told the BBC he expected hybrid working \"to become the norm\" for many companies.\nMark Dixon said: \"It works for companies, because it's a lot cheaper. It's also much, much better for the environment.\"\nNationwide's survey of staff found that almost all of its workers believed they were at least as good at prioritising decisions in the interests of customers when working from home, while three-in-10 said they were better.\nNationwide added: \"People won't be forced to return to an office, but anyone who needs a desk in an office can have one - for whatever reason.\n\"Our offices will become hubs where teams can meet for creativity, social connection and collaboration.\"\nIn a separate report compiled with Ipsos Mori, Nationwide found that 90% of those working from home wanted to continue doing so at least one day a week, with 60% saying it gave them a better work-life balance.\nBut the report - which sought views from a raft of major organisations including American Express, Visa, B&Q owner Kingfisher and NatWest Group - also suggested that 43% of remote workers needed some face-to-face time with colleagues to do their job effectively.

      "title": "Coronavirus: EU and UK try to end row with 'win-win' on vaccines",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The UK and the European Union have said they are working together to improve their relationship, after weeks of tensions over Covid vaccine supplies.\nIn a joint statement, they said they wanted to \"create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all\".\nThe European Commission earlier proposed tougher export controls on vaccines, amid tensions over supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson warned that \"blockades\" were not \"sensible\".\nThe joint UK-EU statement said that \"openness and global co-operation\" would be key to tackling the pandemic.\n\"We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,\" it said. \"We will continue our discussions.\"\nBut there was little harmony earlier on Wednesday when the Commission announced plans for all vaccine shipments to be assessed on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and exports. The proposals, which will be put before EU leaders on Thursday, are seen as focused on the UK and US in particular.\nThe tone of the EU-UK statement was positive, but actual progress between the two sides was described to me by an EU diplomat as \"slow, cumbersome and difficult\". On both sides. \nThat doesn't mean impossible, but at their summit on Thursday, some EU leaders - along with the European Commission - will still be pushing for tougher controls on vaccine exports. And they could hit the UK. \nEU insiders say they had hoped never to use the controls. They say they want them as a means of exerting pressure on vaccine companies and on countries with vaccine production sites that are not exporting to the EU. \nWith a third wave of the pandemic hitting much of mainland Europe, EU leaders are coming under increasing pressure to show voters they are taking action to ramp up both the supply of jabs and their vaccine rollout, on both of which they are trailing behind the UK.\nEU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides rejected a suggestion that the aim was to punish the UK. \"We're dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries,\" she said.\nAsked whether the UK might retaliate, Mr Johnson told MPs he did not believe \"that blockades of either vaccines or of medicines, of ingredients for vaccines\" would be \"sensible\". Companies might draw conclusions about future investments \"in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed\", he added.\nMeanwhile, in other developments:\nThe tougher export controls are most like to affect countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. \nThe key criteria for the proposed regulations are \"reciprocity\" and \"proportionality\":\nThere will be no outright export bans, which are opposed by countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. \nVaccine manufacturers would be assessed to see if they were fulfilling their contract with the EU, although no specific algorithm is planned.\nIn an interview with the BBC, the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton insisted the bloc's issues were with AstraZeneca and not the UK government. \"I know that there's some tension... but as long as we have transparency, I think [relations] will be able to be normalised,\" he said.\nHe said if AstraZeneca had provided the agreed 120 million doses to the EU, member states would have been at the same rate of vaccination as the UK: \"We have been heavily penalised and we just want to understand why\". \nAstraZeneca denies that it is failing to honour its contract with the EU.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We are all fighting the same pandemic. Vaccines are an international operation; they are produced by collaboration by great scientists around the world. And we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout.\"\nLast week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen complained that the EU had exported more than 10 million doses to the UK, but the UK had so far exported none in return.\nHer colleagues added that this had to be seen in the context of the EU being both a global Covid hotspot and also the biggest exporter of vaccines. Since the end of January, EU countries have exported 43 million doses of vaccine to 33 countries not subject to export authorisation, they say.\nUK sources insist vital components are being sent to the continent, for example for the Pfizer vaccine, and they have emphasised the UK's role in investing early in vaccine development, BBC correspondent Nick Beake reports."

      "text": "MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers for another six months.\nThey backed the health secretary's call to renew \"essential\" emergency rules to deal with the pandemic as England moves out of lockdown. \nBut some Conservatives voted against the measures saying they were \"out of step\" with the roadmap for lifting restrictions. \nMinisters say the powers will stay in place \"only as long as necessary\". \nThe Coronavirus Act came in to force in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic with ministers pledging to use the measures \"when strictly necessary\".\nThe law gave the government wide-ranging powers unlike others seen before - from shutting down pubs, through to detaining individuals deemed at risk as part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus.\nMPs voted by 484 to 76 to extend it - 36 Conservative MPs rebelled, by opposing the legislation. Twenty-one Labour MPs also voted against it. \nMPs agreed to extend it until the end of September as well as voting on England's roadmap out of lockdown and the continuation of virtual proceedings in the Commons. \nOpening the debate ahead of the vote, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the legislation had been a \"crucial part\" of the government's response to coronavirus, enabling ministers to bring forward measures such as furlough and statutory sick pay for those self-isolating.\nBut he said 12 provisions in the legislation were no longer needed because of progress that had been made in dealing with the virus.\nThese include easing some responsibilities on the social care sector, laws governing the retention of biometric data for health and security purposes, and obligations on businesses that work in the food supply chain. \nMr Hancock acknowledged some people were concerned about the powers contained in the act.\nHe said: \"Although this act remains essential and there are elements of it which we are seeking the renewal of, we have always said we will only retain powers as long as they are necessary.\"\nBut the chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, Sir Graham Brady, said he would vote against because \"it is important we make the case for a return to normality and trusting people with their own lives\".\nHe said: \"These powers were given by Parliament to government last March as a very temporary set of extreme emergency measures. Nobody then envisaged that they would still be in place a year later, still be in use 18 months on. \n\"I think we need to be very cautious about the dangers of normalising what is actually a very extreme policy response.\"\nThe deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown sceptics, Conservative Steve Baker, said the vote was a \"rare opportunity\" for MPs to \"say no to a new way of life in a checkpoint society\".\nHe said he was reassured by the prime minister's comment at the Liaison Committee on Wednesday that \"anything that is redundant will go\".\nTonight's rebellion by 35 Conservatives won't trouble Boris Johnson - overall MPs backed the renewal of sweeping powers to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. \nMany of the Tories who voted against the government have been persistent critics of its approach to restrictions and lockdowns. \nFor them, it's about trust. \nReassurances from ministers about powers only being used when necessary in extreme circumstances don't cut it. \nThere is deep unease about the scope of these powers and the very fact they are available to the government, even if they're not being used. \nBut the pandemic has changed expectations of what governments can and should do in extreme circumstances. Freedoms considered sacrosanct have been suspended in the spirit of saving lives. \nThe public may have been willing to largely comply, but there are at least a few dozen MPs willing to argue the price society has paid has been too high. \nLabour backed the extension of the emergency powers but said its support was not offered \"with any enthusiasm\". \nThe shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \"Given the loss of life we have suffered and given the risks of mutations that could set us back, we must have zero tolerance to letting the virus rage unchecked.\n\"For that reason we do accept that restrictions have to stay in place and for that reason we support the renewal of the act and the public health regulations.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats also voted against the measures. \nOne of its MPs, Tim Farron, said the powers were \"an over-reach\" that the government \"does not need\" and he described them as a \"default knee-jerk attempt to seek draconian powers\" that he said \"fit in to a pattern\" of eroding civil liberties. \nA government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown.\nThe prime minister said there would be an update on the idea in April, and a review will report in June.\nThe leader of the Covid Recovery Group, Conservative Mark Harper, said the idea of vaccine certificates to enter pubs was \"unconscionable\" and raised \"practical, moral and ethical issues\".\n\"We've asked young people to do a lot over the last year and I think the least we can do is to get the economy open, so that their futures are not damaged any further,\" he said. \nSpeaking on a visit to west London, the prime minister rejected suggestions he was no longer concerned about protecting individual freedoms.\nHe said: \"The libertarian in me is also trying to protect individual's fundamental right to life and their ability to live their lives normally and the only way really to restore that for everybody, is for us to beat the disease.\n\"The best path to freedom is down the cautious but irreversible roadmap that we've set out.

Likewise, there's no law requiring club- and festival-goers to show their pass, if they choose not to.\nHowever, the government says it reserves the right to make showing the pass compulsory at a later date.\nYou will still have to self-isolate if you have Covid symptoms, test positive or are told to do so by NHS Test and Trace. \nIn pubs, cafes and restaurants:\nAt music venues/events:\nSome summer festivals are still planning to go ahead as planned, but others have been cancelled altogether, gone online, or been rescheduled.\nOrganisers of the Latitude (late July), Reading and Leeds (late August) festivals say they will \"sell to capacity\" and are not inclined to encourage those attending to wear masks.\nAll parts of Scotland will move to Covid-protection level zero, with a few changes:\nUnder-12s won't count towards group sizes or the number of households.\nThere will be a 400-person limit for indoor events, 1,000 for outdoor standing events and 2,000 for outdoor seated events.\nUntil 19 July, most areas of Scotland are in level 1 or 2. \nLevel two areas:\nLevel one areas:\nScotland is aiming to remove all major legal Covid restrictions by 9 August.\nRestrictions are due to be relaxed on 26 July (subject to approval on 22 July).\nIndoor gigs and concerts will be allowed without noise restrictions, as long as the audience stay in their allocated seats.\nSocial distancing rules will be removed for outdoor events and relaxed indoors.\nUnder current rules:\nAt the moment, up to six people from different households can meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants. \nPeople who do not live together, or are not in bubbles, should remain socially distanced, 2m (6ft) apart.\nBusiness owners are responsible for making their premises as safe as possible:\nThe maximum number of people allowed at outdoor \"regulated gatherings\" - such as festivals and concerts - is 4,000 standing and 10,000 seated. Capacity rules for indoor music and comedy venues have already relaxed a little.\nFrom 17 July, organised indoor events can take place for up to 1,000 seated and up to 200 standing.\nFrom 7 August, if conditions allow, there will be no legal limits on the number of people who can meet others in places like pubs and restaurants.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Hospitality industry,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It may only be possible to introduce a vaccine passports scheme once all adults have been offered a jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested.\nHe said no decisions had been made but there would be an update on the idea in April. A review will report in June.\nThere were \"difficult issues... moral complexities, ethical problems that need to be addressed\", the PM added.\nAny passport could also reflect a negative test result as well as whether someone was vaccinated or has immunity.\nOn Thursday afternoon, MPs voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers in England for another six months, with 484 in favour, and 76 against, giving a majority of 408. \nThe Coronavirus Act was introduced in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.\nMeanwhile, the UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the government's daily figures.\nToday's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure - but the number of Covid-related deaths has fallen by 32, compared with a week ago.\nThe latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine.\nMeanwhile, publicans have case doubt on a suggestion from Mr Johnson that pub-goers might have to prove their vaccination status when venues reopen.\nA government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown. \nMr Johnson said previous coronavirus infections could be a feature, if the certificates are adopted.\n\"There are three basic components. There's the vaccine, there's your immunity you might have had after you've had Covid, and there's testing - they are three things that could work together.\"\nHowever he added: \"No decisions have been taken at all. One thing I will make clear is none of this is obviously going to apply on April 12 when it will all be outdoors anyway.\" \nSpeaking on a visit to a nursery in west London, Mr Johnson said: \"There are some people who for medical reasons can't get a vaccination, pregnant women can't get a vaccination at the moment, you've got to be careful about how you do this.\n\"You might only be able to implement a thorough-going vaccination passport scheme even if you wanted such a thing in the context of when absolutely everybody had been offered a vaccine.\" \nIn the Commons, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who is leading the review, told MPs: \"A system that relied purely on vaccination would not be appropriate.\n\"What would be right was a system that ensured we could open up our economy to the maximum extent that takes into account both vaccine status but also of recent test status and indeed potentially also antibody status as well,\" he added.\nUnder government plans to ease the lockdown in England, pubs will be able to start serving customers indoors - with a size limit applied to groups - from 17 May at the earliest. \nThe idea of asking pub-goers to show a so-called vaccine passport or certificate was raised at Wednesday's House of Commons Liaison Committee hearing when Boris Johnson was asked whether they were \"compatible with a free society such as ours\".\nMr Johnson said the concept \"should not be totally alien to us\" - pointing out that doctors already have to have hepatitis B jabs - although he stressed such a move in future \"may be up to individual publicans\".\nA Downing Street source earlier said the review would include looking at how people's vaccination and testing status could be stored securely and displayed on a mobile phone, and the circumstances under which such a system could apply.\nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said \"all sorts of things were being considered\" and it was \"really a bit premature\" to speculate on details about how a possible vaccine passport would apply to pubs.\nThe boss of Young's pubs said requiring vaccine passports would be \"unworkable\", while Greene King and the City Pub Group also voiced their opposition to any such measure.\nThe chief executive of the Shepherd Neame pub chain said asking pub-goers to show vaccine passports was a \"fairly poorly thought out idea\" he would not be adopting.\nJonathan Neame told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's absolutely fine to exclude people where there is a situation of bad behaviour or drunkenness, and that's already enshrined in law.\n\"But if you're going to exclude people for what they are, or what they have not done, that's a wholly different issue which does touch on discrimination, civil liberties, and in this case data protection issues.\"\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said the industry was \"very nervous\" about the \"damage\" such a measure could do to it and \"the future of the Great British Pub\".\nShe told BBC News: \"They're asking us to enforce this at each venue and that's impossible for some of our venues to do - particularly our smaller community pubs in rural locations.\"\nHowever, Peter Marks, from nightclub owner Rekom UK, said a vaccine certificate \"could work\" in his industry and would probably be accepted by customers already used to carrying IDs to get into venues. However, he said he was concerned introducing such a measure could delay the reopening of businesses.\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Labour was \"happy to look\" at any government proposals for vaccine and testing certification, but he called for clarity for the hospitality industry about how the measures could work in practice. \nHe said the hospitality industry had been through \"incredibly difficult times over the last year\", adding: \"And suddenly the prime minister comes along, out of the blue, to say here's a new responsibility you're going to have to deal with, without much clarity.\"\nSenior Tory backbencher Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Tory Covid Recovery Group, also expressed concern that businesses would be able to turn away customers \"from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine\"."

      "tags": "NHS Scotland",
      "text": "NHS staff in Scotland are to be offered a pay rise of at least 4%, the Scottish government has confirmed.\nNurses, paramedics and domestic staff are among those who could receive the boost to their salaries. \nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman said the average pay of a front-line NHS nurse would rise by over \u00a31,200 a year. \nShe said the offer - which does not apply to doctors - recognised the \"service and dedication\" of staff during the pandemic\nThe settlement will be backdated to 1 December 2020 in recognition of an \"exceptional year of significant pressure\".\nIt follows the \u00a3500 thank you payment for all health and social care workers which was announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in November.\nEarlier this month Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended plans to give some NHS staff in England a 1% pay rise.\nHe praised \"heroic\" health and social care workers but said the rise was as much as the government could afford during the \"tough times\" of the pandemic. \nMs Freeman described the Scottish government's offer as \"the biggest single pay uplift since devolution\" for NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) staff.\nAfC is the current grading and pay system for\u00a0NHS\u00a0staff. It does not include doctors, dentists, executives and senior managers. \nAcross cycles of economic growth and contraction, public sector pay remains stable while private sector pay is more volatile - racing ahead in the good times, taking the bigger hit and redundancies when they turn tough.\nSo when private employer competition for skilled workers is lower, public sector pay increases can be reined in.\nHowever, the Scottish government has opted to boost pay, going against that cycle and in contrast with the 1% offered to NHS staff in England.\nComing at the end of a three-year 9% pay deal, the cost looks to be about \u00a3135m next year, and unlike the \u00a3500 one-off NHS payment last year, it is baked in to future pay rises.\nNHS staff have political support, so it makes sense ahead of an election. However, with a balanced budget required, a pound spent on pay cannot be spent on others who have been at the Covid battlefront - for instance, care home workers, those in the voluntary sector, welfare benefits for unpaid carers.\nA further consideration in NHS pay is that demand for scarce skills is on the rise, without easy access to EU labour, with doctor retirement, many GPs working part-time and loss of medical expertise overseas. This is one sign of the measures the NHS has to take to ensure it recruits and retains the staff it needs.\nShe added that it would benefit 154,000 staff and including domestic staff, porters and health care support workers.\nThis group, which she described as \"the backbone of our services\" would see pay rises of more than \u00a31,000, the equivalent of between 4% and 5.4%. \nThose on the highest salaries will receive a \u00a3800 pay rise. \nMs Freeman said: \"This has been an exceptionally challenging year for our health service and I am pleased that the Scottish government is able to recognise the service and dedication of our healthcare staff.\"\nThe announcement follows ongoing negotiations between the Scottish government, NHS employers and unions, who will now consult their members on the offer.\nAnd the offer is significantly higher than the pay rise proposals for other public sector workers.\nThis is not just a bumper pay offer for many NHS workers in Scotland, it is a powerful negotiating tool for health unions trying to prise more cash from the UK government. \nIt is hard to imagine nurses and other healthcare staff in England settling for a proposed 1% rise when their colleagues in Scotland are receiving 4%. \nThat contrast will presumably not go unnoticed by the independent pay review panel in England which is due to make its recommendations in May. \nIn Scotland, details of the new pay offer were released just hours before the start of the Holyrood election campaign, during which governments are obliged to avoid making big spending announcements. \nIt may lead to a wider debate in the campaign about how other public sector workers are rewarded and the support available to those in the private sector struggling as a result of the Covid crisis. \nIn her budget, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes announced a 3% rise for people earning under \u00a325,000, with 1% for people earning up to \u00a380,000 a year.\nShe called it a \"progressive and restorative approach\" but unions said it was disappointing after a year of working through the pandemic.\nColin Poolman, Royal College of Nursing Scotland senior officer, said: \"The timescale for negotiations was tight as a result of the forthcoming election but we have now received an offer for a one year pay deal.\"\nWillie Duffy, Unison regional organiser, said that each of the individual trade unions would now enter into discussions with their members on the offer.\nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"There will be a view that it's not enough but we managed through the negotiations to get extra money into the pay envelope.\"\nHe also compared the offer to the 1% offered in England by the Westminster government.\nHe said: \"It shows the stark difference between the two governments and their attitude to trying to deal with health service workers.\"\nAll of Scotland's main opposition parties have made the NHS a central part of their appeals in the forthcoming Holyrood election.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have promised to deliver an increased share of funding to GPs.\nScottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the NHS pay offer was welcome but it did not consider social care workers, whom she called \"the unsung heroes of the pandemic\".\nMs Baillie said Scottish Labour was committed to a wage rise to \u00a315 an hour for the social care workforce, with an immediate increase to \u00a312 an hour.\nThe Scottish Greens have pledged support for a properly funded publicly-owned NHS Scotland while the Scottish Liberal Democrats are promising a \"decent\" pay rise for NHS staff.

      "tags": "SNP Conference,Nicola Sturgeon,Child poverty,Free school meals,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a \u00a3500 payment as a \"thank you\" for their work during the pandemic, Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nThe SNP leader announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their \"extraordinary service\" in 2020.\nIt will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff.\nThe first minister also announced that \u00a3100 grants will be given to low-income families who may struggle over winter.\nMs Sturgeon said these payments could be made before Christmas, and would help households \"pay their fuel bills and make sure children don't go hungry\".\nIn her speech to the SNP conference, Ms Sturgeon said \"clap for carers\" events earlier in the pandemic had been \"really important\", but that the applause \"was never enough\".\nShe said appreciation must be \"shown in a more tangible way\" through the \u00a3500 payment, which would be completed before the end of the current financial year.\nShe added: \"There are no strings attached. Of course a payment like this can never come close to expressing our full admiration for those who have cared for us so heroically.\n\"But to our health and care workers, it is a demonstration of what we collectively owe you - and a heartfelt thank you for the sacrifices you have made.\"\nShe also urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to use the UK government's powers to make sure the payments are tax-free.\nA spokesperson from HM Treasury said: \"The income tax on these payments is paid to Scotland, not Westminster - and the Scottish government has the powers and funding to gross up the payment if it wishes.\"\nThe bonus is expected to be paid to about 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff, and other frontline health workers, at a cost of \u00a3180m.\nThe Royal College of Nursing in Scotland said its members would be \"happy\" with the payment - but that it did not address \"the years of pay restraint or the ongoing demands that nursing staff face\".\nAssociate director Norman Provan called for \"a pay deal that truly values the skills, clinical expertise and contribution of nursing staff\".\nMs Sturgeon said the payment had \"no strings attached\" and was separate from any negotiations about pay in the longer term.\nThe SNP leader also announced payments of \u00a3100 to households which are currently in receipt of free school meals, as part of a \u00a3100m fund to help low-income Scots this winter.\nAbout a quarter of this is to be spent on winter grants to low income families, benefiting about 150,000 households.\nThe cash is designed to support those who would have received the Scottish government's new weekly \u00a310 child payment, which was due to be introduced around now but has been deferred to February. \nA further \u00a325m will be distributed to vulnerable people through local authorities and \u00a315m will go to charities, with further allocations to help the homeless and tackle fuel poverty.\nThe first minister said the pandemic had shown that it should no longer be accepted that problems with poverty and inequality are \"inevitable or insoluble\".\nShe added: \"Initiatives like this are not just about providing practical help to those who need it most - they are an expression of our values and of the kind of country we are seeking to build.\" \nCoping with and recovering from Covid was the key theme of Nicola Sturgeon's speech to the SNP conference. \nAs well as the \"thank you\" payments to NHS and social care staff, there was the \u00a3100m winter hardship fund and extra cash for apprenticeships. \nAside from this extra spending - funded from the Scottish government's share of coronavirus cash from the Treasury - there was a more fundamental question. \nNicola Sturgeon invited her online audience to consider who should be trusted to rebuild Scotland after the pandemic and any disruption Brexit might bring. \nWestminster or Holyrood? The UK government or the government of an independent Scotland?\nThat is the question she hopes will be resolved in a further independence referendum in the early part of the next Scottish Parliament, after next May's election. \nWhile her opponents in pro-UK parties regard talk of indyref2 as irresponsible while the covid crisis is still unfolding, critics in her own party don't think she's nearly bold enough. \nThey want her to set out a plan B for achieving independence if the UK government continues to refuse to agree a 2014 style referendum. \nMs Sturgeon also used her speech to look ahead to May's Scottish Parliament election, saying she would seek the authority of the people of Scotland to hold a new independence referendum in the \"early part\" of the new Holyrood term.\nShe denied that she should instead be focusing on the pandemic, saying: \"Independence is not a distraction from the task of post-Covid reconstruction, it is essential to getting that right.\"\nAnd she questioned whether Scots wanted \"Boris Johnson's band of Brexiteers\" making decisions for them rather than an \"outward looking, internationalist\" SNP government.\nOn Saturday the SNP pledged to extend free school meals to all primary school children if they retain power after the Holyrood elections in May. \nOpposition parties have accused Ms Sturgeon and her party of focusing on independence at the cost of other issues, including dealing with Covid-19.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Ms Sturgeon had made \"a series of promises brought to you by [Chancellor] Rishi Sunak's spending\", and that the UK government had supplied \"vast sums\" to fight the pandemic.\nHe added: \"All weekend she's been talking up another divisive referendum next year, while we're in the middle of a pandemic - it's completely out of touch with people across Scotland.\"\nScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the \u00a3500 payment was \"no substitute at all for the significant increase in salary that all Scotland's health and care workers deserve\".\nHe added: \"This sum announced by Nicola Sturgeon will not make up for the years of pay restraint and austerity that staff in these sectors have had imposed on them by Tory and SNP ministers.\"\nScottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie also said the \"welcome\" payment to health staff \"must not become an alternative to a proper uplift in the Scottish government's pay policy\".\nAnd Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon had \"put independence first\", adding: \"Everything else that needs to be done in Scotland, the mammoth task of recovery in front of us, all of that will have to wait for years in the queue behind another referendum.\""

      "tags": "Andrea Leadsom,Parenting",
      "text": "New parents will have more co-ordinated access to help and services under plans to improve children's health in England, the government says.\nA \"family hub\" network will be set up and the \"red books\" used to log babies' health information will be digitised.\nAndrea Leadsom, who chaired the government review on early years health, said the plans would identify those families most in need of support.\nLabour called them \"a smokescreen for a decade of failure on early years\".\n\"Red books\" - or personal child health records - are given to parents around the time that their baby is born, and are used to record details like weight, height and vaccinations. \nThe government said it will bring forward plans to digitise them, meaning they will go online by April 2023.\nLocal authorities will be asked to produce a single \"Start for Life\" document for parents with information about support services in their area - from health visits to help quitting smoking. \nUnder the plans, published as part of a review on Thursday, there will also be \"family hubs\" - centres where parents could access a range of services.\nThe government says these services could include birth registration, midwifery, health visiting, mental health support and feeding advice.\nDeborah Gibb, a 32-year-old teacher from Bradford, is trying to calm her four-month-old, Freyja, when she picks up the phone. \"I think she's started to teethe, which is ridiculously young,\" she laughs.\nShe seems to breathe a sigh of relief when I tell her that the red book will be moving online (although that might just be because Freyja has settled down).\n\"As a mother, going out of the house you pack your entire life with you. But remembering that red book that's in the back of the cupboard?\" she says. \"It seems ridiculous.\"\nShe thinks having a single publication that lists local services would be useful, so long as it's digitised. She was given leaflets \"left, right and centre\" when she left hospital after giving birth to her older daughter, Eilidh, now three.\n\"They just go in a pile and you don't get time to read them. What you do spend hours doing is using your phone looking for information in the middle of the night.\"\nShe says her job meant she felt reasonably clued up about what support services were available in her area - but many new parents don't.\n\"I was having a conversation the other day about how I've signed Freyja up for nursery for when I return to work in September. They were like, 'you've already put her name down?'\"\nShe says it is important for first-time parents to have \"somewhere to go centrally to get all the information that isn't an intimidating place\".\nMs Leadsom, a former cabinet minister, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the plans would also help identify families who \"would go on to have real difficulties\" without support.\n\"What families will see differently is they will receive a joined-up Start for Life offer, which will show them explicitly what services they can get to support them in the period from conception to the age of two,\" she said.\nShe said the digitisation of the red books would \"make a huge difference\".\n\"For families, they won't have to keep telling their story again and again. For professionals, they will be able to see what's happened to that family to provide them with the support that they need,\" she added.\nTulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, called the plans \"a smokescreen for a decade of failure on early years\".\nShe said ministers had spent years \"dismantling\" Sure Start, an early intervention policy launched by Labour under Tony Blair to support the wellbeing of children before they started school.\nA report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in 2019 found the Sure Start scheme had a positive impact, but that funding had been cut and 500 sites had closed.\nSir Peter Lampl, head of the Sutton Trust, said there was a \"postcode lottery of provision\" at present and the pandemic has \"highlighted pre-existing inequalities\".\n\"We welcome the renewed focus on this crucial stage in life and the development of the Family Hub initiative as a universal service which will also identify the most vulnerable families,\" he said.\nAngela McConville, chief executive of parents' charity the NCT, welcomed the \"commitment to strong, coherent services\" to tackle \"health and wellbeing inequalities that... have been further exacerbated by the pandemic\".\n\"This focus has been strikingly absent from previous policy and investment, with sometimes disastrous consequences for parents and babies,\" she said.\nImran Hussain of charity Action for Children also welcomed the plan.\nHe said children's centres and family hubs \"will be more important than ever\" following the Covid-19 pandemic, helping to tackle \"the growing educational attainment gap\" between children from higher and lower socio-economic backgrounds. \nJudith Blake, chairwoman of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said the report \"rightly recognises the crucial support provided by councils\".\nShe said the LGA was \"keen\" to work with Ms Leadsom on the next phase of the review, but stressed that \"it will need to be properly resourced\"."

      "title": "Covid: Emergency powers extended and passports 'only when all offered jab'",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nMPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers for another six months. They backed Health Secretary Matt Hancock's call to renew \"essential\" emergency rules to deal with the pandemic as England moves out of lockdown. Some Conservatives voted against the measures, saying they were \"out of step\" with the roadmap for lifting restrictions. Ministers have said the powers will stay in place \"only as long as necessary\". MPs voted by 484 to 76 to extend the powers until the end of September, as well as voting on England's roadmap out of lockdown and the continuation of virtual proceedings in the Commons.  \nIt might only be possible to introduce a vaccine passport scheme once all adults have been offered a jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested. He said that there were \"moral complexities\" that had to be addressed before any decisions were made. There will be an update on the idea in April, with a review following in June. Any such passport could reflect a negative test result, as well as whether someone has been vaccinated or been shown to have immunity. None of this will apply from 12 April as venues will only be opening outdoors on that day, Mr Johnson said. Publicans have cast doubt on a suggestion from Mr Johnson that pub-goers might have to prove their vaccination status when venues reopen fully.\nEuropean countries must not turn on each other amid growing tensions over Covid vaccine supplies, the president of the EU Parliament has said. EU leaders are holding virtual talks to discuss supplies and improving distribution across the bloc's 27 member states, with some countries complaining that doses have not been distributed fairly. European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that the summit would \"ensure that Europeans get their fair share of vaccines\". Some EU states, led by Austria, are calling for a revision in the bloc's distribution method after failing to obtain enough doses earlier this year.\nA father whose son took his own life during lockdown after struggling with depression says the restrictions \"imposed new pressures on him\". Ross McCarthy, who had a three-year-old son and a fianc\u00e9e, died in late February aged 31. His father Mike, a former BBC and Sky News journalist, said Ross had suffered with mental health issues for a decade and has called for more support for men. Mr McCarthy, a former reporter and presenter from Sheffield, said: \"Covid didn't kill him, but it was another weight on the burden he felt he was already carrying.\" He described Ross as a keen sportsman and a \"great son who has left a massive void in our lives\". The government said it was committed to supporting UK mental health services.\nFor many families, a year of coronavirus restrictions has meant quality time has consisted of not much more than Zoom quiz nights. But others have found themselves suddenly thrown together again, long after children had left home. A study by the University of Southampton has found that job loss, returning from university and not wanting to live alone have prompted many young people to return to their family homes to ride out the pandemic. Three young adults reflect on their experiences of multigenerational living in the video below.  \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "text": "Tourism businesses say they have been \"preparing like crazy\" and are ready to reopen if given the green light in Friday's lockdown review.\nWelsh government ministers are expected to discuss later whether travel restrictions can be eased to allow limited tourism over Easter. \nSelf-catered accommodation could reopen from 27 March and outdoor hospitality will be considered for 22 April.\nPeople in England cannot go on holiday anywhere in the UK until 12 April.\n\"We have been preparing like crazy for the last two or three weeks to open,\" said William Greenwood from the National Trust's Bodnant Garden in Conwy. \n\"So we are pretty much ready to go as soon as we are given the go ahead.\"\nWith 20 miles of paths and 80 acres of gardens, Mr Greenwood said there should not be an issue with social distancing and they could welcome up to 2,000 visitors a day. \nAt the last lockdown review in Wales hairdressers, garden centres and some non-essential retail were given their dates to open.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford also announced tourism could start to reopen by Easter if case rates stayed low.\nBut, he warned a decision would not be made until \"the last moment\" and tourism openings would come to a halt \"if bookings were made from outside Wales\".\nPlaid Cymru's Adam Price said businesses needed more detail on what they can expect, while the Tories have called for a roadmap out of lockdown.\nGeoffrey Lyons-Mound, of Lyons Holidays Parks - which has 10 sites across Wales and Cumbria - said it had been a \"long winter\" but there were \"positive signs\".\nHe added: \"About 95% of our customers are from England and 5% are Welsh - but all will be welcomed back. \n\"You find Welsh people tend to holiday in England and vice versa. But hopefully we will get there in the end.\"\nCatherine Hummel, co-owner of Riverside Camping near Caernarfon, said she was expecting a \"softer reopening\" because of having to decline English bookings - which she said made up about 90% of their business - but they were making preparations to open.\nShe said: \"We have had to cancel around 100 bookings from England for Easter already, some were double cancellations from last year, so that's a double cancellation for some which isn't nice to do. \n\"Business-wise, I'm sad we can't welcome guests from England back just yet, but as a parent and member of the community I want to keep staff and guests as safe as possible.\"\nNia Rhys Jones, joint chair of Anglesey Tourism Association and owner of some self-catering accommodation, said for some businesses it was \"just not worth the cost of reopening\".\nShe said: \"It's all good allowing self-contained accommodation to reopen, but a lot of businesses on Anglesey are not opening because the bulk of trade comes from England, so opening is not worth the cost for some.\n\"There is some nervousness about people from parts of south Wales travelling up here and potentially seeing rates rise again.\n\"It's a real double-edged sword, businesses need trade from England, but also don't want to be bringing coronavirus back into our communities.\"\nSean Taylor, founder of the Zip World group of attractions in Snowdonia, said he would be glad to see businesses open but \"the most important thing is notice\". \nHe said: \"We're a well-run business, but we need to be able to plan ahead. Any reopening after lockdown will need some time for staff training to take place and for us to organise things with suppliers. Even the most basic things as tea and coffee need a moment to get sorted before you can open the doors.\"\nPaula Ellis is the group general manager for Retreats Group Ltd, chair of South West Tourism Forum and a member of the Covid Emergency Taskforce Group for Tourism, Hospitality and Events. \nShe said lockdown had been \"the most challenging time of our careers\" and that without government support she did not know how the industry would have survived.\nShe said she hoped the plans could go ahead to open tourism by Easter and preparations had been under way since ministers announced in February it was a possibility, but she said she would understand if it was not the case.\n\"We understand that if further strains are found or the R number changes in Wales that the Welsh government would have to retract the opening.\n\"For all our hopes and aspirations, the health of the nation does need to come first.\"\nShe added she would feel \"a lot more confident to open safely\" this summer as opposed to last as people have begun to be vaccinated and a lot of her guests tended to be older so would probably have had their jabs already.\n\"My main concern since last year is how I can look after my colleagues, community and guests, and in that order.\n\"My team are champing at the bit to be back and you can really feel the camaraderie.\"\nAbout 350 people lost their jobs at Newport's Celtic Manor Resort during the pandemic.\nBut with the easing of lockdown, chief executive Ian Edwards said there was \"light at the end of the tunnel\".\nHe told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast he was confident up to 250 furloughed staff and 150 still working would keep their jobs.  \n\"The vaccine rollout has given us hope\u2026 it has been a very tough 12 months, but there is light at the end of the tunnel,\" he said. \nPeople visiting Snowdonia's Pen y Pas will have to book a parking space in advance and use a park and ride service between April and November.\nEmyr Williams, Snowdonia National Park's chief executive, told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast the change was in response to hundreds of incidences of dangerous parking in the area last summer. \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price called for \"greater transparency between now and the end of June on what's likely to happen to allow businesses room to plan ahead\".\n\"We're not calling for an arbitrary date for the ending of all restrictions,\" he said.\n\"To not provide that level of openness means Labour is badly failing Welsh business and the workers and communities that depend on them.\"\nA Welsh Conservative spokesman said: \"Families, workers and businesses in Wales deserve a clear and detailed roadmap out of lockdown.\"Whilst Labour are dead against providing our businesses in the tourist sector with such detail, the Welsh Conservatives would deliver a clear and thorough roadmap out of lockdown, providing businesses with significant notice and restoring people with their freedoms.\"\nFiona Christie lives in Porthcawl and said she was nervous about the influx of people that could come to the town if rules allowed.\nShe said: \"I am nervous - I think Porthcawl is going to be pretty hideous in the summer to be fair. I think everybody is going to just come.\n\"It's lovely for people to come, but I think there's going to be an influx of people.\n\"I think people were more nervous last year and so they were careful, but this year I think everybody's probably had enough.\"\nCarolyn Peers, who also lives in the seaside town, said: \"It happened last year and we couldn't even walk along the prom there was so many people - and whilst I understand people wanting got come out, it's daunting if you live here as well.\""

That is why I am issuing this apology.\"\nHe went on to say that he did not consider this to be an example of \"cancel culture\", but an acknowledgement of a genuine wrongdoing.\nMANAA said Leno's apology, which he agreed to being made public, had been accepted and they considered the matter to be resolved.\nThe 70-year-old star, who was replaced in 2014 by Jimmy Fallon, is set to host a revival of the 1950s TV and radio quiz show You Bet Your Life later this year.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Computing,Intel",
      "text": "Intel's new chief executive has told the BBC it is not \"palatable\" that so many computer chips are made in Asia.\nThe majority of processors are currently manufactured in the region, with Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung the dominant players.\nUS-based Intel plans to set up a new division to make chips for other companies based on their own designs.\nUntil now, its focus had been on manufacturing its own chips in its factories across the world.\nPat Gelsinger has said Intel will invest $20bn (\u00a314.6bn) in two new fabrication plants in the US state of Arizona, in addition to a major expansion of an existing Irish facility in County Kildare.\n\"Having 80% of all supply in Asia simply isn't a palatable manner for the world to have its view of the most critical technology,\" Mr Gelsinger said.\n\"Every smartphone, every telemedicine, every remote worker, every remote education, every autonomous vehicle, every aspect of humanity is becoming more digital. \n\"And when it becomes digital, it runs on semiconductors. \n\"This is the heart of every aspect of human existence going forward. And the world needs a more balanced supply chain to accomplish that. We're stepping in.\"\nHe added that Intel also intended to build a further chip-making foundry in a different European nation, but would not be drawn about exactly where.\nWhile these moves will be too late to tackle an existing shortage of chips which is causing problems for car-makers and others, they could help the West avert a future crisis.\nPoliticians in the US and the EU have called for more chip-producing factories to be built locally.\nThis is partly driven by concerns that Beijing aims to reunify mainland China with Taiwan, while North Korea poses a threat to its southern neighbour.\nHowever, Intel has repeatedly missed manufacturing targets over recent years.\nAs a consequence, its latest desktop processors use older transistor technology than rival silicon from AMD and Apple, putting the components at a disadvantage.\nMr Gelsinger must now prove his company has put these problems behind it if the new business is to thrive.\nThe 60-year-old only returned to Intel last month after his predecessor was ousted over concerns about falling market share, among other problems.\nBut earlier in his career, Mr Gelsinger spent three decades at Intel, including a role as its first chief technical officer.\nOne activist investor had pressed him to go \"fab-less\", and spin off Intel's plants to concentrate on chip designs.\nBut Mr Gelsinger has instead chosen what looks like a tougher challenge in order to restore the company to its past glories.\nAnd that includes letting clients order chips that mix together their own technologies with some of Intel's own architectures for an extra fee.\n\"We're putting it all on the table,\" he said.\nThe following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity:\nLet's start with the new Intel Foundry Services business. It sounds like you're going all out to make chips for other companies who lack the facilities to do so themselves. But why help the competition?\nManufacturing is a capacity game. And if you're not leading in terms of total capacity, you will fall behind. So to some degree it's a necessity. If we're going to be in the manufacturing business, we have to be a foundry for ourselves and for others.\nSimply put, the world needs more semiconductors. \nWe're in an environment where digitisation was at a strong pace of growth. And then Covid kicked us into a dramatically different gear. \nThe world needs more semiconductors, and we're one of the few companies that have leading-edge technologies to be able to step into that void. And to keep it for our own products simply is not the right thing for the planet, for the industry, and for a globally distributed supply chain.\nHow disruptive do you think it will be, coming in to take business away from Samsung and TSMC?\nOverall I think everybody is groaning to catch up to the overwhelming demand. And we're going to use Samsung and TSMC for some of our products. \nSo this is about \"co-op-petition\". We expect to have strong partnerships with them as customers, and in some cases we'll compete a little bit. But overall, this is a rapidly growing $100bn market segment that simply needs more supply. \nIt also needs more geographically balanced supply. \nToday there's a heavy bias to Asia. And as we've seen, coming out of some of the disruptions and challenges, the world needs US and European supply in a more balanced way. It's the right thing for the global supply chain requirements, for both commercial as well as for government and defence use as well.\nYou also have a large chip plant in Dalian, China. Are there any plans to build new ones in China?\nAt this point, we have no expansion plans for what we have there. \nThe announcement yesterday was for two new fabs in Arizona. I already have construction projects going on in Oregon, Ireland and in Israel.\nAnd we announced that we expect to open our next sites, in both Europe and the US, within the next year. So at this point, four major sites under construction, and I hope to add two more within the next year.\nWhen you say you want to build more in Europe, is that going to just be more in Ireland or Israel? Or are you looking at other countries, the UK perhaps?\nI fully expect that we'll open up a site in another country in Europe.\nCould that be the UK?\nI'm not going to speculate any further right now. \nBut just to put this in context: these are extraordinary capital investments. They're also extraordinary job generators. \nYou've said you hope Apple might be one of your clients, despite its decision to stop using Intel's own chips. Is that realistic?\nEverybody wants multiple suppliers. So we think there's very real potential. But I have to earn that business. I have to be able to go to my competitors and be able to say: \"I want you to become my customer.\" \nThat also includes Nvidia, Qualcomm and Broadcom, in addition to Microsoft and IBM. I want all of them to say: \"I need more technology... and I trust that Intel is going to become one of my key suppliers.\"\nAnd that includes Apple as one of the biggest users of advanced semiconductor capabilities.\nApple can be a little thin-skinned at times. So is it wise to be running a high-profile ad campaign mocking its computers at the same time as saying we'd like to be your partner again?\nWe have great respect for Apple as a company. They're an innovator. They've done incredible things in the industry. Tim Cook is a great leader.\nAt the same time, we're going to be aggressive competitors and we're out to reinvigorate the PC ecosystem.\nSo we're going to enjoy ourselves. We're going to compete aggressively. And I'm also going to take care of my customers.\nRegarding your own chips, you say you've now mastered your seven nanometre process, which roughly equates to what TSMC and Samsung market as 5nm. But we've heard promises from Intel before, and then things have slipped. What's different this time?\nWe've understood the core issues. What really happened was problems with our 10nm effort caused a domino delay to 7nm. \nThere's an advanced manufacturing technique called extreme ultraviolet lithography. It was immature, and we bet against it. As we shifted in time, it became more mature. Now we've embraced it fully.\nIt's the same thing that TSMC is doing, and leveraging it aggressively.\nSo we feel that we're now in a very predictable pace. \nI have confidence that we're back on track. But not just for 7nm. Our programmes that go for several nodes beyond that are showing very good success. \nWe've also announced a research partnership with IBM. So, we have a rich portfolio of tricks and ideas and innovations to choose from to put us on a course for the long-term leadership of Intel.\nWhen you say leadership, just to be clear, do you think you could overtake TSMC and Samsung in chip-making capabilities?\nIntel led the semiconductor industry for 20-plus years in innovation.\nWe hit a pothole. We're now digging our way out of that pothole. And I'm looking forward to decades of continued leadership in this area.\nParity. Parity-plus. And then sustained leadership. That's the path that we're on."

      "text": "The man who looked at compensation for victims of Libyan-sponsored attacks by the IRA has said he understands disappointment at the government ruling out payments.\nWilliam Shawcross was appearing on Wednesday before MPs at the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee.\nHe said he had \"huge sympathy\" for the victims.\nMr Shawcross said when he took on the job he understood his 90-page report would not be published.\nHe described it as an internal scoping exercise.\nHe said he was \"surprised and disappointed\" by Tuesday's government statement, which ruled out using \u00a312bn of frozen Libyan assets to compensate IRA victims.\nMr Shawcross said his report made three recommendations, but his contract with the government meant he was limited in what he could tell the committee.\nHe said he did not identify exactly how many victims may have been murdered or injured using weapons, such as Semtex explosives, provided by the Gaddafi regime.\nThere has been a long-running campaign for compensation, with victims' hopes raised when Mr Shawcross was appointed by government to examine the issue in 2019.\n\"I am aware of the agony of people's expectations in Northern Ireland. It was brought home to me,\" he said.\n\"I have huge sympathy for all the victims of Gaddafi-IRA terrorism and all the victims in Northern Ireland and they deserve to be looked after.\n\"Raised expectations over years and years is a terrible thing amongst the victims.\"\nHe is the man the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has been chasing for months, but even before William Shawcross joined the Zoom call MPs had given up hope of getting the answers they wanted.\nAs expected, Mr Shawcross quickly declared that he could not disclose details of the report he was summoned to talk about because of his contractual obligations to the government.\nSo we ended up with lots of questions but very few answers.\nHis appearance before the committee was also spiked by Tuesday's government statement ruling out any move to compensate victims with the \u00a312b of frozen Libyan assets.\nRead more here.\nFormer Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime supplied large amounts of weapons to the IRA during the Troubles.\nIts Semtex explosives were used in numerous murders, such as the Enniskillen Remembrance Day bombing in 1987 and the 1996 attack in London's Docklands.\nIn a written statement to Parliament on Tuesday, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly said the \"internal scoping report\" was commissioned to provide advice to ministers and draws on \"private and confidential conversations\". \nThe report set out why the government is legally unable to access \u00a312bn in frozen Libyan assets to compensate the victims.  \nMr Cleverly said the \"frozen assets may not be seized by the UK government\".\nHe also ruled out using public funds to pay compensation to victims and then recouping the money from the Libyan government.\nHe said the responsibility for providing compensation lies with the Libyan state and the government had urged the authorities at the \"highest level\" to engage with UK victims.\nBut Mr Cleverly added there were \"clear practical difficulties\" in obtaining compensation from Libya because of the ongoing political and economic instability.\nHe suggested victims should avail of the current injury compensation schemes in the UK and he also pointed to the Troubles victims pension, which may provide another avenue for compensation.\nDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds accused the government of \"behaving disgracefully\" and letting down victims of IRA terrorism.  \n\"In 2004, Libya agreed to pay $1m compensation to the families of each of the 170 people killed in the bombing of UTA flight 772 in 1989,\" he said. \n\"The German government secured $35m for those killed in the 1986 bombing of the La Belle discotheque in Berlin.\n\"After all these years, our citizens have received little more than warm words and sympathy. \n\"This should be a point of embarrassment for the government. We will be challenging the government further on this matter in Parliament.\"\nKenny Donaldson, of Innocent Victims United, said: \"For two years the UK government has been responsible for heaping further pain upon those already treated so shamefully. \n\"The Shawcross Report can't even be described as a 'whitewash' because it continues to be held back from victims, the full contents remain hidden.\"\nSolicitor Barry O'Donnell, who represents some of the victims, added: \"It would appear that today's ministerial statement is another piece of political choreography designed to undermine the authority of NI Affairs Committee and to frustrate the hopes and expectations of victims and survivors of Gaddafi-Libyan sponsored IRA terrorism.\""

      "tags": "Social distancing,UK Parliament,Self-isolation,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government has passed all stages of its 329-page emergency bill through the House of Commons.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the emergency legislation will allow \"extraordinary measures\" never seen in peace time in the UK. \nThe bill has cleared the House of Lords, and will become law shortly.\nThe bill gives the government wide-ranging powers unlike any other recent legislation. \nMr Hancock has stressed that the powers in the bill would only be used \"when strictly necessary\" and would remain in force only for as long as required to respond to the crisis.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said 7,563 recently retired clinicians had so far \"answered the call\" to return to work to help with the emergency.\nHe told MPs that the returnees included nurses, midwives, paramedics and social workers - adding that priority would be given to ensure their training was up to date and they were fully insured.\nThere are multiple sections aimed at reducing the pressure on other frontline sectors, for example by relaxing rules around detention under mental health laws and increasing the use of audio and video links in courts.\nThis category of measures shows just how wide the subject matters range.\nOrganisations could be required to provide space or resources for the storage or management of dead bodies, while rules relating to investigatory powers will be relaxed while the law is in force.\nOne of the more high-profile measures in the bill is the power to restrict events and shut down premises such as pubs. \nThe government initially appeared to be relying on the goodwill of landlords and other business owners to comply, with the implied threat of action through local licensing powers, but the bill will give them sweeping powers to force shutdowns.\nIf UK and devolved ministers decide an event or venue poses a threat to public health, the owner of a venue or an organiser of the event can be forced to cancel, close down or restrict access.\nFailure to do so could result in a fine.\nThe government introduced secondary legislation to this effect on Monday, so the bill will streamline and clarify the law. \nSimilarly, the government has decided to use secondary legislation to enforce the new social distancing rules, announced by the prime minister of Monday evening. \nUsing secondary legislation allows ministers to enforce new rules without waiting for the full bill to pass. They can do so using powers included in legislation passed in 1984.\nOnce the bill passes, officials will have the power to close the borders in the event that the Border Force is under intense pressure due to staffing shortages.\nIt also puts into law powers to isolate or detain individuals who are judged to be a risk to containing the spread of Covid-19.\nSince the outbreak of coronavirus, there has been pressure on the government to support workers who are unable to work during the crisis.\nTo support businesses, the bill will allow employers to reclaim statutory sick pay funds from HMRC to help with the burden of increased staff absence. For workers, it will scrap the three-day waiting period so that they can receive the payments from the day they stop working.\nFollowing pressure from Tory MPs, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the bill would be debated and voted on every six months to ensure Parliament was \"content with its continuation\".\nAcknowledging the \"difficult\" powers being sought by ministers were \"unprecedented in peacetime\", he insisted they would be \"relinquished\" as soon as the threat to the UK had passed.\nA succession of Conservative MPs welcomed the move but sought assurances that the measures would only apply to fighting the virus.\nTom Tugendhat expressed concern that the powers could - in different circumstances - be used in a \"malicious fashion\".\nDavid Davis sought reassurances that individual elements of the bill could be removed if they were not working as intended, while Steve Baker called for a sunset clause - when the bill would automatically expire - of one rather than two years. \nOther MPs are angry about the measures introduced to protect renters from eviction after the prime minister promised to address fears. \nLabour's shadow Housing Secretary John Healey criticised a government amendment passed on Monday that extended the eviction warning period to three months, tweeting: \"This legislation does not stop people losing their homes as a result of coronavirus, just gives them some extra time to pack their bags.\"\nLabour's shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said no MPs \"came into this House\" to give powers of this kind to the executive, \"curtailing some of the basic freedoms our forebears fought for and we take for granted\".\nWhile Labour believed unprecedented measures were now needed to \"save lives and protect our communities\", he said the measures would \"chill every Liberal in the House\" and it only offered its support with a \"heavy heart\".\nHowever, he said the bill required careful scrutiny to ensure the \"quite extraordinary\" powers were not abused, particularly in changes to rules on mental health sectioning and the provision of social care.  \nThe bill, he warned, would give councils the power to \"downgrade\" care for the disabled and the elderly and that this should be subject to a review by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission.\nWhile councils should be able to prioritise those with the greatest needs in the event of staff shortages, \"what no-one of us wants to see is the legal minimum of support become the default\".\nAny legislation has to pass to the House of Lords once it has cleared the Commons. The government has no majority on the red benches, so peers could cause some problems if they want to make changes to the bill.\nIt is more likely that ministers will introduce their own amendments to correct or clarify some of the measures.\nIf they do, this would probably happen on Wednesday, at report stage. It could return to MPs immediately if they in session.\nEither way, it should be signed into law by the end of Thursday, giving ministers powers that would be unprecedented in normal times."

      "tags": "Scottish Parliament election 2021,Scottish independence,Brexit,John Curtice",
      "text": "On the first official day of campaigning in the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections, polling expert Sir John Curtice considers the \"intense\" battle for every vote ahead of polling day on 6 May. \nVoters go to the polls in six weeks to elect a new Scottish Parliament. The ballot looks set to be another crucial chapter in Scotland's continuing debate about how it should be governed.\nAccording to the polls, voters are evenly divided on whether Scotland should be an independent country or whether it should remain part of the United Kingdom. On average recent polls put Yes to independence on 50%, No on 50%.\nThe issue seems set to influence the way in which many people will vote in an election in which voters will have two votes - one for their local constituency MSP, the other for a regional party list.\nThe SNP and the Greens will be arguing that there should be another referendum on independence. The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats take the opposite view. \nAs our graph above shows, recent polls suggest that nearly nine in 10 of those who currently support independence are currently minded to support the SNP on the constituency vote. \nLess than one in 10 of those who oppose independence indicate that they will vote for Nicola Sturgeon's party.\nHowever, whereas most Yes supporters are nearly all backing the same party, the preferences of No voters are scattered across different parties.  \nSlightly less than half are supporting the Conservatives, just under a third Labour while one in eight are backing the Liberal Democrats.\nTrue, the Greens have the support of 11% of Yes supporters on the list vote (and only just 3% of No voters), but this still leaves the SNP a long way ahead among those who back independence.\nNot least of the reasons why support for independence, at 50%, is higher than the 45% recorded in the 2014 referendum, is that there has been swing in favour of leaving the UK among those who oppose Brexit.\nOn average the polls suggest that while just 34% of those who voted Leave in 2016 are in favour of independence, well over half (56%) of those who supported Remain now back the idea.\nThis has also opened up a division in party support that was largely not in evidence at the last Scottish Parliament election - which took place seven weeks before the EU referendum.\nAs our Brexit graph above shows, in 2016 SNP support differed little between those who went on to vote Remain and those who backed Leave. Now support for the party is 25 points higher among Remain supporters as it Leave voters.\nIn contrast, support for the Conservatives is now three times higher among Leave voters (45%) than among Remain supporters (15%).\nThe increased support for independence together with opposition to Brexit has enabled the SNP to establish a substantial lead in the polls, as the graph above shows. \nOn average the party is 26 points ahead of the Conservatives on the constituency vote and 20 points ahead on the list vote. Labour are trailing a little further behind in third place.\nAs the opposition parties have acknowledged, it will take a dramatic change of fortunes between now and the beginning of May for anyone other than the SNP to come first.\nHowever, the target the unionist parties appear to have set themselves is to try to deny the SNP an overall majority - something which is very difficult to achieve under Scotland's proportional representation system.\nIt was the SNP's success in winning an overall majority in 2011 that paved the way for the independence referendum in 2014. \nIf the SNP were to repeat that feat it would be more difficult for the prime minister simply to say 'No' to another referendum.\nFrom the figures in our chart, the SNP might just miss out on an overall majority - or might just make it. With the outcome of the election seemingly on such a crucial knife edge, it looks as though there will be an intense battle for every vote between now and polling day in May.\nJohn Curtice is Professor of Politics and Senior Research Fellow, ScotCen Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'"

      "text": "After a day of silence and song, candles and condolence, when the country stopped to try to absorb the enormity of what's happened this last year, a more familiar, and easy-to-digest political fuss emerged.\nAfter a press conference in Downing Street where, alongside the chief medics, the prime minister was more open, in tone at least, about the things that might have gone wrong in the last year, he went off to address a group of Tory MPs in private, on Zoom, in the Cabinet Room.\nThe chief whip was alongside him, I'm told, having his takeaway sandwich. (He also happens to be a farmer - but more of that later.)\nWith an important vote on Thursday that will extend the government's powers during the coronavirus crisis, you might have expected that the PM would have been verbally pushed and shoved a little by some of his backbenchers, frustrated by the pace of easing restrictions. \nIn actual fact, what has got tongues wagging was remarks that Boris Johnson made about the UK's success with vaccines, first reported in the Sun newspaper.\nDiscussing why the programme was doing so well, he told colleagues it was down to \"greed\" and \"capitalism\". \nSeveral of those present have told me he quickly realised his words could be taken out of context and urged MPs to \"remove that comment from your collective memory\". \nHe then went on to spend much of the meeting repeatedly praising AstraZeneca, pointing out that it was providing the vaccine at cost.\nOne MP said: \"I have never seen anyone withdraw something so fast.\"\nAnother of those present told me the prime minister's \"greed\" comments had been intended to poke fun at the chief whip, who was gobbling his cheese and pickle while sitting next to him.\nBelieve it or not, the party boss of discipline, Mark Spencer, has been christened with the nickname \"Big Farmer\", like \"Big Pharma\" - the pharmaceutical companies.\nAnd it's vehemently denied that the PM's comments were designed to stir up anything in the row with the EU. \nDowning Street didn't want to comment and sources are adamant that Mr Johnson was not intending to be critical of the pharmaceutical companies in any way.\nThe government has no desire to exacerbate the argument between the EU and AstraZeneca over vaccines.\nWith the notable exception of the Foreign Secretary's remarks last week in response to the EU Commission, ministers have been at pains to keep things calm.\nThe prime minister has been trying to prevent a dramatic bust-up in phone calls to EU leaders before their summit on Thursday.\nAnd officials on both sides have been talking to see if any accommodations can be made.\nBut while Mr Johnson's words may have been intended as a friendly jibe at a colleague, tensions are high, and any even accidental noises off are unlikely to help. \nPS A government source stressed on Wednesday morning that the PM was not talking about the UK vaccine programme in general. It's unusual to get any comment on private MPs' meetings, and shows how sensitive this all is."

      "text": "Retail giants Nike and H&M are facing a backlash in China after they expressed concern about the alleged use of Uighur forced labour in cotton production.\nMany Chinese have called for boycotts, celebrities have cut ties and e-commerce platforms have dropped H&M.\nSeveral Western countries imposed sanctions on China this week.\nIt is accused of committing serious human rights violations against the Uighur Muslim minority in the Xinjiang autonomous region. China denies this.\nThe sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, target senior officials in the north-west region.\nIn December the BBC published in an investigation based on new research showing China was forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities including Uighurs into manual labour in Xinjiang's cotton fields.\nThe statements in question were made by the companies last year, but only resurfaced in recent days following the announcement of Western sanctions.\nBoth companies had said in separate statements that they were \"concerned\" about reports that Uighurs were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, and that they did not source products from the region.\nBut the latest furore appears to have been sparked by a recent social media post by the Communist Youth League, a Chinese Communist Party group. \n\"Spreading rumours to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while also wanting to make money in China? Wishful thinking!\" it said on microblogging platform Weibo on Wednesday morning, as it shared screenshots of H&M's statement.\nState media outlets have since launched campaigns defending Xinjiang cotton and criticising the brands. \nChinese state media CGTN shared a video on Weibo claiming to show the reality of cotton-picking in Xinjiang, which involved automation and quotes from a Uighur farmer saying that people \"fought\" to work there for high earnings. \nState broadcaster CCTV said that H&M (Hennes & Mauritz) - a multinational firm with the headquarters in Sweden - had \"miscalculated\" in trying to be a \"righteous hero\", and that it \"must pay a heavy price for its wrong actions\". \nH&M China has not yet responded to queries from the BBC, but the company posted a statement on Weibo on Wednesday saying that it \"respects Chinese consumers as always\" and that it \"does not represent any political position\". \nBy Wednesday night, at least three major Chinese e-commerce platforms - Pinduoduo, JD.com and Tmall -  had withdrawn H&M products from sale, reports said. \nVarious celebrities such as Wang Yibo, Huang Xuan and Victoria Song released statements that they were severing ties with the brands, with one noting that \"the country's interests are above all\". \nSocial media has seen a huge wave of backlash against both companies, with numerous calls for people to boycott their products. The hashtag \"I support Xinjiang cotton\" is now the top trending topic on Weibo with more than 1.8bn views. \nH&M has a long relationship with China, which is important to both sides. China is one of H&M's main sources of supply and it is a big market too.\nBut calling out China on what it regards as a core domestic issue is something Beijing doesn't like. Just ask South Korea or the Philippines, whose shop chains and fruit exports both suffered after diplomatic spats. \nChina likes to use its trading might and retail nationalism to pressure governments and multinationals - both at the same time preferably - to keep them quiet about its abuses.\nThe timing of this sudden \"grassroots\" reaction, led by celebrities who've been happy to take H&M money in exchange for endorsement, is down to a wave of co-ordinated sanctions imposed by the UK, US and EU in the last few days - endorsed by Sweden among others. \nRead more: Who are the Uighurs?"

      "text": "A car that became the byword for a certain type of British motorist will be phased out next year after 29 years in production.\nThe Ford Mondeo was launched in the UK in 1993 and has sold five million since on the back of popularity with both families and executives.\nBut demand has shifted towards SUVs and lower-emission cars.\nSo production of the Mondeo will stop at Ford's Valencia plant in early 2022, the company said.\nThe American car giant has been re-evaluating its business model as the motor industry shifts moves towards zero-emission motoring.\nFord plans that all its cars sold in Europe and the UK will be fully electric by 2030, with every model having a hybrid or electric option by 2026.\n\"Today is another step on Ford's electrification journey, providing a bridge to an all-electric passenger vehicle future,\" said Kieran Cahill, vice-president of manufacturing at Ford of Europe.\nBut for a generation of motorists it will signal the death of an icon, as the Mondeo was always more than just an executive saloon and estate vehicle.\nOn hearing the news the BBC's business correspondent Simon Jack tweeted: \"This feels like the end of a political era.\"\nThat was a nod to the concept of the \"Mondeo man\", popularised by Tony Blair at the Labour Party Conference in October 1996.\nIt was a reference to the centrist, no-nonsense, hard-working voter that Blair hoped his then new vision for the Labour Party could attract.\nWhile politics long ago moved on from Blair's vision, the Mondeo remained popular, but with dwindling sales each year.\nAlmost 40% of Ford's sales in Europe of passenger vehicles in the past year were SUVs or crossovers, compared with 31% just a year earlier, the company said.\nTime waits for no man. Not even Mondeo Man.\nThe Ford Mondeo was meant to be comfortable, economical, spacious and safe. Far from flashy, but enough of a car to sit proudly on suburban drives.\nIt was a symbol of hard-working aspiration. A favourite of sales reps the length and breadth of the country. It was the kind of car that the kind of voters New Labour wanted to attract would buy. And so Mondeo Man was created.\nBut times have changed. The family hatchback now seems outdated; aspirational drivers now want SUVs, or their smaller brethren, known as Crossovers.\nSo the Mondeo is going and Mondeo Man has taken his place in history - replaced, no doubt, by SUV Steve, and Crossover Kate."

      "text": "The Covid-19 vaccination programme has saved more than 6,000 lives, an analysis by Public Health England says.\nMost would have been among the over-80s and some among people in their 70s, estimates up to the end of February suggest.\nIt comes as people in England aged over 50 and in at-risk categories are being urged to book their Covid jabs before Monday, when slots are set to dry up.\nThe NHS said appointments should be arranged by 29 March.\nOfficials expect a slowdown in vaccine supplies in April - and medics will be focusing on providing second doses. \nMinisters say the plan to offer a first dose to all adults by July is on track.\nBut NHS England said no first appointments should be booked next month for the under-50s unless they fall into a higher-priority group, such as those who are clinically vulnerable.\nFour in five people in the first nine priority groups have now received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nThe PHE analysis compared expected deaths with Covid-19 with deaths observed among the four million over-70s given first doses by the end of January, assuming it would take 31 days before the protective effects of the vaccine had a significant impact on death rates. \nIt estimated 6,100 lives had been saved:\nAnd an even higher number of lives would have been saved, PHE said, if vaccines also helped to reduce transmission of the virus, as hoped.\nImmunisation head Dr Mary Ramsay said: \"The vaccines have an excellent safety record - and I would encourage anyone who is offered a vaccine to take it as soon as possible.\" \nNHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said: \"It is a testament to the careful planning and sheer hard work of staff that the NHS vaccination programme is continuing to protect people against coronavirus at a record pace.\n\"I was thrilled to get my first dose earlier this month - it was quick, painless and safe and it feels great knowing I've got protection against Covid-19.\n\"So if you are eligible, do not delay, book a jab.\"\nThe latest government figures show 28,653,523 people in the UK have received a first dose of a vaccine, while 2,532,839 second doses have been given.\nAnybody aged 50 or over and people aged 18 and over who are clinically vulnerable can book themselves in for a first dose using the online national booking system for England before 29 March.\nGPs will also continue contacting eligible patients on their lists and offer vaccines to anyone who has not had one so far in that period.\nThe reduction in the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nIndian foreign ministry sources have told the BBC the country has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the vaccine amid a rising number of domestic cases.\nTwo vaccination centres in Cornwall said they will temporarily close next month because of the supply shortage."

      "tags": "Egypt,Global trade,Shipping industry,Suez canal",
      "text": "The Japanese owner of the giant cargo ship that has been blocking Egypt's Suez Canal since Tuesday has apologised for the disruption to global trade.\nShoei Kisen Kaisha said it was trying to resolve the situation as soon as possible, but that dislodging the Ever Given was proving extremely difficult. \nMarine and salvage engineers failed in their latest attempt on Thursday.\nThe 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel became wedged across the canal amid high winds and a dust storm.\nEvergreen Marine, the Taiwanese firm that operates the ship, has said salvage experts are working with the captain and the Suez Canal Authority to design a more effective plan for refloating it.\nThe blockage is creating long tailbacks in the waterway, with more than 150 vessels currently waiting in the area to pass.\nAbout 12% of global trade passes through the canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. \nAn alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer.\n\"In co-operation with local authorities and Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, a vessel management company, we are trying to refloat [the Ever Given], but we are facing extreme difficulty,\" the owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\"We sincerely apologise for causing a great deal of worry to ships in the Suez Canal and those planning to go through the canal,\" it added.\nIndustry sources told Reuters news agency that even if the Ever Given was refloated quickly its owner and insurers faced claims totalling millions of dollars for the delays and extra costs accrued by other companies.\nToshiaki Fujiwara, an official at Shoei Kisen Kaisha, told AFP news agency that the ship had an insurance policy, but that he was unaware of the details or any costs involved at this stage.\n\"It's just the beginning,\" he said.\nGlobal crude oil prices rose 6% on Wednesday after traffic through the canal was suspended, though they fell more than 4% on Thursday. \nA flotilla of tugboats, as well as dredgers and diggers resumed efforts to move the Ever Given at high tide on Thursday morning, after stopping overnight.\nLater, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said in a statement that an attempt to refloat the vessel at about 08:00 was not successful, and that another attempt would be made in the afternoon.\nThe management company added that a team of salvage experts from Smit Salvage had been appointed and were attending to the ship.\nThe CEO of Smit Salvage's parent company, Boskalis, warned that it could take weeks, rather than days, to refloat the ship.\n\"It is like an enormous beached whale. It's an enormous weight on the sand,\" Peter Berdowski told the Dutch TV station NPO.\n\"We might have to work with a combination of reducing the weight by removing containers, oil and water from the ship, tug boats and dredging of sand.\"\nBy Sally Nabil, BBC News, Ismailia \nThe suspension of navigation through the Suez Canal has created an atmosphere of uncertainty. No-one knows exactly when things will go back to normal. The canal is congested. Dozens of ships are waiting to resume their journeys.\nExperts say that the salvage efforts might work when the tides gets stronger early next week. If attempts to free the ship fail, one of the options would be to unload part of its cargo. But that would take a long time too.\nThe authorities are not giving much detail, and the situation is very tense. The strategic waterway is a huge asset for Egypt. Not only is it a source of national pride, but it also provides much needed foreign cash to the Egyptian economy, which is already struggling. \nThe Ever Given ran aground on Tuesday as it sailed northwards through the canal on its way from China to the Netherlands with two canal pilots on board.\nEvergreen Marine said the ship \"was suspected of being hit by a sudden strong wind, causing the hull to deviate from waterway\".\nBernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said initial investigations had ruled out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding.\nShoei Kisen Kaisha said the Ever Given's 25-member crew, who are all Indian nationals, were safe and that no oil leaks had been detected.\nAlmost 19,000 ships passed through the canal in 2020, according to the Suez Canal Authority - an average of 51.5 ships per day.\nService provider Leth Agencies said a total of 156 vessels waiting in the area on Thursday, and that three behind Ever Given were being assisted and escorted back to Port Suez in the south. \nPeter Sand, chief shipping analyst at BIMCO, told the BBC that the delayed vessels were not only container ships, but oil and gas tankers and bulk carriers transporting grain supplies.\n\"We may see production stop at conveyer belts in Europe shortly,\" he warned.\nIn 2017, a Japanese container vessel blocked the canal after it ran aground following reported mechanical issues. The Egyptian authorities deployed tug boats and the ship was refloated within hours.\nDid you witness the incident? Are you on board another vessel on the Suez Canal?

      "tags": "Long Covid,Coronavirus vaccines,Leicester,Glasgow,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Middle-aged women experience the most severe, long-lasting symptoms after being treated in hospital for Covid-19, two UK studies suggest. \nFive months on, 70% of patients studied were still affected by everything from anxiety to breathlessness, fatigue, muscle pain and \"brain fog\".\nBut the researchers say there is no obvious link with how ill people originally became.\nHow women's bodies fight off illness could explain their poorer recovery.\nThe larger study - led by the University of Leicester - which is yet to be peer-reviewed, followed up more than 1,000 patients who had been admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in the UK last year. It found that up to 70% had not fully recovered, an average of five months after leaving hospital, with women most affected.\nMore than 400,000 people have been admitted to hospital with Covid in the UK since the start of the pandemic.\nA separate smaller pre-print study, led by University of Glasgow, found women under 50 were seven times more likely to be more breathless, and twice as likely to report worse fatigue than men of the same age who had had the illness, seven months after hospital treatment.\nIn the Leicester study, these lasting 'long Covid' symptoms stopped 18% of people returning to work and forced 19% to change their job.\nDespite patients receiving a range of hospital care - with most given antibiotics, one-third receiving oxygen and just over a quarter ending up in intensive care - even those who had had short hospital stays still had ongoing problems.\nPeople who hadn't returned to normal health were more likely to be female, white, aged between approximately 40 and 60, have two or more underlying conditions, and been on a ventilator.\nDr Rachael Evans, an associate professor at the University of Leicester and respiratory consultant at Leicester's Hospitals, said, \"much of the wide variety of persistent problems was not explained by the severity of the acute illness\" - often characterised by lung damage.\nThis suggests other underlying factors may be at play, she added.\nAnd among women, it was the middle-aged group which appeared to be worst affected by long-term health problems, while younger and older women recovered better.\nStudy author Dr Nazir Lone, consultant in critical care at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, said this could be because \"older age groups are more likely to die\" and so more younger, middle-aged women are more likely to survive with health issues.\nBut he also said it was possible women have \"a different immune response to men\". Men, however, are more likely to be admitted to hospital with Covid in the first place.\nThe PHOSP-Covid study also found that most people with severe, ongoing symptoms five months after leaving hospital had higher than normal levels of a chemical called CRP in their bodies, which is linked to inflammation.\nThis is also present in middle-aged women, who are prone to auto-immune conditions in which the body attacks its own healthy cells and organs. \n\"This may explain why post-Covid syndrome seems to be more prevalent in this group, but further investigation is needed to fully understand the processes,\" said Prof Louise Wain, chair in respiratory research at the University of Leicester. \nThe researchers were also able to identify four different groups or \"clusters\" of people based on their mental and physical health issues after Covid, with one group showing particular problems with \"brain fog\". They tended to be older and male. \n\"The evidence for different recovery 'clusters', and ongoing inflammation, really is important in guiding how we conduct further research into the underlying biological mechanisms that drive long Covid,\" Prof Wain said.\nThe University of Glasgow study, on 327 adults discharged from 31 hospitals across the UK, found women under 50 were five times less likely to say they felt fully recovered from Covid-19 up to seven months later.\nWomen in this age group were also more likely to have a new disability than men of the same age who had also had the illness.\nThese new difficulties often related to memory, mobility, vision and hearing.\nThe study's lead author, Dr Janet Scott, from the University of Glasgow-MRC Centre for Virus Research, said: \"Our research shows that survivors of Covid-19 experienced long-term symptoms, including a new disability, increased breathlessness, and a reduced quality of life. \n\"These findings were present even in young, previously healthy adults under 50, and were most common in younger females.\" \nShe said this could have \"profound implications for pandemic policy decision, as well as vaccination strategy\".\nDr Lone, who was involved in both studies, said it was vital to identify people with ongoing health problems from Covid and get experts such as dieticians, physiotherapists and social workers on board to help provide personalised help and support.

Face masks are no longer required outdoors. \nRestaurants, cafes and bars can serve customers indoors, with 50% capacity and up to six people per table.\nStanding concerts will resume on 30 June and nightclubs on 9 July (with 75% capacity). People attending will need a health pass which shows either full vaccination, a negative test within the previous 72 hours, or else a previous coronavirus infection.\nRestaurants, bars, beer gardens, museums, hotels and concert halls have reopened.\nMedical grade masks are compulsory in shops and on public transport.\nLocal authorities can impose stricter rules in high infection rate areas. \nFrom 30 June, working from home will no longer be compulsory.\nOn 21 June, Italy's curfew was scrapped and the whole country, except for the northwest region of Valle d'Aosta, became \"white zone\" - the country's lowest-risk category.\nAmong the measures still in place are social distancing (1m) and the wearing of masks indoors (and in crowded outdoor places), and a ban on house parties and large gathering. \nNightclubs and discos are also closed. \nAll indoor businesses, with the exception of nightclubs, are open. \nThe government introduced a \"corona pass\" in April, the first to do so in Europe. \nThis shows - either on a phone or on paper - that you have been vaccinated, previously infected or that you have had a negative test within 72 hours. \nPeople need to show it for entry to cinemas, museums, hairdressers or indoor dining.\nThe Greek government is welcoming tourists from many countries, if they are fully vaccinated or can provide a negative coronavirus test.  \nFace coverings must be worn in all public places and there is a curfew from 01:30-05:00, but bars, restaurants, museums and archaeological sites are all open.\nCinemas, theatres, museums and restaurants are open at 50% capacity.

Most European travellers still have to present a negative Covid test on arrival.\nShops, cinemas, gyms, cafes and restaurants are open, with restrictions. Households can invite up to four people inside.\nFrom 1 July, working from home will no longer be mandatory, if the situation continues to improve. \nCultural performances, shows and sports competitions can also go ahead, with limited numbers, and more people will be allowed at weddings and other ceremonies and parties. \nPortugal has lifted many of its restrictions but face coverings must still be worn in indoor public spaces and some outdoor settings.\nBars and nightclubs remain closed, and it's illegal to drink alcohol outdoors in public places, except for pavement caf\u00e9s and restaurants. \nAlcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 unless it is with a meal.\nRestaurants, cafes and cultural venues have to close at 01:00 and have capacity limits. \nA weekend travel ban is in force in the Lisbon area, starting at 15:00 on Friday, with residents only allowed to leave for essential journeys. \nIn Lisbon and in Albufeira (Algarve), cafes, restaurants and non-essential shops have to close by 15:30 at the weekend and 22:30 on weekdays. \nRestaurants, cafes, museums and historic buildings have reopened with capacity limits. \nFrom 26 June, a number of restrictions are being lifted. \nAlcohol can be sold after 22:00, and nightclubs can open, with an entry pass system. \nEvents held in public venues such as cinemas, conference centres and concert halls will be allowed, subject to social distancing. \nMasks will no longer be compulsory except on public transport, airports and in secondary schools.\nOutdoor services in restaurants and bars returned in June. Theme parks, funfairs, cinemas and theatres, gyms and swimming pools, have reopened as well.\nFrom 5 July, restaurants and bars will be able to serve customers indoors. Weddings and other indoor events for up to 50 people will be permitted and the numbers at outdoor organised events will increase. \nSince June, pubs have been able to stay open until 22:30 and more people are now allowed at sports events, outdoor concerts, cinemas and markets.\nOn 1 July, limits on private gatherings will be raised, and the recommendation to interact with a small circle of people removed.\nFurther easing is planned on 15 July and in September.

      "tags": "Companies,Deliveroo,Gig economy,Self-employment",
      "text": "Six big UK investment firms say they will not buy Deliveroo shares after concerns over workers' rights.\nThe delivery company hopes to be valued at up to \u00a38.8bn when it lists its shares in April.\nBut Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, CCLA, LGIM and M&G said they were put off by factors including the working conditions of its riders and lack of investor power.\nDeliveroo said it had seen \"significant demand\" for stock with interest rising.\n\"We look\u00a0forward to welcoming new shareholders next week alongside our currently highly respected existing investors,\" it added.\nDeliveroo riders are self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to earn a minimum wage from the company, or holiday and sick pay.\nRupert Krefting, head of corporate finance and stewardship at M&G, said the company's reliance on gig-economy workers made it a risk for investors.\nHe pointed out that Uber had recently had greater legal rights enforced by the Supreme Court for drivers previously categorised as self-employed.\n\"Deliveroo's narrow profit margins could be at risk if it is required to change its rider benefits to catch up with peers,\" Mr Krefting added.\nLegal & General Investment Management (LGIM) said it was put off by an \"unequal voting rights\" structure.\nDeliveroo is planning to let its founder and chief executive Will Shu have more than 50% of shareholder voting rights.\n\"It is important to protect minority and end-investors against potential poor management behaviour, that could lead to value destruction and avoidable investor loss,\" LGIM said.\nPhil Webster, a portfolio manager at BMO, said labour issues represented a \"ticking bomb on the side\" for Deliveroo, which contributed to making it \"uninvestable\".\nAndrew Millington, head of UK Equities at Aberdeen Standard, told the BBC's Today programme that the conditions were a \"red flag\", adding: \"We wouldn't be comfortable that the way in which its workforce is employed is sustainable.\"\nHe compared Aberdeen Standard's recent decision to sell off Boohoo shares, following allegations of worker exploitation at suppliers to the online clothing company.\nLarge institutional investors such as Aberdeen Standard can use their financial muscle to try to influence the way firms are run - such as through relationships with managers and shareholder votes.\nBut Mr Millington said that sometimes \"disinvesting or not investing in the first place is our only option\".\nHe added that it would be interesting to see whether Deliveroo can attract investors over the longer term \"without making progress\" on worker rights.\nOne of the biggest-ever floats on the London market of a home-grown technology company should have meant a feeding frenzy among the City's institutional investors, the companies that have the job of putting trillions of pounds of retail and pension investors money to work.  \nFor years they have watched with envy as their US counterparts have put cash into a steady stream of technology companies.\nNot all have been big hits after listing their shares on public markets, but enough of them have been - think Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla and a string of others - to have made it a big source of investment returns. Deliveroo's listing, which could value the company at just short of \u00a39bn, should have been a rare similar opportunity on the London market.\nInstead some big players, including Aviva Investors and Aberdeen Standard, are turning their backs, saying the way the company employs its riders is not socially acceptable, and poses a risk to its future.\nDeliveroo deems its riders to be self-employed, and points out that the High Court has upheld that view. What is more, Deliveroo says its riders value the flexibility that employment status gives them, although it is worth noting that Uber maintained the same thing until it eventually decided its drivers were in fact workers, not self-employed contractors.\nThere is no danger to Deliveroo's float - there are enough investors around who are happy to buy the shares. The buying strike by large investors could have ramifications well beyond one company, however. Does this mean that all gig economy companies are off limits? Does it signal that all companies on the London market will now have to ensure their worldwide organisations meet the best employment standards? \nAndrew Millington of Aberdeen Standard told the Today programme that would be the battle to come - that his firm would hold on to a company's shares as long as it was moving in the right directions, and paid proper attention to employment standards. That is a subtle warning to boardrooms that they will in future be judged by the way their treat their most junior staff.\nDavid Cumming, chief investment officer at Aviva, said investors were taking social responsibilities \"a lot more seriously\".\n\"A lot of employers could make a massive difference to workers' lives if they guaranteed working hours or a living wage, and how companies behave is becoming more important.\"\nA report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) - based on thousands of invoices from 300 Deliveroo riders - claims that one in three is earning less than the National Living Wage, which is currently \u00a38.72 an hour.\nHowever, Deliveroo said the sample of 300 people was \"not a meaningful or representative proportion\" of their riders and that they can earn up to \u00a313 an hour \"at our busiest times\".\n\"These findings [by the BIJ] raise concerns,\" said Tom Powdrill, head of stewardship at shareholder lobby group Pirc. \"Investors considering taking a position in Deliveroo should familiarise themselves with these matters and the risks and responsibilities involved along with all other relevant factors.\"\nMr Cumming also warned of the risk that drivers will have to be reclassified as workers, which would entitle them to rights such as sick and holiday pay. \n\"It's an investment risk if the legislation changes,\" said Mr Cumming. \nUber recently reclassified its drivers as workers after a landmark UK supreme court case last month.\nSince losing a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status, Uber has offered holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage, and pensions benefits to its drivers.\nOther gig economy companies have been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February, although it does not directly apply to Uber Eats - the food delivery arm of the business.\nDeliveroo has set aside more than \u00a3112m to cover potential legal costs relating to the employment status of its delivery riders.\nIt warned potential investors of the risk of litigation around the world in documents setting out its plans for a stock market debut published on Monday.\n\"The European Commission is set to draw up new legislation governing how the gig economy model works across the bloc,\" pointed out Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"If Deliveroo is forced to change the way it classifies its riders in the future, it is likely to puncture its profits prospects, and could even derail the delivery giant.\"\nDeliveroo, which was founded in 2013, has said it will hand its riders bonuses of between \u00a3200 and \u00a310,000 when it floats, depending on the number of orders they have delivered."

Let us grown-ups share to the full in their unstinted pleasures before we turn again to the stern task and the formidable years that lie before us.\"\nJanet Jackson's 1989 album Rhythm Nation 1814 is one of the newest records to be added to the registry this year.\nThe Library of Congress recognised how the pop star had rejected pressure to repeat the commercial success of her previous record, Control, and instead made a record that grappled with racism, homelessness, gun crime and social injustice.\n\"We wanted Rhythm Nation to really communicate empowerment,\" Jackson's producer Jimmy Jam told the Library of Congress. \"It was making an observation, but it was also a call to action. Janet's purpose was to lead people and do it through music, which I think is the ultimate uniter of people.\"\nKermit The Frog, meanwhile, enters the registry thanks to The Rainbow Connection, the 1979 single that has become The Muppets' unofficial theme song.\nComposer Paul Williams has called the ballad a tribute to the spirit of Muppets' creator Jim Henson.\n\"What [co-writer Kenny Ascher and I] tapped into for Kermit is what we tapped into for Jim Henson; his mind, heart, and gentle soul,\" Williams told Vanity Fair in 2019. \"I think it's his song as much as Kenny's, or mine, or Kermit's.\"\nOne of the most curious and significant artefacts to be added to the registry this year is a voice recording made on tinfoil in 1878.\nThought to be the oldest playable recording of an American voice, it begins with the sound of brass instruments, followed by recitations of Mary Had a Little Lamb and Old Mother Hubbard.\nThe nursery rhymes are interrupted intermittently with laughter as the narrator forgets the words. \"Look at me; I don't know the song,\" says the man, thought to be Thomas Mason, a journalist in Missouri.\nMason was among the first people to buy one of Thomas Edison's phonograph machines, which he invented in 1877; but died of sunstroke three weeks after making his historic recording. \nThe foil survived - but it was thought to be unplayable for years, until scientists managed to extract the sound digitally in 2013.\nThe most recent recording added to the registry is a 2008 episode of the US radio show This American Life, which tells the story of the subprime mortgage crisis that led to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. It is also the first podcast to become part of the collection.\nThe full list of recordings selected for the registry is as follows:\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "NI economy,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "Natural gas supplier, Firmus energy, has announced a 14% price increase for customers in greater Belfast. \nThe tariff change on 15 April will affect more than 50,000 consumers. \nThe firm said the move is in response to an increase in global wholesale prices. Bills for the average household will rise by \u00a31.32 per week. \nFirmus said the increase follows two price reductions totalling 20% over the last 18 months. \nThe greater Belfast network area covers Belfast, Lisburn, Bangor, Holywood, Groomsport, Carryduff, Comber, Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus among other areas. \nEarlier this month, the company announced prices in its Ten Towns network would increase by 17.75% from 1 April.\n\"We know that price stability is important for our customers but the increase of wholesale natural gas costs on the global market, which are beyond our control, have unfortunately made this increase inevitable,\" said Michael Scott, managing director of Firmus.\n\"Any increase is never welcome news and we recognise this comes at a particularly difficult time for many. \n\"We want to assure our customers that we will continue to monitor and review our tariffs to ensure customers are getting the best prices possible.\"\nThe Consumer Council said the latest price rise was \"unwelcome news\" for Firmus customers, following the price rise for customers in the Ten Towns network.\nHowever, Raymond Gormley from the Consumer Council said his organisation understood \"the main driver for the increase is the significant rise in the cost of wholesale gas globally over the last year\". \n\"Consumers who are experiencing financial difficulty and are struggling to pay their energy bills should contact their supplier without delay to talk about how they can help during these times,\" he added. \nMr Gormley also encouraged customers to \"shop around to ensure they are on the best energy deal\".

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The rollout of Covid vaccines in European Union (EU) countries is picking up speed, with more than 300 million jabs  administered.\nAs of 20 June, nearly half of the EU's adult population have had at least one one dose, while 28% have been fully vaccinated.\nEarlier this year, the rollout was hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.\nIn the week to 20 June 2021, Germany administered an average of 1 dose per 100 people a day, with Italy and France close behind on  0.9 dose per 100 people - all higher than the UK's 0.6 per 100.\nHungary - which is using Russian and Chinese vaccines as well as the EU-approved ones - has fully vaccinated 46% of its population, the same proportion as the UK. \nIn France, children who are 12 and over can be vaccinated, with parental consent. The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

      "tags": "Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,Angela Merkel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has cancelled plans for a strict lockdown over Easter, just a day after the measures were announced. \nCalling the plan a \"mistake\", Mrs Merkel said she took \"ultimate responsibility\" for the U-turn.\nThe proposed lockdown was agreed with regional leaders in talks overnight on Monday, with restrictions set to be tightened between 1-5 April.\nBut the plan was reversed following a crisis meeting on Wednesday.\nIt had been widely criticised by business leaders and scientists. \nThe lockdown would have been Germany's strictest yet, with most shops closed and gatherings limited.\nFor five days over Easter from 1 April, Germans would have been asked to stay at home and reduce social contact.\nIn-person religious services would have been cancelled, large family gatherings banned and almost all shops would have been closed.\nThe head of Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, Armin Laschet, told a regional parliament meeting on Wednesday that the lockdown was \"not enforceable in this form\".\n\"This mistake is mine alone,\" Mrs Merkel told reporters in Berlin. \"The whole process has caused additional uncertainty, for which I ask all citizens to forgive me.\"\n\"There were good reasons for it but it could not be implemented well enough in this short time,\" she added.\nThis was an extraordinary statement. \nChancellor Merkel said she alone bore responsibility for the plan to extend what is usually a three-day Easter holiday to a five-day shutdown. \nThe German leader will be conscious that - as case numbers soar exponentially - public trust in her government's pandemic response is wavering. \nShe was seen as a safe pair of hands who brought the country through the first wave of infections. But - as regional leaders bicker over lockdown measures - Germany's response is becoming increasingly chaotic.\nMrs Merkel appears to be struggling to keep the country together.\n\"Essentially, we have a new virus,\" Chancellor Merkel said when announcing the now-cancelled Easter lockdown.\nThe highly contagious UK (Kent) variant of coronavirus had become dominant, she explained, plunging the country into \"a new pandemic\".\n\"It is much deadlier, much more infectious and infectious for much longer,\" she claimed, adding Germany was in a race against time to vaccinate against Covid-19.\nThe infection rate has risen above 100 per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany. That number is critical in determining emergency decisions such as tightening lockdowns. Under the current rules, areas exceeding that infection rate over a seven-day period will not be subject to further reopenings.\nBut despite the numbers, the announcement of the five-day lockdown, and the subsequent ban on Easter church services, triggered dismay from religious leaders. They argued that their existing social-distancing measures made church attendance safe.\nThe Catholic German Bishops' Conference made clear that, following Wednesday's U-turn, its services would go ahead as planned with hygiene measures in place and video streams available to those who did not want to attend in person. \nRetail leaders also welcomed the reversal. \n\"With today's decision, a bit of reason is returning to coronavirus policy,\" the HDE association of retailers said in a statement.\nThe country's partial lockdown, meanwhile, has been extended until at least 18 April.\nCoronavirus infections have been surging in some parts of Europe in recent weeks as countries scramble to vaccinate their populations despite delays in rolling out jabs. \nThe European Commission has proposed tougher controls on Covid vaccine exports. It has accused the UK-Swedish firm AstraZeneca of failing to honour its contract to supply EU countries.\nThe tougher export controls are most likely to affect countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US."

      "text": "The buyer of Twitter's first ever tweet by its founder Jack Dorsey for $2.9m (\u00a32.1m) sees it as a wise investment.\n\"It's a piece of human history in the form of a digital asset. Who knows what will be the price of the first tweet of human history 50 years from now,\" Malaysia-based Sina Estavi said.\nMr Estavi compared his newly-acquired tweet to Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.\nExperts agree that the first tweet from the Twitter founder on his own platform is a highly valuable asset.\nJack Dorsey's tweet, which said \"just setting up my twttr,\" was first published on 21 March 2006 and was auctioned off by Mr Dorsey for Give Directly's Africa Response charity.\nMr Estavi, the chief executive of cryptocurrency firm Bridge Oracle, bought the tweet using ether, a rival currency to bitcoin.\nIt was sold as a non-fungible token (NFT), a unique digital certificate that states who owns a photo, video or other form of online media. \nNFTs have become hugely popular this year, with expensive digital artwork also being sold this way.\n\"I believe it's an emerging market and it's just the beginning. All forms of digital arts and creations such as music, photos, videos, tweets and blog posts can be traded in the form of an NFT,\" Mr Estavi, a 29-year-old Malaysian national told the BBC.\nHe added that his investors and colleagues \"are really appreciative and happy about this investment because they know the value and future price of this particular NFT and the impact it made on social media.\" \nWhile the price paid for the tweet raised a few eyebrows, experts believe it could be a shrewd investment.\n\"A way to explain it is that owning this first tweet can be viewed in the future almost like the first edition of a rare book,\" said Cathy Hackl, a social media expert.\n\"Twitter ushered in a new era of communication and this tweet launched it.\"\nMr Dorsey's tweet was sold via an online platform called Valuables, owned by US-based company Cent.\nCameron Hejazi, co-founder of Cent, said this was the highest valued asset sold on the platform so far.\n\"I was shocked but not surprised - the value of these assets is highly subjective. Plus we are happy the money is going to such a good cause,\" he told the BBC.\nThe NFT market is now worth $1bn and uses the same blockchain technology that underpins digital currencies such as bitcoin to establish ownership and authentication.\nHowever, it's still early days to determine precisely how buyers will value other online social media posts.\n\"To be able to capture the first tweet, of the person who invented this, makes it very important memorabilia,\" said Nanne Dekking, the founder of Artory, which records artworks on blockchain technology.\nOthers think some of Donald Trump's controversial tweets as US president might make for future investment targets.\nAs the buyer, Mr Estavi will receive a certificate, digitally signed and verified by Mr Dorsey, \n\"If that person is a crypto investor, it makes even more sense as they will find a way to make the investment work for them,\" added Ms Hackl.\nWhile Mr Estavi owns the Dorsey tweet, anyone with internet access can see and read it.

      "text": "Natural gas supplier, Firmus energy, has announced a 14% price increase for customers in greater Belfast. \nThe tariff change on 15 April will affect more than 50,000 consumers. \nThe firm said the move is in response to an increase in global wholesale prices. Bills for the average household will rise by \u00a31.32 per week. \nFirmus said the increase follows two price reductions totalling 20% over the last 18 months. \nThe greater Belfast network area covers Belfast, Lisburn, Bangor, Holywood, Groomsport, Carryduff, Comber, Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus among other areas. \nEarlier this month, the company announced prices in its Ten Towns network would increase by 17.75% from 1 April.\n\"We know that price stability is important for our customers but the increase of wholesale natural gas costs on the global market, which are beyond our control, have unfortunately made this increase inevitable,\" said Michael Scott, managing director of Firmus.\n\"Any increase is never welcome news and we recognise this comes at a particularly difficult time for many. \n\"We want to assure our customers that we will continue to monitor and review our tariffs to ensure customers are getting the best prices possible.\"\nThe Consumer Council said the latest price rise was \"unwelcome news\" for Firmus customers, following the price rise for customers in the Ten Towns network.\nHowever, Raymond Gormley from the Consumer Council said his organisation understood \"the main driver for the increase is the significant rise in the cost of wholesale gas globally over the last year\". \n\"Consumers who are experiencing financial difficulty and are struggling to pay their energy bills should contact their supplier without delay to talk about how they can help during these times,\" he added. \nMr Gormley also encouraged customers to \"shop around to ensure they are on the best energy deal\".

      "text": "US President Joe Biden was pressed on how he would address the surge in migrants at the southern border at his first official press conference.\nMore than 17,000 children are being kept in government detention centres and Mr Biden was challenged on whether his policies could be contributing to the increase in child arrivals.\nThe president defended his record and vowed to be transparent.\nThe hour-long event also covered subjects from guns to foreign policy.\nHe also doubled his administration's vaccine rollout goal, saying that he now aims to have 200 million jabs be given before his 100th day in office.\nBut questions about the situation at the US-Mexico border dominated the event.\nDuring the White House news conference, Mr Biden blamed his predecessor Donald Trump for the growing humanitarian crisis on the southern  border, and said it was normal for the US to experience an influx of migrants in cooler months.\n\"The truth of the matter is, nothing has changed,\" he said, adding: \"The reason they're coming is that it's the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert.\"\n\"I'd like to think it's because I'm a nice guy, but it's not,\" he said, calling the surge a cyclical event.\nHe also blamed the \"circumstances in their country,\" including natural disasters, crime and lack of economic opportunity.\nAsked when he would make government-run detention centres open to visits from reporters, Mr Biden said he \"will commit to transparency\". \n\"You'll have full access to everything,\" he said, but declined to give a timeline.\nTopics raised during the press conference ranged from questions over gun control to whether the US would keep its commitment to withdrawing troops from Afghanistan by a 1 May deadline agreed to by the previous administration.\nMr Biden admitted that it would be difficult to meet that timeline, and punted on answering questions over what he could accomplish on what he called \"long-term\" problems such as gun legislation.\nHe also made news by saying he planned to run for re-election in 2024 - a question that had been a source of speculation until today.\nMr Biden opened the event with an update on the US Covid-19 response, saying that he would aim to deliver 200m jabs in his first 100 days - a plan he said was \"ambitious\" but possible.\n\"No other country in the world has even come close, not even close, to what we are doing,\" he claimed.\nThe US has so far delivered over 130 million doses of the vaccine - but it still lags behind other countries in terms of the number of shots administered relative to the size of the population.\nAccording to US health experts, approximately 2.5m doses are now being distributed per day.\nThe US Customs and Border Protection agency releases monthly figures of the number of \"encounters\" at the southwest land border.\nIn January and February 2021, 78,442 and 100,441 people were apprehended, respectively. This is a significant increase from previous years.\nStill, the highest number in the last few years was in May 2019 during Mr Trump's presidency - when over 140,000 people were apprehended by the authorities.\nThere are several factors driving the surge at the southern US border. They include: "

      "text": "A car that became the byword for a certain type of British motorist will be phased out next year after 29 years in production.\nThe Ford Mondeo was launched in the UK in 1993 and has sold five million since on the back of popularity with both families and executives.\nBut demand has shifted towards SUVs and lower-emission cars.\nSo production of the Mondeo will stop at Ford's Valencia plant in early 2022, the company said.\nThe American car giant has been re-evaluating its business model as the motor industry shifts moves towards zero-emission motoring.\nFord plans that all its cars sold in Europe and the UK will be fully electric by 2030, with every model having a hybrid or electric option by 2026.\n\"Today is another step on Ford's electrification journey, providing a bridge to an all-electric passenger vehicle future,\" said Kieran Cahill, vice-president of manufacturing at Ford of Europe.\nBut for a generation of motorists it will signal the death of an icon, as the Mondeo was always more than just an executive saloon and estate vehicle.\nOn hearing the news the BBC's business correspondent Simon Jack tweeted: \"This feels like the end of a political era.\"\nThat was a nod to the concept of the \"Mondeo man\", popularised by Tony Blair at the Labour Party Conference in October 1996.\nIt was a reference to the centrist, no-nonsense, hard-working voter that Blair hoped his then new vision for the Labour Party could attract.\nWhile politics long ago moved on from Blair's vision, the Mondeo remained popular, but with dwindling sales each year.\nAlmost 40% of Ford's sales in Europe of passenger vehicles in the past year were SUVs or crossovers, compared with 31% just a year earlier, the company said.\nTime waits for no man. Not even Mondeo Man.\nThe Ford Mondeo was meant to be comfortable, economical, spacious and safe. Far from flashy, but enough of a car to sit proudly on suburban drives.\nIt was a symbol of hard-working aspiration. A favourite of sales reps the length and breadth of the country. It was the kind of car that the kind of voters New Labour wanted to attract would buy. And so Mondeo Man was created.\nBut times have changed. The family hatchback now seems outdated; aspirational drivers now want SUVs, or their smaller brethren, known as Crossovers.\nSo the Mondeo is going and Mondeo Man has taken his place in history - replaced, no doubt, by SUV Steve, and Crossover Kate."

      "tags": "NHS Scotland",
      "text": "NHS staff in Scotland are to be offered a pay rise of at least 4%, the Scottish government has confirmed.\nNurses, paramedics and domestic staff are among those who could receive the boost to their salaries. \nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman said the average pay of a front-line NHS nurse would rise by over \u00a31,200 a year. \nShe said the offer - which does not apply to doctors - recognised the \"service and dedication\" of staff during the pandemic\nThe settlement will be backdated to 1 December 2020 in recognition of an \"exceptional year of significant pressure\".\nIt follows the \u00a3500 thank you payment for all health and social care workers which was announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in November.\nEarlier this month Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended plans to give some NHS staff in England a 1% pay rise.\nHe praised \"heroic\" health and social care workers but said the rise was as much as the government could afford during the \"tough times\" of the pandemic. \nMs Freeman described the Scottish government's offer as \"the biggest single pay uplift since devolution\" for NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) staff.\nAfC is the current grading and pay system for\u00a0NHS\u00a0staff. It does not include doctors, dentists, executives and senior managers. \nAcross cycles of economic growth and contraction, public sector pay remains stable while private sector pay is more volatile - racing ahead in the good times, taking the bigger hit and redundancies when they turn tough.\nSo when private employer competition for skilled workers is lower, public sector pay increases can be reined in.\nHowever, the Scottish government has opted to boost pay, going against that cycle and in contrast with the 1% offered to NHS staff in England.\nComing at the end of a three-year 9% pay deal, the cost looks to be about \u00a3135m next year, and unlike the \u00a3500 one-off NHS payment last year, it is baked in to future pay rises.\nNHS staff have political support, so it makes sense ahead of an election. However, with a balanced budget required, a pound spent on pay cannot be spent on others who have been at the Covid battlefront - for instance, care home workers, those in the voluntary sector, welfare benefits for unpaid carers.\nA further consideration in NHS pay is that demand for scarce skills is on the rise, without easy access to EU labour, with doctor retirement, many GPs working part-time and loss of medical expertise overseas. This is one sign of the measures the NHS has to take to ensure it recruits and retains the staff it needs.\nShe added that it would benefit 154,000 staff and including domestic staff, porters and health care support workers.\nThis group, which she described as \"the backbone of our services\" would see pay rises of more than \u00a31,000, the equivalent of between 4% and 5.4%. \nThose on the highest salaries will receive a \u00a3800 pay rise. \nMs Freeman said: \"This has been an exceptionally challenging year for our health service and I am pleased that the Scottish government is able to recognise the service and dedication of our healthcare staff.\"\nThe announcement follows ongoing negotiations between the Scottish government, NHS employers and unions, who will now consult their members on the offer.\nAnd the offer is significantly higher than the pay rise proposals for other public sector workers.\nThis is not just a bumper pay offer for many NHS workers in Scotland, it is a powerful negotiating tool for health unions trying to prise more cash from the UK government. \nIt is hard to imagine nurses and other healthcare staff in England settling for a proposed 1% rise when their colleagues in Scotland are receiving 4%. \nThat contrast will presumably not go unnoticed by the independent pay review panel in England which is due to make its recommendations in May. \nIn Scotland, details of the new pay offer were released just hours before the start of the Holyrood election campaign, during which governments are obliged to avoid making big spending announcements. \nIt may lead to a wider debate in the campaign about how other public sector workers are rewarded and the support available to those in the private sector struggling as a result of the Covid crisis. \nIn her budget, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes announced a 3% rise for people earning under \u00a325,000, with 1% for people earning up to \u00a380,000 a year.\nShe called it a \"progressive and restorative approach\" but unions said it was disappointing after a year of working through the pandemic.\nColin Poolman, Royal College of Nursing Scotland senior officer, said: \"The timescale for negotiations was tight as a result of the forthcoming election but we have now received an offer for a one year pay deal.\"\nWillie Duffy, Unison regional organiser, said that each of the individual trade unions would now enter into discussions with their members on the offer.\nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"There will be a view that it's not enough but we managed through the negotiations to get extra money into the pay envelope.\"\nHe also compared the offer to the 1% offered in England by the Westminster government.\nHe said: \"It shows the stark difference between the two governments and their attitude to trying to deal with health service workers.\"\nAll of Scotland's main opposition parties have made the NHS a central part of their appeals in the forthcoming Holyrood election.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have promised to deliver an increased share of funding to GPs.\nScottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the NHS pay offer was welcome but it did not consider social care workers, whom she called \"the unsung heroes of the pandemic\".\nMs Baillie said Scottish Labour was committed to a wage rise to \u00a315 an hour for the social care workforce, with an immediate increase to \u00a312 an hour.\nThe Scottish Greens have pledged support for a properly funded publicly-owned NHS Scotland while the Scottish Liberal Democrats are promising a \"decent\" pay rise for NHS staff.

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

It's ascertaining where people are online, where they're checking into. \n\"If that's the means by which the stalker is tracing and contacting you then it can feel like there's no escape from it.\"\nInsp Crossan is part of the force's dedicated anti-stalking unit, set up after it was made a specific criminal offence in England and Wales in 2012.\nAccording to the 2020 crime survey for England and Wales, almost one in 20 women and almost one in 50 men aged 16 or over had experienced some form of stalking in the past year.\nBecky - not her real name - from North Yorkshire, was stalked for a year-and-a-half by her ex-partner, who seemed to know where to find her at all times.\n\"I just kept seeing him everywhere I went, wherever it was,\" she said.\n\"If I was driving on the road he would nearly always be coming in the opposite direction, if I left the gym he would be outside, driving past.\"\nShe only discovered how when a mechanic found a tracking device fitted to her car.\n\"I'm never somebody that's really suffered from anxiety, but it crippled me at times,\" she said.\n\"You're just always looking over your shoulder [and] you don't leave that behind even when it's been discovered.\"\nHer ex was recently jailed for two-and-a-half years after he pleaded guilty to stalking.\nEvie Duarte, from the Independent Domestic Abuse Service, which helps people affected by domestic abuse, sexual violence and stalking, said it was important to raise awareness from an early age.\n\"People do not always recognise that some of the things they are experiencing are stalking,\" she said.\n\"It might start off that if feels quite nice that someone is being really attentive, but then it comes to a point where it can be quite frightening.\"\nIf you're affected by the themes discussed in this article you can find more information from the National Stalking Helpline.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "It may only be possible to introduce a vaccine passports scheme once all adults have been offered a jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested.\nHe said no decisions had been made but there would be an update on the idea in April. A review will report in June.\nThere were \"difficult issues... moral complexities, ethical problems that need to be addressed\", the PM added.\nAny passport could also reflect a negative test result as well as whether someone was vaccinated or has immunity.\nOn Thursday afternoon, MPs voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers in England for another six months, with 484 in favour, and 76 against, giving a majority of 408. \nThe Coronavirus Act was introduced in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.\nMeanwhile, the UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the government's daily figures.\nToday's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure - but the number of Covid-related deaths has fallen by 32, compared with a week ago.\nThe latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine.\nMeanwhile, publicans have case doubt on a suggestion from Mr Johnson that pub-goers might have to prove their vaccination status when venues reopen.\nA government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown. \nMr Johnson said previous coronavirus infections could be a feature, if the certificates are adopted.\n\"There are three basic components. There's the vaccine, there's your immunity you might have had after you've had Covid, and there's testing - they are three things that could work together.\"\nHowever he added: \"No decisions have been taken at all. One thing I will make clear is none of this is obviously going to apply on April 12 when it will all be outdoors anyway.\" \nSpeaking on a visit to a nursery in west London, Mr Johnson said: \"There are some people who for medical reasons can't get a vaccination, pregnant women can't get a vaccination at the moment, you've got to be careful about how you do this.\n\"You might only be able to implement a thorough-going vaccination passport scheme even if you wanted such a thing in the context of when absolutely everybody had been offered a vaccine.\" \nIn the Commons, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who is leading the review, told MPs: \"A system that relied purely on vaccination would not be appropriate.\n\"What would be right was a system that ensured we could open up our economy to the maximum extent that takes into account both vaccine status but also of recent test status and indeed potentially also antibody status as well,\" he added.\nUnder government plans to ease the lockdown in England, pubs will be able to start serving customers indoors - with a size limit applied to groups - from 17 May at the earliest. \nThe idea of asking pub-goers to show a so-called vaccine passport or certificate was raised at Wednesday's House of Commons Liaison Committee hearing when Boris Johnson was asked whether they were \"compatible with a free society such as ours\".\nMr Johnson said the concept \"should not be totally alien to us\" - pointing out that doctors already have to have hepatitis B jabs - although he stressed such a move in future \"may be up to individual publicans\".\nA Downing Street source earlier said the review would include looking at how people's vaccination and testing status could be stored securely and displayed on a mobile phone, and the circumstances under which such a system could apply.\nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said \"all sorts of things were being considered\" and it was \"really a bit premature\" to speculate on details about how a possible vaccine passport would apply to pubs.\nThe boss of Young's pubs said requiring vaccine passports would be \"unworkable\", while Greene King and the City Pub Group also voiced their opposition to any such measure.\nThe chief executive of the Shepherd Neame pub chain said asking pub-goers to show vaccine passports was a \"fairly poorly thought out idea\" he would not be adopting.\nJonathan Neame told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's absolutely fine to exclude people where there is a situation of bad behaviour or drunkenness, and that's already enshrined in law.\n\"But if you're going to exclude people for what they are, or what they have not done, that's a wholly different issue which does touch on discrimination, civil liberties, and in this case data protection issues.\"\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said the industry was \"very nervous\" about the \"damage\" such a measure could do to it and \"the future of the Great British Pub\".\nShe told BBC News: \"They're asking us to enforce this at each venue and that's impossible for some of our venues to do - particularly our smaller community pubs in rural locations.\"\nHowever, Peter Marks, from nightclub owner Rekom UK, said a vaccine certificate \"could work\" in his industry and would probably be accepted by customers already used to carrying IDs to get into venues. However, he said he was concerned introducing such a measure could delay the reopening of businesses.\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Labour was \"happy to look\" at any government proposals for vaccine and testing certification, but he called for clarity for the hospitality industry about how the measures could work in practice. \nHe said the hospitality industry had been through \"incredibly difficult times over the last year\", adding: \"And suddenly the prime minister comes along, out of the blue, to say here's a new responsibility you're going to have to deal with, without much clarity.\"\nSenior Tory backbencher Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Tory Covid Recovery Group, also expressed concern that businesses would be able to turn away customers \"from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine\"."

      "text": "Businesses are reopening and more people are going back to their place of work, as lockdown is lifted.\nMeasures like the furlough scheme have helped to protect jobs during the pandemic, but the number of people out of work is still expected to grow.\nThe most recent unemployment rate - for January to March, when most of the restrictions were still in place - was 4.8%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). \nThe that means about one in 20 people who want a job can't find one.\nThat's more than at the start of the pandemic. \nHowever, despite lockdown, the unemployment rate has fallen slightly since the autumn.\nThis has surprised most economists, who were expecting unemployment to be much higher. \nIt is partly because businesses have become better at coping with lockdowns, as well as the government spending billions of pounds supporting jobs.\nMost economists expect the unemployment rate to rise a little later this year even though it is hoped more restrictions can be lifted.\nThat is because many government support schemes - such as furlough - are due to end after September.\nThe Bank of England expects the unemployment rate to reach around 5.5% in the autumn. \nHowever, the number of unemployed is expected to fall next year as the economy continues to recover. \nYoung people have been particularly badly hit by the pandemic. \nShops, pubs, restaurants and entertainment were unable to fully open and these are areas where lots of young people work. \nOver the past year the number of under-25s on company payrolls fell by 289,000.\nRecord numbers of young people are also choosing to stay in education, and are not looking for work.\nThe ONS said that the latest figures show \"early signs\" of a recovery in the jobs market.\nThere was a rise in the number of vacancies, to the highest level since the pandemic began. \nSome businesses, like restaurants and bars, now say they are struggling to find the workers they need to reopen. \nThe number of people being made redundant has also been falling, though it is still higher than it was before the pandemic began.\nWithout the billions spent on schemes to protect jobs, and the rapid roll-out of vaccines, the unemployment rate would have been much higher. Last year it was feared that up to four million people would be unemployed.\nUnder the furlough scheme, the government has helped many businesses keep their staff on by helping to pay their wages.\nThe furlough scheme has protected more than 11 million jobs since the pandemic began, and four million workers were on furlough at the end of March. The scheme will continue until the end of September.\nThe start of the pandemic saw a big increase in the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits - far more than the rise in the number of people counted as unemployed. \nIn April 2021 there were 2.6 million seeking either Jobseeker's Allowance or universal credit because they were \"searching for work\". This compares with 1.4 million in March 2020, before the pandemic began to take effect. \nHowever, some of these people are working, but with either low wages or short hours. \nThe ONS says it cannot tell how many claimants are out of work, or whether they are now able to get universal credit because the rules for claiming it have changed.

Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

      "text": "More than 700,000 people in Northern Ireland have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \nIt means that nearly half the adult population - 703,334 people - has received at least one jab.\nOfficial figures showed 104,907 people have now received a second dose. \nNo further coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, which means the total number of deaths remains at 2,107.\nThe executive has agreed to introduce \"managed isolation\" for those arriving into NI from certain countries once international flights resume.\nTravellers from so-called \"red list\" countries will have to quarantine in a pre-booked hotel for 10 days, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said.\nPassengers must also complete a pre-departure Covid test and undertake two tests after arrival. \nIt comes after the health minister said foreign travel in the summer should be ruled out.\nThe red list is part of travel regulations aimed at stopping Covid variants entering the UK. \nMs O'Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster were speaking at a joint press conference in Dungannon, County Tyrone, on Thursday.  \nThey revealed the 'R' number, which measures how fast the virus is spreading, is now estimated to be between 0.75 and 0.95. \nThere are currently no direct international flights arriving in Northern Ireland, but passengers can travel from abroad through Dublin and airports in the UK. \nFrom this week, anyone who travels into the Republic of Ireland from from a red list country must now complete a mandatory 14-day quarantine period in a hotel there.\nThe Irish Department of Health said people travelling the Republic of Ireland via Northern Ireland who have been in or through a red list country in the previous 14 days must make their own way to a pre-booked quarantine hotel within four hours.\nEarlier, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said there were ongoing discussions between the Stormont Executive office, and the governments in Dublin and London to ensure there was alignment in terms of travel arrangements for people flying into airports in the Republic of Ireland and the UK. \nDr McBride said co-operation on the issue was \"good\" and progress was being made. \nMs O'Neill said there were too many uncertainties to give assurances over travel. \n\"It's important that we work across these islands in relation to travel,\" Ms O'Neill said. \nMrs Foster said it was too soon to be able to say when people would be able to travel abroad, noting the government's global travel taskforce is not due to report until April.\nThe taskforce is considering a tiered or traffic light system for international travel.\n\"It's perhaps too soon to be booking your holidays, but it is also too soon to be ruling them out,\" Mrs Foster said. \nBrian Ambrose, chief executive of Belfast City Airport, said \"ministers and senior civil servants must carefully consider the severe economic consequences of their public comments\".\n\"As an airport we would never challenge decisions made by the health minister in relation to the running of the health service,\" he said. \u00a0\"However, we would expect decisions on international air travel to emanate from the NI Executive, rather than the health minister or an advisor.\"\nThe executive also agreed the limited reopening of Sure Start and Youth Services programmes. \nPayments will also be extended under two business support schemes - the Covid Restrictions Business Support Scheme (CRBSS), Part A and Part B, and the Large Hospitality and Tourism Business Support Scheme (LHTBSS) will continue beyond 31 March.\nA virologist at Queen's University has also raised concerns about foreign travel in the coming months. \nProfessor Ultan Power told Good Morning Ulster that at least 80% of the population of Northern Ireland should have two doses of a coronavirus vaccine before travel to Europe is allowed again. \nHe said: \"If we have mass foreign travel we run the risk of picking up new variants that may not be covered by the vaccine and that could being us back to a pretty bad place.\"\nHe urged caution, and said it would be a shame if the success of the vaccination rollout in Northern Ireland \"came to naught\" if a vaccine-resistant strain was brought back here because of travel abroad. \n\"We can't lose sight of the fact the virus isn't going away\", he added."

It has been successful, but unemployment has also risen.\nThere were 68,000 people unemployed and looking for work in Wales at the end of 2020 - 23,000 more than a year earlier. \nCaitlyn Morgan, 20, from Fochriw, Caerphilly county, worked in Marks & Spencer in Cardiff on a placement arranged by The Prince's Trust before the pandemic, but has been unemployed ever since and misses work.\n\"I really enjoyed the job, I'm a very people person and this pandemic has been terrible for me.\n\"It was the face-to-face contact, that pride in being able to help someone, organising different things.\n\"Since the pandemic hit and you've been stuck inside, it's been really difficult to get that sense of satisfaction and pride again in the stuff that you do.\"\nThe Prince's Trust said its research showed 48%  of those not working or in education said they \"can't see an end\" to their unemployment.\nWomen in Wales have been part of the Covid Realities project at University of York, sharing online diaries and sharing problems. \nDr Ruth Patrick said families were saying: \"I can't afford to heat this house during the day and so I'm going to have to keep the heating off, be cold, know that my children are cold just so I can put a meal on the table this evening.\"\nOne woman from Wales wrote: \"Before Covid my husband was employed, we were still low income and, with four growing boys, money doesn't stretch far but we were managing.\n\"Then halfway through Covid my husband was made redundant.\" \nShe waited six weeks for her Universal Credit money to arrive.\n\"It's been horrific from one day to the next worrying if we will make it,\" she said.\n\"Through all this three of our sons had birthdays. They knew this year would be different because of Covid, but it was so different and sad seeing their faces when they got a little something each instead of what they asked for.\n\"They didn't even ask for much, what they wanted was only around \u00a315 each and we couldn't do it, my heart hurt for them.\"  \nAnother woman in Wales wrote: \"All our wages go on our bills and food, don't really have any spare... it's hard at the minute, boys need bits for school, paper etc and would like to get some more reading books but prices have rocketed because everyone is at home.\"\nFfion Thompson, 25, from Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, had been working as a nursery assistant and was saving to set up her own business. \nWhen Covid hit she was furloughed and had time to develop her dream - a toddlers' play centre. \nLittle Dino's opened in Usk in November with two staff. Three weeks later, Wales went into lockdown again and the play centre has been closed since. \nHer boyfriend now works from home and she relies on him to pay the bills. \n\"I just remember freezing, the thought 'how am I going to survive? I've got staff to pay, bills to pay, the rent to pay'. \n\"I had so many sleepless nights thinking 'how am I going to afford this?\"\nShe applied for grants, was told she was not eligible, but kept challenging the decision and finally got help.\n\"The next few months could be a struggle but I've got to be optimistic, I've got to keep smiling to keep the staff happy to keep the business running.\" \nWith people doing professional and office jobs generally earning as much as before the pandemic, while shops and restaurants are closed, their savings have increased. \nA report from the Bank of England found 42% of high-income employed households saved more during the pandemic than usual, compared with 22% of low-income working households.\nHouse prices have risen considerably, by 8.5% according to the ONS, unlike during other economic crises, while many owners have redecorated their homes. \nJamie and Richard Price's family business, Quality Carpets Direct, has three south Wales stores.\nRichard Price said customers have \"saved money from going on holidays, saved money not going out as much and happily have spent some of that money on home improvements, paints and carpets\".\n\"We understand the hard times that pubs and restaurants have had, but I think home industries have been better. \n\"When people are in their house so long they want it to look nice and made the best of it and that's been a benefit to us.\"   \nWe cannot know how we will all behave when restrictions end.\nSome believe that those with money will go on a spending spree that will lift the economy and create work. \nOthers are more cautious and think that we may not return to the High Streets and pubs as much as we used to."

      "text": "Two patients were moved to a hospital 300 miles away, because of intensive-care bed shortages during the second UK coronavirus wave, BBC News has learned. \nAn unprecedented 2,300 intensive-care patients moved between UK hospitals from September 2020 to March 2021, in search of beds, data shows. \nFront-line doctors, speaking for the first time, say these transfers were the only way to care for patients. \nNHS England said the health service had responded well under intense pressure.\nIn January this year, the UK's four chief medical officers put out a joint statement saying: \"Without further action, there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed.\"\nAnd measures were taken to cope with the increased demand:\nBut ICU staff reported specialist nurses, who normally look after one patient each, were caring for three, four or - in one instance - five. \nAnd data from the UK's Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) shows almost three times more patients than usual were moved to different hospitals - sometimes hundreds of miles away from their home.\nBetween September 2018 and March 2019, in comparison, there were just 789 such transfers. \nIn London, one of the \"hotspots\" for transfers, doctors set up their own schemes to organise the movement of patients.\nCritical-care consultant Dr Mamoun Abu-Habsa was instrumental in setting up a pandemic transfer service before the second wave hit.\nForeseeing the pressures ICUs could face, he sourced an ambulance and equipment, and trained nurses and doctors so they could accompany patients being transferred.\nWhere hospitals were close to capacity, Dr Abu-Habsa said, moving patients made a huge difference to their care.\n\"We were taking patients across from hospitals that were close to their critical levels of oxygen supply, or the last ventilated bed, to hospitals that were under somewhat less pressure,\" he said.\n\"That was absolutely life-saving.\"\nFew NHS staff have been prepared to speak out about the extent of patient transfers during the second wave, because of the sensitivities around moving such fragile patients because of bed shortages. \nBut Dr Abu Habsa wants people to know how carefully the transfers were handled - and why doctors felt they had no choice.\n\"No-one wants their patients to be taken away from them to complete their journey of care at another centre,\" he told BBC News. \n\"That's not how you are wired as a medical professional. \n\"But they were also very acutely aware that under the circumstances the particular hospitals were under, that was the only option to preserve access to life support.\"\nThe latest figures show one in eight patients had to be moved from hotspots in London and the Midlands, with more than a quarter of these travelling long distances.\nAmong the furthest were:\nIn January, the lord mayor of Stoke-on-Trent's chauffeur, Ashley Harvey, was admitted to the city's hospital, with severe breathing difficulties due to Covid-19.\nDays later, despite being in an induced coma and on a ventilator, he was transferred to Salford hospital - one hour away. \nHis family say they were told it was to make room for a surge of patients coming up from the South.\n\"I'm aware that they had nine patients come from London, who were having a displacement of patients coming into the hospitals up and down the country - somebody would have made a difficult decision,\" Mr Harvey said \nHis daughter Louise was home from university when the family were told Ashley was being moved.\n\"They were saying that he was well enough to do that journey - and make space for someone that's worse,\" she said. \n\"It's insane to think that someone could be worse, because he was very poorly,\" but that \"sort of gave us a bit of hope\", she added.\nIn Birmingham, Dr Nitin Arora, a leading member the Intensive Care Society, said, at the worst point, 40% of ICU patients in some hospitals had to be moved - and without the transfers, more people would have died. \n\"We would have seen scenes like in Italy, triaging by age, scenes like New York, where some hospitals had mortality rates five times higher than others because they were working on a seven-to-one ratio,\" he said. \n\"The transfer service was one of the winners in this pandemic.\"\nThe UK has a relatively low proportion of intensive-care beds compared with similar countries - and the pandemic pushed that capacity almost to the limit. \nDr Abu-Hapsa says that must now change.\n\"The shortage of critical care beds in the UK was absolutely felt during the pandemic,\" he said..\n\"There were contingencies in place to redistribute the pressure load from London to other parts of England  - but none the less, the reality remains we were very close to breaking point.\"\nAn NHS official said: \"Each patient transfer only occurred after direct agreement between intensive-care clinicians and senior doctors that it was safe and right to do so and always happened under the supervision of a specialist transfer team. \n\"Being able to provide mutual support in this way is one of the advantages of having a truly national health service and prevented regions being overwhelmed, as happened in some other countries, even when our hospitals admitted more than 100,000 Covid patients in a single month.\""

They still need our protection now,\" he said.\nThe \"red list\" is part of travel regulations aimed at stopping Covid variants entering the UK.\nThe health minister said the health system in Northern Ireland had been particularly strained in recent years compared with neighbouring jurisdictions. \nNorthern Ireland has begun taking its first steps out of lockdown, after restrictions were re-imposed nearly three months ago.\nThe current rules came into force on 26 December, in a bid to suppress the spread of Covid-19.\nBut ministers have agreed some relaxations of the rules can now be permitted.\nOn Wednesday, no further coronavirus-related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, meaning the total number of deaths remains at 2,107. \nWhile there are no direct international flights arriving into Northern Ireland at the moment, Mr Swann said the executive was looking at establishing a hotel quarantine system for international arrivals.\n\"Should direct flights start, we will have that facility here as well,\" Mr Swann told a press briefing on Wednesday. \nSimon Hamilton, the chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said the health minister's comments on foreign travel would cause alarm. \nHe said there would be \"many in the tourism industry\" who will be \"very disappointed to hear speculative comments that have not be endorsed and backed and supported by the executive\". \nMeanwhile Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said a change in the advice for people who are clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to Covid-19 was planned.\nSince 26 December, CEV people have been advised to adhere to additional steps to keep themselves safe from exposure to the Covid-19, including advice not to attend their workplace if they can work from home. \nThat will now ease from 12 April. \n\"This is an important step to helping CEV people re-engage with everyday life with confidence,\" he said.\nDr Patricia Donnelly, head of NI's vaccination programme, said the target of reaching all adult age groups by the summer is \"firmly within our sights\".\nA total of 694,863 individuals have received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 96,254 have received two.\nDr Donnelly said that meant almost half of the adult population in Northern Ireland had been vaccinated. \nShe said the vaccination centre in the SSE Arena in Belfast would open on 29 March and more than 300 community pharmacies would also join the vaccination programme next week. \nCurrently, anyone over the age of 50 and those with some underlying health conditions are eligible for a coronavirus vaccine.\nThe SSE Arena will operate alongside the seven regional vaccination centres run by health trusts across Northern Ireland as well as GP practices.\nDr Donnelly also warned those who are trying to \"inappropriately access the service\" that \"they might travel as far as they like, they won't get vaccinated\".\n\"It's going to be a wasted journey for anyone who does it,\" she said. \nIt has emerged that hundreds of people from the Republic of Ireland have been turned away from vaccinations centres in Northern Ireland in recent days.\nMeanwhile the Department of Health has said it is investigating an apparent glitch in its online vaccination booking system.\nIt says a number of appointments were booked by people who were not yet eligible.\nThe BBC understands an online link, enabling people to bypass eligibility criteria questions, was circulating on some social media platforms for some time on Tuesday.\nIn a tweet issued on Wednesday, the department said: \"Yesterday some members of the public in NI who are not yet eligible to receive a Covid-19 vaccine were able to make an appointment. \n\"This was as a result of an issue with the system's eligibility checker and we are looking into the circumstances that allowed this - but we want to clarify that such appointments are being cancelled.\n\"Ineligible appointments will in any event be turned away at the vaccination centre through checks that apply there. \n\"Our thanks to the vast majority of people who are using our services properly.\""

The Coronavirus Act was introduced in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.\nThe government review of vaccine certification could report in May to coincide with the wider reopening of hospitality in England, according to a senior government source.\nThe review is looking at how people's vaccination and testing status could be stored securely and displayed on a mobile phone, and the circumstances under which such a system could apply.\nThe idea of asking pub goers to show a vaccine certificate was raised at Wednesday's House of Commons Liaison Committee hearing, when Conservative William Wragg asked Mr Johnson if vaccine certificates were \"compatible with a free society such as ours\".\nMr Johnson said the concept \"should not be totally alien to us\" as doctors already have to have hepatitis B jabs.\nMr Wragg then asked, what about \"ordinary citizens going to the pub?\" and the prime minister replied: \"That's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans.\"\nPushed further, Mr Johnson said: \"I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it\" adding that the public \"want me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them\".\nMr Johnson also said it seemed \"wholly responsible\" for care companies to require their workers to be vaccinated and \"the principle is there\" in terms of professions requiring certain vaccines when \"entrusted with care of a patient\".\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Jonathan Neame, chief executive of the Shepherd Neame pub chain, said his company would not insist on vaccine certificates.  \nHe said: \"The whole essence of a pub is that they are diverse and inclusive environments, where everybody, and families in particular, are extremely welcome.\"\nHe added: \"It's absolutely fine to exclude people where there is a situation of bad behaviour or drunkenness, and that's already enshrined in law, but if you're going to exclude people for what they are, or what they have not done, that's a wholly different issue which does touch on discrimination, civil liberties, and in this case data protection issues.\"\nPeter Marks, from nightclub owner the Deltic Group, said a vaccine certificate \"could work\" for the sector and would probably be accepted by customers already used to carrying IDs to get into venues. However, he said he was concerned introducing such a measure could delay the reopening of businesses.  \nMinisters, and the devolved administrations, have set out plans for how the rules they imposed will be rolled back.\nBut there are still question marks over what will take the place of the laws we have lived with for so long.\nMr Johnson was happy to sketch out how that question could in part be answered, in a way that not all of his party will like.\nHe made clear that he was willing to countenance the idea of \"jabs for jobs\" and held open the possibility that bars might ask for \"papers for pints\".\nWhen tests are widely available, proof of a negative test, is also being considered as a tool to help venues open up\nThe government is reluctant to make any of this compulsory for everyone.\nBut it seems that proving our Covid status, through the vaccination, or a test, is likely to be part of our lives in the medium term.\nRead more from Laura here. \nAt the Liaison Committee hearing, senior Tory backbencher Mr Baker strongly rejected the suggestion of requiring pub goers to show proof they had been vaccinated, saying: \"First they said we'll need them to watch the football, and today that it may be papers for the pub.\"\nHe warned that such a situation would prevent pregnant women - who have been advised not to take the vaccine - from \"taking part in society\".\nHe also expressed concern that business would be able to turn away customers \"from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine\".\n\"We must not fall into this ghastly trap,\" he said. \nDowning Street later pointed out that pregnant women are not specifically being advised to avoid having a Covid vaccination, but to discuss it with their GP.\nKate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the sector should not be \"subject to mandatory vaccination certification\".\n\"It is simply unworkable, would cause conflict between staff and customers and almost certainty result in breaches of equality rules,\" she added."

      "tags": "Britney Spears,Music",
      "text": "Britney Spears' lawyer has formally asked a judge to permanently remove the pop star's father from his role overseeing her personal affairs.\nThe singer's life has been controlled by a court-ordered conservatorship since 2008 after her public breakdown.\nA temporary conservator, Jodi Montgomery, was appointed in 2019 after her father Jamie Spears stepped down due to health issues.\nSpears is now requesting that Montgomery be made permanent.\nSpears' conservatorship is split into two parts - one is for her estate and financial affairs, the other is for her as a person.\nThe singer's father Jamie used to be in control of both, but stepped down from being her personal conservator in 2019 due to health reasons. \nHe remained a co-conservator of her estate alongside financial company the Bessemer Trust.\nJodi Montgomery, a care professional, replaced Jamie Spears as the singer's personal conservator on what has been a temporary basis.\nAt the most recent hearing into 39-year-old's conservatorship, Britney Spears' lawyer Samuel D Ingham III told a judge in Los Angeles he would file a petition to make Montgomery's appointment permanent.\nIn addition, court papers show Spears has asked her father to resign from his role overseeing her personal life.\nThe legal documents also state Spears reserves the right to eventually request an end to the conservatorship.\nThe papers say: \"Petitioner expressly reserves the right to petition for termination of this conservatorship under Probate Code section 1861. Nothing in the within petition shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of that right.\"\nBritney Spears' lawyer previously told the court she was scared of her father and would not be returning to the stage while he remained in control of her life.\nEarlier this year, Jamie Spears' lawyer Vivian Thoreen said he is \"a fiercely loving, dedicated and loyal father\" who had stopped Britney from being exploited.\nAs her permanent personal conservator, Montgomery would have the power to \"restrict and limit\" visitors - aside from Ingham - to Spears.\nMontgomery would also be able to speak with medical professionals about Spears and would have access to her medical records.\nShe would also have the ability to retain caretakers and security guards for the singer, and powers to prosecute civil harassment restraining orders on the star's behalf.\nAlthough he is not currently acting as his daughter's personal conservator, Jamie Spears remains a co-conservator of his daughter's finances.\nHe oversees her estimated $60m (\u00a343.8m) estate alongside private wealth management firm the Bessemer Trust.\nJamie Spears previously requested the financial company be removed as co-conservator, but a judge ruled in February that he must continue to share the financial conservatorship with the trust. \nUnder the current legal agreement, Britney Spears has not controlled her own finances since 2008.\nThe next hearing in the case is set to take place in April.\nBritney Spears' life and career returned to the headlines following last month's release of the acclaimed documentary, Framing Britney Spears.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Virginia has become the first Southern US state to abolish the death penalty after its governor signed into law a bill that ends capital punishment.\nGovernor Ralph Northam said the repeal would stop a \"machinery of death\" with a history of racial disparities.\nIt comes at a time of renewed national debate on the topic of executions.\nVirginia has executed more people than any other state except Texas since capital punishment was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1976.\nSince then, the vast majority of executions have taken place in the Southern US states that made up the former slave-owning Confederacy.\nExecutions are still authorised in 27 states across the country, though several have enacted a moratorium on carrying the punishment out.\nA federal moratorium was ended by former President Donald Trump, who resumed them on a federal level last year after a 17-year hiatus. Some 13 people were put to death in a matter of months - including six executions carried out after his election defeat.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Joe Biden vowed to end the federal death penalty and encourage states to follow suit, but has not addressed the issue as president.\nVirginia has used the death penalty nearly 1,400 times since its days as a colony, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\nDemocrats, who control the state legislature, pushed for its repeal, arguing it had disproportionately hurt people of colour, the mentally ill and the poor.\nAt the bill signing, Mr Northam noted 296 of the 377 people executed by the state in the 20th century were black.\nThe last two men on death row in the state, both black, will now see their sentences converted to life in prison without parole.\nThe United Nations says 170 of its 194 member states have abolished executions in law or practice and the US has faced repeated international criticism over its failure to do so."

      "text": "Prime ministers' appearances in front of Parliament's most senior MPs are rarely short of news. \nOn Wednesday, the prime minister suggested that if he and the EU can't make peace over vaccines, he might be willing to hit back, if they take dramatic action. \nHe suggested that before too long, the UK's nearest continental neighbour, France, might end up on the list of countries that attract the toughest travel restrictions, the 'red list', even though that would cause, as he detailed, significant disruption. \nMost noticeably however, the PM gave some big hints at what life might look like as we come out of the most stringent lockdowns. \nMinisters, and the administrations in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff, have set out plans for how the rules they imposed will be rolled back, as long as the virus ticks down in the way that everyone hopes and the vaccine programme continues. \nBut there are still significant question marks over what will take the place of the laws we have lived with for so long. \nIn other words, how does the government propose to manage the disease in the long term when lockdown ends? \nMr Johnson today was happy to sketch out how that question could in part be answered, in a way that not all of his party will like. \nHe made clear that he was willing to countenance the idea of 'jabs for jobs' - suggesting that it was responsible for care home owners for example, to be making vaccination compulsory for their staff, those many thousands of workers who look after some of society's most vulnerable. \nAnd the prime minister held open the possibility that bars and restaurants might ask for 'papers for pints', suggesting that the use of vaccine certificates could be up to individual landlords. \nMinisters are reviewing how any of these kinds of arrangements would work in practice. \nThe government is not going to mandate that everyone is jabbed. \nWhen tests are widely and freely available, proof of a negative test, is also being considered as a tool that could be used to help venues open up, and life start getting back to something like normal. \nNo one is likely to be forced to take one. \nBut just as school pupils are taking them regularly now, and increasing numbers of workplaces, the normalising of Covid testing is a valuable tool.  \nIf tests are available in walk-in centres, to be sent to homes, or even distributed outside a pub or theatre, it's harder to argue that any member of the public is excluded. \nThe government is reluctant to make any of this compulsory for everyone, whatever the circumstance. But it seems that proving our Covid status, through the vaccination, or a test,  is likely to be part of our lives in the medium term. "

      "tags": "Cash,Money,Personal finance,Bank of England",
      "text": "The design of the Bank of England's new \u00a350 note, featuring the computer pioneer and codebreaker Alan Turing, has been revealed.\nThe banknote will enter circulation on 23 June, which would have been the mathematician's birthday.\nIt will be the last of the Bank's collection to switch from paper to polymer. In keeping with Alan Turing's work, the set is its most secure yet.\nOld paper \u00a350 notes will still be accepted in shops for some time.\nThe work of Alan Turing, who was educated in Sherborne, Dorset, helped accelerate Allied efforts to read German Naval messages enciphered with the Enigma machine. His work is said to have been key to shortening World War Two and saving lives.\nLess celebrated is the pivotal role he played in the development of early computers, first at the National Physical Laboratory and later at the University of Manchester.\nIn 2013, he was given a posthumous royal pardon for his 1952 conviction for gross indecency. He had been arrested after having an affair with a 19-year-old Manchester man, and was forced to take female hormones as an alternative to prison. He died at the age of 41. An inquest recorded his death as suicide.\nAndrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said: \"He was a leading mathematician, developmental biologist, and a pioneer in the field of computer science. \n\"He was also gay, and was treated appallingly as a result. By placing him on our new polymer \u00a350 banknote, we are celebrating his achievements, and the values he symbolises.\"\nThe Bank is flying the rainbow flag above its Threadneedle Street building in London as a result. \nHowever, campaigners are still questioning how much the Bank's collection of banknotes represents society. Three feature men - Winston Churchill on the \u00a35 note, JMW Turner on the \u00a320 note, and soon Alan Turing on the \u00a350 note. Only the \u00a310 note, with the portrait of Jane Austen, depicts a woman apart from the Queen, and all are white.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Mr Bailey said he wanted to see diverse ethnic minorities represented on future banknotes. \nHe added that the portrait of Mr Turing on the new \u00a350 note was an important symbol of diversity. \nWhat features are on the note?\nSteam engine pioneers James Watt and Matthew Boulton appear on the current \u00a350 note, issued in 2011.\nThe new note will feature: \nThere are also a series of security features, similar to other notes, including holograms, see-through windows - based partly on images of Bletchley Park - and foil patches.\nThe Bank also says that plastic banknotes are more durable and harder to forge.\nSarah John, the Bank's chief cashier whose signature features on the note, said: \"This new \u00a350 note completes our set of polymer banknotes. These are much harder to counterfeit, and with its security features the new \u00a350 is part of our most secure series of banknotes yet.\"\nThe \u00a350 note is the least likely to be in people's wallets or purses. \nThere were 351 million \u00a350 notes in circulation last year, out of a total of nearly four billion Bank of England notes.\nThe government has previously discussed whether it should be abolished.\nThe banknote was described by Peter Sands, former chief executive of Standard Chartered bank, as the \"currency of corrupt elites, of crime of all sorts and of tax evasion\".\nThe debate continues, with the added element that cash use has declined, particularly during the Covid pandemic.\nThe UK's intelligence agency GCHQ has set what it describes as its toughest ever puzzle to mark the new note. \nTwelve puzzles - called the Turing Challenge - increase in complexity leading to one final answer. The agency's in-house experts claim that 'an experienced puzzler' should be able to complete it in just seven hours. \nFew clues are provided other than that each is based on unique design elements of the banknote, including technical drawings for the device designed by Turing during World War Two to break the German Enigma code at Bletchley Park. \nAlthough Turing was, among other accomplishments, the co-creator of the first computer chess programme he claimed not to be that good at puzzles himself. \nThe new note though marks another step in the recognition of a man whose wartime work was secret, and who took his own life soon after his conviction for homosexuality in 1952. \n\"Turing was embraced for his brilliance and persecuted for being gay,\" said current GCHQ Director Fleming. \"His legacy is a reminder of the value of embracing all aspects of diversity, but also the work we still need to do to become truly inclusive.\" "

The doctors said they had never seen a baby so small not need any help,\" she said. \nHowever, the twins had to be cared for in different units after Louie had complications and his lungs collapsed.   \nMiss Hough said he was \"much better now\" and the twins were finally reunited on Tuesday.\n\"It was horrible when they were separated at birth but I cried tears of joy when they got back together,\" she said.\n\"They were wrapping their legs around each other and cuddling, even holding hands at one point. They were so cute.\"\nMiss Hough said doctors hoped the twins could go home by May.  \n\"Everyone is made up with them. We are desperate to welcome them home,\" she said.  \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram? You can also send story ideas to northwest.newsonline@bbc.co.uk"
