      "text": "The Scottish government has announced a further easing of the Covid rules.\nGuidance urging people to work from home wherever possible is to be relaxed in favour of a \"hybrid\" system of office and remote working from Monday 31 January.\nRestrictions on large outdoor events came to an end on 17 January, then rules on indoor events and venues, including the need for table service in hospitality premises, were lifted on 24 January.\nNew guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday 31 January.\nThis will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.\nBusinesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.\nThe requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be reduced from 2m to 1m from 31 January.\nAnd face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.\nFrom Friday 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland.\nThose who are not fully vaccinated will still have to take a pre-departure test no more than two days before they travel, then take a PCR test on or before day two after their arrival.\nA raft of new measures introduced in December in response to the spread of the Omicron variant have already been removed.\nThese included limits on the number of people who could attend large public events; restrictions in pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places; and the closure of nightclubs.\nAdults and children aged 12 and over still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as before, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport.\nBusinesses are legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid, including physical distancing and screens.\nIn hospitality, face coverings can be removed while dancing, drinking and dining. Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "text": "The Queen's Speech, on Tuesday, will allow the government to set out what laws it wants to pass. This could include areas like planning, the environment and social care.\nThe Queen's Speech provides the government with an opportunity to highlight its priorities for the months ahead.\nIt forms part of the State Opening of Parliament ceremony, which marks the start of the parliamentary year. \nNormally, the ceremony begins with a procession, in which the Queen travels from Buckingham Palace to Westminster - usually by carriage. \nHowever, in light of the pandemic:\nBefore the speech, MPs are summoned to the House of Lords by an official known as Black Rod. Before entering the Commons, Black Rod has the doors shut in their face, symbolising the chamber's independence from the monarchy. \nDuring the speech - read from the throne of the House of Lords - the Queen sets out the laws the government wants Parliament to approve. \nIt is usually given in the presence of MPs, peers and other dignitaries in the House of Lords. However, only 74 people - including the Queen - will be allowed in the chamber on this occasion, because of Covid restrictions.\nNormally, a Queen's Speech happens once a year - usually in spring or after a general election.\nThe last one, on 19 December 2019, enabled Boris Johnson to set out his agenda, one week after winning the general election.\nThe 2019 Queen's Speech set out more than 30 pieces of proposed legislation, known as bills. \nThere was a heavy focus on Brexit, as the UK was preparing to leave the EU in a few weeks' time.\nNow Brexit is less of an issue, the government is expecting to announce a much broader programme. \nThis could include:\nSome legislation started or drafted in the last session but not completed in time is also likely to be carried over, including\nMr Johnson wanted to hold a Queen's Speech after becoming prime minister in July 2019.\nBut his initial attempt was blocked by the Supreme Court over the length of time Parliament was to be closed - known as prorogation - before it was held. Critics said Mr Johnson was trying to stop MPs scrutinising his Brexit plans and the suspension was far longer than necessary to hold a Queen's Speech.\nDespite the controversy, Mr Johnson did eventually hold a Queen's Speech on 14 October.\nIt is written by ministers but delivered by the Queen.\nIts length depends on the number of proposed laws and other announcements - such as foreign policy objectives - but it normally takes about 10 minutes.\nYes.\nAbout two hours after the speech is delivered, MPs reassemble in the House of Commons to begin debating its contents.\nAfter introductory speeches by two MPs, the prime minister will \"sell\" the speech to the Commons, setting out their vision for the country.\nThe leader of the opposition then gets their chance to respond, before other MPs are allowed to contribute. \nThe debate on what is known as the \"Humble Address\" normally lasts about five days.\nAt the end of the debate there is a vote. It's normally seen as symbolic, as it is extremely rare for a government to lose it.\nIn fact, the last time a government lost the vote was in January 1924, under Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Mr Baldwin proceeded with a King's Speech -   George V was the monarch at the time - despite having lost his majority in the previous month's general election. "

      "tags": "TikTok,Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Scottish Qualifications Authority has written to schools about \"very serious\" incidents of students sharing details of assessments on social media.\nFormal exams were cancelled this year because of Covid but students are instead sitting assessments.\nEach school has its own arrangements but the SQA has provided question papers which they can use.\nIt has emerged that pupils who have already sat the \"exams\" have been sharing information on the Tiktok app.\nFollowing reports of thousands of students discussing the questions on social media, the SQA wrote to schools on Monday to tell them they needed to investigate candidate malpractice and apply the \"appropriate penalties\".\nIn a message, titled \"Maintaining the confidentiality of secure assessment materials\", the SQA's director of qualifications development Dr Gill Stewart said it was taking the matter very seriously.\nShe said the SQA, which is responsible for Scotland's senior phase qualifications such as Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers, had provided \"optional secure assessment materials\" to schools which included question papers and marking instructions.\nDr Stewart said the SQA wrote to all schools and colleges on 20 April about the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of the material. \nHowever, with all schools scheduling the assessments at different times, pupils have been sharing information about what is in them on social media.\nThe Scottish government and Scottish Qualifications Authority say results should be based on teacher judgement backed up by evidence. This evidence is to be gathered through assessments, although the SQA says there is no requirement to sit prelims or a full formal exam diet. \nThere are differences in the approaches schools are taking.\nSome are staging what looks and feels very much like an exam diet, with study leave and assessments being carried out in games halls, under exam conditions.\nMany schools, however, are doing these assessments in class time, with some pupils scheduled to sit up to three assessments in one day, alongside \"normal\" classes for other subjects. This is the model which most closely reflects the guidance given by the SQA.\nOne National 5 pupil told us that the usual seven to nine final exams had been replaced by the stresses of more than 20 assessments, or \"mini exams\".\nA parent of a Higher pupil said the goalposts had been moved, and that her son was \"stressed out the point of being ill\".\nThe SQA said maintaining security and confidentiality was required for the integrity of the assessments and to ensure fairness for students.\nIt called for schools to investigate malpractice and apply penalties where it is found, although it did not say what those should be.\nEducation Secretary John Swinney announced in October that National 5 exams would not go ahead for second year in a row, but the Higher exams were not cancelled until mid-December.\nAt the time, Mr Swinney said that instead of exams there would be a new model that would \"base awards on teacher judgement of evidence of learner attainment\".\nFollowing a surge in new cases of Covid-19 in December, schools were closed to most pupils for more than three months.\nMost senior phase students did not return to school buildings until after the Easter holidays in the middle of April.\nMany complained that despite having to learn remotely since the New Year they were told at short notice there would be a \"final assessment\" after the Easter holidays on which their grade would be primarily based.\nThey said the assessments were \"exams by another name\" but were being sat with much less preparation - and without study leave.\nThe approach across schools varies with some spreading the tests over several class lesson times but others doing them all in one go, with invigilators on hand to make sure strict exam conditions are met.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"The SQA is taking action following reports of incidents involving candidates sharing confidential assessment content and is contacting schools and colleges to ensure that posts are removed as soon as possible and to reiterate the importance of security arrangements around assessment materials. \n\"Unlike with exams, schools have flexibility when setting assessments for this year's qualifications to take account of the disruption to learning that their pupils have experienced as a result of the pandemic.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Wales business,Welsh government,Cinemas,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Only a \"small minority\" of cinemas in Wales will be able to reopen next week under current restrictions, according to an industry trade body.\nConfirmation is expected on Friday that cinemas can reopen from 17 May.\nBut the UK Cinema Association said regulations were different in Wales to the other nations, with venues following the same, stricter rules as indoor hospitality.\nThe Welsh government said cinemas would open \"when safe to do so\".\nPhil Clapp, chief executive of the association which represents 90% of the industry including big cinema chains, said because many cinemas were licensed for the sale of alcohol it meant Welsh officials had \"lumped them in\" with pubs and restaurants. \nHe said the rules in Wales differed to England and Scotland in three ways.\nUnder Welsh government guidelines the following rules will apply to cinemas:\nMr Clapp said the rules were \"impractical and unnecessary\".\n\"So even if a customer just walks up to a concession stand to buy a tub of popcorn, they have to be seated,\" he said.\n\"For many of the smaller venues there simply isn't the space for that kind of seating.\n\"And it will cause queuing and all manner of problems which we presume these restrictions are intended to avoid.\"\nCinemas in Wales have been closed since 4 December with a return now much anticipated, according to Mr Clapp. \n\"I would say the mood in the industry is one of frustration, you know, there is a huge amount of excitement and optimism about the return of cinema,\" he said.\n\"Finding an administrative barrier to that late in the day and unnecessarily we would say, in terms of the safe-guarding of customers and staff, is hugely frustrating.\"\nMr Clapp also said while cinemas were selling tickets for showings from next week, the likes of Cineworld and Showcase had said they would not be able to open, with Vue and Odeon having a \"significant rethink\" on whether they can reopen.\nCineworld has venues in Llandudno, Broughton, Cardiff and Newport, while Showcase has a single cinema in Nantgarw.\nVue has cinemas in Rhyl, Carmarthenshire, Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil, Cwmbran and Swansea, and there are Odeons in Wrexham, Llanelli, Swansea and Bridgend.\nMr Clapp said the rules were also a \"nonsense\" for the many smaller venues in Wales and the issues around collecting contact details and being seated for food were \"magnified\" for them.\nHe continued: \"I very much fear that when we come to next Monday, even if cinemas are allowed to open, only a small minority of cinemas in Wales will feel they can viably reopen.\"\nBeth Watkins is chair of the trustees of the Market Hall Cinema in Brynmawr - which has been closed since mid March 2020 and has not set a date to reopen.\nShe said: \"Most disappointingly for us is the fact that small independent cinemas, and many of them are charities like us, are being included in hospitality.\n\"We don't have a bar, we don't serve alcohol, we don't serve food but we still fall within that category.\n\"Organising for someone to be able to order a box of popcorn or a bar of chocolate from their seat is impossible for us.\n\"Social distancing means that out of our 195 seats around 40 tickets can be sold.  So for us it is not financially viable to reopen. You build your hopes and then suddenly you're hit by this red tape.\"\nSteve Reynolds is director of Picturedrome Cinemas, which runs the Maxime Cinema in Blackwood, which will reopen on Monday.\nHe said: \"When we were told cinemas could open we put our programmes on sale and we've sold 750 tickets so far just for Peter Rabbit without the other films.\n\"Obviously we've got this obstacle now with the food and drink which has to be delivered to the seats.  We are looking at ways around that - click and collect where you can order when you reserve your tickets but it's a very difficult situation for us.\"\nChapter Arts Centre, in Cardiff, will reopen its cinema at about 30% capacity on Monday, if permitted, its chairwoman Elin Wyn told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme.\nMs Wyn said the anticipated rules would not affect Chapter as much as the bigger chains because it had never allowed customers to eat or drink inside its two cinemas.\n\"The thing that would make the biggest difference for us, is if they decided to relax the 2m rule,\" she said.\n\"If they took it down to a metre or got rid of social distancing altogether - that's what would really change things. We could then get more people into our cinemas.\"\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"We have been working closely with Ffilm Cymru and UK Cinema Association to prepare for the opening of cinemas when it is safe to do so.\n\"Contact tracing is an important and effective part of keeping people safe.\n\"Cinemas have been and continue to receive support from the Welsh government's Culture Recovery Fund (CRF). Those within larger arts centres may also have received assistance from the CRF delivered via the Arts Council of Wales.\n\"The first minister will set out the results of the next coronavirus restrictions regulations on Friday and confirm whether cinemas can reopen in Wales next week.\""

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Most of Scotland will move to level two next Monday in the latest easing of Covid restrictions.\nThe new changes mean that three households will be be able to mix indoors and pubs can serve alcohol inside.\nHowever, cases have begun to rise slightly in recent days and health officials are dealing with a serious outbreak in north-east Scotland.\nHere are five figures which indicate the state of the pandemic in Scotland.\nThe emergence of the Kent Covid variant in the weeks before Christmas drove a massive spike in cases in Scotland.\nAt the beginning of the year, the number of weekly cases per 100,000 people in Scotland almost reached 300, triggering a full lockdown which lasted almost four months.\nCases have mainly been falling since January, although there was a small rise in mid-March after Scotland's primary school pupils returned to classrooms.\nHowever, the decline has been flattening and has actually begun to increase in recent days.\nOn Monday, the rate was 24 weekly cases per 100,000 people in Scotland - the fifth day in a row the rate has risen. The Scottish government believes this increase is \"largely driven\" by the Moray outbreak.\nDespite the recent increase, Scotland is still categorised as having a \"moderate\" level of community transmission, using a World Health Organization (WHO) system for measuring infection levels, with the rate sitting just above the \"low\" threshold.\nLooking at a local authority breakdown of case rates across Scotland, there is one stand-out exception.\nInfection levels have been rising in Moray since the beginning of April and the rate was almost 94 cases per 100,000 on 7 May - well above the 50-case threshold for level three.\nThe area has seen relatively low levels of Covid throughout most of the pandemic, but the rate in Moray is more than four times the Scotland-wide rate.\nHealth officials have said the area is experiencing \"uncontrolled, sustained community transmission\" of the virus and it is not yet clear if the outbreak has peaked.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was \"highly probable\" that Moray would remain in level three from 17 May, with travel restrictions in and out of the area,\n\"Unless the situation were to materially improve over the next few days, it would simply not be safe or sensible to ease restrictions there,\" she said.\nAs of 7 May, there were 12 local authorities with infection rates above the Scotland-wide level, but only Moray is above the level three threshold.\nThe Scottish government also takes into account other measures, like pressure on local health services, when deciding the local authority levels.\nLooking at Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the number of new deaths is at a similar level to where it was at the end of the summer.\nOnly one death has been registered since the beginning of the month, giving Scotland a Covid death rate of 0.018 deaths per 100,000 people.\nThis rate has come down from a peak of eight weekly deaths per 100,000 in January as the Kent variant was spreading rapidly.\nA total of 7,661 people have died in Scotland following a positive test for Covid-19.\nHowever, if you count all death certificates that mention Covid-19, the death toll is 10,097, according to the National Records of Scotland.\nThe Scottish government says this sustained decline in the death rate has been achieved through a combination of people sticking to lockdown rules, and the vaccination of those most vulnerable to becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19.\nAccording to the WHO thresholds, the death rate in Scotland indicates \"low\" levels of community transmission.\nIn the week up to 28 April - the most recent figures available from Public Health Scotland - 62 people were admitted to Scottish hospitals for Covid treatment.\nThe last time the figure was this low was 9 September, but then the trajectory was very much up rather than the sustained decline seen now.\nThe number of weekly admissions never reached zero over the summer, but did get down to eight in mid-July before beginning to rise again.\nThe rate of admissions per 100,000 is currently 1.1, giving Scotland a \"low\" level of community transmission according to the WHO thresholds.\nAccording to Scottish government figures, close to three million people had received a first dose of a Covid vaccine by 9 May - almost 65% of the total population aged 16 or over.\nAbout 1.5 million people are now fully vaccinated having received both doses of a vaccine.\nIt's clear from the chart below that there's been a big push on second doses in recent weeks, completing the vaccination of the many thousands who were given a first dose in February.\nHowever, the daily number of first doses being administered appears to be on the rise again. \nThe Scottish government also says that everyone in the nine priority groups, as set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has now been offered a vaccine.\nVaccination targets in the 60-64, 70-74 and 75-79 age groups have been met and are close to completion in the 55-59, 65-69 and 85-plus age groups.\nPeople in their 40s should now be receiving their vaccination invitations in the post. The Scottish government is aiming to offer a vaccine to everyone aged 16 or over by the end of July.\nThe WHO outlines five \"situational levels\" ranging from level zero, when there should be \"no restrictions\" on daily activities, up to level four which requires a full lockdown to tackle an \"uncontrolled epidemic\".\nUsing measures like Covid deaths, cases and hospital admissions, the WHO system indicates that Scotland is likely to be in level one.\nThat's where the organisation recommends that \"basic measures\" should remain in place to prevent Covid infections spreading, but any disruptions to social and economic life should be \"limited and transient\".\nThere are a couple of important caveats to note about the WHO guidelines, which were published in November.\nFirstly, they were written before vaccines were approved for use and so do not take into account a country's vaccination programme.\nSecondly, the advice also came out before the widespread emergence of new strains of Covid-19, which can be more transmissible and in some cases more deadly too."

I think that's the only thing that will persuade people that is it safe.\"\nSally Holland, Wales' Children's Commissioner, said: \"While a few young people have said they feel safer wearing a mask in the classroom, and others say they accept it because they are keen to be in school even with restrictions, many others have raised with me difficulties they experience.\n\"This includes feeling discomfort, difficulties communicating, skin problems and steaming up of glasses. \n\"The government has assured me that the advice to wear face coverings in classrooms will be removed when advised by health experts.\"\nPupils have been required to wear masks in all areas except the classroom since November, and these rules were expanded to include the classroom as children returned to school following the Christmas break.\nThe Welsh government is due to announce the results of the latest lockdown review on Friday."

      "text": "Millions of Apple's UK customers should be compensated for breaches of competition law, a legal action claims. \nThe case, filed with the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), alleges Apple's 30% commission on app sales is an abuse of dominance and unlawful. \nOrganisers are aiming to include nearly 20 million UK users in the collective action, if it is approved. \nThose behind the claim say they intend to seek damages of up to \u00a31.5bn. Apple said the legal action was \"meritless\".\nWhile the UK does not have the same kind of class-action legal structure as the US, so-called \"optout\" claims have been allowed in the CAT since 2015, meaning all affected people could be covered unless they decide to exclude themselves.\nAnd anyone in the UK who has bought paid apps, paid subscriptions, or other in-app purchases on an iPhone or iPad since October 2015 is included in the claim. \nHowever, such a collective action needs to be approved by the tribunal before proceeding. \nWhile the 30% Apple cut on sales is already facing challenges from other companies, the group behind this claim say it is customers who have ultimately paid the fee. \nIt alleges: \nKing's College London digital-economy lecturer Dr Rachael Kent, who is taking the case to the tribunal and representing all those affected, said Apple \"charges entry and usage fees that are completely unjustified\".\n\"This is the behaviour of a monopolist and is unacceptable,\" she said. \nApple's estimates of its costs for running the App Store were \"just $100m\" (\u00a371m) - but it had made $15bn (\u00a310.6bn) last year. \n\"Apple achieves this by slapping unjustified charges on its users,\" Dr Kent said.\n\"It would not be able to impose these exorbitant charges if competitor platforms and payment systems were allowed to compete.\"\nThe rest of the team behind the case includes law firm Hausfeld and Co and Vannin Capital. \nVannin would be paid - a proportion of the total compensation, from \"damages that are left unclaimed\" - only if the case succeeded, the group said, \"putting their money at risk for a lengthy legal battle with one of the wealthiest corporations in the world\". \n\"Claimants will not lose out,\" the group added.\nIn a statement, Apple said: \"We believe this lawsuit is meritless and welcome the opportunity to discuss with the court our unwavering commitment to consumers and the many benefits the App Store has delivered to the UK's innovation economy.\"\nIt highlighted that the 30% cut is \"very much in the mainstream of those charged by all other digital marketplaces\", and said 84% of apps on its App Store were free - so developers paid nothing. It also argued that the \"vast majority\" of developers paid a commission of 15%, in an apparent reference to its recent decision to cut rates on the first $1m.\nApple's competitor Google also charges a 30% fee, along with several other digital platforms. \nBut the group said it was \"not in a position to comment on Google at the moment\". \nApple has faced a backlash from several developers in the past year, along with scrutiny from an EU competition investigation and the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee in the US. \nIt is embroiled in a major US-based legal battle with Epic Games, which says Apple's policies prevent it competing on price. \nAnd earlier this year, the competition tribunal rejected Epic's attempt to bring that case into the UK, while allowing a similar one against Google to proceed.

      "text": "A fresh Police and Crime Commissioner election will be held after a disbarred candidate won.\nConservative candidate Jonathon Seed gained 100,003 first and second preference votes in the Swindon and Wiltshire election.\nNews of an historical driving offence which made him ineligible did not emerge until Sunday after polls had closed.\nWiltshire Police said it was assessing how to proceed. \n\"We will now be working closely with the PARO [Police Area Returning Officer] to understand the full circumstances surrounding this situation.\n\"It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time,\" the force added.\nWhen all the first preferences were counted, Mr Seed had 84,885 votes, nearly 50,000 more than second-placed Liberal Democrat candidate Liz Webster but not enough to avoid the vote going to second preferences.\nWith second preference votes counted, Mr Seed gained 100,003 and second placed Liberal Democrat candidate, Liz Webster, polled 58,074 votes.\nLiberal Democrat candidate Liz Webster added that Mr Seed had treated voters with \"total contempt\". \nShe added: \"He has betrayed their trust, wasted their time and a vast amount of public money.\n\"Re-running this election will cost\u200e tax payers \u00a31.4m, require residents to go to vote again and deny our tired elections staff their well deserved break. All of that is an absolute disgrace.\n\"I am ready to fight again to be a powerful voice for the victims of crime, champion our dedicated police officers and staff, and to take the action needed to make our communities safer and bring law breakers to justice.\"\nLabour candidate Junab Ali said: \"I demand that the Conservative Party and Jonathon Seed publish full facts on the timelines of when they were first aware of this issue and apologise unreservedly to the people of Wiltshire for their failures in this case.\"\nHe also called on the party to offer to pay the full costs incurred by the \"abortive process\" for all parties including public bodies, candidates, their agents, parties, volunteers and the press and media.\n\"For the record I have never had any convictions for any offence,\" Mr Ali said.\nIndependent candidate Mike Rees said he was \"disappointed\" this had happened and he held Mr Seed responsible.\nPrior to withdrawing, the Wiltshire councillor said he was advised by his party that a 30-year-old drink-driving offence would not affect his application, on which basis he had mistakenly believed he was eligible to stand.\nHowever, the legislation creating Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) places a stricter bar on historical offences than other elected positions.\nGuidance on the Electoral Commission's website states that candidates cannot stand for election if they have ever been convicted of an imprisonable offence.\nThis disqualification applies even if the person was not imprisoned for that offence or if the conviction has been spent.\nEarlier Mr Seed, via his legal team, released the letter he sent to Terence Herbert, PARO for Swindon and Wiltshire, on Sunday.\nIn the letter Mr Seed states he had always been open with the Conservative party about his 1993 conviction, and that he had been reassured it did not prevent him from standing as a PCC candidate.\nMr Seed said that \"at all times up until the evening of 6 May\" he had been told, by party officials, that he was able to contest the election.\nLocal Conservative MPs Robert Buckland, James Gray and Justin Tomlinson declined to comment on Mr Seed's situation when approached by the BBC.\nOther first-preference votes in the Swindon and Wiltshire PCC election were; Junab Ali (Labour) 34,147 votes, Mike Rees (independent) 31,722, Brig Oubridge (Green Party) 16,606 and Julian Malins QC (Reform UK) 4,438."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nBoris Johnson has said there will be a public inquiry into the government's handling of the Covid pandemic in the current parliamentary session. The prime minister told MPs he had already made it clear that an inquiry was \"essential\". He was responding to a question from Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey \"on behalf of bereaved families\". Mr Johnson had previously said only that an inquiry would happen in future. A session of Parliament is typically a year, but can be longer.\nPeople will be able to hug and meet in each other's homes from Monday as Scotland's Covid rules are relaxed. Mainland Scotland will move to level two restrictions - although it is \"very likely\" Moray will remain in level three after a surge in cases there. Most of the Scottish islands, except Arran, Bute and Skye, will move to level one on the same date. Read more about the rules for Scotland and the rest of the UK here.\nPeople who have received both jabs of a coronavirus vaccine in England will be able to use the NHS app to prove their vaccination status from next week. A paper version will also be available - by calling 119 but not through a GP. Both will launch on Monday - as foreign travel curbs are eased. The newly updated app will also display other medical information, but it won't yet reflect Covid test results.\nDozens more bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges in northern India as the country struggles with a second Covid wave. More than 50 bodies have been discovered in Gahmar, Uttar Pradesh, over the past few days. It is not known how any of the the bodies got there, but it is thought they are Covid-19 victims. The country has experienced a severe surge in cases and deaths.\nEleven Greater Manchester Police officers were caught breaching Covid-19 lockdown rules in the first year of the pandemic, a Freedom of Information request has revealed. Details obtained by the Local Democracy Reporting Service showed a community support officer and four civilian staff also broke the restrictions. The majority of the breaches were around illegal social gatherings.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWith lockdown restrictions easing in various parts of the UK next Monday, remind yourself what you'll be able to do where you live.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The Prince of Wales has spoken about how his family have \"an empty seat at their dinner table\" after the death of his father, the Duke of Edinburgh. \nPrince Charles made the comment during a video message wishing Muslims an Eid Mubarak ahead of the end of Ramadan. \nHe said the last year had been \"deeply challenging for us all\" and he was \"only too aware of the impact of the pandemic on the Muslim community\". \nPrince Philip, the UK's longest-serving royal consort, died aged 99 on 9 April. \nIn a video posted by the Naz Legacy Foundation, a charity promoting education and integration, Prince Charles said: \"This year so many families, like my own, will have an empty seat at their dinner table and friends are no longer able to share the celebratory hug after Eid prayer.\"\nThe message was shared with young people from the foundation and the British Asian Trust, who were taking part in a virtual iftar, the evening meal where Muslims break their daily Ramadan fast, on Monday. \nThe iftar meal is usually shared with family and friends but such gatherings have been restricted during the pandemic. \nThe end of Ramadan, during which Muslims fast during daylight hours for a month, is marked with a celebration called Eid. \nFollowing his father's death last month, Charles said his \"dear papa\" was a \"very special person\" who had given the \"most remarkable, devoted service\" to the Queen, the Royal Family, the country and the Commonwealth.\nEarlier, Charles accompanied the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament - her first major public engagement since the death of her husband.

      "text": "The government is to bring forward legislation in the course of the next year to deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles.\nAs expected, the move was signalled in the Queen's speech.\nThe mention was brief: \"Measures will be brought forward to strengthen devolved government in NI and to address the legacy of the past.\"\nAccompanying government papers said the new legislation will be set out in the coming weeks.\nThe papers stated: \"The government is fully committed to introducing legislation to address the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and will confirm further details in the coming weeks.\n\"It is clear that the current system for dealing with the legacy of the past is not working well for anybody, with criminal investigations increasingly unlikely to deliver successful criminal justice outcomes and failing to obtain answers for the majority of victims and families.\n\"The government will introduce a legacy package that delivers better outcomes for victims, survivors and veterans, focuses on information recovery and reconciliation, and ends the cycle of investigations.\"\nBased on details of the plan leaked last week, it is proposed that all prosecutions prior to 1998 and related to the Troubles will, in future, be banned under a statute of limitations.\nInstead the focus will be on \"information recovery\" for families of those killed. \nThe government has started to brief political parties on the finer points of what is proposed.\nIt faces strong opposition to what is generally viewed as an amnesty which will apply across the board to former paramilitaries as well as those who served in the security forces.\nPart of the government's motivation is a manifesto commitment to protect ex-soldiers from re-investigation and prosecution.\nSpeaking before a meeting with the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, the Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the proposals were \"an insult to victims\"\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in politician added: \"At its core this is about the British state closing down any prospect of a meaningful investigation of its role in the conflict.\"\nThe Justice Minister Naomi Long has also had talks with Mr Lewis.\nShe said the plan displayed \"a callous and cavalier attitude\" to victims and survivors.\nIt is not clear when exactly the government intends to bring forward the legislation or whether it will force it through in the absence of support from the parties and victims' groups.\nThe conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles lasted almost 30 years from the late 1960s, and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people.\nNorthern Ireland was created in 1921 and remained part of the UK, while the rest of Ireland became an independent state.\nThis created a split in the population between the unionists - who were mainly Protestants and were happy to stay in the UK - and nationalists, who were predominantly Catholics and wanted to join the new Irish state.\nMany Catholics faced discrimination in jobs and housing and in the late 1960s began protests which were met with a crackdown from the Northern Ireland government, and led to the UK government to sending over troops in 1969.\nThey were largely welcomed, but later armed groups from both sides, like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA)  began carrying out bombings and shootings.\nPeace talks started in the early 1990s, and culminated in the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which ended the worst of the violence.

      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the coronavirus variant first found in India last year as a \"variant of global concern\".\nIt said preliminary studies show the B.1.617 mutation spreads more easily than other variants and requires further study.  \nThe variant has already spread to more than 30 countries, the WHO says.\nThree other variants from the UK, South Africa and Brazil have been given the same designation.\nA mutation is elevated from a \"variant of interest\" to a \"variant of concern\" (VOC) when it shows evidence of fulfilling at least one of several criteria, including easy transmission, more severe illness, reduced neutralisation by antibodies or reduced effectiveness of treatment and vaccines.\nThe variant is being studied to establish whether it is responsible for a deadly surge in India, which is currently overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums.  \nIndia reported 366,161 new infections and 3,754 deaths on Monday, down from record peaks.  Experts say the actual figures could be far higher than reported. \nSurging cases have meant that oxygen shortages continue to be a problem and have spread beyond the capital, Delhi.\nLocal media in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh reported that 11 Covid patients died overnight in the city of Tirupati after an oxygen tanker supplying the hospital was delayed.\nThe Indian government says there is evidence of a link between the variant and India's deadly second wave, but that the correlation is not yet \"fully established\".\nSeveral states have imposed localised lockdowns, curfews and curbs on movement over the last month.  \nHowever, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is coming under increasing pressure to announce a nationwide lockdown and stop the spread of the virus. \nHe is also facing criticism for allowing massive gatherings at Hindu festivals and election rallies to go ahead despite rising cases.  \nOn Monday, Delhi's health minister said the capital had just three or four days of vaccine supplies left.  \nShortages are further disrupting a lagging vaccination programme, with just over 34.8 million, or about 2.5% of the population receiving both doses of a vaccine so far.  \nThe WHO says current vaccines will continue to be effective against the Indian variant, although the WHO's technical lead did say there may be some evidence of  \"reduced neutralization,\" at a press conference on Monday."

Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "tags": "The Troubles,Ballymurphy inquest",
      "text": "Ten people killed in west Belfast almost 50 years ago in the wake of an Army operation were \"entirely innocent\", an inquest has found.\nThe inquest, which began in November 2018, examined the deaths in and around the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast in August 1971. \nThe shootings happened after an operation in which paramilitary suspects were detained without trial.\nVictims included a priest trying to help the wounded and a mother of eight.\nNine of the 10 victims were killed by the Army, the coroner said. \nThe coroner could not definitively say who shot the tenth victim, John McKerr.\nMrs Justice Keegan, who delivered her findings over the course of more than two hours, said the deaths took place during Northern Ireland's Troubles in a \"highly charged and difficult environment\".\nThe killings happened over three days immediately following the introduction of internment - the arrest and detention of paramilitary suspects without trial.\nShe noted that during that time there was widespread disorder. \nAcross Belfast alone on 9 and 10 August 1971, it was recorded that there were approximately 12 explosions, 59 shooting incidents, 17 reported deaths, 25 reported injuries, 13 incidents of rioting, 18 reports of arson and other reports of civil disorder of various kinds.\nBut Mrs Justice Keegan concluded, to a round of applause: \"What is very clear, is that all of the deceased in the series of inquests were entirely innocent of any wrongdoing on the day in question.\"\nEileen McKeown, daughter of victim Joseph Corr, said her family was \"delighted\" with the findings and added that now the \"world knows that they are innocent\".\nA UK government spokesperson said it would now \"take the time to review the report and carefully consider the conclusions\".\nMrs Justice Keegan said the effects of the killings on the families of the 10 victims had been \"stark\". \nInquests were held into the deaths in 1972, but they were separate and returned open verdicts. \nThe new inquests, which began in November 2018, have been held together.\nThe court heard almost 100 days of evidence from more than 150 witnesses. \nThese included more than 60 former soldiers, more than 30 civilians and experts in ballistics, pathology and engineering. \nFather Hugh Mullan, 38 and Francis Quinn, 19\nThe coroner found both men were shot by the Army on 9 August 1971, although neither was armed.  \nShe said there was no evidence Mr Quinn had a gun or was in close proximity to someone who had a gun. \nShe said she was quite convinced Fr Mullan was a \"peace-maker\" and that he was carrying a white object at the time that he was shot. \n\"He had made representations to the Army earlier about the issues that were pertaining in the community. Letters sent by the military after his death provided an indication of the esteem in which he was held,\" the coroner found. \nMrs Justice Keegan said there was enough evidence both men were trying to render help to someone injured at the time.\nShe concluded, in the case of both men, that \"the use of force was clearly disproportionate\".\nPat Quinn, the brother of Francis Quinn, later said it was a great day for the families, \"but it's also a bittersweet day\".\nJoan Connolly, 44; Daniel Teggart, 44; Noel Phillips, 19; Joseph Murphy, 41\nMrs Justice Keegan found there was \"no doubt\" the four were shot by the Army in August 1971.\nShe acknowledged the Army was coming under fire from gunmen in the area at the time, but she concluded the use of force against the deceased was \"clearly disproportionate\".\nShe said they were innocent, unarmed and were \"posing no risk.\"\nThe coroner said it was clear the environment was difficult at the time, with many people, including children, out on the streets but she said the state had failed to establish that the shootings were justified.\n\"The four deceased were unarmed and were not acting in any way of threat. No arms were found on or near the deceased and there was no evidence of gunshot residue that satisfied evidential standards,\" Mrs Justice Keegan said. \n\"None of the deceased were claimed as members of the IRA, none had military trappings at their funerals and their death notices highlighted no association.\"\nRuling on a claim by a soldier that 33 rounds of ammunition were found in a pocket on clothes worn by Mr Teggart, she said if this was the case it was \"quite an amount of ammunition\" yet it was not mentioned by other soldiers.\nShe concluded she was not satisfied that \"this fact is proven.\"\nThe coroner said there was some IRA activity in the area, and she was satisfied the military were justified in using force. \n\"There was, however, no justification provided by the Army for the shootings of the four deceased,\" she added. \nLater, Briege Voyle, Ms Connolly's daughter, said the Army told a lie 50 years ago and the UK government covered up that lie.\n\"The coroner's findings are clear she was innocent,\" she said. \nJanet Donnelly, the daughter of Joseph Murphy, said that for 50 years her family had lived with the knowledge that her father was \"an innocent civilian murdered by British paratroopers\".\nJohn Teggart, son of Daniel Teggart, said: \"I want to speak directly to the people of Britain at this moment. Can you imagine what would happen if the British soldiers murdered 10 unarmed civilians on the streets of London, Liverpool or Birmingham?\n\"What would you expect, an investigation? Would you expect justice? Or would you be happy for them to get an amnesty?\"\nEdward Doherty, 31\nMrs Justice Keegan said Mr Doherty was an innocent man when he was shot, who posed no threat. She said he was on the street and had come across events on his way home. \nShe said he was not linked with the IRA and there was was no sign of petrol or explosives on his body. \n\"He was not a petrol bomber and he was not acting in any other way that would justify a violent attack on him,\" the coroner said.  \n\"Mr Doherty was not associated with any terrorist group. He was an innocent victim of the situation.\"\nShe said a British soldier, known as M3, fired in response to a petrol bomber, but the \"firing of his weapon was disproportionate to the risk posed to him\".\n\"Unfortunately, Mr Doherty was caught up in what happened in this incident and he lost his life as a result,\" Mrs Justice Keegan said. \nLater on Tuesday, Mr Doherty's sister, Kathleen, said she was \"elated that my brother's name is eventually cleared\".\n\"He was a good man and he was a humble man,\" she told the BBC's Evening Extra programme.\nJoseph Corr, 43, and John Laverty, 20\nMrs Justice Keegan found that on the balance of probability, both men were shot by the Army. \nShe said it was wrong to describe the two men as gunmen and that rumour should be dispelled. \nShe also said the Royal Military Police investigation of the killings at the time was inadequate.\n\"There was no adequate investigation by the Royal Military Police. The Coroner found that both men were shot in the back when either crouching, crawling or prone,\" the coroner's verdict stated.  \n\"There was no evidence that the deceased were armed or acting in a manner that could be perceived as posing a threat.\"\nCarmel Quinn, Mr Laverty's sister, later said \"no-one cared\" about her brother's death.\n\"He was my big brother and we would never give up fighting for him,\" she said. \nEileen McKeown, Mr Corr's daughter, said her family was \"delighted\" with the rulings and that the \"world knows that they [the victims] are innocent\".\nJohn McKerr, 49\nMrs Justice Keegan said Mr McKerr was an innocent man who was not acting in any suspicious way when he was shot. She said he was \"indiscriminately shot on the street\".\nShe said he had \"no association with the IRA\" and that his family could now know that any claim to the contrary could be allayed \"once and for all.\"\nShe said he may have been shot by a stray bullet but it was not possible for her to say where any shot may have come from. \nShe said the evidence was not clear or consistent in this case and there was no direct evidence as to who fired the fatal shot. \n\"The military were in the area at the time, but that did not equate to responsibility for the death. As a result of weaknesses in the evidence and the limitations of the original investigation, it was impossible to say where exactly any shot came from,\" the coroner found. \nThe coroner described the \"inadequacy of the original investigation as shocking\".\n\"Not one statement was taken from the military in the area, the scene was not sealed and the bullet was not recovered.\n\"It is in itself a serious indictment of the state's failure to properly investigate the death of an innnocent civilian,\" she said. \nREAD MORE: Who were the victims?\nConcluding her remarks after more than two hours, Mrs Justice Keegan said she wanted to acknowledge the families of the victims and said it must be a difficult occasion of remembrance.\nShe added: \"I do express the hope that some peace may now be achieved now that these findings of the inquest have been delivered.\"\nCatherine Morrison, BBC News NI\nAfter the findings were delivered, the families of the victims streamed out of the makeshift courtroom at the Waterfront conference centre in Belfast wreathed in smiles. \nHugging each other, some crying with relief and with joy, they spoke of their delight at the coroner's findings: the names of their loved ones finally cleared after 50 years.\nPat Quinn, whose brother Frank was shot dead during one incident on 9 August 1971, said he shed tears for the first time in many years.\nOthers remembered family members who have since died and were not here for today's ruling.\nThere were cheers as relatives left and had their photographs taken by the waiting press in the bright sunshine.\nIt's been a hugely significant day for these families.\nMrs Justice Keegan said often, during the hearings, that she wanted to hear evidence that would help her understand what had happened.\nShe has had to decide the circumstances of how each person died on the balance of probability.\nShe has also had to determine who was there, where the shooting came from, who she thought fired the fatal shot, and the circumstances in which those shots came to be fired. \nOther information or witnesses were missing.\nOne person, known as Witness X, offered to pass on what he knew about Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) snipers in the area. \nBut he never gave evidence in the end and the court concluded that ballistics evidence cast some doubt on what he had indicated that he would say.\nThere was clear testimony at the inquest that the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA were in the area on those days and did open fire on certain occasions. None of them testified.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, tweeted that it had been a \"long road\" for the families. \n\"The court has considered the evidence and the findings should be accepted,\" she wrote. \n\"I commend the families for their tenacity.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, the vice-president of Sinn F\u00e9in, said the victims were innocent and the families had been vindicated. \nJustice Minister Naomi Long tweeted that the families \"had to battle too hard and too long\" to hear Tuesday's verdict. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was \"inspired by the fearless dedication of these families\".\nUlster Unionist Party MLA Doug Beattie said the government needs to come up with a \"coherent plan to deal with the past and deal with the victims of our Troubles\".\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he wanted to \"acknowledge the terrible hurt\" that had been caused to the families of those killed and said the government would \"carefully consider\" the coroner's findings.\nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Mich\u00e9al Martin said \"the legacy of violence in Northern Ireland remains a deep wound\".\nShadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the families' 50-year wait was \"a profound failure of justice\".\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We note the coroner's findings which have been long awaited by the bereaved families of the deceased, military personnel and their relatives. \n\"We recognise how difficult the process has been for all of those affected by the events of August 1971 and the inquest. We will now take the time to review the report and carefully consider the conclusions drawn.\"\nLord Dannatt, former head of the Army, said \"matters should have been investigated much more thoroughly a long time ago\".\n\"The families should not have had to wait this long to get the degree of truth that has come out today through this very extensive inquest which has gone on for some time,\" he said. \nREAD MORE: Ballymurphy findings 'cast new light on dark pages'"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Wales business,Welsh government,Cinemas,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Only a \"small minority\" of cinemas in Wales will be able to reopen next week under current restrictions, according to an industry trade body.\nConfirmation is expected on Friday that cinemas can reopen from 17 May.\nBut the UK Cinema Association said regulations were different in Wales to the other nations, with venues following the same, stricter rules as indoor hospitality.\nThe Welsh government said cinemas would open \"when safe to do so\".\nPhil Clapp, chief executive of the association which represents 90% of the industry including big cinema chains, said because many cinemas were licensed for the sale of alcohol it meant Welsh officials had \"lumped them in\" with pubs and restaurants. \nHe said the rules in Wales differed to England and Scotland in three ways.\nUnder Welsh government guidelines the following rules will apply to cinemas:\nMr Clapp said the rules were \"impractical and unnecessary\".\n\"So even if a customer just walks up to a concession stand to buy a tub of popcorn, they have to be seated,\" he said.\n\"For many of the smaller venues there simply isn't the space for that kind of seating.\n\"And it will cause queuing and all manner of problems which we presume these restrictions are intended to avoid.\"\nCinemas in Wales have been closed since 4 December with a return now much anticipated, according to Mr Clapp. \n\"I would say the mood in the industry is one of frustration, you know, there is a huge amount of excitement and optimism about the return of cinema,\" he said.\n\"Finding an administrative barrier to that late in the day and unnecessarily we would say, in terms of the safe-guarding of customers and staff, is hugely frustrating.\"\nMr Clapp also said while cinemas were selling tickets for showings from next week, the likes of Cineworld and Showcase had said they would not be able to open, with Vue and Odeon having a \"significant rethink\" on whether they can reopen.\nCineworld has venues in Llandudno, Broughton, Cardiff and Newport, while Showcase has a single cinema in Nantgarw.\nVue has cinemas in Rhyl, Carmarthenshire, Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil, Cwmbran and Swansea, and there are Odeons in Wrexham, Llanelli, Swansea and Bridgend.\nMr Clapp said the rules were also a \"nonsense\" for the many smaller venues in Wales and the issues around collecting contact details and being seated for food were \"magnified\" for them.\nHe continued: \"I very much fear that when we come to next Monday, even if cinemas are allowed to open, only a small minority of cinemas in Wales will feel they can viably reopen.\"\nBeth Watkins is chair of the trustees of the Market Hall Cinema in Brynmawr - which has been closed since mid March 2020 and has not set a date to reopen.\nShe said: \"Most disappointingly for us is the fact that small independent cinemas, and many of them are charities like us, are being included in hospitality.\n\"We don't have a bar, we don't serve alcohol, we don't serve food but we still fall within that category.\n\"Organising for someone to be able to order a box of popcorn or a bar of chocolate from their seat is impossible for us.\n\"Social distancing means that out of our 195 seats around 40 tickets can be sold.  So for us it is not financially viable to reopen. You build your hopes and then suddenly you're hit by this red tape.\"\nSteve Reynolds is director of Picturedrome Cinemas, which runs the Maxime Cinema in Blackwood, which will reopen on Monday.\nHe said: \"When we were told cinemas could open we put our programmes on sale and we've sold 750 tickets so far just for Peter Rabbit without the other films.\n\"Obviously we've got this obstacle now with the food and drink which has to be delivered to the seats.  We are looking at ways around that - click and collect where you can order when you reserve your tickets but it's a very difficult situation for us.\"\nChapter Arts Centre, in Cardiff, will reopen its cinema at about 30% capacity on Monday, if permitted, its chairwoman Elin Wyn told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme.\nMs Wyn said the anticipated rules would not affect Chapter as much as the bigger chains because it had never allowed customers to eat or drink inside its two cinemas.\n\"The thing that would make the biggest difference for us, is if they decided to relax the 2m rule,\" she said.\n\"If they took it down to a metre or got rid of social distancing altogether - that's what would really change things. We could then get more people into our cinemas.\"\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"We have been working closely with Ffilm Cymru and UK Cinema Association to prepare for the opening of cinemas when it is safe to do so.\n\"Contact tracing is an important and effective part of keeping people safe.\n\"Cinemas have been and continue to receive support from the Welsh government's Culture Recovery Fund (CRF). Those within larger arts centres may also have received assistance from the CRF delivered via the Arts Council of Wales.\n\"The first minister will set out the results of the next coronavirus restrictions regulations on Friday and confirm whether cinemas can reopen in Wales next week.\""

      "text": "Upper Bann MLA Doug Beattie has put his name forward to be the next leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP).\nThe party has begun the process of appointing a new leader after Steve Aiken announced his resignation.\nMr Aiken said the party was \"not breaking through\" and had \"not been working as well as it should be\".\nMr Beattie, a retired Army captain, said he was the right person to \"rekindle the fortunes\" of the UUP and give a clear vision for the future.\nHe told BBC Newsline he would have a different style and would be \"able to reach out to all people in Northern Ireland regardless of what your religion is, sexual orientation or ethnicity\".\nMr Beattie, who was elected MLA for Upper Bann in 2016, said people underestimated Mr Aiken, whom he described as a strong unionist with liberal views. \n\"I share [those views] with him,\" he added. \"Maybe the presentation might be slightly different and maybe we have to work on how we get our message out to people.\"\nMr Beattie said the Northern Ireland Protocol, the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland which places a border in the Irish Sea, must be replaced.\nHe said it was damaging to the Good Friday Agreement but the party had an alternative ready to go. \n\"I do not want a hardened border on the island of Ireland. But neither do I want a border in the Irish Sea,\" Mr Beattie said. \nEarlier, outgoing leader Mr Aiken said unionism needed to \"get its act together\" and there was now a time for reflection. \nMr Aiken will remain in charge temporarily until his successor is found. \nA virtual meeting of the party's ruling executive will be held on Tuesday night to discuss the leadership process.\nMr Aiken has been in charge since November 2019.\nMr Aiken said the UUP continued to do what was right not only for unionists but for all in Northern Ireland. \nHe said his resignation as party leader was a \"bittersweet moment\". \n\"I am, however, self-aware enough to realise that our party, despite our strengths, is not breaking through,\" he said. \n\"I am also very aware of my limitations. And despite the successes over the last 19 months, I realise that a change of leadership is needed.\"\nMr Aiken said the UUP was a team in which all parts needed to work effectively.\n\"Quite frankly, it hasn't been working as well as it should be. That is down to me,\" he said. \n\"Rather than being the perceived problem, I want to be part of the solution.\"\nParty chairman Danny Kennedy thanked Mr Aiken for his leadership, describing him as a \"dedicated Ulster Unionist\". \nLagan Valley assembly member Robbie Butler, who is the party's chief whip, has also been mentioned as a possible contender.\nIn his letter of resignation, Mr Aiken said he had taken the party as far as he could.\nHe said it had been a \"privilege to lead in these difficult and trying times\" and he took pride in the party's decision to take on the challenging health minister portfolio when Stormont was restored in 2020.\nHis departure follows the resignation of Arlene Foster as DUP leader and first minister after an internal revolt.\nMore than 20 DUP NI Assembly members and four MPs signed a letter voicing no-confidence in her leadership.\nResponding to Mr Aiken's decision to step down, Mrs Foster said she found him \"very straightforward and honourable\" as a fellow party leader."

      "tags": "UK Parliament",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has said the government \"won't settle for going back to the way things were\", as the UK emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.\nHe promised to end the \"criminal waste of talent\" in parts of the UK by spreading opportunity more evenly.\nIt came as the government unveiled 30 planned new laws for the year ahead in the Queen's Speech.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's programme lacked urgency and ambition.\n\"Today we needed a Queen's Speech that rose to scale of the moment,\" said Sir Keir, but instead, he claimed, it was \"packed with short-term gimmicks and distant promises\".\nSir Keir seized on the absence of new legislation to fix the funding of adult social care - something he said the prime minister had promised on the steps of Downing Street two years ago.\nHe said the government's failure to act on the issue after the pandemic was \"nothing short of an insult\" and it was \"a similar story on skills and education\".\nThe government has promised to bring forward social care proposals later this year.\nMany of the measures in the Queen's Speech are aimed at the Conservatives' new electoral strongholds in the Midlands and north of England.\nThe prime minister told MPs: \"We intend to unite and level up across the whole of our United Kingdom because we one nation Conservatives understand this crucial point - that you will find flair and imagination and enthusiasm and genius distributed evenly across this country while opportunity is not.\n\"And we need to change that because it is not just a moral and social disgrace, it is an economic mistake. It is a criminal waste of talent.\n\"And though we cannot for one moment minimise the damage that Covid has done - the loss of learning, the NHS backlogs, the courts delays, the massive fiscal consequences - we must use this opportunity to achieve a national recovery so that jabs, jabs jabs becomes jobs, jobs, jobs.\"\nAmong the planned new laws are:\nMissing from the government's programme was a specific bill on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, although the speech said legislation will be introduced.\nAnd trade unions accused the government of \"rowing back\" on a promise to protect workers' rights.\nDowning Street said an Employment Bill would be introduced \"when the time is right\", citing the pandemic as the reason for the delay.\nMr Johnson committed to setting up a \"full, proper\" public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic, which could begin in the coming year, in response to a question from Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey.\nSir Ed also raised concerns about plans to introduce voter ID for future general elections, which he said would hit the disadvantaged and ethnic minorities, and were \"straight from the Donald Trump playbook\".\nAnd he echoed criticism of planning reforms by former Prime Minister Theresa May, who said they would hand too much power to developers and \"see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places\".\nThe SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told the prime minister there was a fresh mandate for a Scottish independence referendum after Thursday's elections. \nHe also attacked \"further power grabs\" by the Westminster government in the Queen's Speech.\nOne of the pleasures of the Queen's Speech for journalists is hearing Her Majesty reading out the political slogans of the government of the day. \nSo 15 seconds in there was mention of the prime minister's favourite: plans to \"level up\" the country. \nThe meaning of the phrase is gradually being refined but the agenda is still vast and encompasses jobs, schools, health, policing, industry, productivity, civic pride, the strength of local leadership and the quality of life. \nBut the real detail in this area will come later this year when the government publishes a White Paper where it will spell out much more detail about what levelling up means and the \"bold\" action that ministers will take to achieve it. \nSo for now the government is trumpeting what it's already doing: a \u00a34.8bn fund for infrastructure projects, \u00a3830m for redeveloping High Streets, along with eight freeports and 40 new hospitals in England. \nAnd where there are such big promises, Labour stands ready to highlight pledges that go unmet. \nThis year's speech also included changes to the policing of protests, including setting time and noise limits. A previous discussion of this by MPs earlier this year led to angry demonstrations.\nCritics say the measures impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest - but ministers say the proposals will respect human rights and will only affect very disruptive gatherings.\nA ban on so-called conversion therapy - attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity - is also planned.\nThe Queen's Speech is part of the State Opening of Parliament, normally the grandest of Westminster occasions.\nBut it was pared back this year because of Covid, with fewer MPs and peers than normal gathering in the House of Lords to hear it - and the Queen arriving by car rather than the usual carriage.\nIt was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh."

      "tags": "Religion,LGBT",
      "text": "So-called conversion therapy will be banned in England and Wales after a public consultation, it's been announced in the Queen's Speech. \nThe government said these \"abhorrent practices\" can cause mental and physical harm.\nAccording to NHS England, conversion therapy - sometimes called \"reparative therapy\" or \"gay cure therapy\" - tries to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity. \nIt and other professional bodies have warned all forms of conversion therapy are \"unethical and potentially harmful\"..\nIn practice, it means trying to stop or suppress someone from being gay, or from living as a different gender to their sex recorded at birth.\nIt can include talking therapies and prayer, says Jayne Ozanne, a former government equality adviser subjected to the practice. More extreme forms can include \"exorcisms, physical violence and food deprivation\", she says. \nSome forms, such as \"corrective\" rape, are already illegal.\nJustin Beck, who underwent conversion therapy as a result of his religious faith, told the BBC the experience left him \"emotionally traumatised\".\nIn 2018, Theresa May's government promised to end conversion therapy as part of its LGBT equality plan. Last summer, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said plans for a ban would be brought forward.\nBut in March, three advisers - including Ms Ozanne - quit the government's LGBT advisory panel amid concerns it was being too slow. LGBT charity Stonewall urged the government to \"stop dragging its feet\".\nIn Northern Ireland, politicians have passed a non-binding motion calling for a ban on conversion therapy \"in all its forms\".\nBut in the Queen's Speech, the government announced a consultation will be held in England and Wales before the law changes.\nThis will explore how to ensure the ban does not have \"unintended consequences\", and that medical professionals, religious leaders, teachers and parents can keep having \"open and honest conversations\". \nThe government said it will provide additional financial support to ensure victims of conversion therapy get the help they need. \nIt's difficult to know exactly how widespread the practice is. The government has not defined exactly what it counts as conversion therapy, and victims may be reluctant to share their experiences. \nAbout 5% of the 108,000 people who responded to a 2018 LGBT government survey said they had been offered some form of conversion therapy, while 2% had undergone it.\nThose from an ethnic minority background were twice as likely to be affected. About 10% of Christian respondents and 20% of Muslims said they had undergone or been offered conversion therapy, compared to 6% with no religion.\nMore than half said it was conducted by a faith group, while one in five received it from healthcare professionals.\nThe figure is higher among transgender respondents. Almost one in 10 trans men said they had been offered conversion therapy, and one in 25 said they had undergone it.\nBut the survey did not define what it meant by conversion therapy, and did not ask when it had happened, or whether it was in the UK.\nSome groups say a ban could infringe on traditional religious teachings, such as the belief that all sex outside a heterosexual marriage is sinful.  The Evangelical Alliance, which says it represents 3,500 churches, has suggested an \"expansive definition\" of conversion therapy could restrict religious freedoms. \nUK director Peter Lynas said ministry leaders could be \"at risk of arrest\" for encouraging young people to remain chaste until marriage. He suggested it could criminalise supportive prayer for someone who asked for help dealing with same-sex attraction they wished to resist.\nHowever, many other religious leaders support a ban. The Church of England said the practices have \"no place in the modern world\".\nSome mental health professionals say they fear being accused of conversion therapy if they question young people who are struggling with their gender identity.\nUnder-18s referred to the NHS's Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) currently undergo an initial \"wide-ranging\" psychosocial assessment. This is to \"explore and understand the child or young person's past and current gender identification\".\nConservative MP Alicia Kearns, who has campaigned for a ban, said safeguarding measures could be put in place for accredited professionals who are assisting people considering gender transition. \nMany places have introduced a full or partial ban, including Canada, Malta, Germany, Mexico and parts of Australia. \nIn Germany, under-18s are not allowed to receive conversion therapy, while it is outlawed for adults in cases of coercion or deceit.\nAbout 20 US states have banned the practice, although many of these do not include religious counsellors and organisations.\nAll countries that have introduced some form of conversion therapy ban have covered gender identity in their definitions.

      "text": "Boris Johnson is promising a skills \"revolution\" for England, with loans for adults wanting to retrain and more powers to deal with failing colleges.\nThe measures are being unveiled in the Queen's Speech, which sets out the government's programme for the next year.\nIt includes 30 bills with pledges to overhaul the asylum system and reform planning laws in England.\nMPs are set to debate the proposed new laws this afternoon.\nThe Queen's Speech is part of the State Opening of Parliament, normally the grandest of Westminster occasions.\nBut it was pared back this year because of Covid, with fewer MPs and peers than normal gathering in the House of Lords to hear it - and the Queen arriving by car rather than the usual carriage.\nIt is the monarch's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.\nLabour has called for detailed plans to fix the \"broken\" social care system. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the government would \"bring forward a long-term plan to strengthen and reform social care\". \nThe government says its main focus is on helping the country recover from the pandemic, after the economy shrank by 9.9% last year., and spreading opportunity more evenly across the UK.\nA range of bills will aim to help industrial and post-industrial areas in particular, where the Conservatives have been picking up support recently.\nThe speech, written by ministers but delivered by the monarch, will promise to bring in a \"lifetime skills guarantee\".\nPart of this will be allowing all adults to get a \"flexible loan\" for higher-level education and training at university or college, \"useable at any point in their lives\".\nThis will be used to provide the equivalent of up to four years' study and can be used for full-time or part-time courses.\nBusinesses and trainers will be encouraged to target \"local needs in sectors including construction, digital, clean energy and manufacturing\".\nLabour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the government had \"lots of talk but little action\" about levelling up and creating jobs.\nShe said: \"It's great to hear that they want people to be able to retrain, but where are the jobs that people need...the good-quality jobs that allow people to earn decent money to look after their families, and to be able to spend in their local communities and on their high streets?\"\nAhead of the speech, the prime minister said: \"These new laws are the rocket fuel that we need to level up this country and ensure equal opportunities for all. We know that having the right skills and training is the route to better, well-paid jobs.\n\"I'm revolutionising the system so we can move past the outdated notion that there is only one route up the career ladder, and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to retrain or upskill at any point in their lives.\"\nThe government will introduce the Skills and Post-16 Education Bill - detailing the plans - next week.\nThe Queen's Speech will include 30 pieces of legislation, although several of them are carried over from the previous session.\nLabour and local government leaders have demanded detailed plans for the reform of social care. \nFormer health secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a \"live debate\" going on inside No 10 and the Treasury and tensions over the costs of changing the system, including introducing a cap on people's care costs. \nBut the Conservative chair of the Commons Health and Social Care Committee added that \"this is not about the immediate problem in public finances caused by pandemic because the costs will build up later\" and said the government needed to come up with \"a comprehensive solution\". \nMr Hancock said strengthening the social care system was \"close to the prime minister's heart\" but the pandemic had meant the government \"weren't able to put as much focus on [plans] as we would have done\". \nOn his first day as prime minister Boris Johnson made a promise to \"fix social care\" and shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has told the Daily Mirror that the Queen's Speech would be a test as to whether he \"delivers on his word\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"We must also see detail on long-promised plans to fix the broken social care system, reduce the shocking levels of violent crime and narrow the gap between different parts of the country.\n\"For 11 years we have had lots of rhetoric and the endless promise of jam tomorrow. That must now be turned to action.\"\nThis year's speech will also include changes to the policing of protests, including setting time and noise limits. A previous discussion of this by MPs earlier this year led to angry demonstrations.\nCritics say the measures impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest - but ministers say the proposals will respect human rights and will only affect very disruptive gatherings.\nThe speech is expected to include a bill restricting the future prosecution of British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.\nAnd there is likely to be a Sovereign Borders Bill, aimed at dissuading asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel.\nA ban on so-called conversion therapy - attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity - is proposed too. This will be preceded by a public consultation, the BBC understands.\nThe speech will include a commitment to introducing voter ID for future general elections, which has raised concerns among many MPs and civil rights groups.\nLegally binding environmental targets are also expected to feature, as is a planning bill to ease controls in England and increase housebuilding.\nMany Conservative MPs are concerned this legislation will leave people in some areas with less say over new developments.\nNational Trust director general Hilary McGrady has warned the prime minister over plans to drive development of homes, saying that \"the stakes are high and reforms need to be carefully considered\".\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph she said: \"The planning system is the most important tool that we have for shaping our physical environment. \n\"It is a mistake to characterise it as simply a blocker to new homes, growth and development in general.\""

      "text": "Tom Cruise has handed back his three Golden Globes in protest at a lack of diversity among the body that runs the glittering annual Hollywood awards.\nHe is the latest star to join a growing chorus of criticism. NBC, which has aired the event since 1996, has said it won't broadcast the ceremony next year.\nNBC said it wanted to see \"meaningful reform\" from the organisers, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.\nThe Golden Globes are second only to the Oscars in terms of profile.\nTime's Up, a leading advocate for industry reform, described NBC's move as a \"defining moment for Hollywood\".\nWarnerMedia, Netflix and Amazon Studios are also refusing to participate in HFPA-related events. , \nThe HFPA, whose members vote on the awards, has faced months of criticism stemming from a Los Angeles Times report back in February that revealed it had not had a single black member for 20 years.\nOn Tuesday, the HFPA published a timeline of reforms, saying it wanted to implement \"transformational changes as quickly - and as thoughtfully - as possible\", adding that \"systemic reform... is long overdue\".\nIt added that it was committed \"to achieving these goals with extreme urgency\".\nThe plans will widen the HFPA's membership, with an emphasis on recruiting black members and the hiring of diversity advisers. It has pledged to increase its membership by 50% over the next 18 months.\nThe association also indicated it would loosen its cloak of secrecy and strict admission rules by publishing its membership list and accepting foreign entertainment journalists who are based across the US, not just in California.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion training will be given to all members, as well as sexual harassment awareness training. And members will be barred from accepting promotional items from film and TV studios.\nTime's Up described the proposals as \"window-dressing platitudes\".\n\"Any organisation or sponsors that set themselves up to pass judgement on our vibrant community of creators and talent must do better,\" said Time's Up president Tina Tchen.\nScarlett Johansson, who has been nominated for five Golden Globes, has urged others in the film industry to boycott the organisation unless it makes significant internal changes.\nThe 36-year-old recalled facing \"sexist questions and remarks by certain HFPA members that bordered on sexual harassment\".\nHer Avengers co-star Mark Ruffalo wrote that the HFPA's reforms were \"discouraging\".\n\"Now is the time to step up and right the wrongs of the past,\" he said. \"Honestly, as a recent winner of a Golden Globe, I cannot feel proud or happy about being a recipient of this award.\"\nThe main issues appears to be that the implementation of changes isn't fast enough.\nAccording to Variety, organisations will continue to boycott the Globes and other HFPA events until the reforms are actually enacted.\nThe timeline published by the HFPA states that a new board and new members will be in place by the first week of August.\nIn a statement on Monday, NBC said: \"Change of this magnitude takes time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. As such, NBC will not air the 2022 Golden Globes.\n\"Assuming the organisation executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023.\"\nThe TV network's decision also follows a steep drop in viewing figures for the Globes, which hit a 13-year low this year. That is a trend for film award shows in general - particularly during the pandemic, with many ceremonies eschewing the red carpet and conducting their events virtually.\nSam Asi, who works for BBC Arabic and is a member of the HFPA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he found it \"bizarre\" that Hollywood was \"suddenly shocked\" about the lack of black members of the HFPA \"when this has been the case for 20 years\".\n\"HFPA members are seen every day by Hollywood talent, executives and publicists\u2026 why the sudden shock?\"\nHe added: \"Once the tide turned against the HFPA, everyone wanted to jump on the wagon and benefit from it. It's a political game.\"\nHe said publicists had told him privately that they knew they also lacked diversity in their field and said he had been in Hollywood for 15 years but had never met a black publicist.\nIn February Chadwick Boseman was awarded a posthumous Golden Globe for his performance as a jazz musician in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom."

      "text": "Dua Lipa demanded a pay rise for NHS workers as she won two major awards at the Brits - the UK's first major in-person ceremony of the Covid era.\nAnd Little Mix called out sexism in the music industry after becoming the first all-female outfit to win best British group.\nThe other big winners on the night were J Hus, Harry Styles and Taylor Swift.\nThe test event at London's O2 Arena took place with a 4,000-strong audience and no social distancing or face masks.\nRappers Headie One and AJ Tracey used several verses of their performance to call out the demonisation of drill music and criticise the government, while highlighting the work done by footballer and free school meals campaigner Marcus Rashford.\nWhile the 2021 Brits were not on a leap year it was very much a Lipa year, as the singer won two of the three awards for which she was nominated.\nFuture Nostalgia, the best-selling album released last year in the UK, predictably won best album.\nBut it was after winning the best British female award, her first of the night, that the star called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to give nurses and NHS workers pay rises, as opposed to mere applause.\nThis year, each of the Brit award trophies came in two parts and Dua dedicated hers to British nurse Dame Elizabeth Anionwu - who she noted has spent \"a stellar nursing career fighting racial injustice\" and \"protecting frontline workers\".\n\"She has also said that there's a massive disparity between gratitude and respect for frontline workers,\" said the singer. \"Because it's very good to clap for them, but we need to pay them.\n\"So I think what we should do, is we should all give a massive, massive round of applause and give Boris a message that we all support a fair pay rise is for our frontline.\"\nThe audience, which was packed with key workers, gave her a standing ovation.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, environment secretary George Eustice responded to Dua Lipa's speech by stressing there was a \"difficult public finance environment\".\n\"There's been a pay freeze for most of the public sector and it's also important to recognise that in recent years that there have been some pay rises as well, particularly for nurses and the lower paid,\" he said.\n\"We can't always go as far as you'd like, but it's also the case that there's a pay review that's going on into the NHS,\" he continued.\nThe government recommended in March that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year, while many other public sector workers will have their pay frozen.\nBefore her double win, Dua Lipa had performed a medley of hits from her latest floor-filling record.\nIt was a visual love letter to her home city of London, complete with a Tube platform string quartet, Amy Winehouse-style beehive hair and a union jack skirt which evoked memories of Spice Girl Geri Halliwell's famous patriotic dress.\nThe night's big winner also shared her delight at seeing more women on both the stage and the winners' podium - several years after she called out the Brits for overlooking female artists.\nThis year, by contrast, women won four of the five mixed categories.\nOne such example, Little Mix dedicated their award to some of the great all-female bands who could and should have won in previous years.\n\"It's not easy, being a female in the UK pop industry,\" said Leigh-Anne Pinnock while accepting their award.\n\"We've seen white male dominance, misogyny and sexism, and a lack of diversity.\n\"We're proud that we've stuck together, surrounded ourselves with strong women and are now using our voices more than ever.\"\n\"The fact that a girl band has never won this award really does speak volumes,\" added bandmate Jade Thirlwall. \"So this award isn't just for us, it's for the Spice Girls, Sugababes, All Saints, Girls Aloud.\n\"All of the incredible female bands - this one's for you.\"\nSince the departure of Jesy Nelson, Little Mix are now a three-piece. Two of them - Pinnock and Perrie Edwards - have recently announced that they are pregnant.\nSpeaking to the BBC the day after Little Mix's speech, former Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts said: \"They absolutely deserved that award last night and it's long overdue. I feel very proud of the girls because obviously they've been going for 10 years and it's not too dissimilar from the story of Girls Aloud.\"\nShe told 5 Live's Nihal Arthanayake: \"We were nominated a good few times for that award but we never received it, it was always a male indie band that would be recognised.\"\nElsewhere, rapper J Hus was not on hand on the night to pick up his award for best male solo star.\nBut Harry Styles was - in typically well-tailored fashion, sporting a brown and white Gucci suit - to collect best British single for his ubiquitous hit Watermelon Sugar.\nIf last month's Oscars took place in tinsel town then the Brits was very much tonsil town, as spectators underwent Covid tests on their way into the event.\nThe event formed part the government's pilot scheme for reopening live events safely, which includes the forthcoming FA Cup Final.\nThe live audience of about 4,000 people was about one-fifth of the O2's capacity and more than half of the ticket-holders were key workers from Greater London and their guests.\nSeveral performances were pre-recorded including Coldplay's show opener from a pontoon on the River Thames, and another from best international male The Weeknd.\nAfter being introduced by Jackie Weaver - of local council Zoom meeting fame - Chris Martin and co played their new single Higher Power with a little help from some holograms and pyrotechnics.\nSir Elton John later appeared on tape too alongside Years & Years star Olly Alexander for a rendition of Pet Shop Boys track It's a Sin, title track of the latter's recent drama series.\nBefore the event, US pop star Taylor Swift - who best international group-winners Haim described as \"the most incredible human being\" - was announced as the first female winner of the global icon award.\nSwift, who normally resides in Los Angeles, was there in-person to accept it and also praised the \"help and support we got from the NHS\" over the past year.\nIn the only other award announced beforehand, young singer Griff was named as the winner of the rising star prize, and she demonstrated why with a career-making performance.\nPrevious winners of the award include Adele, who went on to win a host of more senior Brit Awards in the years that followed.\nAnother star in bloom, Arlo Parks, said it was \"a dream come true\" to win the breakthrough award and she sang - in front of a garden centre's worth of sunflowers - like she had been doing it forever.\nThe event finished with a collaboration between Rag 'n' Bone Man, a virtual Pink, and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust Choir.\nBefore teeing them up, comedian Jack Whitehall, hosting the awards for a fourth time, gave \"a massive big up to the key workers here tonight, and across the country\".\n\"We will never be able to thank you guys enough,\" he said.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Sometimes it is by accident, they do get stranded, but usually sadly it is the case that they're already seriously ill or badly injured.\n\"And there's not a great deal we can do in that situation.\"\nLiz Sandeman, co-founder of Marine Connection, said the whale's welfare had to be considered as it was not just a case of getting it back to sea if it was a young animal.\n\"It wouldn't know how to feed. It learns everything from its mother - how to navigate, how to hunt,\" she said.\nMinke whales are the smallest of the great whales, growing to about 33ft (10m), and are usually found throughout the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\nTheir range extends from the ice edge in the Arctic during the summer to near the equator during winter.

There was no military band or Guard of Honour outside the Palace of Westminster or as part of the procession from Buckingham Palace.\nHowever, the ancient tradition of the Black Rod still took place. \nThis tradition saw the doors of the Commons shut in the face of Sarah Clarke, Lady Usher of the Black Rod, as she arrived to summon MPs. She then had to strike the door three times before it is opened, symbolising the Commons' independence from the monarchy. \nThe Queen did not wear the heavy Imperial State Crown, which was instead carried on a cushion and placed on a table nearby as it was in 2019.\nThe monarch last wore the crown, which is made of more than 3,000 gemstones and weighs two pounds and 13 ounces, for the 2016 state opening."

West was a regular customer when the teenager worked at the cafe.\nThe film crew told police on Friday they had found evidence that a body could be buried within the property. \nOfficers could be at the site \"for a number of weeks\" and excavation work is yet to begin, Gloucestershire Police said.\nAssistant Chief Constable Craig Holden said: \"This could be a significant development on a case which has gained a lot of public interest over the years.\n\"On the basis of the information provided to us, we consider this to be new and potentially important evidence in the case of Mary Bastholm, however further detailed assessments will take place over the following few days to determine the extent of excavation needed.\n\"First and foremost our thoughts are with Mary's family and we would ask that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.\"\nIn a statement released via the force, Miss Bastholm's family said: \"We are aware of the ongoing developments around Mary's disappearance and are being kept up to date and supported by Gloucestershire Police family liaison officers.\n\"At this time please may we ask for privacy so we can grieve for Mary.\"\nA white tent has been set up outside the building in Southgate Street and officers are stationed at the scene. \nThe cafe is close to Cromwell Street, where officers found the bodies of West's victims at the home he shared with his wife Rosemary.\nA spokesperson for The Nelson Trust, a women's charity that owns The Clean Plate, said: \"As soon as we were made aware of the situation, we have done everything we can to accommodate the investigation.\n\"The Clean Plate will remain closed until all necessary activity is complete. \"It is an extraordinary twist of fate that this building, now associated with a story as tragic as that of the victims of Fred and Rosemary West, is part of a charity working to support women at risk from violence.\"\nBy Andrew Plant, BBC News\nMary Bastholm disappeared at a bus stop on her way to meet her boyfriend.\nThere has been no trace of her since. It's been a mystery for 53 years.\nThe cafe has been there for decades and has been under several different names.\nOne of its waitresses was Mary, who was 15 at the time when Fred West was a regular customer and was known to him.\nIt was also known he was a builder at the time renovation was needed on the cellar and the toilets at the cafe - work he was believed to have carried out in 1968.\nA lot of people locally put two and two together and suggested that perhaps he was responsible for her disappearance and that was where she ended up.\nPolice say their activity will take place over a number of weeks and there will be disruption for some time.\nIn 2012, a petition was set up calling for a fresh investigation into Miss Bastholm's disappearance but it was rejected by then Chief Constable Tony Melville.\nIn 1994, West admitted murdering his daughter Heather.\nThe confession came as police began to search 25 Cromwell Street, where they found the bodies of nine girls and young women. \nHe and his wife Rose were jointly charged with nine murders and he was charged with a further three.\nWest took his own life while awaiting the murder trial the following year."

and that's the level of honesty I think we need with the public and with our staff.\"\nHe warned the recovery of the NHS would take time \"partly because of capacity but importantly because our staff need to be cared for as well\".\nWelsh Labour has budgeted to spend at least \u00a31bn extra on NHS recovery.\nMr Drakeford said on Saturday that Wales' response to the Covid pandemic had been a major part in Labour's election win as they were returned as the largest party for the sixth successive time since devolution in 1999.\n\"A government I lead will continue to follow the science to do what our medical advisers tells us we should do, and that does mean doing things in a way that continues to keep Wales safe,\" he said.\nThe Welsh government controls Wales' Covid response and the relaxing of restrictions - such as meeting inside pubs and restaurants and travel rules - has tended to have been more cautious in Wales.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that people from different households would be able to meet up and hug from 17 May in England.\nIt is up to individuals whether they socially distance with close family and friends from that date in England.\nThe UK government said it wanted to let people in England exercise personal judgement as more of life returns to normal, but people are still urged to remain cautious and remember some people are more vulnerable to Covid than others.\nAddressing the issue of hugging in Wales, Dr Atherton said: \"Prevalence rates are really quite low at the moment, and being close to a member of your family is less risk now - but with strangers, I would be very cautious still.\n\"I think there are other ways to greet people than to give everybody a hug, so there are ways to do that and to do it safely - don't spend too long making face-to-face contact, make it a brief hug.\n\"But to be honest, I think it is quite right - I understand that grandparents want to hug their grandkids, of course they do, and that's only natural.\n\"But we have learned over the last year that there are other ways to interact socially, and perhaps\u2026 hug cautiously.\"\nThe new Senedd is meeting for the first time on Wednesday to elect a presiding officer and deputy presiding officer to conduct proceedings. \nThen, once those posts are filled Labour will then be able to re-nominate Mr Drakeford as first minister - with no significant challenge from the opposition expected to his reappointment.\n\"We have demonstrated over a number of governments that you can govern successfully on 30 seats, but I'm open to working with any party where there is common ground between us,\" he said.\nLib Dem leader Jane Dodds, their only Senedd member, has ruled out joining the Welsh government like her predecessor Kirsty Williams did.

Common people are not left with money to pay a priest and spend more on cremation at the river bank. They are asking 2,000 rupees [\u00a320; $27] just to get the corpse out of the ambulance. The river has become their last recourse so people are immersing corpses in the river.\"\nUttar Pradesh is India's most populous state. \nA second wave of the virus is ravaging parts of India, with deaths rising significantly in recent weeks. Most of the country's crematoriums have run out of spaces.\nThe country is now the epicentre of the global pandemic.\nIndia has recorded more than 22.6 million coronavirus cases and 246,116 Covid-related deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data. \nExperts believe the real death toll could be far higher."

      "text": "The US has authorised the Pfizer vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds amid a push to get the shot into more Americans' arms.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it was \"a significant step in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic\".\nFDA Commissioner Dr Janet Woodcock said the move was aimed at \"bringing us close to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic\".\nAbout 250 million doses have been given in the US, but demand has been falling.\nMs Woodcock added in her statement: \"Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our Covid-19 vaccine emergency use authorisations.\"\nMonday's announcement expands an emergency use authorisation that already allowed the Pfizer jab to be administered to people as young as 16 in the US. \nThe decision follows a clinical trial by Pfizer and BioNTech involving 2,260 children aged 12-15. The participants received either two doses of the vaccine, or a placebo.\nThere were 18 cases of symptomatic coronavirus infection in the placebo group and none among the children who received the vaccine, found the trial.\nThe FDA's seal of approval is not the final regulatory hurdle. An advisory panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will review the data soon.\nImmunisations could begin straight away if, as expected, the CDC committee approves the vaccine's use in adolescents.\nSome of New York and Oregon's biggest universities have meanwhile joined a\u00a0growing number of higher education institutions requiring students and staff to have Covid-19 vaccinations before they can return to classes this autumn.\nThe rules were announced on Monday by State University of New York, the City University of New York, the University of Oregon and Western Oregon University.\u00a0\nLast week, US President Joe Biden announced a plan to get at least one dose of vaccine administered to 70% of the nation's population by 4 July.\nMask mandates are being loosened across the country, and most states have reopened their economies, or are doing so within the next month.\nBut dwindling demand for the shot has been prompting states across the country to refuse their full allocation of doses from the federal government.\nWisconsin, Iowa, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina and Washington are all among states that reduced their requests.\nThe risk of children becoming seriously ill from the virus is tiny, health data shows. \nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), as of this month 3.85 million US children have tested positive for Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic, just over 10% of total cases nationwide.\nBetween 0.1%-1.9% of all child Covid-19 cases resulted in the patient being admitted to hospital, found the organisation's report.\nNo more than 0.03% of all child Covid-19 cases resulted in death, according to the AAP.\nThe risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared with Covid-19, according to the CDC.\nPfizer has been one of a number of vaccine manufacturers testing jabs on children. The aim of vaccinating them - particularly older children - would be to keep schools open, reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and protect vulnerable children with conditions which put them at increased risk. \nModerna and Johnson & Johnson are currently testing their vaccines on those aged 12-18, with Moderna's data expected soon. \nModerna and Pfizer are also testing their jabs on younger children between six months and 11 years old. \nIn the UK, AstraZeneca is testing its vaccine on 300 child volunteers. Researchers will assess whether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17. \nLast week President Biden said he planned to back a World Trade Organization waiver that would take away intellectual property rights from vaccine manufacturers. If approved, the waiver would allow production of vaccines to be ramped up and provide more affordable doses for less wealthy countries. \nThe head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described Mr Biden's backing as a \"monumental moment in the fight against Covid\".

      "text": "People will be able to hug and meet in each other's homes from Monday as Scotland's Covid rules are relaxed.\nMainland Scotland will move to level two restrictions - although it is \"very likely\" Moray will remain in level three after a surge in cases.\nMost of the Scottish islands, except Arran, Bute, Cumbrae and Skye, will move to level one on the same date.\nAnd a traffic light system will be introduced for international travel from Monday.\nThe changes, which will also allow pubs and restaurants to sell alcohol indoors, were confirmed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.\nShe also announced that the requirement for social distancing during meetings indoors or in private gardens would be dropped.\n\"I actually feel a wee bit emotional saying this... from Monday, as long as you stay within permitted limits, you can hug your loved ones again,\" she said.\nThe first minister added that it was \"vital to be cautious\".\nA \"more fundamental review\" of physical distancing will be carried out in the next three weeks, which will look at whether there can be further relaxations in places like pubs and restaurants.\nLockdown is being eased a little faster than the Scottish government originally planned. \nAllowing social mixing in your own home from Monday was anticipated, but not with the removal of social distancing rules. \nAs the first minister put it, you can \"hug your loved ones again\" - echoing a similar announcement by the prime minister, relating to England. \nScotland is also aligning with the UK government's plans to open up international travel, but taking more time to consider easing the requirements for face coverings in school. \nEnding social distancing at home creates an anomaly because the rules will remain in force in other settings, including pubs and restaurants. \nThe Scottish government said it did not want to remove distancing rules everywhere at once, to reduce the risk of Covid flare-ups. A wider review of this policy is to report back in three weeks. \nMs Sturgeon said there were no changes at this stage to guidance on face coverings, but that their use in schools would be reviewed in the coming weeks.\nShe said it was \"highly probable\" that Moray would remain in level three when restrictions are eased in the rest of the country.\nCase numbers in the area are more than four times higher than in the rest of Scotland.\n\"It's against that backdrop that, unless the situation was to materially improve over the next few days, it would simply not be safe or sensible to ease restrictions there from Monday,\" she said.\nIt is also expected that travel restrictions will be reintroduced, so that travel in and out of Moray would be limited to \"permitted purposes only\". A final decision will be taken at the end of the week.\nScotland has five levels of Covid restrictions, which range from full lockdown down to level zero.\nIt is hoped that the whole country can move to level one on 7 June, then to level zero on 28 June - before returning to \"something much more like normality\" over the the summer.\nThe country moved down from level four to level three on 26 April, which enabled the reopening of cafes, pubs and restaurants, gyms, and the remaining non-essential shops.\nThe level two restrictions have been updated so that up to six people from three households will be able to meet in their homes, and can also stay overnight.\nAlcohol can be served indoors in pubs or restaurants, which will be allowed to stay open until 22:30 - and up to six adults from three households will be able to meet indoors in a public place.\nRestrictions on meeting up outdoors will ease further, to enable up to eight adults from eight different households to gather.\nAdult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises will be able to resume.\nCinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades are also likely to be able to reopen, and outdoor and indoor events like concerts can restart - although capacity may initially be limited.\nThe Western Isles, Orkney, Shetland and remote Highland and Argyll islands will move straight to level one on Monday because the virus is now sufficiently under control on those areas.\nMs Sturgeon also said there would be \"a careful move away from blanket restrictions\" on non-essential overseas travel.\nShe said the introduction of a traffic light system in Scotland meant there would be a consistent four-nations position.\nThe existing system of managed isolation will continue to apply to those arriving from countries on the red list, while those travelling from amber list countries must undertake a 10-day period of self-isolation with two PCR tests.\nPeople arriving from green list countries will be required to take a test when they arrive, but will not need to self-isolate if they do not have the virus.\nMs Sturgeon said green list status should be the \"exception not the rule\". Iceland, the Faroe Islands, New Zealand and Australia are among the 12 countries and territories initially on the list.\n\"Even though the rules on non-essential travel are starting to change, that doesn't mean we're saying that non-essential international travel is desirable,\" she added.\n\"Everyone should think seriously about whether they should travel abroad this summer.\n\"When it comes to holidays abroad, my advice continues to be to err on the side of caution and to staycation this summer.\"\nThe easing of restrictions was welcomed by the travel and tourism sectors, as well as Scotland's business groups.\nDr Liz Cameron, the chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said those sectors still \"gridlocked in uncertainty\" needed to re-open as quickly as possible."

It has been incredibly hard, and so to try and get this back up and running is incredibly important.\"\nLiverpool director of public health Matt Ashton said the club event, which will also run on Saturday, was \"crucial\" for the local economy.\n\"In Liverpool, it's over 40% of our economic output. So it's really important we start to get the economy opening again.\"\nHe said clubbers who test positive in the next five days would be expected to self-isolate and would be spoken to by contact tracers.\nScientists will use data on crowd movements and air quality to see whether people mixing indoors at mass events will increase coronavirus transmission.\nThe night was part of the Events Research Programme, which will also see crowds return to the FA Cup final and Sunday's music festival in Liverpool's Sefton Park.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Population growth,China",
      "text": "China's population grew at its slowest pace in decades, according to government data released on Tuesday. \nThe average annual growth rate was 0.53% over the past 10 years, down from a rate of 0.57% between 2000 and 2010 - bringing the population to 1.41bn.\nThe results add pressure on Beijing to boost measures for couples to have more babies and avert a population decline. \nThe results were announced in a once-a-decade census, which was originally expected to be released in April. \nThe census was conducted in late 2020 where some seven million census takers had gone door-to-door to collect information from Chinese households.\nGiven the sheer number of people surveyed, it is considered the most comprehensive resource on China's population, which is important for future planning. \nNing Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that 12 million babies were born last year - a significant decrease from the 18 million newborns in 2016. \nHowever he added that it was \"still a considerable number\". \nMr Ning added that a lower fertility rate is a natural result of China's social and economic development.\nAs countries become more developed, birth rates tend to fall due to education or other priorities such as careers.\nIts neighbouring countries Japan and South Korea, for example, have also seen birth rates fall to record lows in recent years despite various government incentives for couples to have more children. \nLast year, South Korea recorded more deaths than births for the first time in history, raising fresh alarm in a country which already has the world's lowest birth rate. \nShrinking populations are problematic due to the inverted age structure, with more old people than the young. \nWhen that happens, there won't be enough workers in the future to support the elderly, and there may be an increased demand for health and social care. \nYes. In 2016, the government ended a controversial one-child policy and allowed couples to have two children. \nBut the reform failed to reverse the country's falling birth rate despite a two-year increase immediately afterwards.\nMs Yue Su, principal economist from The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \"While the second-child policy had a positive impact on the birth rate, it proved short-term in nature.\"\nThere had been expectations that China might scrap the family planning policy altogether along with the new census results, but this did not happen.\nA report by the Financial Times in April also quoted people familiar with the matter as saying the census would reveal a population decline. \nThis did not happen with the 2020 report but experts have told various media outlets that it could still happen over the next few years.\n\"It will in 2021 or 2022, or very soon,\" Huang Wenzhang, a demography expert at the Centre for China and Globalisation told Reuters. \nChina's population trends have over the years been largely shaped by the one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979 to slow population growth. \nFamilies that violated the rules faced fines, loss of employment and sometimes forced abortions. \nChina's working-age population - which it defines as people aged between 16 and 59 - has also declined by 40 million as compared to the last census in 2010. But chief methodologist Zeng Yuping said that the total size \"remains big\" with 880 million.\n\"We still have an abundant labour force,\" he said. \nHowever, economist Ms Yue warned that going forward, continued drops in the labour force \"will place a cap on China's potential economic growth.\"\nShe added: \"The demographic dividend that propelled the country's economic rise over recent decades is set to dissipate quickly.\"\nAfter a few extra weeks in which officials were reportedly working to \"prepare\" the numbers and help to \"set the agenda\" the bottom line is the number of Chinese in China is growing - just.\nMost of that is people getting older - and staying older. There was a small increase in the number of under 14s, a vindication of the decision to end the one-child policy in 2015, according to the government's census chief. \nBut state media is already talking about the population beginning to fall next year. \nThis is not a demographic change unique to China, but with the biggest population in the world and an economy that it's trying to make more reliant on domestic consumption, this is a particularly salient issue. \nChina's Communist leaders have already said retirement age will need to go up to deal with those demands and costs. This could mean more work to come for the country's workers. \nExperts warned that any impact on China's population, such as a decline, could have a vast effect on other parts of the world.\nDr Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said: \"China's economy has grown very quickly, and many industries in the world rely on China. The scope of the impact of a population decline would be very wide.\"\nAdditional reporting by the BBC's Yip Wai Yee"

      "text": "Seven children and two adults have been killed in a shooting at a school in the Russian city of Kazan, officials say.\nTwenty-one other people, mostly children, were injured. A 19-year-old suspect was detained.\nThe attack happened in the capital of the republic of Tatarstan, 820km (510 miles) east of Moscow. \nRussian PM Mikhail Mishustin spoke of \"great sorrow\" while Tatarstan's leader Rustam Minnikhanov described the attack as a \"major tragedy\".\n\"We are deeply saddened that this has happened,\" he said. \nResponding to the shooting, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he would review the country's gun control laws. \nSchool shootings are relatively rare in Russia. One of the last major incidents happened in Russian-annexed Crimea in 2018.\nMr Minnikhanov confirmed the deaths of seven children - four boys and three girls - as well as a female teacher and a female school worker at School No 175. It is believed the children were eighth graders (aged around 15).\nEighteen children and three adults were being treated in hospitals for gunshot wounds, fractures and bruising, Mr Minnikhanov added.\nThe attack began at about 09:20 local time (06:20 GMT), a source in the emergency services told Russian news agency Tass. The first signal from a panic button at the school was sent five minutes later. \n\"Everyone started panicking and saying 'shut the doors',\" a student who witnessed the attack told the Mediazona news website. \"About a minute later the head teacher started yelling: 'We're shutting the doors!'\n\"We got out about 15 minutes later, not out of the windows. I wanted to do that, but the teacher closed the window immediately and said no.\"\nFootage shared on social media shows some children jumping from windows to escape as well as injured people being evacuated. Russian TV reported that two of the children had died after jumping from a second-floor window.\nHeavily armed police and emergency vehicles responded to the incident. \nA Kazan resident outside the school told Moscow Echo radio station that people there were hysterical. \"Parents are crying, medics are giving out medicine,\" she said.\nElvira Ignatyeva, a 25-year-old English teacher, was killed trying to shield one of the children, a police source told Tass news agency, quoting eyewitnesses.\nShe had pushed the child out of the way in a corridor and tried to block the gunman but was shot and mortally wounded, the source said.\nOn her Instagram account, Ms Ignatyeva had often posted upbeat messages over photos of herself enjoying walks  and nights out.\n\"It's not that hard to make your life happy,\" she wrote on 1 February. You just need to stop thinking that happiness is only possible somewhere over there, in the future, and learn to enjoy every actual minute, here and now...\"\nReports initially said that there were two gunmen and that one of them had been killed. But officials later said there was only one suspect, named locally as Ilnaz Galyaviev. \nRussian investigators say he is a Kazan resident and it is believed he once studied at the school. \nMr Minnikhanov said the suspect was a registered firearm owner. According to Russian MP Alexander Khinshteyn, the suspect received a firearms licence only recently. The MP said it was for a semi-automatic shotgun. \nOfficials did not comment on the possible motive for the attack although Mr Minnikhanov called the attacker a \"terrorist\".\nThe suspect went on social media before the attack, posting that he planned to kill a \"huge number\" of people before shooting himself. Screenshots of his account, now blocked, show him wearing a black mask with the word \"god\" written across it in red.  \nA video on social media captured a teenager lying on the ground apparently being detained outside the building.\nAuthorities have called for all schools in Tatarstan to be inspected and have their security stepped up. \nA day of mourning will be held on Wednesday to honour the victims.  \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Putin had ordered the chief of Russia's National Guard to \"work out as a matter of urgency new regulations on the types of weapon that can be in civilian circulation and that can be owned by the public\".\nThe instruction was issued \"given the type of firearm used by the shooter\", Mr Peskov said. \"The fact is that sometimes types of small arms are registered as hunting weapons, which in some countries are used as assault rifles,\" he explained. \nOlga Ivshina, BBC News\nPeople in Kazan seem to be completely shocked and devastated by what has happened. It is a big city - with more than one million people - which has enjoyed peace and stability over the past decade. \nSchools in Kazan - as well as in most other Russian cities - are not really guarded. Usually it is just one or two unarmed private security guards who meet people coming to the school at the gates. Often many of these so-called security officers are pensioners with no special training. But even if they had any it is hard to confront an armed person with bare hands.\nIt is worth mentioning that the Kazan gunman allegedly used a gun very similar to one the attacker in Crimea used in 2018. It is a relatively cheap but powerful rifle which can be bought for the equivalent of just $280 (\u00a3200). There are a lot of discussions now in Russia about whether the regulations for civilian gun ownership should be changed.\nShootings at schools are relatively rare in Russia compared with other countries.\nAre you in the area?

      "text": "Stock markets across the world have slid amid worries that US inflation is set to rise.\nIn the US, the Dow fell 474 points to lose 1.4% on Tuesday - its largest one-day drop since late February.\nEuropean bourses also saw steep declines on fears among traders that rising consumer prices could push up interest rates.\nThe UK's benchmark share index, the FTSE 100, closed 2.47% lower.\nThe index retreated below the 7,000 mark to 6,947.99 after hitting a post-pandemic high of 7,164 on Monday.\n\"The market just can't shake the inflation fears which are clouding the recovery from Covid,\" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.\n\"Surging commodity prices are acting as a canary in the coal mine for inflation - with the huge infrastructure and stimulus packages in the US a key contributing factor.\"\nIn March, US President Joe Biden signed a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) economic relief bill that saw the government send $1,400 cheques to most Americans, and last month he set out plans for more government spending on jobs, education and social care.\nIt has led to a build-up of savings which is now being spent as the economy reopens, driving prices higher. \nInflation hit 2.6% in the 12 months to March, breaching the Federal Reserve's target of 2% and raising fears it might raise rates to cool things down.\nThere are similar concerns in other economies, but central banks have so far played down the risks.\nThe tech-heavy US Nasdaq share index initially fell more than 2% on Tuesday as markets opened, but reversed those losses later on.\nThe sell-off also continued in Asia and Europe, with both France's Cac 40 index and Germany's Dax index down nearly 2%.\nBen Yearsley, investment director at Shore Financial, said inflation was always likely to pick-up over the next few months given that in the same period a year ago economies were closed and oil prices slumped. \nHe said investors should only get concerned if higher inflation continues. \"If inflation persists and we are still talking about it in six months, for example, then that is a different scenario and will maybe lead to higher interest rates.\" \nOther analysts raised concerns that new data released by the US Labor Department on Tuesday showed that the number of job vacancies jumped by 597,000 to a record high of 8.1 million on the last day of March.\nThe food and hotels sectors added the most vacancies, with the report following figures that showed last week that job growth slowed sharply in April, curbed by shortages of available workers despite huge fiscal stimulus.\nOn the London Stock Exchange, British Airways owner IAG was one of the biggest fallers, with its shares falling more than 7% on the back of negative investor reaction to the government's green list of safe countries to travel to. \nShares in NatWest Group fell more than 3%.The government announced on Tuesday morning it had sold another chunk of shares in the bank, reducing its stake from 59.8% to 54.8% and raising \u00a31.1bn for taxpayers.\nThe concerns in markets are not only about the United States, but that is the main focus of the nervousness. In common with many other governments, the US has supported household incomes, at a time when people have been unable or unwilling to spend as they normally would.  \nSo there has been a build-up of unplanned savings. As restrictions are lifted and vaccinations make people feel more confident, much of that is likely to be spent. If there are any persistent disturbances to supply chains, that would only add to the pressure pushing prices higher. \nWill it lead the Federal Reserve and other central banks to change policy, to raise interest rates or curb their purchases of financial assets, or quantitative easing? \nSo far, the Fed has said it thinks the rise in inflation is due to \"transitory factors\" and it says expectations about future inflation are \"well anchored\". \nSo there is clearly no rush on its part to change policy. But investors are likely to remain wary that inflationary pressures might prove to be persistent and lead the Fed to rethink."

      "text": "Palestinian militants say they fired 130 missiles at the Israeli city of Tel Aviv after an Israeli air strike felled a tower block in the Gaza Strip. \nThe 13-storey building was attacked an hour and a half after residents and local people were warned to evacuate, Reuters news agency reports.\nIsrael's military says it is targeting militants in Gaza in response to earlier rocket attacks.\nAt least 31 people have died in some of the worst violence in years.\nThe international community has urged both sides to end the escalation, which follows days of unrest in Jerusalem. \nMilitants had already fired hundreds of rockets towards Jerusalem and other areas. \nThree people have been killed in Israeli areas while at least 28 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier that the main militant group, Hamas, had \"crossed a red line\" by firing rockets towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. \nHamas, which controls Gaza, says it has been acting to defend Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque from Israeli \"aggression and terrorism\" after the site, which is holy to Muslims and Jews, saw clashes between Israeli police and Palestinians on Monday that left hundreds injured. \nThe past few days have seen the worst violence in Jerusalem since 2017. It followed mounting Palestinian anger over the threatened eviction of families from their homes in occupied East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers. Tension had already been stoked by a month of altercations between protesters and police in the predominantly Arab part of the city.\nHamas said it had launched rockets at Tel Aviv and its suburbs in response to \"the enemy's targeting of residential towers\". \nVideo footage from the city shows rockets streaking through the night sky, some exploding as they are hit by Israeli interceptor missiles.\nA 50-year-old woman was killed by a rocket in Rishon LeZion, near Tel Aviv, Israeli official said. \nIn the Tel Aviv suburb of Holon, a rocket hit a bus just after it had been evacuated. A girl of five and two women, one 50 and one 30, were injured.\nIn Tel Aviv itself, pedestrians ran for shelter and diners streamed out of restaurants while others flattened themselves on pavements as the sirens sounded, according to Reuters. \nBen Gurion Airport briefly halted flights and an energy pipeline between the cities of Eilat and Ashkelon was hit.\nThe rockets were launched after the destruction of the Hanadi Tower in Gaza, which houses an office used by the political leadership of Hamas.\nHours after the collapse, there were still no reports of casualties.\nThere are reports that a second high-rise building was also destroyed by the Israelis after a warning to evacuate.  \nIsraeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said the Israeli strikes were \"just the beginning\".\n\"Terror organisations have been hit hard and will continue to be hit because of their decision to hit Israel,\" he said. \"We'll return peace and quiet, for the long term.\"\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said the group was \"ready\" if Israel chose to escalate.\n\"If [Israel] wants to escalate, we are ready for it, and if it wants to stop, we're also ready,\" he said in a televised address. \"There is a new balance of force.\"\nThe UN Security Council will meet privately on Wednesday to discuss the conflict, diplomats said.\nThe fundamental reason for the renewed violence does not change. It is the open wound of the unresolved conflict between Jews and Arabs that has blighted and ended Palestinian and Israeli lives for generations. \nThis latest episode has happened because of tension in Jerusalem, the sharpest part of the conflict. The holy sites in the Old City are national as well as religious symbols. Crises affecting them have often ignited violence. \nThe triggers for what has happened this time include heavy-handed Israeli policing of Palestinians during Ramadan and controversial efforts in the Israeli courts to evict Palestinians from their homes.\nBut other events could have had the same effect. This was a crisis waiting to happen, in a conflict that, once again, has been left to fester. \nLeaders on both sides have concentrated on safeguarding their own positions. \nThe biggest challenge, of making peace, has not been addressed seriously for years. \nEarlier on Tuesday, two women, one in her 60s and the other in her 80s, were killed in a rocket attack on the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, with one other person seriously injured, medics say.\nHamas said it had fired 137 rockets at Ashkelon and nearby Ashdod in the space of five minutes, and warned it had \"many surprises\" prepared if the fighting continued.\nAt least 95 people received treatment in Israeli hospitals as a result of the attacks.\nThe Israeli military said earlier that 90% of rockets had been intercepted by its Iron Dome missile defence system.\nAmong the \"terror targets\" in Gaza it said it had struck were two attack tunnels being dug under the border with Israel.\nAmong those killed by Israeli air strikes was the head of the Islamic Jihad group's special rocket unit, Samah Abed al-Mamlouk, and the commander of a Hamas anti-tank missile unit is also said to have been killed. \nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported that at least 28 Palestinians, including 10 children, had been killed in Israeli strikes and more than 150 others had been injured.\nVictims included a 59-year-old woman and her disabled son and seven members of one family, including three children, in Beit Hanoun. \nThe fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. \nThe site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. \nThe fate of Jerusalem, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. \nPalestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own."

      "tags": "Budget 2021,Trade",
      "text": "Plans to create eight new freeports in England include tax breaks for employers, the government has said.\nWhere will they be?\nFreeports are usually located around shipping ports, or airports. \nGoods that arrive into freeports from abroad are exempt from tax charges, called tariffs, that are normally paid to the government.\nThese taxes are only paid if the goods leave the freeport and are moved elsewhere in the UK. Otherwise, they are sent overseas without the charges being paid.\nThe UK had seven freeports between 1984 and 2012. Locations included Liverpool, Southampton and the Port of Tilbury.\nThe locations of England's eight new freeports were announced at the March 2021 Budget:\nIt is hoped freeports - which can be up to 45km (27 miles) across - will help regenerate deprived areas. \nIn England, companies inside the sites will be offered temporary tax breaks. These include reductions to the tax companies pay on their existing property, and when they buy new buildings.\nIn the Queen's Speech, on 11 May, the government confirmed that freeport employers will be able to pay less national insurance for all new workers, from April 2022.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own freeport policies. \nEighteen areas in England bid to become a freeport.\nOne of the most important considerations, according to the government, was how a freeport could bring economic opportunities to poorer regions and \"level up\" the country.\nMinisters say other factors - such as the impact of Covid-19 on local areas and ensuring freeports are \"spread fairly\" across England - were also taken into account.\nSupporters say freeports can help increase manufacturing, and encourage jobs and investment in areas that would otherwise struggle to attract them. \nBut opponents say they don't boost employment overall, and moving economic activity from one place to another comes at a cost to the taxpayer.\nLabour says firms inside freeports will not be able to take full advantage of post-Brexit trade deals and tariffs will have to be paid.\nThe Labour-led Welsh government says it has reservations about freeports, although it has not ruled out introducing them.\nThe SNP Scottish government - which has previously been critical of freeports - now plans to introduce its own scheme for Scotland, dubbed \"green ports\". \nExact details have not been set out, but bidders will be asked to promote \"sustainable\" growth, and pay the real living wage. \nThere are currently about 80 freeports dotted around the EU.\nNow that the UK has left the EU, some Brexit supporters say the UK can adopt a more generous freeport policy. For example, they say the government could give businesses more financial help.\nJonathan Branton, a partner at law firm DWF, says the UK does have more flexibility now it doesn't have to follow EU rules. \nHe also points out tax breaks offered to freeport firms would no longer require prior agreement from the European Commission.\nHowever, he adds that the Brexit trade deal - agreed by the UK and the EU - still requires subsidies to be justified, otherwise they could be challenged in UK courts.  \nIn more extreme circumstances, the EU could respond to UK subsidies by introducing tariffs on some UK goods deemed to be damaging EU trade or investment.\nAnd the UK will still be subject to World Trade Organization rules - which say you can't introduce subsidies linked just to export performance.\nThere are also questions over Northern Ireland, which still has to follow EU subsidy rules under the UK's withdrawal deal. \nTreasury Minister Steve Barclay has admitted the freeport model used in Great Britain will need to be \"adapted\" for Northern Ireland. \nNorthern Ireland's devolved government says it is working with the Treasury to find out how much of the model it will be able to follow.

      "text": "Up to six people from different households will be able to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales from Monday.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed indoor hospitality can reopen from 17 May as Wales' Covid case rate continues to fall.\nExtra cash support for hospitality businesses still affected by Covid restrictions has also been announced.\nMr Drakeford said the funding would \"support firms and safeguard jobs\".\nThe support is available to businesses such as pubs, clubs, restaurants and late-night entertainment venues.  \nThey can claim up to \u00a325,000 to help them through to the end of June, as they prepare for re-opening and more normal trading conditions.\nThe news comes after calls from some in the hospitality industry for all significant restrictions on trading to be lifted before July.\nIn England pubs will also open indoors on Monday, with people from different households or not in a bubble having to stay one metre apart.\nWhen they reopen in Wales, six people from any households will be able to meet, but those who do not live together, or who are not in bubbles, will have to socially distance, with the rule being two metres apart.\nNumbers have been increased from the four people set out in the Welsh government's lockdown easing plan.\nBBC Wales understands this was changed to make it easier to enforce, bringing it into line with beer garden rules, and indoor meeting drinking rules in England.\nSarah John, of Boss Brewery in Swansea, said while she was \"breathing a sigh of relief\" to reopen indoors, many small pubs would not be able to reopen unless the two-metre rule was reconsidered.\n\"Capacity-wise you can get a lot fewer people in, for some small venues it might not be feasible... ideally we would have liked to have seen that taken down to one metre as well,\" she said.\nMs John said she hoped the Welsh government would reduce social distancing at the next lockdown briefing on Friday, and the industry needed clarity for the future.\n\"The back and forth has been difficult... it's very important to be on the home straight, we want to see some commitment from Mark Drakeford on when we will be totally restriction free,\" she said.\nPaul Slater, landlord of the Trotting Mare Inn in Overton-on-Dee, which is right on the Welsh-English border said he was delighted to open indoors, after two weeks of \"hit and miss weather\" with customers sitting outside with hot water bottles and blankets.\nHe said the two-metre social distancing rule would mean numbers able to sit indoors would halve from 72, and would be a \"balancing act\".\n\"In the week it won't make too much of a difference, but at weekends we are going to be very limited... We have a lot of drinkers at a weekend, so it's a balancing act between reserving tables for drinkers or people eating,\" he told Radio Wales Breakfast.\nAt the Cross Keys in Penrhynside, near Llandudno, Conwy county, landlords Robin Fitzpatrick and Sabine L\u00f6eber said they had concerns people's habits might have changed during lockdown.\nThey said people may have saved money while being unable to go out, and want to spend money in their homes, and it may led to a \"slow recovery\".\nDue to social-distancing measures, the pub had temporarily got rid of its pool table to sit more people inside, but they said even then numbers would be reduced by a third.\nHowever the couple said they had not considered staying closed.\n\"We are a community pub, so long as we break even and provide a service...we are doing what we are passionate about,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said.\nAmy Wilson, who runs her grandfather's business Elmers Cafe, on Crwys Road in Cardiff, said they would be sticking to four people per table indoors because the cafe did not have a large area.\n\"If there are six people then we'll encourage them to sit outside,\" she said.\n\"Our customer base includes students, builders and older local people. We have a 91-year-old regular called Bryn. He comes in every day and has a tea and toast.\n\"But it's been so sad seeing him having a takeaway and eating outside, sometimes even in the rain. We put a little chair out there for him. It'll be nice to have him coming back inside.\"\nAfter being closed since 18 December, Marco Orsi said he was looking forward to reopening his caf\u00e9 in Pontypridd and said he hoped people would be \"queueing out the door\".\nHe said that he believed cafes should have been allowed to open indoors weeks ago, when non-essential shops pulled up their shutters.\n\"What we will be opening up to is a slight question mark...with the town centres, but I am confident, in due course, that things will get back to normal,\" he said.\nHe added he believed it was customers' own responsibility to social distance and business owners should not be made to police it.\n\"People should know how to behave now, if they don't I'm not going to educate them, we will keep social distancing, but I don't expect to police it myself,\" he said.\nSophia Joannides, Owner of Bluebell Coffee and Kitchen in Tyc\u00f4ch, Swansea, said she was excited to see all her regulars again, some who had not visited for over a year due to having to shield.\n\"Outside dining hasn't really worked for us due to our lovely Welsh weather, we are lucky we have quite a bit of space inside Bluebell, but we are still working on a very reduced capacity,\" she said.\n\"Our customers are the most loyal and supportive, so we know the next few weeks will be great.\"\nSupply chain firms, events and conference venues not covered by the Welsh government's Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF) can also apply for support.\nMr Drakeford said the cash announced was part of a \u00a3200m package earmarked for the incoming Welsh government to help businesses affected by the pandemic.\n\"We know the restrictions have helped to keep us all safe but they have had a big impact on Welsh businesses, which is why we are making more funding available to support firms and safeguard jobs,\" he said.\nAs leader of Welsh Labour, Mr Drakeford had faced criticism during the Senedd election campaign for not announcing the extra financial support for the hospitality sector. \nAt the time, he said \"election rules\" prevented him from releasing the cash - and the move did not apparently harm Labour's chances of being re-elected last week. \nHospitality businesses which can apply for this funding include pubs, clubs, restaurants, nightclubs, late night entertainment venues, supply chain firms, events and conference venues not covered by the Welsh government's Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF).\nThe government said an \"eligibility checker\" would open on the Business Wales website at midday on 17 May so businesses can find out how much support they are likely to be entitled to and how to apply.\nMr Drakeford added: \"The public health situation continues to improve in Wales - we have the lowest coronavirus rates and the best vaccination rates in the UK.\"\nThe relaxation is the latest development in the Welsh government's route out of the lockdown imposed last year to contain the spread of coronavirus.\nGyms, swimming pools and community centres have already reopened while cinemas, theatres and museums are also due to reopen from 17 May, though with strict social-distancing rules still in place.\nThe news came as only six Welsh council areas reported deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest week of figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nDeaths overall were also below normal levels for a ninth week in succession.\nThe number of deaths where Covid was mentioned on death certificates dropped to seven in the week ending 30 April - half the previous week's total and the lowest for more than seven months.\nThese accounted for 1.2% of all registered deaths in Wales.\nIt is a further indication of the retreat of Covid, which has resulted in low case numbers and falling hospital cases.\nThe trend has been for a steady decline in deaths and the weekly total is 93% fewer than registered two months ago."

      "text": "A former English National Ballet principal dancer has been found guilty of sexually assaulting his students.\nYat-Sen Chang attacked girls and women at the English National Ballet and Young Dancers Academy in London between December 2009 and March 2016.\nThe 49-year-old was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault and one count of assault by penetration. He was cleared of one offence.\nHe will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on 18 June.\nJudge Edward Connell told Chang his offending had \"escalated in seriousness\" and warned him he faced a \"lengthy custodial sentence\".\nThe offences related to four females, aged between 16 and 18 at the time, who accused the dancer of touching them inappropriately during massages at the schools.\nThe jury was told Chang, who now lives in the German city of Kiel, had \"used his position\" as a \"famous and revered\" ballet dancer to abuse his students.\n\"For his part, he trusted that his fame and his position would protect him from complaint, or from consequences of his actions,\" prosecutor Joel Smith said.\nChang had denied all the allegations, saying he had \"no idea\" why they had been made.\nAccording to a profile on the Theatre Kiel website, Chang joined the English National Ballet in 1993 and was a principal dancer until 2011. He performed in productions including The Nutcracker, Coppelia and Sleeping Beauty. \nThe Met Police said two of his victims contacted the force in 2016 about assaults that had taken place during private ballet tuition lessons at either his home, the dance school or the ballet school.\nThe other two complainants came forward later with further allegations.\nSpeaking after the court hearing, Det Con Helen Larson described the ballet dancer as \"a dangerous and predatory individual\".\n\"He abused his position of trust and power to prey on them when they were most vulnerable,\" she added.\nChang was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing."

      "text": "Nightclubs have called on Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford to give a date when the sector can plan to reopen without restrictions.\nAn industry body warned ministers could be condemning thousands of businesses to bankruptcy without a date and extra financial help.\nOne licensee said some operators were \"desperate\" and running out of cash.\nThe Welsh government said any decision to relax restrictions must be based on the latest advice.\nBut it said it would give businesses \"as much notice as possible\".\nBusinesses fear that under current plans they have \"no hope\" of resuming trade except for test events.\nIn England the UK government has given a tentative date of 21 June at the earliest for when nightclubs may be allowed to reopen. No date has been set in Wales.\nMr Drakeford is expected to reveal his next steps on Covid at a press conference on Friday, following discussions with ministers on Monday.\nCoronavirus case rates currently stand at the lowest since last August, with 8.6 cases per 100,000 people over seven days.\nNick Newman, a licensee at Croeso Pubs which owns the Philharmonic and Brewhouse venues in Cardiff, said the situation was bad for nightclub businesses.\nThe chairman of the Cardiff Licensee Forum said: \"There's still a huge sector of our business which has no clarity whatsoever as to when it's going to reopen - nightclubs, venues that specialise in music.\n\"I know operators of nightclubs who are quite frankly desperate - there's no money left in the bank account.\n\"The licensees forum compromises roughly 100 businesses - or at least it did before the pandemic started. We've probably lost eight or nine businesses through this. Some of them are smallish businesses - some have been quite iconic.\"\nPubs and restaurants will be able to reopen indoors from 17 May, with four allowed to meet inside venues. But Mr Newman warned that would have a \"crippling effect\" on traders' ability to trade profitably.\n\"The way the night time economy has been treated in Wales during the pandemic just isn't good enough,\" he added.\nUnder the current system, coronavirus restrictions are set according to which alert level the Welsh government believes is needed, according to what the risk is deemed to be.\nThe traffic light control plan has nightclubs and late-night entertainment venues closed at all coronavirus alert levels, except for pilot events at the low risk alert level one.\nMr Drakeford has dubbed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's roadmap for England \"very optimistic\".\nWales is currently in the high risk alert level three, with plans to move into alert level two if rates remain low on Monday.\nAn open letter from the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) asks for \"an indicative date for when nightclubs, entertainment-led, and late-night venues will be able to reopen without restrictions\".\n\"Under the alert levels as described in the current 'control plan', these businesses have no hope for reopening other than for test events in the lowest alert level.\n\"We would stress the importance for our sector of knowing when they will be able to operate without or with minimal restrictions and take deliberate decisions about staffing, debt and investment now, as night time economy businesses in England are currently doing.\"\nIt asks for additional financial support: \"Welsh government support initiatives to date have been neither sufficient nor comprehensive enough to prevent many businesses in the sector falling into significant debt.\n\"Without either a clear path to unrestricted opening, or extended and enhanced financial support, the Welsh government is condemning thousands of businesses in our sector.... to bankruptcy,\" it added.\nThe letter also calls for consistency for groups that can meet indoors and outdoors - six are currently able to meet outside, and for guidance to be changed so it does not \"discriminate\" against venues with amplified sound and music.\nIt is backed by licensee groups in Cardiff and Swansea.\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said only businesses in England could have \"some optimism\" of reopening soon.\n\"In Wales, we've only got 17 May as a date to cling on to for indoor hospitality,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"We do need that same timeline, that same line of sight that we've got in England and in Scotland, to be able to look at reopening those closed segments of the economy and then looking forward to ending all restrictions altogether.\"\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"We understand the difficulties faced by all businesses, and particularly those involved in the night-time economy. \n\"We will continue to work with the sector and give businesses as much notice as possible. However, any decision to relax restrictions must be based on the latest medical and scientific advice.\"\nA recent set of pilot events took place in Liverpool, with a music festival, two club nights and a business conference held with no masks or social distancing."

      "tags": "Reality Check",
      "text": "The government plans to pass a law requiring people to show an approved form of identification in order to vote. \nIt would mean people need identification to vote in a polling station, as is already the case in Northern Ireland, where photo ID is required.\nThe government says this would \"tackle electoral fraud\" and give voters \"confidence that their vote is theirs, and theirs alone\".\nIt plans to extend this to elections in the whole of the UK and is talking to devolved governments about extending it to assembly elections in Scotland and Wales.\nThere are very few complaints about electoral fraud in the UK - and even fewer convictions. \nIn 2019, there were:\nThe recommendation came in a 2016 report from former Communities Secretary Sir Eric Pickles (now Lord Pickles), which followed the Tower Hamlets election fraud in 2015.\nThe report suggested fraud may be overlooked because of \"over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion\".\nIt could be similar to the system that has existed in Northern Ireland since 2003, where voters must show photo ID at the polling station before receiving a ballot paper.\nThe acceptable forms of photo ID are:\nA House of Commons Library report said: \"There has been no evidence that the ID requirements in Northern Ireland have affected turnout.\"\nThe Electoral Commission recommended a small number of other forms of ID could be added to this list, such as:\nIt estimated that would mean about 92.5% of the electorate already had suitable ID.\nIn a pilot scheme of voter ID checks in 10 areas during the local elections in England in 2019, about 2,000 people were turned away at polling stations for lack of ID. Of those, 750 failed to return with ID.\nThe government says it will also \"increase protections\" on postal voting, including banning \"harvesting\" - this is when somebody collects up people's postal votes and delivers them to a polling station.\nCampaign group the Electoral Reform Society has raised concerns that the ID plans could prevent eligible people voting.  \nThere are variations across different groups - for example, women are considerably less likely than men, and black people considerably less likely than white people, to have a driving licence. Certain ethnic groups such as Gypsies and Irish Travellers are much less likely than the average to have a passport. \nThe government plans to offset this risk by introducing a form of identity document voters can apply for free of charge. \nIn the 2019 pilot, awareness of the new ID requirements differed by demographic group, with younger voters and those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds being less likely to know about the requirements. \nAnd that is an issue that might not necessarily be mitigated by supplying free ID, since voters would have to be aware of the requirement in order to apply, and would have to do so in sufficient time.\nAs the Electoral Commission has stated in the past, a public awareness campaign would be needed to ensure the affected groups knew they needed to apply for a new ID. \nAt a Downing Street press conference, Boris Johnson was asked about suggestions that Labour voters are less likely to have suitable ID and whether the policy could be \"a way to suppress votes for people who would not vote for the Conservative Party\".\nThe prime minister replied that that was \"complete nonsense and what we want to do is to protect democracy, the transparency and integrity of the electoral process\".\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions\nFollow us on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Religion,LGBT",
      "text": "Campaigners have called on the government to stop delaying the ban of so-called conversion therapy.\nThe ban for England and Wales was announced in the Queen's Speech - but it will be preceded by a consultation.\nIt will consider religious freedoms and how to protect accredited professionals in a move welcomed by some groups.\nA document signed by a number of health groups defined conversion therapy as the attempt to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity.\nSome campaigners were disappointed that the government did not announce an immediate and wide-ranging ban on the practice. \nLGBT rights charity Stonewall says the practice must be banned in all forms \"including religious and faith-based settings\", and that any delay leaves LGBT groups \"at further risk of abuse\". \nJayne Ozanne, a former government equality adviser who underwent conversion therapy, agrees.\n\"We've had three years of talking,\" she said.\n\"What we really need is action that will protect young and old LGBT people right now, not this Groundhog Day of constantly being told that we're going to consult and listen.\" \nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists said it would be taking part in the consultation to \"highlight why conversion therapy is both unacceptable and harmful\" and to \"ensure clinicians can still help people fully explore their gender identity where appropriate\".\nThe ban - which was first pledged in 2018 - is set to include both sexuality and gender identity in its definition, and will protect people from \"coercive and abhorrent practices\".\nBut the government has said the short consultation will be held before the legislation is published, asking the public and interested parties how best to address the problem while still \"protecting the medical profession, defending freedom of speech, and upholding religious freedom\".\nIt also said it wants \"legitimate forms of pastoral support\" to be allowed to continue, including prayer to help someone explore their sexual orientation or gender identity. \nThe Evangelical Alliance, which represents 3,500 churches, said it welcomed the consultation process.\n\"We want to avoid the situation where a person can be accused of conversion therapy for praying with someone who freely chooses and asks for prayer,\" Peter Lynas, the group's UK director, said.\nA number of health organisations and patient groups signed a document in 2017 warning all forms of conversion therapy were \"unethical and potentially harmful\".\nThe practice can take many forms, some of which - like \"corrective\" rape - are already illegal. \nAbout 5% of the 108,000 people who responded to a 2018 LGBT government survey said they had been offered some form of conversion therapy, while 2% had undergone it.\nMore than half said it was conducted by a faith group, while one in five received it from healthcare professionals.\nAs well as the ban in England and Wales, a support fund for victims of the practice will be made available. \nNorthern Ireland has passed a non-binding motion calling for a ban on gay conversion therapy \"in all its forms\".\nThe Scottish government \"fully supports moves by the UK government to end conversion therapy\", a spokesperson said."

      "text": "Stock markets across the world have slid amid worries that US inflation is set to rise.\nIn the US, the Dow fell 474 points to lose 1.4% on Tuesday - its largest one-day drop since late February.\nEuropean bourses also saw steep declines on fears among traders that rising consumer prices could push up interest rates.\nThe UK's benchmark share index, the FTSE 100, closed 2.47% lower.\nThe index retreated below the 7,000 mark to 6,947.99 after hitting a post-pandemic high of 7,164 on Monday.\n\"The market just can't shake the inflation fears which are clouding the recovery from Covid,\" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.\n\"Surging commodity prices are acting as a canary in the coal mine for inflation - with the huge infrastructure and stimulus packages in the US a key contributing factor.\"\nIn March, US President Joe Biden signed a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) economic relief bill that saw the government send $1,400 cheques to most Americans, and last month he set out plans for more government spending on jobs, education and social care.\nIt has led to a build-up of savings which is now being spent as the economy reopens, driving prices higher. \nInflation hit 2.6% in the 12 months to March, breaching the Federal Reserve's target of 2% and raising fears it might raise rates to cool things down.\nThere are similar concerns in other economies, but central banks have so far played down the risks.\nThe tech-heavy US Nasdaq share index initially fell more than 2% on Tuesday as markets opened, but reversed those losses later on.\nThe sell-off also continued in Asia and Europe, with both France's Cac 40 index and Germany's Dax index down nearly 2%.\nBen Yearsley, investment director at Shore Financial, said inflation was always likely to pick-up over the next few months given that in the same period a year ago economies were closed and oil prices slumped. \nHe said investors should only get concerned if higher inflation continues. \"If inflation persists and we are still talking about it in six months, for example, then that is a different scenario and will maybe lead to higher interest rates.\" \nOther analysts raised concerns that new data released by the US Labor Department on Tuesday showed that the number of job vacancies jumped by 597,000 to a record high of 8.1 million on the last day of March.\nThe food and hotels sectors added the most vacancies, with the report following figures that showed last week that job growth slowed sharply in April, curbed by shortages of available workers despite huge fiscal stimulus.\nOn the London Stock Exchange, British Airways owner IAG was one of the biggest fallers, with its shares falling more than 7% on the back of negative investor reaction to the government's green list of safe countries to travel to. \nShares in NatWest Group fell more than 3%.The government announced on Tuesday morning it had sold another chunk of shares in the bank, reducing its stake from 59.8% to 54.8% and raising \u00a31.1bn for taxpayers.\nThe concerns in markets are not only about the United States, but that is the main focus of the nervousness. In common with many other governments, the US has supported household incomes, at a time when people have been unable or unwilling to spend as they normally would.  \nSo there has been a build-up of unplanned savings. As restrictions are lifted and vaccinations make people feel more confident, much of that is likely to be spent. If there are any persistent disturbances to supply chains, that would only add to the pressure pushing prices higher. \nWill it lead the Federal Reserve and other central banks to change policy, to raise interest rates or curb their purchases of financial assets, or quantitative easing? \nSo far, the Fed has said it thinks the rise in inflation is due to \"transitory factors\" and it says expectations about future inflation are \"well anchored\". \nSo there is clearly no rush on its part to change policy. But investors are likely to remain wary that inflationary pressures might prove to be persistent and lead the Fed to rethink."

This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "text": "It is one year since the coronavirus pandemic put Scotland, along with the rest of the UK, into lockdown. As cases rose and deaths mounted, fear took hold. Exactly 12 months on, we look back at the key moments.\nIn the final days of February 2020, Scotland was still waiting for its first confirmed case of coronavirus to arrive.\nInfections had already been detected in England and most eyes in the UK were on the unfolding horror in northern Italy as hospitals filled and the death toll rose.\nScotland's first confirmed case came on 1 March, and was linked to recent travel in Italy, though we know now this was not likely to have been the country's \"Patient Zero\".\nIt later emerged there were cases in late February linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh. And Public Health Scotland data shows that five people were admitted to Scottish hospitals with Covid-19 on 1 March.\nOn 2 March First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us to expect a \"significant outbreak\" over the coming weeks.\nBut the speed with which the virus tore through the population took most people by surprise.\nOn 6 March, two cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Shetland.\nThey were also linked to travel to Italy - a couple from the islands who had spent a long weekend in the Italian city of Naples, 500 miles (805km) to the south of the country's Covid cluster in Lombardy.\nFour days after Iain and Suzanne Malcolmson's test results came back, the number of confirmed cases in Shetland rose to six. Five days later, they stood at 15. By 19 March, they had risen again to 24.\nThe numbers were modest compared to later outbreaks, but they were enough to ensure that Shetland had the highest number of cases per 100,000 in the UK.\nThey also rooted the global Covid story firmly in one of Scotland's communities.\nContact tracers from NHS Shetland worked fast to bring the outbreak under control and with some success. Daily new cases returned to zero by the end of April and remained there for a long time.\nThe health board currently has the second lowest number of cases in Scotland, with just 224 confirmed since the start of the pandemic.\nThe prime minister announced the national UK lockdown on 23 March. In an address to the nation, Mr Johnson called coronavirus the \"biggest threat\" the country had faced for decades.\n\"All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer,\" he said.\nIt's strange now to see that on 23 March, just 83 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Scotland.\nToday, that would be seen as a sign of an outbreak was well under control, but in March 2020 Scotland's testing strategy was in its infancy and the actual number of infections would have been vastly higher.\nDespite case figures being artificially low, it's still possible to see the growth rate. There was a slow build in the first days of March - and then the line on the graph steepens alarmingly.\nScotland went from an average of two cases a day on 7 March to peaking at an average of 343 a day a month later.\nHospital admissions and deaths also rose at a fast pace, the rates of both going from zero to their first wave peak in a matter of a few weeks.\nThe death rate lags behind the hospital admissions rate, but only by a fortnight - an indication of the fast progression of this disease in the sickest patients.\nBy the middle of March, there were only nine suspected Covid-19 cases among residents in adult care homes, according to Scottish government figures.y\nFour weeks later this figure stood at more than 1,700. It seemed the virus was tearing through the population most vulnerable to dying from the disease and the consequences of that were quickly obvious.\nBy 20 April, more than half of all deaths per week were in care homes, and remained so until the end of May, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS).\nUsing the most recent NRS data from 17 March 2021, exactly a third of all Covid deaths were in care comes, with most deaths occurring in hospital.\nScotland's full lockdown was eased at the end of May, with cases, deaths and hospital admissions dropping to very low levels over the summer.\nBut the virus hadn't been eliminated and as people began to travel more widely, in the UK and abroad, the second wave began.\n\"Once as a society we are allowed to travel again, we brought fresh new strains into Scotland which started our second wave,\" Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said in December - commenting on a study that said travel had \"reignited\" Scotland's outbreak.\nSmall clusters were detected at the end of the July - one centred on a call centre in North Lanarkshire and another linked to an Inverclyde pharmacy.\nBut a much bigger outbreak was taking hold in Aberdeen, linked to bars in the city. It also started at the end of July and grew quickly enough to trigger Scotland's first local lockdown on 5 August.\nThe first minister called it the \"the biggest wake-up call\" since the early days of the pandemic - and so it proved.\nIf the Aberdeen outbreak in August provided a warning that Covid had not disappeared, then the outbreak among students in September signalled the virus was definitely back for a second round.\nIn mid-September, Glasgow's infection rate began to climb steeply as Covid spread among students living closely together in shared accommodation.\nSimilar outbreaks also occurred in student populations in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen.\nPublic Health Scotland figures clearly show the rise in infections among younger people, with the elderly perhaps now being more cautious about exposure to the virus - or protected in locked down care homes.\nAs the number of cases built in the early autumn, the Scottish government began to apply a local restrictions strategy, with similar tactics being used in other parts of the UK.\nAn indoor visiting ban was put in place in parts of west Scotland at the beginning of September. It was followed by even stricter measures in October across much of the central belt.\nScottish ministers argued consistently that the restrictions were \"blunting\" the number of infections, though total cases in Scotland did not start going down until after the introduction of the levels system at the end of October.\nBut that decline was about to be brutally interrupted.\nNine cases of a new, more infectious, variant of Covid-19, first identified in south east England, were reported in Scotland on 15 December.\nAt this stage, there were still hopes for a Christmas easing of restrictions and Ms Sturgeon urged people not to \"prematurely overreact\" to the development.\nBut it was soon obvious the new strain was taking hold across the UK. Four days later, the Scottish government tightened the Christmas rules significantly and said tough level four restrictions would be applied to all of Scotland from 26 December.\nThe rise in cases was reflected once again in hospital admissions and deaths \nA full lockdown, with a firm stay at home message, was imposed across most of Scotland on 4 January.\nThe Scottish government was facing the prospect of the second wave biting far deeper than the first, with additional winter pressure on the NHS and a Covid variant which it was feared could lead to a higher chance of hospitalisation and death.\nThe number of Covid patients being treated in Scottish hospitals rose quickly past the spring 2020 peak and the death rate did the same.\nA corner was finally turned on 12 January when hospital admissions began to fall - but by then the new strain had already done its damage.\nIt's difficult to pick an exact date for when the first wave of Covid ended and the second began, but counting death certificates that mention Covid-19, average daily deaths reached their lowest point on 10 August.\nThis date is also near the middle of a five-week period in the summer when there were no Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nUp to 10 August, there were 4,219 deaths certificates mentioning Covid.\nSince that date there have been a further 5,614 deaths, using the latest figures available from the NRS.\nThere have been Covid deaths among younger people in Scotland - including a baby girl and two children aged between one and 14.\nBut almost 73% of the 9,831 deaths recorded by the NRS have been among the over-75s.\nThe latest figures from the NRS also show that the rate of Covid deaths gets higher the more deprived an area is.\nDeprivation is measured using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation and the NRS has made estimates of the death rates in each category.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December and more than two million people have now received their first dose.\nThere is some evidence that the vaccine is working with falling death rates among the vaccinated, though it is difficult to separate the effect of the vaccine with the impact of the current lockdown in Scotland.\nHowever, the evidence has been encouraging enough for the Scottish government to begin to talk more optimistically about a way of life \"much closer to normality\" by the summer.\nVaccination progress in Scotland has been good - about 45% of the population aged 16 or over have received a first dose of either the Pfizer or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.\nAnd crucially, close to 100% of those most at risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19 have been given a first dose.\nBarring serious disruptions to vaccine supply, the Scottish government is aiming to have offered a first dose to all adults by the end of July.\nThe pie chart above will then be one colour, or close to it. But Covid-19 will not have disappeared.\nNew variants may have emerged and much of the world's population will still not have been vaccinated. New infections will still be arriving in Scotland.\nIt is then that the real test of whether the vaccine has armoured the population against Covid will begin."

      "text": "A inquest has found that 10 people who were shot over a three-day period in Ballymurphy, west Belfast, in 1971, were \"entirely innocent\".\nCoroner Mrs Justice Keegan said nine of the victims were shot by the Army, could not definitively say who shot the tenth.\nThe victims included a priest trying to help the wounded and a mother of eight.\nMrs Justice Keegan, who delivered her findings over the course of more than two hours, said the deaths took place during Northern Ireland's Troubles in a \"highly charged and difficult environment\".\nBBC News NI reporter Will Leitch covered the inquest to its conclusion following 16 months of hearings.\nHe has reflected on some of the harrowing stories he heard during his \"longest and most difficult assignment\".\nIt was a cry of horror. A sharp, sudden cry of pain, of grief, of deep, deep sorrow.\nA visceral cry which must have pierced the heart of every single person who heard it echo around courtroom 12 of the Laganside Courts complex in Belfast.\nThe courtroom gasped as waves of emotion rippled out from the jury box, where the families were sitting to watch witnesses give evidence on day 33 of the Ballymurphy Inquest.\nThe daughters of Joan Connolly comforted their sister.\nShe had just heard, for the very first time, graphic details of how her mother was shot, and died, alone and in great pain, just feet from a house where another woman inside was frantically trying to save her.\nThat woman, now in the witness box, paused, and looked anxiously at the coroner to see if she should continue her evidence.\nMargaret Elmore had, under oath, described what she remembered from August 1971, and knew that in doing what the court asked, had inadvertently awoken great sorrow.\nThe court rose, to allow time for everyone to recompose themselves.\nThat was just one painful moment in March 2019 during the Ballymurphy Inquest, but one which has stayed with me.\nThis story was about ordinary people and the quest for the truth of what happened 50 years ago.\nI have watched and listened to many sad or upsetting court cases in my 30 years as a reporter.\nBut nothing prepares you for the cries of a woman who had just heard how half of her mother's face had been shot off.\nIn all, there had been more than 150 witnesses and 248 statements.\nOn my desk I now have four box files full of documents, notes, transcripts, TV and radio scripts.\nWhere the statement came from someone who could not attend, or was already dead, they were read out to the court, in full and at length.\nI watched as witnesses gave their recollections, listened to the voices of former soldiers giving evidence from behind a curtain and concentrated as experts in forensic pathology or ballistics explained their findings.\nI looked into the faces of former colonels and generals who waived their anonymity and tried to explain their command decisions.\nI also looked on as barristers asked pointedly about the witnesses who did not appear and the documents which were never submitted as evidence.\nIn 1971, the coroner had a list of all the soldiers who claimed to have shot anyone, but in the intervening years that list was lost.\nSeveral Army records, including some from the Parachute Regiment in 1971, are missing or incomplete.\n\"Witness X\" offered to supply information about Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) snipers in the area at the time, but despite giving answers to the coroner's investigators, he never appeared to testify in court.\nAlthough several witnesses, including the former Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams, said they had seen Irish Republican Army (IRA) gunmen in the area, no one from the IRA came forward with any information.\nCovering the Ballymurphy Inquest has been my longest and most difficult assignment, but the stories I tried my best to tell belonged to those people whose memories unfolded in the courtroom."

But there is one message the government is keen to get out - don't do what I did and ring your GP.\nTravellers also need to take coronavirus tests before returning to England and after arrival. \nSome countries may also require tests to be taken upon entry to the holiday destination.\nEuropean officials have announced plans for an EU-wide \"Green Digital Certificate\". \nThis would allow anyone vaccinated against Covid or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the region.\nOfficials hope the certificate will be in place before the summer.\nSeveral companies have been working on apps to make travel easier, including trade body the International Air Transport Association, who are piloting 'Travel Pass'. \nIt said it has been in discussions with government to ensure the pass can read data from the NHS App.\n\"We're keen to go further and faster now that the Secretary of State has confirmed that travellers will have access to their covid vaccination status by 17 May,\" a spokesperson added. \"Globally there are now 20+ countries that are either easing testing or quarantine requirements for vaccinated passengers so the UK needs to move quickly if it does not want to fall behind globally in supporting its citizens' ability to freely travel.\""

      "tags": "Earth science,Geology,Atlantic Ocean,Oceans",
      "text": "Scientists say we now have the most precise information yet on the deepest points in each of Earth's five oceans.\nThe key locations where the seafloor bottoms out in the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic and Southern oceans were mapped by the Five Deeps Expedition.\nSome of these places, such as the 10,924m-deep (6.8 miles) Mariana Trench in the western Pacific, had already been surveyed several times.\nBut the Five Deeps project removed a number of remaining uncertainties.\nFor example, in the Indian Ocean, there were two competing claims for the deepest point - a section of the Java Trench just off the coast of Indonesia; and a fracture zone to the southwest of Australia. \nThe rigorous measurement techniques employed by the Five Deeps team confirmed Java to be the winner, but this lowest section in the trench - at a depth of 7,187m - is actually 387km from where previous data had suggested the deepest point might be.\nLikewise, in the Southern Ocean, there is now a new place we must consider that region's deepest point. It's a depression called Factorian Deep at the far southern end of the South Sandwich Trench. It lies 7,432m down.\nThere is a location in the same trench, just to the north, that's deeper still (Meteor Deep at 8,265m) but it's technically in the Atlantic Ocean. The dividing line with the Southern Ocean starts at 60 degrees South latitude. \nAll of the new bathymetry (depth data) is contained in a paper published in the Geoscience Data Journal. \nIts lead author is Cassie Bongiovanni from Caladan Oceanic LLC, the company that helped organise the Five Deeps Expedition, which had as its figurehead the Texan financier and adventurer Victor Vescovo.\nThe former US Navy reservist wanted to become the first person in history to dive to the lowest points in all five oceans and achieved this goal when he reached a spot known as the Molloy Hole (5,551m) in the Arctic on 24 August, 2019.\nBut in parallel to Mr Vescovo setting dive records in his submarine, the Limiting Factor, his science team were taking an unprecedented number of measurements of the temperature and salinity (saltiness) of the seawater at all levels down to the ocean floor.\nThis information was crucial in correcting the echo-sounder depth readings made from the hull of the sub's support ship, the Pressure Drop. The reported depths therefore have high confidence, even if they come with uncertainties of plus or minus 15m. \nIn this context, refining the observations any further will be extremely hard. \nThe wider context here is the quest to get better mapping data of the seabed in general. Current knowledge is woeful. Roughly 80% of the global ocean floor remains to be surveyed to the modern standard delivered by the likes of the Five Deeps Expedition.\n\"Over the course of 10 months, as we visited these five locations, we mapped an area the size of continental France. But within that was an area the size of Finland that was totally new, where the seafloor had never been seen before,\" explained team-member Dr Heather Stewart from the British Geological Survey.\n\"It just shows what can be done, what still needs to be done. And the Pressure Drop continues to work, so we are gathering more and more data,\" she told BBC News.\nAll of this information is being handed over to the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project, which aims to compile, from various data sources, a full-ocean depth map by the end of the decade.\nIt would be a critical resource. Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons.\nThey are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines. \nThey are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.\nIn addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water. This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a pivotal role in moving heat around the planet. \nAnd if you want to understand precisely how sea-levels will rise in different parts of the world, good ocean-floor maps are a must.\nThe BBC made contact at the weekend with the Pressure Drop, which is currently sailing west of Australia in the Indian Ocean.\nTeam-member and co-author on the new paper, Prof Alan Jamieson, is still aboard. He said the research ship was making discoveries every time it sent instrumentation into the deep.\n\"For example, there are some major animal groups in the world for which we just don't know how deep they go. Just last month, we recorded a jellyfish 1,000m deeper than 9,000m, which was the previous record by us. So we've now got jellyfish down to 10,000m. \n\"Three weeks ago, we saw a squid at 6,500m. A squid at that depth! How did we not know this? And during the Five Deeps Expedition, we added 2,000m on the depth range for an octopus. \n\"These are not obscure animals; it's not like they're some sort of rare species. These are big animal groups that are clearly occupying much larger parts of the world than we thought,\" Prof Jamieson said. \nThe deepest place in the Atlantic is in the Puerto Rico Trench, a place called Brownson Deep at 8,378m. The expedition also confirmed the second deepest location in the Pacific, behind the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench. This runner-up is the Horizon Deep in the Tonga Trench with a depth of 10,816m."

      "text": "People \"on the doorstep didn't know what Keir Starmer stood for\", Labour's deputy leader has said following poor results in England's local elections.\nAngela Rayner, who was locked in a dispute with Sir Keir over her role in the party at the weekend, told the BBC the two had \"robust conversations\".\nHowever, she also said she believed in him \"100% because I wouldn't still be working with him if I didn't.\" \nShe said the party now had to \"connect with voters we've lost\".\nMs Rayner was removed as the party's campaign coordinator on Saturday evening but the following day was given a job shadowing Michael Gove at the Cabinet Office and also became Labour's spokesperson for the future of work. \nMs Rayner did not deny she had been sacked from the position but said they had agreed she should take on a more \"front-facing\" role.\nShe said she had \"a very frank relationship\" with her leader, adding: \"I have always been a bit fiery... and Keir's a very measured person so actually we work incredibly well... because we bounce off each other.\"  \nMs Rayner said she would use her new job to \"get out there and really sock it to the government\" but also to address questions from \"the doorstep\" about \"what does Labour stand for?\" \nThe Ashton-under-Lyne MP was speaking less than a week after Labour suffered defeat to the Conservative in the Hartlepool by-election and lost control of eight councils in England.\nHowever, the party achieved better results in Wales, where it remains the largest party in the Senedd - the Welsh Parliament.\nIt also won 11 out of 13 mayoral races in England.\nHowever, the results raised concern in the party that it had not done enough to win back its traditional strongholds from the Conservatives. \nReflecting on Sir Keir's time as Labour leader, Ms Rayner said it was \"right that we came together\" during the coronavirus pandemic but that now was the time for \"a fundamental rethink\" and \"real change in our communities\".\n\"The taxpayers of tomorrow will be paying off coronavirus for decades to come - I don't want them in low paid insecure work where they can't bring up their family and own their own home. \n\"I want to do something that tackles insecure work, tackles low pay, and delivers on high skilled jobs.\" \nShe also said she wanted to see green jobs go to areas that \"for decades haven't had any industry\". \nMs Rayner sought to distance herself from briefings by her supporters in the last few days saying, \"I say we pull together, like any family we have our fallouts and we do that in private'. \nShe warned, \"if we fight each other, then people don't think we're on their side and I want people to know that we are on their side - and that's what we are focused on.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People will be able to hug and meet in each other's homes from Monday as Scotland's Covid rules are relaxed.\nMainland Scotland will move to level two restrictions - although it is \"very likely\" Moray will remain in level three after a surge in cases.\nMost of the Scottish islands, except Arran, Bute, Cumbrae and Skye, will move to level one on the same date.\nAnd a traffic light system will be introduced for international travel from Monday.\nThe changes, which will also allow pubs and restaurants to sell alcohol indoors, were confirmed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.\nShe also announced that the requirement for social distancing during meetings indoors or in private gardens would be dropped.\n\"I actually feel a wee bit emotional saying this... from Monday, as long as you stay within permitted limits, you can hug your loved ones again,\" she said.\nThe first minister added that it was \"vital to be cautious\".\nA \"more fundamental review\" of physical distancing will be carried out in the next three weeks, which will look at whether there can be further relaxations in places like pubs and restaurants.\nLockdown is being eased a little faster than the Scottish government originally planned. \nAllowing social mixing in your own home from Monday was anticipated, but not with the removal of social distancing rules. \nAs the first minister put it, you can \"hug your loved ones again\" - echoing a similar announcement by the prime minister, relating to England. \nScotland is also aligning with the UK government's plans to open up international travel, but taking more time to consider easing the requirements for face coverings in school. \nEnding social distancing at home creates an anomaly because the rules will remain in force in other settings, including pubs and restaurants. \nThe Scottish government said it did not want to remove distancing rules everywhere at once, to reduce the risk of Covid flare-ups. A wider review of this policy is to report back in three weeks. \nMs Sturgeon said there were no changes at this stage to guidance on face coverings, but that their use in schools would be reviewed in the coming weeks.\nShe said it was \"highly probable\" that Moray would remain in level three when restrictions are eased in the rest of the country.\nCase numbers in the area are more than four times higher than in the rest of Scotland.\n\"It's against that backdrop that, unless the situation was to materially improve over the next few days, it would simply not be safe or sensible to ease restrictions there from Monday,\" she said.\nIt is also expected that travel restrictions will be reintroduced, so that travel in and out of Moray would be limited to \"permitted purposes only\". A final decision will be taken at the end of the week.\nScotland has five levels of Covid restrictions, which range from full lockdown down to level zero.\nIt is hoped that the whole country can move to level one on 7 June, then to level zero on 28 June - before returning to \"something much more like normality\" over the the summer.\nThe country moved down from level four to level three on 26 April, which enabled the reopening of cafes, pubs and restaurants, gyms, and the remaining non-essential shops.\nThe level two restrictions have been updated so that up to six people from three households will be able to meet in their homes, and can also stay overnight.\nAlcohol can be served indoors in pubs or restaurants, which will be allowed to stay open until 22:30 - and up to six adults from three households will be able to meet indoors in a public place.\nRestrictions on meeting up outdoors will ease further, to enable up to eight adults from eight different households to gather.\nAdult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises will be able to resume.\nCinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades are also likely to be able to reopen, and outdoor and indoor events like concerts can restart - although capacity may initially be limited.\nThe Western Isles, Orkney, Shetland and remote Highland and Argyll islands will move straight to level one on Monday because the virus is now sufficiently under control on those areas.\nMs Sturgeon also said there would be \"a careful move away from blanket restrictions\" on non-essential overseas travel.\nShe said the introduction of a traffic light system in Scotland meant there would be a consistent four-nations position.\nThe existing system of managed isolation will continue to apply to those arriving from countries on the red list, while those travelling from amber list countries must undertake a 10-day period of self-isolation with two PCR tests.\nPeople arriving from green list countries will be required to take a test when they arrive, but will not need to self-isolate if they do not have the virus.\nMs Sturgeon said green list status should be the \"exception not the rule\". Iceland, the Faroe Islands, New Zealand and Australia are among the 12 countries and territories initially on the list.\n\"Even though the rules on non-essential travel are starting to change, that doesn't mean we're saying that non-essential international travel is desirable,\" she added.\n\"Everyone should think seriously about whether they should travel abroad this summer.\n\"When it comes to holidays abroad, my advice continues to be to err on the side of caution and to staycation this summer.\"\nThe easing of restrictions was welcomed by the travel and tourism sectors, as well as Scotland's business groups.\nDr Liz Cameron, the chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said those sectors still \"gridlocked in uncertainty\" needed to re-open as quickly as possible."

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Most of Scotland will move to level two next Monday in the latest easing of Covid restrictions.\nThe new changes mean that three households will be be able to mix indoors and pubs can serve alcohol inside.\nHowever, cases have begun to rise slightly in recent days and health officials are dealing with a serious outbreak in north-east Scotland.\nHere are five figures which indicate the state of the pandemic in Scotland.\nThe emergence of the Kent Covid variant in the weeks before Christmas drove a massive spike in cases in Scotland.\nAt the beginning of the year, the number of weekly cases per 100,000 people in Scotland almost reached 300, triggering a full lockdown which lasted almost four months.\nCases have mainly been falling since January, although there was a small rise in mid-March after Scotland's primary school pupils returned to classrooms.\nHowever, the decline has been flattening and has actually begun to increase in recent days.\nOn Monday, the rate was 24 weekly cases per 100,000 people in Scotland - the fifth day in a row the rate has risen. The Scottish government believes this increase is \"largely driven\" by the Moray outbreak.\nDespite the recent increase, Scotland is still categorised as having a \"moderate\" level of community transmission, using a World Health Organization (WHO) system for measuring infection levels, with the rate sitting just above the \"low\" threshold.\nLooking at a local authority breakdown of case rates across Scotland, there is one stand-out exception.\nInfection levels have been rising in Moray since the beginning of April and the rate was almost 94 cases per 100,000 on 7 May - well above the 50-case threshold for level three.\nThe area has seen relatively low levels of Covid throughout most of the pandemic, but the rate in Moray is more than four times the Scotland-wide rate.\nHealth officials have said the area is experiencing \"uncontrolled, sustained community transmission\" of the virus and it is not yet clear if the outbreak has peaked.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was \"highly probable\" that Moray would remain in level three from 17 May, with travel restrictions in and out of the area,\n\"Unless the situation were to materially improve over the next few days, it would simply not be safe or sensible to ease restrictions there,\" she said.\nAs of 7 May, there were 12 local authorities with infection rates above the Scotland-wide level, but only Moray is above the level three threshold.\nThe Scottish government also takes into account other measures, like pressure on local health services, when deciding the local authority levels.\nLooking at Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the number of new deaths is at a similar level to where it was at the end of the summer.\nOnly one death has been registered since the beginning of the month, giving Scotland a Covid death rate of 0.018 deaths per 100,000 people.\nThis rate has come down from a peak of eight weekly deaths per 100,000 in January as the Kent variant was spreading rapidly.\nA total of 7,661 people have died in Scotland following a positive test for Covid-19.\nHowever, if you count all death certificates that mention Covid-19, the death toll is 10,097, according to the National Records of Scotland.\nThe Scottish government says this sustained decline in the death rate has been achieved through a combination of people sticking to lockdown rules, and the vaccination of those most vulnerable to becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19.\nAccording to the WHO thresholds, the death rate in Scotland indicates \"low\" levels of community transmission.\nIn the week up to 28 April - the most recent figures available from Public Health Scotland - 62 people were admitted to Scottish hospitals for Covid treatment.\nThe last time the figure was this low was 9 September, but then the trajectory was very much up rather than the sustained decline seen now.\nThe number of weekly admissions never reached zero over the summer, but did get down to eight in mid-July before beginning to rise again.\nThe rate of admissions per 100,000 is currently 1.1, giving Scotland a \"low\" level of community transmission according to the WHO thresholds.\nAccording to Scottish government figures, close to three million people had received a first dose of a Covid vaccine by 9 May - almost 65% of the total population aged 16 or over.\nAbout 1.5 million people are now fully vaccinated having received both doses of a vaccine.\nIt's clear from the chart below that there's been a big push on second doses in recent weeks, completing the vaccination of the many thousands who were given a first dose in February.\nHowever, the daily number of first doses being administered appears to be on the rise again. \nThe Scottish government also says that everyone in the nine priority groups, as set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has now been offered a vaccine.\nVaccination targets in the 60-64, 70-74 and 75-79 age groups have been met and are close to completion in the 55-59, 65-69 and 85-plus age groups.\nPeople in their 40s should now be receiving their vaccination invitations in the post. The Scottish government is aiming to offer a vaccine to everyone aged 16 or over by the end of July.\nThe WHO outlines five \"situational levels\" ranging from level zero, when there should be \"no restrictions\" on daily activities, up to level four which requires a full lockdown to tackle an \"uncontrolled epidemic\".\nUsing measures like Covid deaths, cases and hospital admissions, the WHO system indicates that Scotland is likely to be in level one.\nThat's where the organisation recommends that \"basic measures\" should remain in place to prevent Covid infections spreading, but any disruptions to social and economic life should be \"limited and transient\".\nThere are a couple of important caveats to note about the WHO guidelines, which were published in November.\nFirstly, they were written before vaccines were approved for use and so do not take into account a country's vaccination programme.\nSecondly, the advice also came out before the widespread emergence of new strains of Covid-19, which can be more transmissible and in some cases more deadly too."

      "text": "There will be a public inquiry into the government's handling of the Covid pandemic in the current parliamentary session, Boris Johnson has pledged.\nSpeaking on the first day of a new session of Parliament, the prime minister told MPs he had already made it clear an inquiry was \"essential\".\nHe was responding to a question from Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey \"on behalf of bereaved families\". \nMr Johnson had previously only said there would be an inquiry in future.\nA session of Parliament is typically a year, but can be longer, with one recent session lasting two years.\nThe question about the inquiry came in the Commons debate after the Queen's Speech, which sets out the government's programme for the coming year.\nMr Johnson said: \"I can certainly say that we will do that within this session. Yes, that's absolutely.\n\"I have made that clear before. I do believe it's essential that we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic.\"\nIt was first time Mr Johnson had put a timeframe on when a public inquiry will be held and comes a day after he had confirmed the government had met its four tests for easing lockdown restrictions in England next week. \nThe prime minister said deaths and hospitalisations had dropped to their lowest level since last July.\nThe latest government data released on Tuesday shows a further 20 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there have been 2,474 new cases.\nA total of 18,088,385 people have now received both doses of a vaccine, while 35,587,348 - 67.6% of all adults - have had a first jab.\nLast month, Downing Street told a campaign group there was was \"simply no capacity\" for the government to divert resources to an \"intensive\" inquiry at the current time.\nThe Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group has been lobbying Mr Johnson since last summer to meet them and to launch an urgent independent investigation into the pandemic.\nJo Goodman, co-founder of the group, said: \"An inquiry must begin this summer. The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. \n\"Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future.\"\nShe also urged Mr Johnson to commit to holding a statutory inquiry, where witnesses can be legally compelled to attend and give evidence under oath.\nDeputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: \"We welcome this commitment and will hold the prime minister to it.\n\"It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework.\"\nThe All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus urged the prime minister to set out a specific timeline and remit for the inquiry, with its vice-chairman, Tory MP Dan Poulter, calling for one focus to be Covid-related deaths in care homes."

      "text": "Texts published by the Treasury Committee reveal the extent of David Cameron's lobbying for the now-collapsed firm Greensill Capital.\nBetween 5 March and 26 June 2020, the ex-PM and his staff sent ministers and officials 45 messages on behalf of the company, including to the chancellor.\nThe committee is examining Mr Cameron's role in trying to access government funding for the financial company.\nCompany founder Lex Greensill appeared at the committee earlier on Tuesday.\nAnswering questions from MPs, Mr Greensill said he bore \"complete responsibility\" for the failure of his company adding that he was \"desperately saddened\" by the job losses.\nMr Cameron is due to face MPs on the same committee on Thursday afternoon.\nReports of Mr Cameron's lobbying for Greensill prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to order a review by lawyer Nigel Boardman into decisions made in government around the finance scheme and the role of Mr Greensill.\nThe Treasury Committee also published a letter from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in which it confirmed it is formally investigating the company.\nThe Treasury Committee's documents - provided by Mr Cameron - revealed that the former prime minister made strenuous efforts on behalf of Greensill including sending nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 texts to Sir Tom Scholar, the permanent secretary of the Treasury.\nMr Cameron also contacted Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi, as well as ministers in the Treasury. \nGreensill had hoped to take part in a government scheme - the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) - set up to help businesses during the pandemic. \nHowever the Treasury rejected their application concluding the firm's proposals were not suitable. \nOn 3 April, Mr Cameron contacted Sir Tom: \"Again Greensill have got a \"no\". Am genuinely baffled. Letter says CCFF is there to provide liquidity for \"non financial corporates\". That is what we do. The fact the notes are issued by a financial entity is irrelevant. The recipients of the money are all non financials and mostly SMEs [Small and medium enterprises]! Can I have 5 minutes for a call? This seems bonkers.  Am now calling CX, Gove, everyone.\" \nAnd on the same day he messaged Mr Sunak: \"HMT are refusing to extend CCFF to include supply chain finance, which is nuts as it pumps billions of cheap credit into SMEs... think there is a simple misunderstanding that I can explain.\"\nAlso on 3 April, Mr Cameron messaged Mr Gove: \"I know you are manically busy - and doing a great job, by the way (this is bloody hard and I think the team is coping extremely well). But do you have a moment for a word? I am on this number and v free.\"\nLater that month on 22 April, Mr Cameron wrote to Mr Sunak: \"Just to report back. Three weeks later and while constructive conversations have taken place, the situation is still stuck.\" \n\"Could you try and give it another nudge over the finish line - this is clearly in the national interest, creates instant value for tens of thousands of SMEs and complies with the spirit (and we believe the letter) of the CCFF Market Notice?\"\nResponding to criticism over his lobbying efforts, Mr Cameron released a statement last month in which he acknowledged he should have contacted the government \"through only the most formal of channels\".\nHowever, he insisted that he had not broken any codes of conduct or government rules on lobbying. \nThe collapse of Greensill - which filed for insolvency in March - has threatened thousands of UK jobs at Liberty Steel, which was dependent on it for its financing.\nGiving evidence to the Treasury Committee, Mr Greensill said that his company had sought to take part in the CCFF scheme to ensure \"continued liquidity\" for its clients which included small businesses. \nCommittee chair Mel Stride asked if he was also motivated by a desire to \"shore up against potential problems\" Greensill itself might face during the pandemic. \nMr Greensill replied that his company had \"at no time sought funding for itself\" from the CCFF scheme. \nHe also said there had been \"no loss to the UK taxpayer\" from Greensill's collapse.

But there is one message the government is keen to get out - don't do what I did and ring your GP.\nTravellers also need to take coronavirus tests before returning to England and after arrival. \nSome countries may also require tests to be taken upon entry to the holiday destination.\nEuropean officials have announced plans for an EU-wide \"Green Digital Certificate\". \nThis would allow anyone vaccinated against Covid or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the region.\nOfficials hope the certificate will be in place before the summer.\nSeveral companies have been working on apps to make travel easier, including trade body the International Air Transport Association, who are piloting 'Travel Pass'. \nIt said it has been in discussions with government to ensure the pass can read data from the NHS App.\n\"We're keen to go further and faster now that the Secretary of State has confirmed that travellers will have access to their covid vaccination status by 17 May,\" a spokesperson added. \"Globally there are now 20+ countries that are either easing testing or quarantine requirements for vaccinated passengers so the UK needs to move quickly if it does not want to fall behind globally in supporting its citizens' ability to freely travel.\""

No date has been set in Wales.\nMr Drakeford is expected to reveal his next steps on Covid at a press conference on Friday, following discussions with ministers on Monday.\nCoronavirus case rates currently stand at the lowest since last August, with 8.6 cases per 100,000 people over seven days.\nNick Newman, a licensee at Croeso Pubs which owns the Philharmonic and Brewhouse venues in Cardiff, said the situation was bad for nightclub businesses.\nThe chairman of the Cardiff Licensee Forum said: \"There's still a huge sector of our business which has no clarity whatsoever as to when it's going to reopen - nightclubs, venues that specialise in music.\n\"I know operators of nightclubs who are quite frankly desperate - there's no money left in the bank account.\n\"The licensees forum compromises roughly 100 businesses - or at least it did before the pandemic started. We've probably lost eight or nine businesses through this. Some of them are smallish businesses - some have been quite iconic.\"\nPubs and restaurants will be able to reopen indoors from 17 May, with four allowed to meet inside venues. But Mr Newman warned that would have a \"crippling effect\" on traders' ability to trade profitably.\n\"The way the night time economy has been treated in Wales during the pandemic just isn't good enough,\" he added.\nUnder the current system, coronavirus restrictions are set according to which alert level the Welsh government believes is needed, according to what the risk is deemed to be.\nThe traffic light control plan has nightclubs and late-night entertainment venues closed at all coronavirus alert levels, except for pilot events at the low risk alert level one.\nMr Drakeford has dubbed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's roadmap for England \"very optimistic\".\nWales is currently in the high risk alert level three, with plans to move into alert level two if rates remain low on Monday.\nAn open letter from the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) asks for \"an indicative date for when nightclubs, entertainment-led, and late-night venues will be able to reopen without restrictions\".\n\"Under the alert levels as described in the current 'control plan', these businesses have no hope for reopening other than for test events in the lowest alert level.\n\"We would stress the importance for our sector of knowing when they will be able to operate without or with minimal restrictions and take deliberate decisions about staffing, debt and investment now, as night time economy businesses in England are currently doing.\"\nIt asks for additional financial support: \"Welsh government support initiatives to date have been neither sufficient nor comprehensive enough to prevent many businesses in the sector falling into significant debt.\n\"Without either a clear path to unrestricted opening, or extended and enhanced financial support, the Welsh government is condemning thousands of businesses in our sector.... to bankruptcy,\" it added.\nThe letter also calls for consistency for groups that can meet indoors and outdoors - six are currently able to meet outside, and for guidance to be changed so it does not \"discriminate\" against venues with amplified sound and music.\nIt is backed by licensee groups in Cardiff and Swansea.\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said only businesses in England could have \"some optimism\" of reopening soon.\n\"In Wales, we've only got 17 May as a date to cling on to for indoor hospitality,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"We do need that same timeline, that same line of sight that we've got in England and in Scotland, to be able to look at reopening those closed segments of the economy and then looking forward to ending all restrictions altogether.\"\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"We understand the difficulties faced by all businesses, and particularly those involved in the night-time economy. \n\"We will continue to work with the sector and give businesses as much notice as possible. However, any decision to relax restrictions must be based on the latest medical and scientific advice.\"\nA recent set of pilot events took place in Liverpool, with a music festival, two club nights and a business conference held with no masks or social distancing."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People in England will be allowed to hug loved ones and enjoy indoor hospitality from next Monday, the PM has said - whilst urging people to \"exercise caution and common sense\".\nBoris Johnson said this was the \"single biggest step\" to unlocking society but that people should remain vigilant.\nIndoor mixing and overnight stays in groups of up to six people or two households will also resume.\nLeisure venues such as cinemas, museums and children's play areas will reopen.\nSpeaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said the further relaxation of England's lockdown would go ahead on 17 May as the government had met its four tests for easing restrictions.\nThese tests relied on the success of the vaccine rollout, evidence that the jabs were reducing serious illness and death, infection rates remaining under control and the risks from new Covid variants not changing.\nThe prime minister said the latest data showed deaths and hospitalisations had dropped to their lowest level since last July.\nZero coronavirus deaths were announced in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Monday, while Wales recorded four deaths.\nMore than two-thirds of adults across the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine,  with almost 18 million people having had their second dose.\nThe UK's four chief medical officers said earlier that the UK's Covid alert level should be lowered from level four to three. \nIt means that although coronavirus is in general circulation, transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially, so restrictions can be gradually reduced. \nMr Johnson said that all the data supported the latest easing of restrictions, which he said amounted to \"a considerable step on the road back to normality\".\n\"And today we're taking a step toward that moment when we learn to live responsibly with Covid, when we cease eventually to rely on detailed government edicts and make our own decisions based on the best scientific advice about how best to protect our families and those around us.\"\nHe added that, as part of the latest lockdown easing, the government would update its guidance on close contact between close family and friends shortly.\nThe advice would explain the risks involved so people could make informed choices, he said.\n\"This doesn't mean that we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. We all know that close contacts such as hugging is a direct way of transmitting this disease,\" he said.\n\"So I urge you to think about the vulnerability of your loved ones.\"\nMr Johnson said social distancing should still be followed when people are not with their friends and family in workplaces, shops, pubs, restaurants and other settings.\nHe also confirmed that the wearing of face masks in secondary school classrooms in England will not be required after 17 May.\nCare home residents will be able to have up to five named visitors, he said, and greater freedoms to enjoy low- risk visits outside their home without having to isolate on their return. \nThis next unlocking is - as the prime minister and his scientists stressed - the most significant step yet.\nIndoors is, after all, where transmission is most likely to take place, which explains why quite a sober tone accompanied the confirmation that restrictions would lift.\nIt means vaccines are going to have to do most of the work in terms of controlling infection levels - during the winter it has been lockdown and social distancing that has played a key role in getting cases down.\nThe good news is that all the evidence is pointing to the vaccines being incredibly effective.\nIt means the threat of the NHS being overwhelmed and lockdowns reimposed has gone - unless a new variant comes along that can evade the vaccines in a significant way (considered unlikely by most experts).\nBut cases could still creep up and there could be local outbreaks that need intervening on.\nIt's why the key message is proceed with caution.\nThe devolved nations are working to their own timeframe for easing restrictions.\nUnder current plans in Wales, indoor attractions, cinemas and theatres will open alongside pubs and restaurants serving customers inside on 17 May.\nIn Scotland, indoor hospitality venues are expected to resume with alcohol being served until 22:30. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls should reopen and indoor group exercise restart.\nMore restrictions might be lifted in Northern Ireland on 24 May, including the reopening of indoor hospitality, B&Bs and hotels. \nThe prime minister said subject to the impact of the latest easing on the data, England was still on track to progress to step four of the government's roadmap from 21 June - when it is hoped that all legal limits on social contact will be removed.\nAsked by BBC Health editor Hugh Pym if the final stage of unlocking would be brought forward, Mr Johnson said every time restrictions are relaxed, \"we give ourselves breathing space\" to make sure that cases are not rising too much due to more social contact being allowed.\nThe easing of measures next week is the most significant step, he added, saying that businesses want to get ready for the next planned relaxation on 21 June with the \"biggest certainty\" they can have.\nIn order to give businesses time to prepare, further details will be released later this month \"about what the world will look like and what role there could be, if any, for certification and social distancing\", Mr Johnson said.\nMeanwhile, new data published by Public Health England shows that a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab reduces the risk of death with Covid by 80% compared with unvaccinated individuals. \nResearchers also found the two doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine reduced the risk of death by 97%.\nIn other key developments:\nIs there someone you have been waiting until the guidance changes to hug?

      "tags": "Belfast,The Troubles,Ballymurphy inquest",
      "text": "The families of those killed in Ballymurphy in 1971 have been giving moving accounts of their relatives to the inquest. \nThe killings happened during an Army operation in which paramilitary suspects were detained without trial.\nThe inquest began in November 2018 and the findings are due to be published on 11 May 2021.\nThe victims included a priest trying to help one of the wounded and a mother of eight.\nHere are extracts from the statements given by the victims' relatives:\nThe 38-year-old priest, who was from Portaferry, County Down, and served a year in the Merchant Navy, had served in parishes in Belfast, County Antrim and County Down before coming to Ballymurphy.\nHis brother, Patsy, said Hugh loved sailing on Strangford Lough and when he served in the Good Shepherd Convent in Belfast he would play guitar and sing to the children.\nHe said that on the night of 9 August 1971, he heard that a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.\n\"I knew it would be him,\" he said. \n\"When I was later told that he was dead, I phoned our doctor and asked him to come to be with my mother as I didn't know how she would cope with this news. She was in a terrible state and had to be sedated.\"  \nFr Mullan's cousin, Gabriel Ellison, said that as a child he had been sailing a toy boat off the slip in Portaferry when he fell into the water.\n\"Hughie ran out of his house and jumped in after me and pulled me out,\" he said.   \n\"I was surely gone only for his super actions, he was at QUB [Queen's University Belfast] then and had learned life saving skills.\"\nFrank Quinn was 19 and from west Belfast. While he had worked in a number of jobs after leaving school, his main one was a window cleaner.\nHe married his wife, Ann, when he was 17 and they had a daughter, Angela, soon afterwards. \nAnn was pregnant with their second daughter Frances, when Mr Quinn was shot dead.\nFrank's younger brother Pat recalled the moment his father came home from work and told the family that Frank had been shot.\n\"I said 'was he wounded? Was he wounded?' and he said 'no, he's dead'. Those three words changed me and my family's lives forever.\"  \nAngela Sloan, Frank Quinn's elder daughter, said growing up without her father was heart-breaking and that her mother never remarried \"such was her love for my daddy\".\n\"He should have been there for us but all we had of him was pictures,\" she said.\n\"Daddy now has four amazing grandchildren and a little great grandson, Ronan. We were all robbed of his presence in our lives.\"  \nJoan Connolly, a 44-year-old mother of eight, was the only woman shot in the Ballymurphy killings.\nMrs Connolly and her family moved from a two-bedroom bungalow on north Belfast's Shore Road to a four-bedroom house in Ballymurphy in 1966.\nHer daughter, Briege Voyle, said her mother was shocked by the start of the Troubles, saying that she \"just couldn't get her head around\" what was happening\nHer eldest daughter married a British soldier and they had a baby son, Joan's first grandson. Previously Joan had made tea and sandwiches for British soldiers at her house.\nBriege was moved to a refugee camp in Waterford during the violence in Ballymurphy and only found out her mother was dead when she saw it on a TV news report.\nShe went out to look for her daughters on the night of 9 August 1971 when she was shot dead.\n\"My mother was very dearly loved and has been very dearly missed. Losing her destroyed our family. \n\"Whilst coping without her has been hard for all of us what has made things worse were the media reports that she was a gunwoman and the rumours that followed us that we were the children of the gunwoman that was shot. I believe this to be untrue.\" \nJoseph Murphy, 42, from west Belfast, a father of 12, whose father had served in the British army, worked as a rag and bone man.\nHis daughter Janet Donnelly said he would often bring stray animals home with him, which was how she got her first pet - a kitten. \nShe told the inquest she remembered waiting for her dad to come home from work on Friday nights and asking her who she loved most as she sat on his knee.\n\"I remember my daddy going out on the day he was shot. We were all upstairs and I can remember running to the landing and shouting 'Daddy where are you going?' and him saying 'a wee message'.\n\"I asked him to give me a kiss and stuck my head through the bannister of our stairs and he kissed me.\"\nHe was shot in the leg on 9 August 1971 and taken to hospital where he died 13 days later, on his twin sons' 16th birthday.\n\"I was only eight when my daddy died but I remember that Sunday as if it was yesterday,\" Mrs Donnelly said.\n\"This was the first time I ever saw my brothers cry. They never celebrated another birthday since that day.\"\nNoel Phillips was a 19-year-old window cleaner, who according to his brother Kevin \"loved his style\" and was so quiet, sedate and easy going that no-one could say a bad word about him.\nKevin Phillips said that when trouble broke out on 9 August 1971 his brother was \"doing what kids do, you would go for a nosey that's all he was doing\".\nHe said his brother Robert and a brother-in-law went to the morgue to identify Noel's body after he was shot.\n\"They came back in a terrible state, nothing was ever the same from that point,\" he said.  \n\"Nobody came to tell us Noel was dead we just had to find out for ourselves.\"\nHe said his mother, once a happy go lucky woman, \"went to pieces\" and was never the same after losing her son.\n\"After his death everything just went black, everything changed for us. There was no laughing or messing about, the normal things six brothers would get up to, that all changed,\" he said.\n\"We never spoke about our Noel's death and we never asked our older brother Robert about identifying his body. He never spoke about it right up until the day he died.\" \nAlice Harper is the daughter of Daniel Teggart, 44, who was shot near the Henry Taggart army base near Springfield Park.\nShe said she was part of a family of 13 children and they had been living in a house in New Barnsley Crescent prior to her father's death.\n\"It might seem impossible to care for 13 children and work but my father did his stint around the house caring for us,\" Ms Harper said.\nMrs Harper said her father went missing on the day interment was introduced, 9 August 1972, and she went to the Henry Taggart army base to ask for information:\n\"I asked 'did you arrest my father?' I was just asking different questions and they just said 'no we hadn't time for arrests we only had time for killing' and that was their words.\"  \nThe Army later directed her to a morgue. \n\"After that, all of our lives changed completely and it affected our family in a big way,\" she said. \nThe IRA shot dead one of her brothers in 1973.\n\"Our family never got any support we were just left to get on with things,\" she said. \n\"It took us a long time but we got our Bernard's name cleared. Now we need to get our daddy's name cleared. He was innocent just like Bernard was.\"\nEileen McKeown is the daughter of Joseph Corr, 43, who was shot at the top of the Whiterock Road.\nMr Corr worked in Shorts as a machinist. After the Army said he was an IRA gunman, his family got hate mail from his former colleagues, Ms McKeown said.\nShe said that Mr Corr lived for his family, even taking on part-time jobs to bring in extra money.\nThe family were in the process of emigrating to Australia when he was killed. \n\"Daddy was shot on the 11 August and was in hospital for sixteen days before he died, at the beginning he was missing, we didn't know where he was, whether he was alive or dead before he was found in Musgrave military hospital, I remember thinking why did they take him there when the Royal Victoria Hospital is closer?\n\"When my daddy was in hospital, we were taken to a refugee camp somewhere in Dublin to a convent I think, mammy must have thought we would be safer there. \n\"The next memory I have is my uncle Paddy telling us that my daddy was dead,\" Ms McKeown said, adding that the lives of everyone in the family changed completely. \n\"The soldiers who did this, they don't realise the after-effects. I mean, I used to have four brothers and now I've none. \n\"With all the boys they resented the fact that they lost their daddy and they never had a father figure around. Their dependence on alcohol and early deaths are as a direct result of losing my daddy.\"\nMs McKeown said she wanted her father's name cleared and the true facts to be recorded.\nKathleen McCarry is the younger sister of Edward Doherty, 31, who was shot at the corner of Brittons Parade and Whiterock Road.\nMr Doherty had been a soldier, a member of the Royal Engineers, who later joined the Territorial Army.\nMs McCarry remembers her brother as a family man. With rumours that internment was going to be introduced, Mr Doherty sent his wife and children to Ardglass in County Down. \nMs McCarry saw her brother on the second day of internment:\n\"I told him to watch himself going down the road and he said he would. He left my daddy's and went on to our sister Theresa's where he had a cup of tea. He left Theresa's at 4.35pm.   \n\"The next thing we knew Eddie was dead.\"\n\"My mummy went to pieces, we all went to pieces, it was like a nightmare you were never wakening from, we just found it so hard to cope,\" Ms McCarry said. \nShe said her family and his were torn apart with grief.\nMs McCarry said she wanted her brother's named cleared for him and his children.\n\"It just takes over your life. When you think it's 47 years and that's a lifetime.\"\nJohn McKerr was a 49-year-old former British soldier, who despite losing his right hand in World War Two worked as a joiner.\nHe was returning from working at a church when he was shot and injured on 11 August 1971. He died in hospital a week later.\nThe family found out he had been shot from a newspaper report the following day after he failed to return.\nMr McKerr was a father of eight and had four grandchildren at the time of his death.\nHis eldest daughter Anne Ferguson said the family had been brought up to \"live and let live\".\n\"The newspaper reports about daddy being in the IRA were terrible lies which only made matters worse,\" she said.  \n\"As a family we were devastated by the untruths spoken about our father.\n\"If the inquest does find the truth it will help us all a little. Please God that it does.\"\nMrs Ferguson said her sister remembers an Army officer apologising to her mother before the funeral.\nShe added: \"There is nothing in this world that will ever fill the void that his death has left for all of us.\"  \nJohn Laverty, 20, was named after his uncle, who had fought in World War Two.\nCarmel Quinn, Mr Laverty's youngest sister, said her earliest memory of him was being carried on his shoulders to Clonard Novena.\nMr Laverty, who worked for the Belfast Corporation, was shot in the back and killed on 11 August, while his brother Terry was arrested.\nMrs Quinn said her sister Rita remembers \"hearing our daddy cry out in the chapel 'ah God, my son' and breaking down\".\n\"We had never saw our daddy cry before,\" she added.\nWith John dead and his brother Terry imprisoned, Mrs Quinn said that \"Christmas of 1971 was not a Christmas in our house, our mummy and daddy had two sons missing\".\n\"Life went on but was never the same. We were happy and then, in the blink of an eye, it was all gone,\" she said.  \nIn April 1974, Mr Laverty's sister gave birth to a son, named John after his uncle.\n\"My parents seemed to have found a bit of hope,\" Mrs Quinn said. \"He was so much like our big John.\"\nTragically, five years later 'wee John' was knocked down and killed by a car.\nOf her brother, Mrs Quinn said: \"A young fella that had so much life in him to live. We truly wish we could hear his loud laugh, see the glint in his big brown eyes and most of all to hear him sing once more.\""

      "tags": "Plaid Cymru,Welsh Parliament",
      "text": "Labour's response to the Covid pandemic helped the party retain power after it won the most seats in the Welsh elections, Mark Drakeford has said. \nMr Drakeford is set to continue as Wales' first minister after Labour won 30 of the 60 Welsh Parliament seats. \nThe Conservatives had their best Senedd campaign with 16 seats while Plaid in third took 13 seats.\nWelsh Labour leader Mr Drakeford has said his next Welsh government would be \"radical\" and \"ambitious\". \nHe said people felt they've been \"kept safe here in Wales\" and that was a \"strong theme\" in the election.\n\"From the very first day of the campaign here in Porthcawl, people have been coming to the doorstep to tell us that they feel glad they've lived in Wales over the last 15 months,\" said Mr Drakeford.\n\"A government I lead will continue to follow the science to do what our medical advisers tells us we should do, and that does mean doing things in a way that continues to keep Wales safe.\"\nThe Welsh Government controls Wales' Covid response and the relaxing of restrictions - such as meeting inside pubs and restaurants and travel rules - has tended to have been more cautious in Wales.\n\"But on other matters, our manifesto is a radical manifesto with a host of ideas that are ambitious for Wales,\" added Mr Drakeford.\n\"I'll be very keen to ensure that we give that the most powerful sense of momentum behind it to get those things happening here in Wales.\"\nLabour, who have been in power in Wales either in coalition or as a minority ever since devolution in 1999, did fall one seat short of the 31 needed for an outright majority.\nBut this is a feat no party has ever achieved in the history of the Welsh Parliament.\nFifty-two of the 60 Senedd seats were declared on Friday, with two final regional list results on Saturday. \nBoth the South Wales East and South Wales Central constituencies returned two Welsh Conservative and two Plaid Cymru Members of the Senedd (MS).\nIn South Wales East, Delyth Jewell and Peredur Owen Griffiths were elected for Plaid, while Laura Anne Jones and Natasha Asghar will represent the region for the Welsh Conservatives. \nMs Asghar has become the first woman of colour to be elected into the Welsh Parliament and she was welcomed by Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies.\nMr Davies was elected in South Wales Central alongside fellow Tory politician Joel James and Plaid Cymru members Rhys ab Owen and Heledd Fychan.\nLabour fell one short of an outright majority, but the Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds, who was elected as an MS for Mid and West Wales has said she will not be seeking a ministerial role, like her predecessor Kirsty Williams. \n\"I'm absolutely clear that I'll be working across parties and I need to focus on what we can deliver,\" she said.\n\"But it is it is the case, I hope that I can work with and I can influence other parties, predominantly Labour, in order to deliver some of those real liberal values\".\nFour parties are represented in the new Senedd, which features 34 men and 26 women. Nineteen of the 60 MSs, just under a third, are serving in the Welsh Parliament for the first time. \nThe Welsh Conservatives will be the second largest party in the Welsh Parliament and made gains on both the constituency and regional lists, but failed to win some of its target seats needed to win the election. \nIt did take the Vale of Clywd from Labour for the first time in 22 years, but Clwyd South and Wrexham, which both voted Conservative in the 2019 General Election, remained red. \nThe party also took Brecon and Radnorshire from the Liberal Democrats and won eight seats on the regional lists, more than any other party. \nThe 16-seat total beats the Conservatives' best result in a Welsh Parliament election of 14. \n\"The team has gone above and beyond and deserve great credit for the positive campaign we've run right across Wales,\" said leader Mr Davies.\n\"I am thrilled to see Natasha Asghar make history in South Wales East by becoming the first female from a BAME background to be elected to the Senedd.\n\"It's been an unconventional campaign and it's clear incumbency and continuity has played a significant part. To that end, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mark Drakeford and Welsh Labour on a successful campaign.\"\nPlaid Cymru won 13 seats, but former party leader Leanne Wood lost her seat in Rhondda to Labour. \nThe party's MP for Ceredigion, Ben Lake said on Friday losing Rhondda was \"an absolutely terrible blow\" for Plaid.\nSpeaking after the final results came in on Saturday, Plaid Cymru leader Adam price said the Senedd would be a \"poorer place\" without Ms Wood, who served in the Welsh Parliament for 18 years. \nHe also extended his congratulations to Mr Drakeford. \nHe added: \"Although disappointed not to be returning more Members to the Senedd, I am proud Plaid Cymru ran a positive campaign based on a transformational programme.\n\"Our Senedd group will bring renewed energy and fresh ideas, and I look forward to working with all my colleagues as we continue to build the case for independence.\"\nThere were no wins for smaller parties, including UKIP, Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party and Reform UK - in sharp contrast to the seven regional seats UKIP took in 2016.\nThe new Senedd chamber will be made up only of members of the traditional parties.\nDespite fears that turnout could be exceptionally low due to the coronavirus pandemic, turnout for the election was the highest in the Senedd's history.\nAt 46.6% this was just slightly higher than the record high of 46.3% at the first Senedd election in 1999, but is significantly lower than turnout for general elections.\nFor the first time 16-17-year-olds were able to vote at an election in Wales, but less than half registered to vote for who could form the next Welsh Parliament."
