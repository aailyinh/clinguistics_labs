They detained her and found the missing jewellery in her possession. \nBut that was not all. They were soon able to link her with the theft of a wallet from the body of a man at the same funeral home, earlier on the same day, Tuesday 24 August.\nWhen the suspect's home was searched, police also found a stack of recent death notices. Included in the notices were the access codes for family members to enter the individual rooms where the coffins of their relatives were reposing. \nThe woman will appear in court in 2022. "

      "text": "Marks & Spencer no longer sells men's suits at more than half of its 254 bigger stores as the pandemic hit \"fast forward\" on the trend for casual wear.\nIt said men's preferences were already shifting to \"smart separates\" such as chinos and shirts before coronavirus.\nBut Wes Taylor, director of menswear at M&S, said: \"Covid hit fast forward on the trend to more casual dressing that was already in train.\"\nNow the retailer only sells men's suits at 110 large shops.\nIn total, sales of them in the UK have fallen by 2.3 million over five years, according to the market research firm Kantar Group.\nIt said men purchased two million of them in the year to July compared to 4.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nThe decline in M&S stores selling men's suits, which was first reported in The Sunday Times, was already being seen in 2019 when the retailer said sales fell by seven per cent.\nHowever, in the first two months of the Covid pandemic, when millions of people were forced to work from home, M&S said it sold just 7,500 suits - a fall of 80% compared to the same period in the previous year.\nIn contrast, it said, \"shorts and jogger sales were up\". Mr Taylor said: \"During the pandemic we worked hard to adapt our product offer to be more relevant to customers' rapidly changing needs.\" \nWhile M&S says it has seen some increase in demand following the easing of Covid restrictions and weddings now being allowed to take place, Mr Taylor said: \"Our Smartwear is now more focused on smart separates - easy to wear, stylish smart clothing that can be worn in lots of different ways\".\nThe average spend on men's suits has also declined over the past decade, according to Kantar, from a high of \u00a3534m in 2011. Some five years ago, spending on men's suits hit \u00a3469m but fell to just \u00a3159m in the 12 months to July.\nKantar said that although there has also been a fall in sales of women's suits over five years, it is less pronounced than men's professional wear. In the year to July, women bought 500,000 of them compared to 600,000 in 2017.\nM&S said it continues to sell ties and shirts at its 254 larger stores which offer clothing as well as food. \nM&S has around 700 stores in total, the majority of which are food-only but people who buy suits online can have them delivered to any of its shops.\nThe retailer also launched an online video consultation service during the pandemic for men seeking advice on buying suits.

      "tags": "Hurricanes,Severe weather",
      "text": "As we enter hurricane season, when there is a greater chance of more powerful storms developing in the Atlantic, here is a guide to how deadly storms form, how they are measured and why they happen where they do.\nHurricanes are the biggest and most violent storms on the planet. Every year, between June and November they hit the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern coast of the United States, sometimes leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.\nIn the Pacific Ocean, they are known as cyclones. In the Indian Ocean and southern Pacific, they are known as typhoons. They are all tropical storms, but they are only called hurricanes in the north Atlantic and north-eastern Pacific.\nMost hurricanes that form in the Atlantic are the result of an atmospheric phenomenon known as a tropical wave. \nThe wave starts as a type of atmospheric trough that creates an area of relatively low air pressure - usually in western Africa, in mid-July. \nIf the conditions are right for it to develop, the low pressure starts to move west, with the help of the trade winds or easterlies.\nWhen it reaches the Atlantic, the tropical wave has the potential to become a hurricane - but for this to happen it needs enough energy in the form of heat and wind.\nIn fact, it needs a deep layer of warm water, with a surface water temperature above 27C.\nIt also needs the right winds - horizontally swirling winds to concentrate the storm and a weak vertical wind shear rising from the surface of the sea. \nIf the wind shear changes too much as it rises, it can disrupt the flow of heat and humidity needed to create the hurricane.\nThe final ingredient is a concentration of rain clouds and high humidity in the area.\nThis all needs to happen in the right place - generally between 10 and 30 degrees latitude in the northern hemisphere, where the rotation of the Earth helps the winds converge and rise in the area of low pressure.\nWhen a tropical wave encounters all these elements, they all start to interact over an area between 50km (31 miles) and 100km wide.\n\"The movement of the tropical wave is a trigger for the storm,\" says Jorge Zaval Hidalgo, general co-ordinator of Mexico's National Weather Service.\nThe storm is the catalyst - and the dance of heat, air and water begins.\nThe area of low pressure cools the humid, warm air rising from the ocean, which fills the clouds.\nThe condensation of this air releases heat, which lowers the pressure even more, drawing more humidity from the ocean and the storm builds.\nThe winds converge and rise within the area of low pressure, spinning counter clockwise, giving the hurricane its trademark shape.\nWhile the storm becomes more powerful, the eye of the hurricane - the central area about 30-60km wide on average - remains relatively calm.\nAround it, rises the eye wall of dense clouds and most intense winds.\nBeyond that are the spiral bands of cloud, where there is the most rain.\nThe wind speeds are what determine the moment at which we can call this phenomenon a hurricane.\nAt its birth, it is a tropical depression. As it gathers strength, it becomes a tropical storm. When speeds reach more than 118km an hour, it is a hurricane.\nHowever, hurricanes can be classified in five categories depending on the sustained wind speeds. In the Atlantic, the Saffir-Simpson wind scale is used to measure their destructive power.\nOne hurricane's winds can produce about half as much energy as the electrical generating capacity of the entire world, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \nHowever, it is not the winds that cause the most destruction and loss of life, but the storm surge and flooding caused by the hurricane's rain.\nIn the United States, for example, the storm surge caused by tropical cyclones in the Atlantic were responsible for nearly half of hurricane-related deaths between 1963 and 2012, according to the American Meteorological Society.\nThe level of destruction caused by a hurricane is also going to depend on other circumstances, such as the speed at which it hits, the terrain and local infrastructure in the affected area.\n\"The damage or danger associated with a tropical cyclone does not necessarily correspond to its category. For example, the highest level storm will not necessarily mean more rain,\" Mr Hidalgo told the BBC.\nHere is a recap:\nIf you can't see the explainer above, follow this link\nHurricane Irma: Visual guide\nSix graphics that sum up Puerto Rico disaster\nText and graphics by Camilla Costa, Carol Olona and Cecilia Tombesi"

It just seemed it would be much too valuable [to leave behind],\" Mr Hanks said.\n\"We don't have any culture of this in [the United States]. I don't know if this is unusual but it seems odd to me.\"\nCapt Landon was 28 when he was killed on 3 September 1916 near the French village of Guillemont, which was left ravaged by the Battle of the Somme. \nHe is commemorated at the Thiepval Memorial, which marks the deaths of more than 72,000 British and South African servicemen who died during the war and have no known grave. \nCapt Landon was from a middle-class family from Shenfield, Essex, attending Brentwood and Felsted Schools, before working in business in India. A plaque celebrating his life was unveiled at Shenfield Parish Church in September 1917.\nHis brother, William, died in Banbury, Oxfordshire, aged 92 in 1978. \nTexans Mr and Mrs Hanks, who own another hotel in Dripping Springs, about 25 miles (40km) west of the state capitol Austin, said they plan to spend between a third and half of their time in Wiltshire running the Old Bell. \nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "A local branch of the Islamic State group in Afghanistan has vowed to continue attacks now that Taliban militants are in control.\nSo who are these IS militants?\nIS-K - Islamic State Khorasan Province - is the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group.\nIt is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan.\nIS-K was set up in January 2015 at the height of IS's power in Iraq and Syria, before its self-declared caliphate was defeated and dismantled by a US-led coalition. \nIt recruits both Afghan and Pakistani jihadists, especially defecting members of the Afghan Taliban who don't see their own organisation as extreme enough.\n\"Khorasan\" refers to a historical region covering parts of modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group initially included Pakistan until a separate Pakistan section was declared in May 2019.\nAt its height the group numbered about 3,000 fighters.\nHowever, it has suffered significant casualties in clashes with both the US and Afghan security forces, and also with the Taliban.\nIS-K has targeted Afghan security forces, Afghan politicians and ministries, the Taliban, religious minorities, including Shia Muslims and Sikhs, US and Nato forces, and international agencies, including aid organisations.\nIS-K have been blamed for some of the worst atrocities in recent years, targeting girls' schools, hospitals and even a maternity ward, where they reportedly shot dead pregnant women and nurses. \nUnlike the Taliban, whose interest is confined to Afghanistan, IS-K are part of the global IS network that seeks to carry out attacks on Western, international and humanitarian targets wherever they can reach them.\nIS-K are based in the eastern province of Nangarhar, close to drug and people-smuggling routes in and out of Pakistan. \nWhile most of its activities have been in Nangahar and Kabul, it has also claimed attacks in the provinces of Kunar, Jowzjan, Paktia, Kunduz and Herat.\nPeripherally yes, via a third party, the Haqqani network. \nAccording to researchers, there are strong links between IS-K and the Haqqani network, which in turn is closely linked to the Taliban.\nThe man now in charge of security in Kabul is Khalil Haqqani who has had a $5m (\u00a33.6m) bounty on his head. \nDr Sajjan Gohel from the Asia Pacific Foundation has been monitoring the militant networks in Afghanistan for years. \nHe says \"several major attacks between 2019 and 2021 involved collaboration between IS-K, the Taliban's Haqqani network and other terror groups based in Pakistan\".\nWhen the Taliban took over in Kabul on 15 August, the group released large numbers of prisoners from Pul-e-Charki jail, reportedly including IS and al-Qaeda militants. These people are now at large.\nBut IS-K have major differences with the Taliban, accusing them of abandoning Jihad and the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement hammered out in \"posh hotels\" in Doha, Qatar.\nIS-K considers Taliban militants \"apostates\", making their killing lawful under their interpretation of Islamic law.\nIS militants now represent a major security challenge for the incoming Taliban government, something the Taliban leadership shares in common with Western intelligence agencies."

      "text": "The final flights bringing British troops home from Afghanistan are arriving, as the UK's 20-year military campaign ends.\nThe last British flight has left Kabul, and the ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Laurie Bristow, arrived at RAF Brize Norton on Sunday morning.\nFurther flights are expected to arrive at the RAF base in Oxfordshire later.\nMore than 15,000 people, including about 2,200 children, have been evacuated by the UK since 14 August.\nAbout 800 to 1,100 eligible Afghans, including those who worked for the UK government, and 100 to 150 British nationals were feared to be unable to make evacuation flights. \nMore than 1,000 UK service personnel were in Kabul at the height of the airlift operation. The final dedicated civilian evacuation flight left Kabul on Saturday.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday that if the Taliban regime wanted diplomatic recognition and aid funding, they would have to ensure \"safe passage\" for those who wanted to leave.\nIn a joint statement with the US and more than 90 other countries, it was confirmed that the Taliban had said anyone who wished to leave the country could do so.\nThe statement said: \"We have received assurances from the Taliban that all foreign nationals and any Afghan citizen with travel authorisation from our countries will be allowed to proceed in a safe and orderly manner to points of departure and travel outside the country.\"\nBy Simon Jones, BBC reporter\nAt RAF Brize Norton, they're preparing for the arrival of more British troops from Afghanistan.  \nThe vast majority of military personnel have now left the region. Dogs and equipment have been brought back too.  \nThere's a sense of pride at the air base at how the evacuation operation has gone over the past two weeks - in hugely challenging circumstances.  \nBut there's also frustration that some people who wanted to get out of the country have been left behind.  \nSome of the troops, who will now face a period in quarantine, will need support too - due to the harrowing scenes they witnessed at Kabul airport.  \nAnd although we are seeing the last major flights to the UK carrying troops from Kabul, more personnel will be brought back in smaller groups in the coming days, meaning the operation still has some time to run. \nVice Adm Key, chief of joint operations, said that while he \"pays testament\" to everything achieved by British forces over the last two weeks, \"we know that there are some really sad stories of people who have desperately tried to leave that - no matter how hard our efforts - we have been unsuccessful in evacuating\".\nSpeaking at RAF Brize Norton, Vice Adm Key said the 31 August deadline imposed by the Taliban prevented them evacuating more people \"who had helped us so wonderfully and courageously over the last 20 years\".\nAmbassador Sir Laurie, who had been processing those fleeing the country at the airport, pledged to continue efforts to support Afghanistan from a new embassy location in Qatar.\nNo 10 said the youngest child evacuated was just one day old.\nAbout 5,000 British nationals and their families were airlifted, alongside more than 8,000 Afghan former UK staff and their families and those considered at risk from the Taliban.\nThis number is in addition to the number of Afghans set to be resettled in the UK through a separate multi-year programme - with all arrivals coming under a new effort called Operation Warm Welcome.\nIn a video posted on Twitter on Sunday, Mr Johnson praised the \"colossal exertions\" of those involved in the evacuation operation who worked \"to a remorseless deadline, in harrowing conditions\".\nHe said that although the UK \"would not have wished to leave in this way\", the suffering and hardship of all the troops involved over 20 years was \"not in vain\"."

      "text": "Tens of thousands of people are fleeing the US state of Louisiana as Hurricane Ida closes in from the Gulf of Mexico.\nIda is now a category four hurricane, one below the highest level, with up to 150mph (240km/h) sustained winds.\nIt is expected to make landfall on Sunday, bringing a \"life-threatening\" storm surge. Ida is likely to be stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated much of New Orleans in 2005.\nTraffic jams clogged motorways as residents heeded orders to evacuate.\nThe National Hurricane Center said \"potentially catastrophic wind damage and flooding rainfall will impact portions of the northern Gulf coast beginning later this morning\" (Sunday).\nThe current 150mph maximum sustained wind speed is only 7mph short of a category five hurricane. No category five has ever hit Louisiana.\nGovernor John Bel Edwards warned residents on Saturday: \"Your window of time is closing. By the time you go to bed tonight you need to be where you intend to ride the storm out and you need to be as prepared as you can be, because weather will start to deteriorate very quickly tomorrow.\"\nThe governor of neighbouring Mississippi has declared a state of emergency.\nPresident Joe Biden said Ida was \"turning into a very, very dangerous storm\" and the federal government was ready to provide help.\nPosition of Ida at 01:00 local time (06:00 GMT) on Sunday. Source: National Hurricane Center\nThe NHC said that, at 12:00 GMT on Sunday, Ida was about 50 miles south-west of the mouth of the Mississippi river and was moving north-west at about 15mph. While still over water, it has the capacity to strengthen even further.\nIda earlier battered part of Cuba, bringing down trees and tearing off roofs, while Jamaica suffered heavy rains. No-one was reported killed.\nSunday marks the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans after making landfall as a category three. Katrina flooded 80% of the city and killed more than 1,800 people.\nWith stronger storm defences now in place, there's hope that levees in New Orleans will be able to withstand the impact of the hurricane.\nBut experts warn that if storm surges hit at a time that coincides with high tides, sea water could flood the New Orleans levee system and enter the city again.\n\"Please understand this, there is the possibility that conditions could be unliveable along the coast for some time and areas around New Orleans and Baton Rouge could be without power for weeks,\" the National Weather Service wrote on Saturday.\n\"We have all seen the destruction and pain caused by [Hurricanes] Harvey, Michael and Laura. Anticipate devastation on this level and if it doesn't happen then we should all count our blessings.\"\nAlessandra Jerolleman, a senior fellow in emergency management at New Orleans' Tulane University, told the BBC as she fled in her car: \"I am absolutely devastated thinking about those communities under mandatory evacuation orders.\n\"They can expect to see catastrophic and substantial damage... streets can be expected to flood, vehicles can be expected to be lost.\"\nMore than 80 oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico have been evacuated and half the region's oil and gas output has been suspended.\nThe impact of climate change on the frequency\u00a0of\u00a0storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes,\u00a0cyclones and typhoons.\nAs a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.\u00a0\nHow has hurricane Ida affected you?

      "text": "The British ambassador to Afghanistan has arrived in the UK, with the last British soldiers to leave Kabul expected to touch down within hours.\nThe final flight left on Saturday, bringing to an end the UK's 20-year military involvement in Afghanistan.\nMore than 15,000 people have been evacuated by the UK since 14 August.\nVice Adm Sir Ben Key, who ran the UK's evacuation, said he would be \"very nervous\" in saying the withdrawal was a success until all the allies had left.\nHe said it had been a \"tremendous international effort\" but it wasn't \"a moment of celebration for us at all\", adding that there was a \"sense of sadness\" at those left behind.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK's departure was \"the culmination of a mission unlike anything we've seen in our lifetimes\".\nAmbassador Sir Laurie Bristow, who had been processing those fleeing the country at the airport, was among those who landed at RAF Brize Norton base in Oxfordshire on Sunday morning.\nThe flight came via the United Arab Emirates and further flights carrying military and civilian personnel are expected later. \nVice Adm Key, chief of joint operations, said that while he \"pays testament\" to everything achieved by British forces over the last two weeks, \"we know that there are some really sad stories of people who have desperately tried to leave that - no matter how hard our efforts - we have been unsuccessful in evacuating\".\nSpeaking at RAF Brize Norton, he said the 31 August deadline imposed by the Taliban prevented them evacuating more people \"who had helped us so wonderfully and courageously over the last 20 years\".\nPhotos of exhausted UK service personnel in aircraft coming back from Kabul showed how \"deeply tired\" they were having \"given their all over the last two weeks\", he said.\n\"Some of the pictures that have come back in the last few days have painted a really good impression of just how desperate and difficult those conditions have been in the last few weeks.\n\"They have been sleeping in rough conditions, eating off ration packs and their sole motivation has been to help as many of the Afghans and British entitled personnel as they possibly could.\"\nHe had the most \"enormous admiration\" for what British troops had done, he added.\nBy James Reynolds, BBC News\nThe stark image of Britain's ambassador to Afghanistan walking down the steps onto the tarmac at Brize Norton was clear confirmation that Britain's mission in Kabul is now over. \nAt the bottom of the steps, Sir Laurie Bristow was greeted by a single Foreign Office colleague - the permanent under secretary Sir Philip Barton. \nThere was no ceremony, no speeches. The diplomats and their colleagues walked off into the terminal building.\nA few minutes later members of the 16 Air Assault Brigade - who had been at Kabul airport - walked quietly off the same plane. \nThe mission may be over - but it's not complete. \nA senior naval officer told me of his great sadness that local Afghan allies have been left behind. Their safety is now in the hands of the Taliban.\nNo 10 said the number of people evacuated included about 2,200 children, with the youngest just one day old.\nAbout 5,000 British nationals and their families were airlifted, alongside more than 8,000 Afghan former UK staff and their families and those considered at risk from the Taliban.\nIn a video posted on Twitter on Sunday, Mr Johnson praised the \"colossal exertions\" of those involved in the evacuation operation who worked \"to a remorseless deadline, in harrowing conditions\".\nHe said that although the UK \"would not have wished to leave in this way\", the suffering and hardship of all the troops involved over 20 years was \"not in vain\".\nSir Laurie said \"for the time being\" the UK embassy to Afghanistan would operate from Qatar but it would reopen as soon as possible and \"we will continue to stand by the people of Afghanistan\".\nIn a video posted on Twitter, the ambassador said the UK government would continue putting pressure on the Taliban \"to allow safe passage\" to the UK for those Afghans and British nationals \"who still need our support\".\nLord Dannatt, who was head of armed forces between 2006 and 2009, told BBC Breakfast: \"It's a big moment because it's the end of a military chapter - a chapter that's ended not in the way we would have wished.\"\nHe said the soldiers involved in the evacuation process at Kabul airport had done \"a fantastic job in very difficult circumstances\" but he said it was a \"tragedy\" that some people eligible to come to the UK had been left behind. \nHe said there should be an inquiry into the UK's 20-year engagement in Afghanistan to look at the \"string of strategic errors\", including the manner of the evacuation, which he said could have started several months ago and been done \"in a more calm and considered way\".\nThe US is continuing evacuations ahead of the 31 August deadline for foreign troops to leave the country.\nA suicide bombing near the airport on Thursday resulted in some 170 deaths, including two UK citizens and the child of a British national. US President Joe Biden has warned another attack is highly likely. \nA new plan to resettle people fleeing Afghanistan, called Operation Warm Welcome, has been announced by the government.\nIt will be modelled on a similar scheme put in place for Syrian refugees - 20,000 of which came to the UK between 2014 and 2020.\nSupport will include help with integration and dealing with trauma, free English language courses, and assistance with health, education, accommodation and employment.\nThe UK government has two schemes to resettle Afghans - the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) for those who worked for the UK government; and the Afghan Citizens' Resettlement Scheme, which focuses on women and children, as well as religious and other minorities."

We will do our utmost to help them\". \nThe final British flight left Afghanistan on Saturday, bringing to an end the UK's 20-year military involvement in the country.\nMore than 15,000 people have been evacuated by the UK since 14 August.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Sunday morning. We'll have another update for you tomorrow. \nBritish tennis star Andy Murray says that players have a responsibility to the public as they travel around the world and should therefore be vaccinated against Covid. Many have voiced reluctance at getting a jab and tournaments have not yet made it a condition of entry. But with spectators at the US Open having to show proof of having at least one dose, the two-time Wimbledon champion hopes more players will also choose to get the vaccine.\nDentists are warning that people could lose teeth unless Covid rules in Wales are eased. Routine appointments were postponed in March 2020 with dentists only seeing patients face-to-face for urgent care. While some routine treatments have now resumed, the British Dental Association warns that strict hygiene measures are limiting the number of non-urgent patients that can be seen. \nRetailers have blamed rising shipping and raw material costs for big price increases for outdoor furniture over the past two years. Consumer group Which? found some items were almost twice as expensive as they were before the pandemic. Sheds saw a particularly steep rise in prices, with homeware retailers pointing to a timber shortage as well as supply chain issues.\nLive music is back. During the pandemic many of us will have missed the chance to sing our hearts out or jump around in a united euphoria. But for the most committed fans it's the return of an entire way of life. Among them is Anna Doble who has shared some of her own gig experiences as well as stories from fellow super-fans on how they have found ways to endure 18 months without getting in a mosh pit. \nA rise in puppy-purchasing during the pandemic has led to increasing demand for providers of doggy day care, as owners return to work or seek ways for their pets to make new pals. As well as allowing owners the time to return to work, such services also help pets to socialise and get used to other animals. Camilla Smith, who owns the Paddocks Daycare in south Leicestershire, says since the pandemic she has been overwhelmed with demand.

      "title": "Government plans to lift football standing ban",
      "text": "Plans to lift the ban on standing in the English Premier League and Championship are set to be announced by the government, the BBC has learned.\nIt is thought a handful of grounds will be able to use designated safe standing areas before the end of the season.\nIt would mean for the first time in over 25 years, fans of some top flight football clubs would be legally allowed to stand and watch their team play.\nAn official announcement is expected as soon as next month.\nThe chairman of the Football Supporters Association, Malcolm Clarke, said it was a \"welcome\" development that would benefit all fans.\nHe added: \"People who want to stand should be able to do so in safety. Those who want to sit should be able to do so without having their view blocked.\"\nSince 1994, first and second tier grounds in England and Wales have been required to be all-seaters by law.\nHowever, thousands of supporters continue to stand throughout matches.\nIn their 2019 general election manifesto, the Conservatives promised to work towards the introduction of safe standing areas, which have been embraced in the German Bundesliga, as well as in Scotland - where around 3,000 Celtic fans have been allowed to make use of a safe standing section since 2016.  \nNow, the BBC understands ministers will instructs the regulator, the Sports Ground Safety Authority (SGSA), to choose \"early adopters\" for the trials.\nAnd while they are keen to proceed with caution, if the initial trials prove successful, the expectation is legislation would be widened out to cover all stadiums in England's top two divisions within the next few years.\nA spokesperson for the Sports Ground Safety Authority said: \"We are working closely with the government on planning the next steps for implementing this manifesto commitment.\"\nBoth Labour and the Liberal Democrats also went into the last election with a pledge to update the legislation that was introduced in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, which led to the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans.\nAs a result, the relatives of the Hillsborough victims have had long-term concerns about standing in football grounds.\nBut Margaret Aspinall, whose son died as a result of Hillsborough, now accepts the arguments for a change in legislation.\nShe said: \"People's opinions have changed. You've got to move forward with the times.\"\nIn anticipation of the change in legislation, Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea have all installed rail seating over the summer.\nThe clubs had all been identified by the SGSA as having a problem with persistent standing.\nThe new seats are incorporated into a waist high rail for the supporters behind to lean on.\nThis means supporters who prefer to stay on their feet occupy the same amount of space as those that would rather sit, avoiding any danger of overcrowding.\nLiverpool invited Ms Aspinall and other Hillsborough relatives to see the new rail seats in the Kop end of the Anfield football ground earlier this month and the families are now largely on board with the initiative.\nBut there are concerns the plans don't go far enough.\nLabour MP Alex Norris, who is the vice-chair of the All Parliamentary Group for Football Supporters, backs safe standing but believes it should not be confined to the home team's seating areas.\nHe added: \"I've never sat down at an away ground. This alone won't solve the problem.\" \nIt is understood that Premier League and Championship clubs will be invited to register an interest to be part of the trial in the coming months.\nBut clubs that have already installed rail seating aren't guaranteed to be selected. \nThose that are successful will be granted updated licences that would only allow standing in specially designated areas - which would not require a major legislative change. \nSurveys show that safe standing is overwhelmingly popular among football fans.\nThe FSA's Mr Clarke said: \"The safety and customer care arguments have been won. We would urge the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to proceed as soon as possible.\" \nIn an interview in the Times, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: \"It's the sensible thing to do because fans are standing all the way through [games] anyway and you can do it in a safer way. \n\"We've got terrible experience in the past and more recent experience with things like the Euros, which just means we need to make sure we get this right. \n\"We're engaging with the police and others, but we'll get to the stage this season where we'll see safe-standing, at least in pilot form.\""

      "text": "Workers in England and Wales are being fobbed off with a \"stingy\" number of bank holidays, say trades unions.\nThey get eight public holidays a year, which is four fewer than the EU average and half the number in Japan.\nThe umbrella body for unions, the TUC, is calling for a new public holiday between September and Christmas.\nIt would be \"a great way to thank working Britain for getting us through these tough times,\" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said.\n\"The August Bank Holiday will be a welcome break for everyone working hard to get us through the pandemic - especially those on the front line,\" said Ms O'Grady.\n\"But after August, there's no national holiday until Christmas. And that's because the number of holidays we get is so stingy compared to other nations.\"\nEven in Scotland, with nine bank holidays, and Northern Ireland which has 10 public holidays, the situation is only slightly better.\nA spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said: \"The current pattern of public and bank holidays is well established and whilst an additional bank holiday may benefit some communities and sectors, the cost to the economy of an additional bank holiday is considerable.\"\nAccording to the TUC every EU-member is more generous than the UK when it comes to public holidays.\nSeveral countries including Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Finland give 15 days off. The EU average is 12.8 days a year, the TUC said.\nJapan's workers enjoy 17 days off a year but New Zealanders only get 11.  \nHowever, in many countries if a bank holiday falls at the weekend, workers are not entitled to an additional day off. So in practice workers don't always enjoy as many holidays as the officially listed days suggest.\nThe TUC says all UK workers should get at least 12 public holidays and is calling for a wider debate on the issue.\n\"It's time for a national conversation - when should our new holidays be? What might they celebrate?\" added Ms O'Grady. \n\"An autumn holiday to break the long stretch to Christmas would be a good start.\" \nThose who have to work on bank holidays are entitled to be paid a premium or receive time off in lieu, the TUC said.\nBank holidays are created under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, or are created by royal proclamation - that is, by the Queen, who acts on government advice. \nThe department responsible for bank holidays is the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\nBank holidays are not actually statutory holidays, although most workers do get the day off.\nNine things you might not know about bank holidays"

      "text": "At least 30 pro-government fighters have been killed in an attack on an airbase in southern Yemen, security and medical sources say.\nA spokesman for Yemeni southern forces said al-Anad airbase was targeted with armed drones and missiles.\nHe blamed the Iran-aligned rebel Houthi movement, which is fighting a war against the Saudi-backed government.\nThe Houthis have not yet commented on the reports, but they have attacked the same airbase in the past.\nYemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in 2015, when the Houthis seized control of large parts of the country and a Saudi-led coalition launched an operation to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's rule.\nThe fighting has reportedly left more than 130,000 people dead and triggered what the UN says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 12 million people reliant on food aid and half of children under five facing malnutrition.\nA soldier who witnessed what happened at al-Anad on Sunday said he and his comrades were gathered inside a hangar after breakfast when they saw a drone hovering overhead.\n\"We tried to fire at it and bring it down, but we couldn't hit it,\" he told AFP news agency. \"The craft flew over and headed directly towards the hangar, where it fired two missiles.\"\nAnother soldier who was wounded in the attack, Nasser Saeed, told the Associated Press that 50 troops were inside the hangar when it was hit by missiles and bomb-laden drones, and that they shot one of them down. \nSouthern forces spokesman Mohammed al-Naqeeb said at least 30 soldiers were killed and 60 others were wounded, many of them critically.\nHe warned that the death toll might rise as rescue teams were still searching through the site. \nPresident Hadi expressed condolences to the families of those killed and promised that the Houthis would \"pay heavily for all the crimes they have committed against the people of Yemen\".\nIn January 2019, six soldiers were killed in a Houthi drone strike on al-Anad, which occurred while high-ranking officers were watching a parade.

A DNA test later confirmed that it was the animal that had attacked the child.\nAttacks by mountain lions are very rare in North America. \nOfficials said the animal involved was young. Experts believe that it was still learning how to hunt and fend for itself, according to CBS News."

      "tags": "Jamaica,Music",
      "text": "Tributes have been paid to the legendary Jamaican singer and music producer Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, who has died at the age of 85.\nHe died in hospital in Lucea, north-west Jamaica, local media reported.\nPerry is known for his pioneering experiments in dub, which revolutionised not only reggae, but also hip hop, dance and other genres.\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called him \"unforgettable\" and praised his \"sterling contribution\" to music.\nThe Beastie Boys, who first worked with Perry when he opened for them in Japan in 1996 before they joined forces on the track Dr Lee PhD as party of 1998's Hello Nasty album, hailed the musician's \"pioneering spirit\".\n\"We are truly grateful to have been inspired by and collaborated with this true legend,\" the group said in a tweet.\nFlying Lotus, whose real name is Steven Ellison, wrote on Twitter: \"Blessed journey into the infinite. RIP Lee 'Scratch' Perry.\"\nRapper Lupe Fiasco also remembered Perry, tweeting: \"African blood is flowing through I veins so I and I shall never fade away.\"  \nGlastonbury Festival's Emily Eavis hailed the singer as a \"musical genius\".\nEavis tweeted: \"RIP the almighty Lee 'Scratch' Perry, musical genius, free spirit and a regular Glastonbury performer. We shall miss him.\"\nPerry was born in rural Jamaica in 1936 and moved to the capital Kingston in the early 1960s. \nIn a 1984 interview with NME magazine, he said: \"My father worked on the road, my mother in the fields. We were very poor. I went to school\u2026 I learned nothing at all. Everything I have learned has come from nature.\"\nHe started his music career in the 1950s as an assistant at a reggae music label, before moving up to become a recording artist with the same label.\nOver the next seven decades Perry went on to work with a number of fellow music legends, including Bob Marley and the Beastie Boys.\nHe also won a Grammy in 2002, was nominated four other times - in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2014 - and received a Jamaican national honour, the Order of Distinction.\nIn a 2010 interview with Rolling Stone, Keith Richards described Perry as \"the Salvador Dali of music\".\n\"He's a mystery. The world is his instrument. You just have to listen,\" Richards said. \"More than a producer, he knows how to inspire the artist's soul.\"\nElectronic group The Prodigy shared a photo of Perry on Twitter showing him at a mixing desk.\n\"RIP to the King\", wrote British rapper Ghostpoet.\nAmerican indie rock group the The Mountain Goats said there were \"few more important figures in the music of the 20th Century\" than Perry. \nIf Bob Marley was the face and voice of reggae, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry was its soul.\nHe was a towering figure despite his diminutive stature and eccentric appearance, but his influence was much deeper than most reggae fans realise. Much like Nile Rodgers, he was the producer and brains behind many songs more famously sung by other people. \nAnd it was his spirit that converted Marley's band - The Wailers - from a rocksteady and ska trio to a much more bass-fuelled, political and spiritual group, a process later accelerated by Chris Blackwell. \nShamanistic and reliably stoned, \"Scratch\" nevertheless had a remarkable work ethic. He fell out with many of his collaborators, including the great Studio One boss Coxsone Dodd, and indeed The Wailers, though he and Marley would later reconcile. \nBut by coming to the height of his powers in late 1960s and 1970s Jamaica, he was a charismatic engineer and catalyst for the group of artists who produced much of the best music of the 20th Century.

      "text": "People could lose teeth unless Covid rules in Wales are eased to allow more to get check-ups, leading dentists have warned.\nThe British Dental Association said it wants rules for dentists relaxed now most of Wales' Covid rules have eased.\nRussell Gidney, chair of the BDA's Welsh General Dental Practice Committee said delays could mean tooth decay, gum disease and cancer may go unspotted.\nThe Welsh government said it had given \u00a3450,000 to help practices in lockdown. \nRoutine appointments were postponed when Wales was placed into coronavirus lockdown in March 2020 and dentists only saw patients face-to-face for urgent care.\nPractitioners did undertake video or phone consultations - of which there have been about 350,000 in Wales in the past 18 months - for patients with less urgent problems.\nAfter the pandemic hit, the number of treatment sessions claimed on the Welsh NHS fell by 97%, from 1.1m in January to March 2020, to 22,713 in April to June 2020, as missed appointments in England topped 19 million.\nWhile more routine treatments have since resumed in Wales under a phased return of services, strict hygiene measures remain in place due to Covid, including allowing downtime between patients.\nUnder guidance, this time has to be used if dentists need to use air, such as for fillings or cleaning, to allow the room to ventilate and then be deep cleaned before the next patient.\nMr Gidney, principal dentist at a practice in Monmouthshire which has 7,000 patients, said the \"dead time\" was limiting how many non-urgent patients they could see and creating a \"bottleneck\" in the system.\nHe said, while surgeries were prioritising so-called \"red patients\" - those with underlying issues like gum disease - and emergencies, the wait was making it difficult for dentists to see anyone else.\nMr Gidney said it meant minor issues, like a small hole in the tooth, which may not be obvious to a patient, could end up needing a major procedure if people were not able to book routine check-ups.\n\"By the time it causes problems, we are often talking towards root fillings or teeth coming out, and then you've got things like gum disease or cancer, where there can be no symptoms,\" he said.\n\"The only time you really get symptoms with gum disease is when the teeth have already come loose and by that stage it's too late.\n\"It might mean people end up losing teeth that we could have saved.\"\nThe Chepstow-based dentist fears children and adults could face problems after lifestyle changes in lockdown and said measures should be eased now so many have been vaccinated. \n\"It's kind of causing us sleepless nights at the moment, because we don't know how long it's going to take to be able to get there,\" added Mr Gidney, who is also a clinical supervisor at the dental teaching hospital in Cardiff.\nRebecca Cotterell tried to get an appointment when she started getting tooth ache in mid-2020, but said she was told she could not be seen as her practice was only seeing urgent cases.\nShe was eventually seen in May this year, and had a temporary filling put in, but said she was then told she could not be seen again for a permanent solution until September.\n\"It got to the point that over the counter painkillers just weren't working,\" said Ms Cotterell, from Cardiff.\n\"As a parent of a young child who's very energetic, it was quite upsetting to not be able to take them out and do activities with them as I was in just too much pain.\"\nShe said the pain got worse and she had to have an emergency appointment in the end to remove her tooth in August.\nMs Cotterell added while she felt lucky to be an NHS patient when so many people were struggling to find a dentist, not being able to get a face-to-face appointment for months was \"not ideal when in pain\".\nThe Welsh government said it had provided \u00a3450,000 to health boards to provide ventilation for practices to help reduce the time between patients.\nIt added routine dental appointments had not stopped during the pandemic, but like all NHS services people were being seen \"according to need\".\n\"Since the beginning of the pandemic, dentists have seen more than 1.5m people and provided 350,000 consultations remotely, via phone or video services,\" a spokesman said.\n\"Dentistry has been one of the most challenging services for us to deliver during the pandemic because of aerosol generating procedures such as fillings, and the need for dentists to be in such close proximity to the patient which requires enhanced PPE.\" "

      "tags": "Kabul,Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "Another attack on Kabul airport is highly likely, US President Joe Biden has warned, saying commanders have told him it could come as early as Sunday.\nThe state department has urged all US citizens to leave the area near the airport because of a \"specific, credible threat\".   \nThe US is continuing evacuations but the final UK troops, diplomats and officials have now left Kabul.  \nA suicide bombing near the airport on Thursday resulted in some 170 deaths.\nA local branch of the Islamic State group - Islamic State in Khorasan Province (IS-K) - claimed the attack.\nIn retaliation, the US carried out a drone strike on eastern Afghanistan late on Friday, saying it had killed two \"high-profile\" IS-K members.\nThe two are described as a planner and a facilitator. It is unclear whether they were directly involved in planning the Kabul airport attack. \n\"This strike was not the last. We will continue to hunt down any person involved in that heinous attack and make them pay,\" Mr Biden said in a statement released on Saturday.\nIS-K is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan and has major differences with the Taliban, who now control most of the country. It accuses them of abandoning the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement with the Americans. \nThe Taliban condemned the air strike, saying the Americans should have consulted them first, a spokesman told Reuters news agency. \nThe next few days of the US evacuation operation are likely to be the most dangerous since it began, White House officials say.\nUS troops have begun their withdrawal from the airport - their numbers are now down to 4,000, from a peak of 5,800 in the past week. \nOne Western security official told Reuters that US forces were in the final phase, although a time for the end of the operation had yet to be decided.\nJust over 1,000 civilians remain to be airlifted, the official said.\nA Taliban official told Reuters their technical experts and engineers were ready to take over the airport when they were given the \"final nod from the Americans\".\nThe Taliban have set up further layers of checkpoints around the airport and are not allowing most Afghans through, the Associated Press adds.\nIn all, more than 110,000 people - both Afghans and foreign nationals - have been evacuated from Kabul airport since the airlift began two weeks ago. \nOn Saturday, Italy's final flight from Afghanistan arrived in Rome. Italy said it had evacuated almost 5,000 Afghan citizens from Kabul - the highest number of any EU country. \nFrance said it had flown out more than 2,800 since 17 August, while Germany said it had taken about 4,000 Afghans. \nThe head of the UK's armed forces, General Sir Nick Carter, said it was \"heartbreaking\" that they had not been able to rescue everyone. \nFrance and Britain will urge the UN to create a \"safe zone\" in Kabul to help evacuation efforts, French President Emmanuel Macron said.\nHe said it would allow the international community to carry out humanitarian work and \"maintain pressure on the Taliban\".\nSince the Taliban took Kabul on 15 August, the Afghan economy has been in freefall as aid donors freeze funds and panicked depositors seek to withdraw their money from banks. \nOn Saturday crowds of protesters gathered outside banks in the Afghan capital. \n\"If the situation continues and employees of the government don't get their salaries and a businessman cannot get his money from the bank for trading, the result of this is very horrible, and there will be poverty in the society as well, and no-one can solve that issue,\" one man told Reuters.\nAre you in Afghanistan?

      "text": "Survivors have spoken of their horror after twin blasts hit crowds of people awaiting evacuation outside Kabul's airport on Thursday. Most witnesses have not been named for their own safety.\nOne Afghan, who previously worked with an international development group and who holds a US visa, was among the thousands of people who had been waiting outside Kabul's airport for hours when the explosion struck.\n\"It was as if someone pulled the ground from under my feet. For a moment I thought my eardrums were blasted and I lost my sense of hearing,\" he told Reuters news agency.\n\"I saw bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado taking plastic bags... into the air.

The little water flowing into it had turned into blood,\" he recalled.\n\"Physically, I am OK... but I don't think the mental wound and the shock I sustained from today's blast will ever let me live a normal life.\"\nOther witnesses spoke of the chaos at the scene after the initial blast.\n\"When people heard the explosion, there was total panic,\" a man named Milad, who had been waiting outside the airport with his wife and three children, told the AFP news agency. \n\"The Taliban then started firing in the air to disperse the crowd. I saw a man rushing with an injured baby in his hands.\"\n\"I will never, ever want to go (to the airport) again.

      "tags": "Department of Health & Social Care,Healthcare,NHS Wales,NHS England,NHS",
      "text": "GPs are having to make difficult choices about which patients get blood tests because of the ongoing shortage of test tubes, doctors are warning.\nThe vials used for blood tests are currently in short supply - and the NHS in England and Wales is temporarily stopping all non-urgent testing.\nDoctors say they are in a \"perilous\" situation and want more clarity about how long the shortage will last.\nThe government says it is working flat out with the supplier.\nThere are currently global shortages of blood tube products and company Becton Dickinson - which makes vials for the health service - is among those facing serious supply chain issues. \nBecton Dickinson said it had seen record demand for its blood collection tubes in recent months, partly driven by the need for tests for Covid patients. It also said it was facing issues transporting the tubes, for example, challenges at the UK border.\nBecause of the shortage, the NHS in England and Wales has told surgeries and hospitals to temporarily stop some blood testing - with patients told they will only be able to get tests if they are urgent. \nThe tests put on hold include those for fertility, allergies and pre-diabetes - and the shortage will likely worsen over the next few weeks and last until mid-September, NHS England said.\nGeraldine Gray, 65, from Nottingham, told the BBC the problems had been going on for several weeks. She had a blood test booked two weeks ago to diagnose a potential blood disorder, but it was cancelled. \n\"The day before I was due to have it, a receptionist rang up and said they were having to cancel certain blood tests... and the doctors had been through the lists looking at the ones that they thought were non-urgent.\"\n\"It's annoying,\" she said, of not being able to have the diagnostic test. \"It's not a cancer blood test, it's not diabetes. But it's something it would be good to know I haven't got.\"\nAnother woman, Alison Webb, told the BBC earlier this week that she cannot have her yearly thyroid and cholesterol checked due to the shortages - and her tests are already overdue by four months.\n\"Now I've been told to ring again in a month's time. Terrible,\" she said.\nBut doctors have said the guidance issued to them is vague, and it is not always easy to decide what tests are essential. \n\"No doctor knowingly undertakes unnecessary blood tests and to now have to ration all those we are doing, as well as cancel hundreds more, goes against everything we stand for as clinicians,\" said Dr David Wrigley from the British Medical Association, which represents doctors.\n\"However, if we don't try to follow the NHS guidance, it's clear we will get to the point where even the most clinically urgent of blood tests may not be able to be done as we simply won't have the tubes for the blood to go into.\"\nHe said doctors and their patients had been put in a \"terrible, unenviable position\" and he thought it was \" surprising that NHS England hasn't declared a critical incident\".\nAnother GP, Dr Farah Jameel, from north London, said: \"There will be some patients who absolutely must have blood tests, and I have got to make that decision and seek understanding from patients who perhaps could wait a bit longer.\"\nBecton Dickinson said the supply disruption was also affecting other companies. It said it took its responsibility to provide consistent supply \"very seriously\" and that it was taking steps to boost supply and divert products from other regions to help the UK.\nOn Thursday, the NHS warned supply was \"forecasted to become even more constrained over the coming weeks\".\n\"While it is anticipated that the position will improve from the middle of September, overall supply is likely to remain challenging for a significant period,\" it said in a letter to doctors. Alternative products are being sought, it said. \nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said patient safety was a \"top priority\" and it was working closely with the NHS and devolved administrations to minimise any impact on patient care.\n\"The health and care system continues to work flat out with the supplier and stakeholders to put mitigations in place, and restore normal supply, and there continues to be stock in place.\""

      "text": "A US drone strike in the Afghan capital Kabul has prevented another deadly suicide attack at the airport, US military officials say.\nThe strike targeted a vehicle carrying at least one person associated with the Afghan branch of the Islamic State group, US Central Command said.\nThe US had warned of possible further attacks as evacuations wind down.\nDespite this, it has said that it will keep evacuating Afghans from Kabul airport until \"the last moment\".\nA deadline for the evacuation mission of 31 August was agreed between the US and the Taliban, who now control most of the country. \nThe US will be the last to complete its mission, with all other countries having already concluded theirs.\nThe final flights returning British troops from Afghanistan have been arriving in the UK on Sunday. \nThe US says it has facilitated the evacuation of more than 110,000 people from Kabul airport since 14 August - a day before the Taliban took control of the capital. \nThe BBC's Lyse Doucet, in Kabul, says she and her colleagues are still receiving urgent SOS messages from Afghans who feel threatened by the Taliban. They include musicians, university students and female politicians. \nMany of them feel they cannot have the kind of future they had prepared for after two decades of international engagement, our correspondent says - and many say the Taliban are stopping them from leaving. \nOn Sunday, Capt Bill Urban of Central Command said the US had carried out a targeted drone strike aimed at \"eliminating an imminent\" threat to Kabul airport. \n\"We are confident we successfully hit the target,\" he said, adding: \"Secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material.\"\nHe said later that Central Command were aware of reports of civilian casualties following the drone strike. \"It is unclear what may have happened, and we are investigating further,\" he said, adding that Central Command would be \"deeply saddened by any potential loss of innocent life\".\nHis comments came after multiple reports of a loud explosion heard near Kabul airport. Some images posted on social media showed black clouds of smoke rising into the air above buildings.\nUS intelligence officials earlier said they had received \"specific, credible\" threats against the airport, and that the military would continue to carry out targeted strikes where necessary.\nThe US advised people to stay away from the area, despite time running out for anyone still trying to access evacuation flights.\nSeparately on Sunday, Kabul police said a child had been killed in a rocket strike on a house near the airport. Details about the strike are unclear.\nA bomb attack at the airport last Thursday killed as many as 170 people, including 13 US troops.\nA regional affiliate of the Islamic State group, IS-K, said it was behind Thursday's bombing.\nIn retaliation, the US carried out a drone strike on eastern Afghanistan late on Friday, saying it had killed two \"high-profile\" IS-K members.\nUS President Joe Biden on Sunday met the families of the 13 American personnel killed in Thursday's Kabul airport attack. \nMr Biden took part in a ceremony to honour the victims at Dover Air Force base in Delaware.\nIn addition to the US personnel killed in the IS-K bomb attack, dozens of Afghans who were queuing at the airport in the hope of leaving the country also died. Two British nationals and the child of a British national were among the dead.\nMost of IS-K's several thousand extremists are believed to be in hiding in the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan, east of Kabul."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "Thousands of people are scrambling to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban seized back control of the country, almost two decades after they were ousted by a US-led coalition.\nThe United Nations has warned that up to half a million Afghans could flee the country by the end of the year and has called on neighbouring countries to keep their borders open. \nThe current crisis comes on top of the 2.2 million Afghan refugees already in neighbouring countries and 3.5 million people forced to flee their homes within Afghanistan's borders.\nThe US-led operation to evacuate people by air has now ended, with the last flight taking off from Kabul airport just after midnight on Tuesday - a deadline agreed with the Taliban for foreign forces to withdraw.  \nMore than 123,000 civilians were evacuated by US forces and its coalition partners after the Taliban took control of the capital on 14 August - but it's unclear exactly how many of those were Afghan nationals. \nThe US has said that it flew nearly 80,000 civilians out of Kabul and of those, about 5,500 were Americans and more than 73,500 were either Afghans or other foreign nationals. \nWhile the UK Ministry of Defence, which ended its evacuations on Saturday, said it had flown out more than 15,000 people and some 8,000 of them were Afghans. \nAt the height of the operation, the US said its military planes were departing the airport every 39 minutes - although the evacuations did slow down after the suicide bomb attack on the 26 August outside the airport, which killed about 170 people, including 13 American troops.\nMany of those flown out of the country were taken to emergency processing centres set up in several countries, including Spain, Germany, Qatar and Uzbekistan.\nAs many as 300,000 Afghans have been affiliated with US operations in the country since 2001, according to the International Rescue Committee, and tens of thousands of them are eligible to obtain a US visa - but many will now have to find a different way out of the country. \nAt the weekend, the US said it had received assurances from the Taliban that Afghan nationals who are issued with valid travel documents by another country will be allowed to leave Afghanistan. \nThe Taliban control all the main land crossing points with Afghanistan's neighbours (shown on the map below) and reports suggest they are only allowing traders or those with valid travel documents to leave the country.\nHowever, many of those trying to flee because they fear for their safety under Taliban rule will not have any paperwork. \nThe UN has urged Afghanistan's neighbours to keep their borders open to refugees and called on the international community to support those countries. \nBut Uzbekistan, which borders the north of Afghanistan, has said its main crossing point is closed to \"ensure security\" and there are no plans to open it. \nPakistan, which has the longest border with Afghanistan, has also said it will not accept refugees - with its US ambassador telling the BBC: \"We are already overburdened by the refugees, and it is beyond our capacity to host any more refugees.\"\nLast week, satellite imagery of the Spin Boldak crossing point between Afghanistan and Pakistan showed a large crowd of people gathered on the Afghan side. \nThe BBC's Shumaila Jaffery, who was at the crossing point, said it was a chaotic scene with many Afghans not being allowed to enter Pakistan. \nLast Friday, two Afghans were reportedly killed by Pakistani security forces at the Torkham border crossing after trying to enter Pakistan illegally.\nThere have also been reports of thousands of Afghans trying to cross the western border with Iran, but it's unclear how many have been successful. \nThe latest movement of Afghans is part of a historical exodus from a country that has suffered instability and conflict over many years.\nEven before the Taliban retook control, more than 550,000 people had been forced to flee their homes this year due to fighting, according to the UNHCR. \nThat means an estimated 3.5 million Afghans are currently internally displaced within the country.\nIn addition to those within Afghanistan's borders, about 2.2 million refugees and asylum seekers were also seeking sanctuary in neighbouring nations as of the end of last year.\nThis year, Afghans have also had to deal with a severe drought and food shortages across most of the country. A report by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in June said that 14 million people - more than a third of the population - were suffering from hunger. \nMary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP country director for Afghanistan, said last week that unless emergency food and medical supplies arrived soon, the \"already horrendous situation\" would become \"an absolute catastrophe, a complete humanitarian disaster\".\nNeighbouring countries Pakistan and Iran saw the highest numbers of Afghanistan's refugees and asylum seekers last year.\nAlmost 1.5 million fled to Pakistan in 2020, while Iran hosted 780,000, according to UNHCR figures.\nGermany was third, with more than 180,000, while Turkey took nearly 130,000.\nWhen looking at asylum seeker numbers only - those who have applied for sanctuary in another country but whose claims have not yet been granted - Turkey, Germany and Greece top the list, with about 125,000, 33,000 and 20,000 respectively.\nAlthough there are no Afghan asylum seekers in Iran, those with refugee cards - an official document recognising their status - are able to access the country's health and education systems.\nThe UN has called on its member states to help Afghan people in \"their darkest hour of need\" - but while some countries have offered refugees a safe haven, others have indicated they will not be giving sanctuary to those fleeing the crisis. \nBoth Pakistan and Iran have said that they cannot cope with a further influx of Afghan refugees. Officials in both countries have said that any refugees that do arrive will have to stay in camps near the border until they can return to Afghanistan. \nUzbekistan has said it will help transfer Afghans to third countries but will only host refugees temporarily. The Tajikistan government previously offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees but it's unclear if any have been allowed in yet. Turkmenistan has said its airspace can be used for evacuation flights but it hasn't made any commitment to take in refugees itself. \nIn Turkey, the government has urged European countries to take responsibility for any new migrant crisis, saying Turkey would not be \"Europe's migrant storage unit\". The country has stepped up construction of a border wall with Iran to thwart those entering illegally. \nOfficials in several European Union countries say they are keen to avoid a repeat of the 2015 migrant crisis, when there was a populist backlash against large numbers of Syrian refugees being allowed to enter EU territory.\nFrance, which evacuated more than 2,800 people from Kabul airport, mostly Afghans, has indicated it will accept some refugees but has not specified a number. Germany has also not specified a number but Chancellor Angela Merkel has said as many as 40,000 people still in the country may have a right to be evacuated to Germany if they feel they are endangered.\nOther EU countries, like Austria, Poland and Switzerland have said they will not accept any new Afghan arrivals and are upping their border security to guard against illegal arrivals. \nThe UK has said it will take in 5,000 Afghans in 2021 as part of a scheme to resettle 20,000 over the next few years, focusing on those at greatest risk from the Taliban.\nThe US has not said how many refugees it will accept yet, but it has authorised $500m (\u00a3367m) for \"unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs of refugees\". Canada has said that it will resettle 20,000 Afghans while Australia has said it will take in 3,000.\nSeveral countries, including Kosovo and Uganda, have also accepted US requests to temporarily accept Afghan refugees before they are resettled elsewhere.

      "tags": "Schools,Personal finance,School uniform",
      "text": "A new law aimed at making school uniforms cheaper in England will not be in place in time for the start of this school year.\nHeadteachers are waiting for the new statutory guidance on uniforms, which will make schools place affordability at the centre of their uniform policy.\nThe government says schools should expect full details in the autumn.\nBut that means parents will not benefit from the changes, as schools go back this September. \nAccording to The Children's Society, the average uniform costs \u00a3315 per primary school pupil and \u00a3337 per secondary pupil. \nMike Amesbury, the Labour MP who first introduced the legislation, said he would be \"incredibly disappointed\" if any further delays to the guidance meant that the changes weren't fully in force for the start of the next academic year, beginning in September 2022. \nHe added that hundreds of thousands of children, parents and campaigners would be equally upset. \nIt is expected that the rules will limit the number of logos on uniforms, allowing parents to buy more items from supermarkets and shops other than a school's main supplier. \nWhen this new law eventually comes into force, it will save families a big sum of cash. \nAt the moment, some schools require trousers or skirts to have the school badge on, alongside jumpers, cardigans, polo shirts, blazers - and that's before you even get started on sports kits. \nEach item that's specific to the school costs more, so only having to buy one or two would mean big savings. \n In the meantime some local sewing services have pattern school logos and might be able to embroider a badge onto a generic top to save some cash. \nFor years many, schools have had a link to a local uniform shop, where all pupils must go to get kitted out. Although many parents see this as a way of supporting local business, for plenty of other families it just limits their chances of getting something cheaper elsewhere. This new law is aiming to open up the way those deals with supply shops are signed, so it's not done on a nod-and-a-wink, and will now have price as the central factor. \nParents will now have to wait and hope that the law is finalised before the next academic year begins to see the reality of those cash savings.  \nAzmina Siddique, policy manager at the Children's Society, told the BBC it was disappointing parents won't see a financial benefit this September.\nBut she added: \"We appreciate that these [changes] can take a bit of time and it's really important to get the guidance right.\"\nSchools will now have more time to review their policies, she said, adding: \"Teachers have also told us that, while they would be very happy for the law to have been passed, in year they have had - adjusting to home learning and the impact of the pandemic -  that one more thing before the summer term may have been difficult.\"\nSchools are also expecting a new tendering process, which will mean they can get the best value for money when selecting who makes and sells their uniforms. \nAdditionally there's expected to be a process for parents and carers to complain if they feel that's not happening effectively at their children's schools. \nWhile they wait for legislation to cut costs, many parents have taken matters into their own hands by forming groups and swap shops, often online, to offer others items that no longer fit and to find new kit for their own children. \nEmma Ball started the Uniform Exchange in Winsford, Cheshire, three years ago when her two eldest children left school and she was left with clothes she no longer had use for. \nShe now collects items from parents across the area and helps get them to families who need anything from a new blazer for high school to a pinafore for winter term. \nSince starting the exchange, she has helped more than 1,000 families and said that this year demand has doubled. \nEmma says the issue of incorrect uniforms affects secondary school pupils in particular, with some schools sanctioning them or even sending them home if they arrive without wearing the right clothes.\n\"Children shouldn't ever be punished for not having a school uniform,\" she said, adding that people shouldn't worry about going to a swap shop for school wear as they're keeping it out of landfill. \nParents Corinna Baker-Sinclair and Rebecca Benson have both used the swap shop in the town. \nWith three children in primary and another in secondary, Corinna said she would have to pay out well over \u00a31,000 if she were to buy everything new each year. \nFor Rebecca, it's not just the financial cost of new uniforms that led her to use the uniform exchange. \"When you look around and see how much there actually is that can be put to good use rather than going to landfill it makes sense to reuse,\" she said. \"You'd much rather spend that money making memories than just to buy a school uniform.\"\nWhen the law requiring government to introduce the new guidelines came into force earlier this year, school standards minister Nick Gibb said they would help families to save money and ensure that cost was never a barrier to accessing the best possible education. \nHowever, with the new term starting imminently for most pupils in England, it's likely to be a year at least before parents see any change in the amount they're spending to kit out their children for school.

Information about the attack had been \"garbled\", according to a senior Pentagon official.\nUK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said a suicide bomber walked into the middle of families waiting outside the gate before carrying out the attack.\nHe told the BBC: \"We think it was a suicide vest and a smaller device. The individual got to the perimeter we had pushed out the day before in response to that threat.\n\"[The bomber] walked straight into the middle of those families waiting.\"\nReports say some victims were blown into  a sewage canal where Afghans were waiting to be processed.\nMany of the victims of the attack were rushed to Kabul's Emergency Hospital.\nUS and British troops had recently been deployed to guard the area around the Abbey Gate.\nAccording to one account, one attacker fired into a crowd of people, although reports also said Taliban guards had fired into the air.\nUS citizens who had gone to the area around the airport had been warned before the attack to \"leave immediately\".\nIt's believed some 95 people were killed and 150 injured.\nThe Pentagon said that 13 US military personnel, including US marines and a US Navy medic, were among the dead. A further US 15 troops were injured.\nOn Friday, the UK government confirmed that two British nationals and the child of a British national had been killed in the attack.\nImages taken at the scene showed the injured being taken away in wheelbarrows.\nHuge crowds had been gathering in the area, hoping to be accepted on to an evacuation flight.\nThe attack is likely to significantly complicate the final effort to airlift thousands of people out of Afghanistan ahead of 31 August.\nBefore the attack, a number of countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, had announced that they could no longer conduct flights. \nTurkey also announced that its troops, who had been providing security at the airport for six years, were withdrawing.\nThe UK has confirmed that it will no longer be calling people forward to the airport for evacuation flights.\nGraphics by Prina Shah and Gerry Fletcher"

      "title": "Afghanistan: Tired, overwhelmed Afghan families start new lives in the UK",
      "text": "Tired, occasionally scared - but mostly overwhelmed - shortly after 09:00 on Thursday, Afghan families walked through Heathrow Airport to a new life.\nChildren gripped their parents' hands. Grandparents clutched folders of identity documents proving their right to come to the UK. Volunteers from the Red Cross handed out food parcels with sandwiches - a very British welcome. \nFor the third day running, Heathrow has received thousands of Afghan refugees into the UK. \nWhatever the questions about the effectiveness of the UK and international response to the unfolding disaster in Afghanistan, the operation to oversee the arrival of those who have managed to get out is enormous. \nSince Tuesday, Heathrow's Terminal 4 has become a refugee processing hub - along with smaller operations at Birmingham International and RAF Brize Norton. \nThe airport is receiving around five flights a day, bringing more than 1,000 Afghans to safety - part of 15,000 who have arrived so far. \nAs they arrived in the reception hall, the refugees looked around as Border Force officers and Heathrow staff ushered them to seating. \nChildren were given packs of colouring crayons, officials explained to them how each family group would have to go through an identification and verification process. \nSome of the arrivals had full documentation - passports and proof of their links to the UK. Others had fewer records - some only birth certificates. \nWahis, a British-Afghan, had taken the unusual step of returning to the homeland he fled as a refugee to find and bring his younger sisters and their small children to safety.\nAs he sat in the hall, watching relatives being fingerprinted as part of the checks and registration for new identity documents, his relief was palpable. \n\"The Taliban are literally driving around every day, in certain roads, they try to find certain people,\" he told me. \n\"They went through [the family] house - they would have probably taken my sisters. That's what they do.\"\nThe process to receive the refugees has involved a cross-government operation. \nNHS staff, from GPs to ambulance personnel, are responding to immediate medical concerns. \nEach day a handful of passengers have gone to hospital, often because they have arrived without vital medicines. \nEach family group in turn has their bundle of identity documents checked by Border Force officers, assisted by the military. \nThe final stage of their arrival is a review of all the individual information by police officers who work in counter-terrorism - looking out for suspects trying to smuggle themselves in. \nSo far, there's been only one publicly confirmed serious security alert. An individual who arrived at Birmingham was on a \"no-fly\" list - which can cover a range of concerns. Detectives later established the individual's listing was unrelated to terrorism. \nOnce the checks are complete, the families are taken to a Covid quarantine hotel for 10 days. From there they are distributed to local authorities - although Home Office officials have admitted in the past week that the hunt for suitable housing, particularly for large families, has become challenging. \nBut before that happens, the officials welcoming the refugees at the airport have to put them at ease. Step forward Dorna, a Border Force translator. \nShe's had an emotional rollercoaster of a week, telling family after family they now have nothing to fear - and everything to hope for. She told me that her daily goal is to remain professional - to keep her emotions in check as she does her duty to help people feel safe. \n\"It's terrifying for a lot of them but luckily I've been able to communicate with some of them by speaking Farsi,\" she said. \n\"It's helped massively. The uniform will scare a lot of people. It's been good in the sense that a lot of people are opening up and they're realising we're not scary, we're not going to hurt them, we're here to help.\"\nOfficials at the airport have heard stories that have confirmed what everyone suspects. Despite the Taliban presenting a new public face, some of those arriving have experienced abuses. One man with ties to the British military was beaten and whipped by militiamen as he struggled to get through the Taliban's check-points to Kabul's airport. \nAnother woman showed me footage on her phone of a Taliban fighter sneaking around her family home in the dead of night. \nIt was an open secret in the neighbourhood that her father had worked in the British embassy. Seeing the fighter lurking convinced them they had to get out.\nMalalai Hussiny, 20, abandoned her university course to flee with her extended family. \nShe wants to continue to learn English, return to university and follow her ambition to become a journalist. \nAs she rested in the arrivals hall, she couldn't contain her feelings.\n\"I am very happy to be here because the UK has helped us, our people in Afghanistan are coming here. I am so very happy - and now me and my family safe here. Thank you a lot in UK.\"\nFor those left behind the Kabul bombing has underlined not only that time is running out - but the questions ministers face about how quickly they have acted.\nPriti Patel, the home secretary, spoke to families as they arrived on Thursday - and she defended the government's response.\n\"We are working night and day, my colleagues in government and internationally and in the region, looking at safe passage and safe and legal routes,\" she said. \n\"Our priority first and foremost is to save lives. Also, if you look at what we're doing around immigration - they are our absolute priority and we will make sure, find ways we can get them here and of course importantly we've got to regularise their status.\"\nNick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary for Labour, has accused the government of leaving huge numbers of people at risk of losing their lives. \n\"We still don't know when these supposed safe routes will open or how people fearing for their lives will be able to access help once the airport closes, and the military has left,\" he said."

About one million locals remain without power.\n\"It's going to be a difficult life for quite some time,\" said one local leader in the Greater New Orleans area.\nAbout 5,000 National Guard members have been deployed to aid search and rescue.\nIn addition, more than 25,000 workers from around the country have mobilised to support power restoration in the state, according to CNN.\nAt least one person is dead after a tree fell on their home in Ascension Parish, in Louisiana's Baton Rouge area.\nState and local officials have conceded that number is likely to grow as search and rescue efforts continue, but argued the city had largely \"held the line\".\n\"The systems we depended on to save lives and protect our city did just that and we are grateful, but there is so much more work to be done,\" said New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell on Monday. \nShe urged residents who had already evacuated their homes to stay put and not return until power and communications have been restored.\nAs the slow-moving Ida continues to move inland, it has weakened to a tropical storm - but the National Hurricane Centre warned that heavy rain could still bring flooding to parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.\nIda was previously deemed \"life-threatening\", drawing comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, a 2005 storm that had a path similar to Ida and killed 1,800 people.\nBut it seemed that New Orleans' flood defences, strengthened in Katrina's aftermath, have done their job. Governor John Bel Edwards said the levee systems had \"performed magnificently\" and none have thus far been breached.\n\"But the damage is still catastrophic,\" he acknowledged on Monday. \"We are still in a life saving mode.\"\nPresident Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in the state, releasing extra funds for rescue and recovery efforts.\nOn Monday, he pledged that the federal government would \"stand with the people of the Gulf [Coast] for as long as it takes for you to recover\".\nEntergy, the largest power company in Louisiana, warned that it would take days - and likely weeks in the hardest hit areas - to restore electricity to the more than one million homes without power across the state. \nIda gathered strength over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico during the weekend. More than 90% of oil production there has been shut down as a result of the storm. \nOn Sunday, Ida made landfall south of New Orleans as a category four hurricane - meaning it would cause severe damage to buildings, trees and power lines. As it moves inland, Ida's winds have dropped to 95mph (153km/h), meaning it is now a category one storm.\nThere are still fears of storm surges along the coast - which could be as high as 16ft (4.8m), potentially submerging parts of the low-lying coastline. \nBy Nada Tawfik, BBC News\nIn New Orleans, the sun is now shining. While that might sound lovely, sweltering conditions are less than ideal when residents and businesses lack power and water. With a lengthy wait to restore utilities many residents are now scrambling to make a post-storm evacuation.\nThere has been significant property damage as well. Jazz icon Louis Armstrong's second home, a small brick structure, is now just a pile of bricks.\nStill, residents talk about how they got lucky after Hurricane Katrina's disastrous death toll.\nThe picture changes once you head to low lying areas outside of New Orleans's hurricane protection system. \nThe situation there is more desperate as people wait atop their roofs and inside their attics to be saved from the water. Some of the roads are impassable and unsafe due to downed power lines and flooding. Reaching the most vulnerable in these conditions will be challenging but resources are now pouring in.  \nIn Jefferson Parish, I met Clarence Sinceno, an older man who has lived in his home there for 50 years. He says Ida was the worst storm he's lived through. Throughout the night, he and his family kept moving to different parts of the house as leaks turned into holes. The intense winds tore off sections of his roof and the sheet rock and insulation completely collapsed. \nCovid-19 has also further complicated efforts to keep people safe. Louisiana hospitals are already under pressure from Covid-19, as the state has the third-highest rate of infections in the US. \nNormally, hospitals in the predicted path of the hurricane would be evacuated, but this time there are few beds available, even at facilities further inland. \n\"We don't have any place to bring those patients. Not in state, not out of state,\" Mr Edwards said.\nIda came ashore on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a category three storm when it made landfall.\nSince then, billions of dollars have been spent on flood defences, known as levees. So far, the levees have held, though a flash flood warning is in place for New Orleans.\nHigh winds tore part of the roof off a hospital in the town of Cut Off, Louisiana, just inland from the Gulf of Mexico. The hospital said it had suffered \"significant damage\" but that its patients were safe.\nThe impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above, making more energy available to drive hurricanes. \nAs a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.\nHow has Hurricane Ida affected you?

      "text": "Health professionals expect a \"surge\" of issues about children's emotional health due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThat is just one of the key findings of a wide-ranging report into how services to children and young people have been affected.\nThe report by experts from Queen's University Belfast (QUB) was carried out for the Commissioner for Children and Young People (NICCY).\nIt found children had been \"severely impacted\" by restrictions.\nThe review of the effect of Covid-19 on the planning and delivery of children's services was carried out by academics from the Centre for Children's Rights at QUB.\nIt is a companion report to one from the Children's Commissioner reflecting the views of more than 4,000 young people.\nThe NICCY report found that the pandemic and lockdown restrictions had \"a severe impact\" on their education, mental and physical health and wellbeing.\nThe QUB report was based on interviews and focus groups with 38 professionals working with children and young people in areas such as health, education, early years, child protection and youth services.\nIt said \"crucial services\" were \"put on hold\" or made \"more difficult for children and young people and their families to access during the pandemic\".\nIn the health sector, professionals expressed concerns about children's mental health.\n\"There's solid data that shows that when you close schools and close services mental health issues increase in children and young people\u2026 young people's loneliness is kind of being neglected,\" one told the authors.\n\"There are babies being born to mothers who are mentally ill now as a result of the pandemic,\" another said.\n\"Every single adult who's now hitting that threshold for mental illness, the risk of mental illness in their child increases.\"\nThe report said that vulnerable children, newcomer children, refugees and asylum seekers were particularly vulnerable to physical and mental health problems.\n\"Children with disabilities and complex needs, pre-existing and life-limiting conditions, mental health issues, and children with refugee status may have endured the greatest health related impact,\" it concluded.\n\"They missed essential therapies, surgeries, respite care and cancelled outpatient appointments to track their illness and rehabilitation.\"\nAnother professional interviewed by the authors spoke of \"a whole generation of invisible children\" who had not received the healthcare they needed.\n\"Another group of children who may have fallen under the radar during the pandemic are adolescents,\" the report said.\nIt noted, for example, that some young people had limited access to sexual health advice and treatment.\nOne health professional spoke of \"increases in gonorrhoea, chlamydia among young women, gonorrhoea among young men, but also syphilis has gone up 32%\".\nIn schools, teachers had \"additional and significant responsibilities\".\n\"This ranged from the extra time spent preparing materials to late-night phone calls and emails with parents to find out why some children are not engaging with remote learning,\" the report said.\nWhen many pupils were educated remotely teachers were \"less able to effectively monitor children who may be perceived as vulnerable for a range of reasons or to keep an eye on safeguarding issues\".\nFamilies of children with disabilities were also said to have struggled.\n\"During the first lockdown when they closed off all services, including schools, mental health services, health services, parents were calling up, they were struggling, they were really struggling,\" a children's worker told the authors.\nSome professionals criticised the way the Department of Education had communicated changes to schools.\n\"If there's anything that is vaguely controversial it comes out on Friday afternoon after schools are closed,\" one told the report's authors.\nYouth workers said that the abrupt closure of schools, youth clubs and community groups, leisure centres, parks, museums and libraries had left \"children and young people with few choices and places where they could spend their free time in a safe and enjoyable way\".\n\"You're now seeing people going 'actually play is', what we've been saying for years, it is one of the most critical activities children engage in,\" one told the report's authors.\n\"And the pandemic is showing, through all of the research around mental health and around physical health, it's showing the impact of not having access to this.\"\n\"By removing that it actually impacts significantly on children and young people's lives.\"\nMany professionals said, though, that services \"improved over time\" and that there had been more collaboration between those in different sectors and agencies.\nMany also said they had found new ways to deliver services that would benefit children and young people in the future.\nBut there were still concerns.\n\"There was concern about what recovery would look like, not just for working arrangements but in terms of increased needs of children and young people, service provision and resourcing,\" the report concluded.\nIt also included a number of recommendations based on those from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus vaccines,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "The number of new Covid cases reported in Scotland has hit another record high of 7,113.\nThe figure tops the previous high of 6,835 which was recorded on Friday.\nIt comes as Health Secretary Humza Yousaf  warned the NHS was facing a \"perfect storm\" of pressure.\nThe latest government figures show a total of 507 people are in hospital with Covid and 52 are in intensive care.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"We are seeing a rising curve of cases in Scotland. It's reassuring that vaccines are preventing the levels of serious health harms that case numbers like this would once have caused.\n\"However, we can't be complacent and are monitoring carefully. In the meantime, please take care.\"\nThree council areas - East and West Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire - now have weekly case rates above 1,000 per 100,000 of population.\nPeople under 40 are being urged to get a Covid jab to help ease the increasing strain on the NHS .\nAround two thirds of cases are in the under-40 group.\nAbout 30% of Covid-related hospital admissions in the last month were also from the same age bracket.\nBefore the latest case numbers were released, Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland the NHS was under \"severe, severe pressure\", particularly with A&E services and ambulance turnaround.\nAmong 18 to 29-year-olds, only 74% have had a first dose of the vaccine.\nProgress remains slow, with that figure only rising by one percentage point in 10 days.\nThe Scottish government is also urging people who have already had a first dose of vaccine \"not to leave the job half done\" and book an appointment or go to a drop-in clinic for their second dose.\nThe health secretary said disinformation such as claims that the vaccine affects fertility or a belief that younger people do not get seriously ill may be a factor in the lower take-up rate among the younger age groups.\nHe said the current high case rates \"underline the fact that this virus is still a significant threat and the importance of getting vaccinated cannot be underestimated\".\nThe health secretary added: \"Scotland's vaccination programme has been one of the fastest in the world, but it's clear there are some people - particularly aged under 40 - who have been offered a second appointment and for whatever reason have not yet attended.\n\"Our message to you is clear. It's not too late to get your vaccine.\n\"And it remains vital that you get both doses in order to give maximum protection against this virus.\"\nThe health secretary said the NHS faced huge challenges across all departments while still dealing with 500 Covid patients in hospitals.\nHe said: \"What you are seeing in many local health board areas is that the A&E departments are almost at pre-Covid levels - and in some areas, above pre-Covid levels.\n\"Add to that, just shy of 500 Covid patients across the country. And, of course, we've still got infection prevention control measures in place.\n\"We've also had staff absence through illness and some taking annual leave, understandably.\n\"All of that is a real perfect storm putting enormous pressure on our health service.\"\nLucy Fleming, lead nurse with NHS Grampian's Ecmo life-support team said no age group \"should consider themselves invincible to Covid-19\". \nShe said: \"I am under 40. To see increasing numbers of young and otherwise healthy people of my own age requiring this level of intensive care is heartbreaking. \n\"There is no doubt that as cases rise, it is crucial that everyone who is eligible takes up their invitation for a vaccination and gets both doses.\"\nThe health secretary also said the current pressure on A&E departments was having a serious impact on ambulance waiting times.\nIn recent weeks, some people have had to wait up to several hours to be attended to.\nMr Yousaf said: \"The NHS is absolutely and utterly interconnected. If you are having problems within the A&E department, that's a whole-systems problem, so the demand on the ambulance service is huge.\n\"But, of course, if the ambulance gets to a hospital which is under severe pressure, then discharging someone from an ambulance and getting them seen also takes time.\n\"That then affects the ambulance going back out to recover another patient.\n\"So that's why we're asking people, only to call 999 and only request an ambulance if it is absolutely critical.\""
