      "tags": "Nightclubs,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People attending nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather in England will need to be fully vaccinated from the end of September, the government says. \nLatest figures show 35% of 18 to 30-year-olds have not had their first jab. \nCurrently nightclubs and other crowded venues are only encouraged to ask clubbers to show proof of vaccination, a negative test result or immunity.\nBut Boris Johnson said he was concerned by the continuing risk of transmission.\nThe announcement came on the day nightclubs in England were allowed to reopen after 16 months of closure. \nThe prime minister told a press conference on Monday: \"I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere. But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing.\n\"As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission.\n\"And I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over 18s have had their chance to be double jabbed we're planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather.\"\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said nightclubs and other such venues could be \"potential super spreading events\" because of crowds in close contact.\n\"I would expect that with opening of nightclubs, we'll continue to see an increase in cases, and we will see outbreaks related to specific nightclubs as well,\" he said.\nHow have you been affected by issues covered in this story?\nNightclubs are still closed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe Welsh government said it would never mandate the use of vaccination certificates but that businesses would be free to ask for them.\nAcross the UK, 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIt's easy to understand how a loud and busy nightclub could be the perfect stomping ground for Covid. \nHaving lots of people packed closely together, snogging, singing and shouting in a confined space with relatively poor ventilation creates ideal conditions for a virus carried in our spit to spread. \nAdd in the fact that many of those attending may not have had two or even one dose of a vaccine that helps protect against catching and transmitting the virus, and you could have a super-spreading event on your hands. \nThe Netherlands recently tried reopening its clubs and quickly decided to close them again amid rising infection rates. Its government said most of the new infections occurred in nightlife settings and parties with large numbers of people. \nFor now, it is asking its citizens to use their common sense and act responsibly; keeping gatherings small and manageable. Time will tell if the UK might go the same way. \nMany nightclubs have shut down during the pandemic and the industry reacted angrily to the prime minister's announcement.\n\"So, 'freedom day' for nightclubs lasted around 17 hours then,\" said Michael Kill, boss of the Night Time Industries Association. \n\"Leaving aside the fact that this is yet another chaotic U-turn that will leave nightclubs who have been planning for reopening for months having to make more changes to the way they operate - this is still a bad idea. \n\"80% of nightclubs have said they do not want to implement Covid passports, worrying about difficulties with enforcing the system and a reduction in spontaneous consumers, as well as being put at a competitive disadvantage with pubs and bars that aren't subject to the same restrictions and yet provide similar environments.\"\nBoss of UK Hospitality Kate Nicholls called the announcement \"a hammer blow\" for a struggling industry trying to rebuild. \nOne major nightclub firm, Rekom UK, which owns 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, and Fiction, said clubs had become a political football. \nBoss Peter Marks said: \"Mandatory Covid passports may make sense one day once the entire adult population has been offered vaccines, but does government really think this threat will entice the 'vaccine wary' to take the vaccine? They will just stay later in the pubs and hold their parties in their houses.\"\nMark Harper MP, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative backbenchers, also criticised the plans, saying the government was \"effectively moving to compulsory vaccination.\"\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, he called on the government to bring forward the evidence for the policy in September ahead of any vote, saying he didn't think the evidence from pilot schemes supported the idea. \nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi MP promised to share the evidence with the Commons, \"working with the nightclub industry or at-risk large scale events that are indoors\"."

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "Some children and young people aged over 12 in Northern Ireland are to be offered a Covid vaccine.\nOfficials say those with specific underlying health conditions and who are at risk of serious illness from the virus can now receive the Pfizer/BioNtech jab.\nTeenagers within three months of their 18th birthday can also get a jab.\nAt present health officials are not recommending routine universal vaccination of under 18s. \nThe list of eligibility currently includes those with severe neuro-disabilities, Down's Syndrome, underlying conditions resulting in immunosuppression, and those with profound and multiple learning disabilities, severe learning disabilities or who are on the learning disability register.  \nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the vaccination programme had always been \"guided by the expert advice\". \n\"The decision by the medicines regulator to approve the Pfizer vaccine for use in this younger age group has only been taken after rigorous assessment of both safety and effectiveness,\" he said. \nMr Swann said the announcement by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) underlined the important role of the vaccines. \nThe JCVI advises government ministers on which people should be offered a vaccine.\nAdditionally, vaccines will be offered to young people over 12 who live with someone who is immunosuppressed. \nThis is aimed at providing increased protection for the more vulnerable members of the household.\nParent or guardian consent will be required ahead of vaccination. \nNorthern Ireland chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride said the JCVI had carefully examined the risk of Covid-19 to children and young people against the potential benefits of vaccination. \n\"While the evidence strongly indicates that almost all children and young people are at very low risk from Covid-19, a small number of children and young people with underlying chronic conditions are at increased risk and will benefit from the protection offered by vaccination.\"\nSir Michael said the JCVI will keep this advice under review. \nThe Department of Health is continuing to operate a number of walk-in Covid-19 vaccine clinics across Northern Ireland this week.\nThe appointment-free pop-ups were established as part of a \"final push\" to get younger people vaccinated.\nMeanwhile, the Department of Health has said the Northern Ireland version of the Covid-19 vaccine certificate app should be ready to go from Monday 26 July.\nCurrently travellers are using an interim system to prove that they have had both jabs.\nAnyone travelling from Northern Ireland between 20 and 25 July can access a downloadable certificate and QR code.\nDr Eddie O'Neill, from the department, said certificates are \"designed specially for the EU specification\".\nHe said the certificate and QR code should be readily usable within the EU.\nDr O'Neill said once people download the app, they'll be invited to register an account, prove their identity and then be able to request a certificate.\n\"There's an automated matching process and then on their app they will be able to get the QR code,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \nHe said that it works in a similar way to the NHS app in England.\nLast week, more than two million people in the Republic of Ireland got their certificates, which contain QR codes, by email and post.\nBut most Irish passport holders in Northern Ireland will not be able to access the certificate because they were vaccinated outside of the Republic of Ireland.\nAnother 1,776 positive cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland were reported on Monday - that figure is more than triple the number reported on Sunday which was 537.\nThere has been one further coronavirus-related death.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she has been \"quite disturbed by some of the imagery \" she has witnessed in the last 24 hours after Covid restrictions were lifted in England. \nThe move means there are no limits on how many people can meet and it means nightclubs can open for the first time since March 2020.\nMs O'Neill said the Northern Ireland Executive would always \"set its own path and would continue to do so\".\nEast Antrim Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson criticised Mr Swann, saying he should not try to \"blackmail ministers into just listening to the Covid obsessed advice that seems to be prevalent in policy making at present\".\nMr Swann`s party colleague Alan Chambers supported the health minister, saying exercising caution was the correct approach. \nMeanwhile, anyone travelling to Northern Ireland from France must continue to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. \nFrom Monday, anyone arriving from a country on the so-called amber list do not have to quarantine if fully UK vaccinated. \nHowever, the Department of Health said this will not apply to arrivals from France due to \"the persistent presence of cases ... of the Beta variant\".

      "text": "Ben & Jerry's has said it will stop selling its ice cream in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.\nThe US company said sales \"in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT)\" were \"inconsistent with our values\".\nIsraeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the move was \"morally wrong\" and would prove to be \"financially wrong\".\nThe West Bank and East Jerusalem have been under Israeli control since the 1967 Middle East war.\nMore than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements there. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. \nIn a statement shared to its Twitter and Instagram pages on Monday, Ben & Jerry's said its decision reflected the concerns of \"fans and trusted partners\".\nThe changes would be made by allowing current licensing arrangements to expire at the end of next year, it added. \n\"We have a longstanding partnership with our licensee, who manufactures Ben & Jerry's ice cream in Israel and distributes it in the region,\" the statement said.\n\"We have been working to change this, and so we have informed our licensee that we will not renew the license agreement when it expires at the end of next year.\"\nBen & Jerry's also runs two \"scoop shops\" in Israel and said it would distribute its goods in Israel through a different agreement, the details of which would be announced \"when we're ready\".\nUK firm Unilever, which has owned Ben & Jerry's since 2000, says the decision was taken and announced by Ben & Jerry's and its independent board, but it remained \"fully committed\" to maintaining a presence in Israel.\nBen & Jerry's Israeli licensee was quoted by the Haaretz newspaper as saying: \"Global Ben & Jerry's decided not to renew the agreement with us in another year and a half in light of our refusal [to comply] with their demand and stop selling throughout Israel.\"\n\"We call on the Israeli government and consumers not to permit a boycott of Israel... Ice cream is not part of politics.\"\nIsraeli politicians reacted furiously to the announcement. \n\"The boycott of Israel - a democracy surrounded by islands of terror - reflects a complete loss of bearings. The boycott does not work and will not work, and we will fight it with all our might,\" Mr Bennett said.\nForeign Minister Yair Lapid called Ben & Jerry's move a \"disgraceful capitulation\" to anti-Semitism and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a complete boycott of Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians.\n\"Over 30 states in the United States have passed anti-BDS legislation in recent years. I plan on asking each of them to enforce these laws against Ben & Jerry's,\" he said.\nA spokesman for BDS, Mahmoud Nawajaa, it welcomed Ben & Jerry's decision and called on the company \"to end all its procedures with the apartheid Israel\".\nBen & Jerry's  - which was founded in 1978 by best friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield - has a track record of campaigning on social issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and climate change.

      "text": "Supermarkets have warned they will have to cut opening hours or even shut shops if the number of workers forced to self-isolate continues to rise.\nM&S said the number of workers being notified by the NHS app is rising exponentially, and it may have to reduce hours if there are shortages.\nA leading supermarket, which declined to be named, said it could lead to massive disruption of food supplies.\n\"And there's a risk that there won't be sufficient staff to open shops.\"\nLast week, over 500,000 alerts were sent to users of the NHS Test and Trace app in England and Wales for the week to 7 July, a rise of 46% on the previous week. \nM&S chief executive Steve Rowe told The Times that the number of people being forced to self-isolate is \"a major issue across every industry at the moment\". \nHe said: \"Our Covid cases are roughly doubling every week and the pinging level is about three to one of Covid cases, so we're seeing that growing exponentially.\"\nHe said: \"If there's shortages we'll have to manage it by changing hours of stores, reducing hours.\"\nFrom 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they are \"pinged\" by the NHS app when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid.  They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible.\nBut another UK supermarket warned: \"The clock is ticking and the government needs to act fast to get people back to work if they have a negative test.\n\"If not, we could be heading towards crisis point next month.\"\nA spokeswoman for Morrisons said: \"As per the whole of the UK, we are experiencing a rise in cases and close contact notifications.\"\nBut she added: \"We provide guidance and support for colleagues who may need to self-isolate including sick pay and have Covid secure controls in place in all our stores to ensure we can continue to operate and keep them open. Throughout the whole of the pandemic, we have not been required to close a store.\"\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents the industry, said that the government must bring forward the changes on self-isolation from 16 August \"so that people who are fully vaccinated or have a negative test are not forced to needlessly quarantine\" when they are contacted by the app.\nBRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said: \"We are already seeing a serious impact on retail operations as a result of staff having to self-isolate and this will only get worse right across the economy, as cases are already rising fast and the final restrictions are eased.\"\nLord Karan Bilimoria, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said that amid \"crippling staff shortages, speed is of the essence\".\nHe called for an immediate end to \"the self-isolation period of 10 days for people who are double-jabbed\" and \"a route out of isolation for those not yet fully vaccinated through daily lateral flow tests\".\nIt comes as both the prime minister and the chancellor u-turned on a decision not to self-isolate after coming into contact with health Secretary Sajid Javid, who announced on Saturday that he had tested positive for Covid.   \nBoris Johnson and Rishi Sunak initially said they planned to keep working on essential government business under a pilot scheme that involves daily testing.\nHowever, it prompted a backlash by opposition parties as well as the managing director of the retailer Iceland, Richard Walker, who tweeted: \"Shame the hundreds of Iceland staff who've been pinged can't avoid self-isolation. We can all do a daily lateral flow test.\"\nThe rising number of people being forced to self-isolate is impacting other sectors. Car-makers Nissan and Rolls-Royce have both warned that staff shortages could impact production at their plants.\nAround 900 workers at Nissan's Sunderland plant have been sent home after being told to self-isolate. \nRolls-Royce said it may have to halve production if more employees are contacted by the Test and Trace app. \nMr Rowe also said: \"Where the industry will see the pain is in the supply chain, because logistics runs tight anyway to be efficient.\"\nThe union Community, which represents steelworkers across the UK as well as people working in logistics, said rising cases of coronavirus coupled with staff members having to self-isolate, has led to a lack of drivers being able to work. \n\"This is causing disruption in the industry, and reinforces the evidence government has been reckless in its approach to easing restrictions and should reconsider its approach,\" a spokesman for Community said.\nOn Monday, final Covid restrictions will be lifted in England, including the legal requirement to wear a face mask in enclosed spaces. \nOn Friday, the number of daily coronavirus cases reported in the UK surpassed 50,000 for the first time since mid-January. It recorded 54,674 cases on Saturday."

      "text": "Kurt Westergaard, a Danish cartoonist whose caricature of the Prophet Muhammad outraged many Muslims worldwide, has died at the age of 86.\nHe died after a long illness, his family told the Berlingske newspaper on Sunday.\nWestergaard was a cartoonist for the conservative Jyllands-Posten newspaper from the early 1980s.\nHe became world famous in 2005 for his controversial image of the Prophet Muhammad in the newspaper.\nHe was behind the most controversial one of 12 cartoons published by the newspaper to make a point about self-censorship and criticism of Islam. It showed the prophet wearing a turban in the shape of a bomb.\nImages of the Prophet Muhammad are taboo in Islamic tradition and many Muslims considered the cartoons extremely and deliberately offensive.\nThe cartoons led to protests in Denmark and across the Muslim world. Danish embassies were attacked and dozens died in the riots that followed. \nThe publication of the cartoons has left a lasting legacy. In 2015, 12 people were killed in an attack by Islamist militants on the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which had published the cartoons.\nWestergaard also received several death threats and was a target of assassination attempts. He first went into hiding but then decided to live openly in a heavily fortified home. \nIn 2008, Danish authorities charged three people with planning to murder Westergaard. Two years later they caught a man armed with a knife breaking into his home. Mohamed Geele was later convicted of attempted murder and terrorism and was jailed for nine years.\nIn his later years, Westergaard had to live with a bodyguard at secret addresses.\nSpeaking to Reuters news agency in 2008, Westergaard said he had no regrets about his drawing.\nHe said the cartoon had generated \"important\" discussion about the place of Islam in Western countries with secular values.\n\"I would do it the same way (again) because I think that this cartoon crisis in a way is a catalyst which is intensifying the adaptation of Islam,\" he said.\n\"We are discussing the two cultures, the two religions as never before and that is important.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Scotland is to move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for \"some time\".\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant.\nThe move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals.\nHowever, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the return of workers to offices is to be delayed.\nMs Sturgeon said \"sensible precautions\" had to be maintained while the vaccine programme continues.\nShe said she still hoped Scotland could move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions.\nMinisters also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point.\nMs Sturgeon said a decision would be made before the new academic term on whether or not school pupils who are the close contacts of positive cases will have to self-isolate.\nAnd fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as of Monday, as long as they take a test after arrival.\nHowever, the first minister told MSPs that mandatory precautions like the mandatory wearing of face coverings and guidance on ventilation and hand hygiene would remain in place \"for some time\".\nMs Sturgeon added: \"We must stick to a cautious approach. We are easing restrictions next week, but we are not abandoning them.\n\"And even when we move beyond level zero, we will continue to require some baseline measures such as face coverings.\"\nScotland has been hit by a record-breaking third wave of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, with the faster-spreading Delta variant putting pressure on health services.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs - who were recalled for a virtual session despite Holyrood being in recess - that the spike in infections had \"levelled off\", and that the vaccine programme was weakening the link between case number and severe illnesses.\nShe said \"a gradual approach\" to easing restrictions stood the best chance of being sustainable and of minimising loss of life.\nNicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said \"I will always err on the side of going more cautiously\". \nEngland is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. \nBut Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasis restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option \"for good headlines\".\nA statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.\nDespite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned.\nAn obvious point of divergence from England is face coverings.\nWhile laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (they'll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear they'll stay here \"for as long as necessary\". \nIt feels like they'll be one of the last measures to go.\nThe move to level zero means: \nPlans have, however, been modified in light of high case numbers:\nMs Sturgeon said the move was \"not a complete and wholesale lifting of all restrictions\", but it said it \"does restore yet more freedom to all of us\".\nBusiness groups broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers \"moving the goalposts\" at the last minute by altering their plans.\nThe Scottish Retail Consortium said firms \"will be reassured the sense of progress is being maintained, even if the pace has slowed\".\nThe Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant \"should hopefully generate some extra passing trade\", but said there was \"less good news\" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue.\nAnd the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was \"another encouraging milestone\", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be \"a bitter blow for employees and employers alike\".\nThe virtual session of parliament gave opposition politicians the chance to question the first minister about the plans.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said \"we can't continue asking the public to sacrifice so much of their lives\".\nHe said: \"The balance has to tilt further in favour of moving forward - we have to make progress back to normality. The public have done what was expected of them, now it's time for this SNP government to deliver.\"\nLabour's Anas Sarwar said the changes to restrictions were welcome, but said \"inconsistent decision making and communications\" was hitting the response to the pandemic.\nHe said: \"The high rate of cases is a cause for concern and I'm afraid what the first minister has presented today is not a clear strategy to cope with the new phase of the pandemic.\"\nScottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater said she had \"concerns about reducing restrictions while case numbers are so high\", voicing fears that it could lead to a vaccine-resistant variant emerging.\nAnd outgoing Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said changes to self-isolation rules must be made \"urgently\", with \"thousands of key workers\" having to quarantine despite testing negative."

and Secretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart, to highlight the issue.\nMr Hart said he was delighted that people wanted to enjoy the beach, but added: \"It is being spoiled by a selfish few. \n\"Local residents regularly pile up the rubbish and the National Trust is very good about collecting it - one autumn we even cleared away an old trampoline and a dead caravan. \n\"We think there are sufficient laws to deal with it - we've just got to get the evidence and give the police every possible chance of dealing with it.\"\nBut Rebecca Williams, director of conservation with National Trust Cymru, said fines or stricter measures would be \"difficult\" to implement.   \n\"Fines are difficult - it means having people here overnight, putting their safety at risk, so we need to work with the local community to raise awareness of the impact the damage is having,\" she said.    \nNational Trust is also looking for volunteers to act as what they call \"coastodians\" to help look after places like Morfa Bychan with regular beach cleans.   \nMorfa Bychan beach is the latest in a long list of sites across Wales which have seen a rise in vandalism and \"wild\" overnight camping.  \nRichard Owen, from Natural Resources Wales, reminded those enjoying Wales' landscapes this weekend to \"leave no trace\" of their visit and ensure enjoyment outdoors is not done at \"the expense of nature\".\n\"The scenes of abandoned campsites, damaged habitats, verge parking, as well as litter, are totally unacceptable and a blight on Wales' reputation as home to some of the world's greatest landscapes,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, in north west Wales, plans are in place for a busy bank holiday weekend.\nSnowdonia National Park Authority, local councils and North Wales Police, said they had learned lessons after seeing an increase in litter and illegal camping, after restrictions were eased after the first lockdown last year.\nThey said they were \"anticipating a significantly high volume of visitors\" to the area over the bank holiday and urged visitors to respect the rules and not put a strain on resources.\nEmyr Williams, Snowdonia National Park Authority's chief executive, said there would be extra shuttle bus services in Snowdon's Yr Wyddfa and Ogwen areas, temporary and permanent signage and pre-booking at Pen-y-Pass.\n\"We need to remember that Snowdonia is a protected area where people live and work and we also recognise the countless hours the dedicated hard-working team of volunteers give to the area and appreciate their hard work and generosity,\" he said. \nSupt Neil Thomas, of North Wales Police, said when lockdown rules lifted last year, the force saw \"dangerous, irresponsible and illegal parking which posed a risk to public safety\" in many beauty spots, including Ogwen and Pen-y-Pass.\n\"Patrols will continue throughout the bank holiday weekend and we'll continue to work with our partners to ensure the rules are being followed,\" he said.\nHe urged anybody considering visiting areas such as Snowdonia to be responsible and think about where they park.\nMeanwhile, Chris Cousens, RNLI water safety lead in Wales, said they were expecting this summer to be \"the busiest ever\" for lifeguards and volunteer lifeboat crews in Wales.\nHe urged people to \"respect the water, think about their own safety and know what to do in an emergency\" as well as enjoying being on beaches.\nThe RNLI warning to swimmers and coastal walkers follows a survey predicting unprecedented numbers of people on Wales' beaches, with an estimated 30 million visitors expected in the coming months as people opt for 'staycations'.\nIn a survey commissioned by the RNLI, 75% of 16 to 64-year-olds expect to visit a UK beach or the coast between April and September, with around half of that number likely to do so three or more times."

She was later nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and named a Woman of the Year by Glamour magazine.\nMs Abdel Fattah had been in pre-trial detention since being taken into custody amid a wave of arrests back in 2019. \nEgypt's current leader, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent.\nHe has been in power since leading the military's overthrow in 2013 of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi.\nMs Abdel Fattah claimed she had been tortured by security forces while in custody and went on a hunger strike in protest. \nHer arrest and alleged treatment attracted international condemnation.\nA number of other prominent journalists and opposition figures, including activist Gamal el-Gamal and Abdel Nasser Ismail - leader of the Popular Alliance party -  were also freed this weekend. \nHowever the releases come days after US officials voiced fresh concerns after another prominent activist was indicted in Egypt."

      "text": "Iceland and Greene King say they have had to shut shops and pubs due to staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app.\nIceland said that after keeping all of its stores open during lockdown, it has now had to shut some because 1,000 staff have been \"pinged\" by the app. \nChief executive Richard Walker said: \"The great irony is that we're now all getting vaccinated.\"\nGreene King has closed 33 pubs in the past week due to staff self-isolating.\nBoss Nick Mackenzie said the pubs group also had to shorten opening hours at some sites. He added that across the hospitality industry about one in five team members have been affected, \"and therefore it is causing a real issue for us setting up a business on a daily basis\".\nRecent figures showed more than 500,000 people in England and Wales were \"pinged\" by the app in the week to 7 July, up 46% on the previous week. \nPeople who have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 must self-isolate for 10 days.\nBusiness lobby group the CBI has warned that \"crippling staff shortages\" risk hampering an economic recovery. \nVauxhall confirmed on Monday that it has reduced its daily shifts from three to two at its Luton plant \"because of increasing numbers of employees who have been contacted by the app\".\nA spokesman for the carmaker said Vauxhall was about to embark on its yearly three-week shutdown from Friday, 23 July. By the time the Luton plant restarts in August it hopes \"the situation will have improved\".\nOthers in the car industry have also been affected by high levels of staff self-isolating. Nissan and Rolls-Royce have both warned that staff shortages could affect production.\nMeanwhile, a group representing some of the UK's biggest ports said staff shortages caused by people having to self-isolate after being contacted by the NHS app represented \"one of the most significant threats to ports' resilience in recent years\".\nThe UK Major Ports Group (UKMPG), which represents Felixstowe, the Port of Liverpool, Southampton and others, says that absence rates caused by staff self-isolating are at 10% at some ports.\n\"Whilst ports are maintaining all the controls on site that have - so far - kept ports open through the pandemic, we have no control over what happens in the wider world,\" said Tim Morris, chief executive of UKMPG.\nIceland's Mr Walker said that as well closing some stores, the chain has also had to reduce opening hours in some circumstances. \"The concern is that as this thing rises exponentially as we've just been hearing. It could get a lot worse a lot quicker,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\nMr Walker said 4% of Iceland's 30,000-strong workforce was now absent. \"In fact, we've just announced employing an additional 2,000 people on top of that to give us a deeper pool of labour, because so many people are now getting pinged.\"\nThe number of Covid cases in England and Wales surpassed 50,000 on both Friday and Saturday, the highest number since mid-January. On Monday, England lifted final Covid restrictions, including the legal requirement to wear a face covering to prevent the spread of the virus. \nWales is expected to scrap most rules on 7 August though this will not include face masks. Scotland has moved to the lowest level of restrictions of Covid restrictions but face coverings must be worn for a further three weeks. Northern Ireland will decide on Thursday to ease rules on seven days' time. \nPureGym's chief executive, Humphrey Cobbold, said his business had managed to keep all of its sites open despite rising numbers of employees forced to self-isolate, but it had been difficult.\n\"Up to 25%, in some areas, of our staff have been asked to self-isolate,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Through flexibility and sharing of labour across sites, we've been able to keep sites open so far but it's been a very close call in certain circumstances.\"\nKate Lester, founder and chief executive of Diamond Logistics, which runs a UK network of fulfilment and delivery centres, said the company has had to delay opening a new site at Motherwell in Scotland because between 20% and 25% of staff are off work.\n\"We're actually having to delay that launch for over a month which deprives our new network partner of his income and in addition to that it deprives his clients of vital logistics services,\" she said.\nToday is potentially a big day for many businesses. Capacity limits are gone; venues can fill up if they want to. That means many pubs and restaurants, for example, have the chance of turning a profit again. \nBosses have longed for this day since the pandemic began. But they face another growing problem. As infections rise, so too are the number of people told they must self-isolate after coming into contact with a positive case. This is causing a staffing problem for many, many firms. Venues and stores have had to close. Opening hours have been curtailed. \nThere is a clamour from companies, demanding the government immediately change the self-isolation rules to exempt people who have had both Covid-19 vaccines and test negative. The regime is due to be overhauled in a month's time.\nHowever, business leaders fear many more staff will be told to stay at home and therefore businesses will be forced to close at a time when they hoped to making money again.\nThe CBI has called for an immediate end to the 10-day self-isolation period for people who have been fully vaccinated. It also said daily lateral flow tests could help people who have not received both jabs get back to work.\nFrom 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they are \"pinged\" by the NHS app when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible.\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were forced to U-turn on a decision not to self-isolate after coming into contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who tested positive for Covid on Saturday.\nMr Johnson and Mr Sunak had said initially that they would not need to isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing instead. But this sparked a backlash from opposition parties and businesses.\nGreene King's Mr Mackenzie said the government needed to bring the \"test and release\" scheme forward to allow more people to come into work and \"get us back to normal again\"."

      "tags": "Swansea",
      "text": "Mayhill has been brought to the nation's attention due to ugly scenes during a riot and public disorder. \nThursday's disturbances came at a time when recorded crime in the area is at its highest levels since 2018.\nGangs were seen setting fire to cars and rolling them down a hill, in scenes that brought condemnation from the first minister and a promise of robust action from the police.\nBut what is the history of the Swansea area? \nThe disorder in Waun-Wen Road is believed to have started following a vigil to a local person who recently died. \nIt comes at a time when recorded crime in the area is at its highest levels since 2018.\nThe hill above the city has panoramic views of the city, which made it the perfect location for the opening of cult 1990s film Twin Town.\nAfter images of smiling locals and playing children, a theft scene then sees actor Rhys Ifans roaring through the streets in a stolen BMW.\nThe Twin Town car chase was filmed on the cobbled streets of Constitution Hill, which runs up through Mount Pleasant, with Mayhill above.\nWales' tallest building - the Tower at Meridian Quay - is prominent below, while the bay development area continues to grow along the coast.\nThere are also the houses cascading down through Uplands and Brynmill to the cricket ground and Gower on one side, and the Brecon Beacons to the north. \nMayhill has a twin suburb - Townhill - and the two are joined in the same ward.\nIn describing the inception of the area, the South Wales Cottage Exhibition at the city's Glynn Vivian Gallery, stated: \"A hundred years ago, in an age when many of the poorest families lived in cramped, unsuitable slums, Swansea took an innovative approach to the design of affordable rented housing. \n\"The result was the building of a garden city estate on Townhill and Mayhill.\"\nIt is the ninth largest and fourth most densely populated area of Swansea, and has about 8,700 residents.\nThere are a higher number of under-16s living in the area than the Swansea average, according to the ward description.\nOf 8,714 residents, 4,100 are male and 4,614 female, with 3,883 houses occupied.\nMost of the homes were built by the council in the inter-war years, with about 56% of residents renting from the local authority. \nThe entire Townhill ward has been designated a \"Communities First\" area by the Welsh Government, because of long-term social and economic disadvantage. \nAmong community projects is the Phoenix on the Hill, whose mantra is: \"Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.\"\nIt is run by a voluntary board of trustees and has a cafe, nursery and library, while it runs projects for local people.\nAccording to South Wales Police figures, reported crimes in the Townhill area reached a high for the past three years between January and March 2021\nDuring this three-month period, there were 365 crimes recorded, with 30 of these violence and sexual offences. \nThere were also 21 reports of criminal damage and arson, 17 incidents of anti-social behaviour, 14 public order offences, 10 involving drugs and seven robberies. \nThese are the highest figures for a three-month period over three years, dating back to September 2018.\nThe figure beat the 340 reported between April and June 2020.\nFor many generations of teachers, Townhill will be synonymous with the former Training College. \nIt originally opened in the heart of the city as Wales' first teacher-training college with 38 female students in 1872. \nIn 1912, it moved to the Townhill campus where it remained a women's-only college until after World War II. \nThis later became University of Wales Trinity Saint David, which moved courses to the new bay campus in 2018. \nWhen it closed, officials said hundreds of the nation's teachers had trained there and the college had had \"an immeasurable impact on Welsh education\".\nThe Pobl Group is now building 84 affordable houses at the site of the Edwardian building, with head of development Elfed Roberts saying they were being \"designed to make the most of the views\".\nDevelopers had also proposed to transform the empty Swansea Boys' Club into 23 new modern residential flats that would have given panoramic views across the city.\nHowever, this building was set alight last November, with flames lighting the night sky, according to eyewitnesses."

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Children over 12 who are at higher risk of getting ill if they catch Covid will be offered the jab, the vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has confirmed. \nBut the vast majority of children in the UK, who are low risk, will not be offered the vaccine for now. \nHowever, some healthy children over 12 who live with other vulnerable people can have the vaccine, as well as those on the cusp of turning 18. \nIt means, overall, around 370,000 children will be eligible. \nThe UK is in marked contrast with other countries - such as the US and Canada - which have mass vaccinated children aged 12 to 17.\nThe decision is based on recommendations from the UK's vaccines experts - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Ministers in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each then approve the plans.\nThose newly eligible include vulnerable children, aged 12 to 15, with:\nVulnerable 16 and 17-year-olds were already able to get the vaccine. \nThose aged 12 to 17 will also be offered a vaccine if they live with somebody with a weak immune system. \nTeenagers within three months of their 18th birthday will be offered the jab - the aim is to protect people leaving school before they start work or university.  \nMr Zahawi said the NHS had been asked to offer the vaccine as soon as possible and that eligible children would be contacted by the health service. \nThey will all be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine because it is the only one approved for use in children aged 12 to 17 in the UK.\nThe European Medicines Agency says heart inflammation following the vaccine is a very rare side effect which can be treated with rest and anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. \nDo you have any questions about masks, rule changes and vaccinations?\nProf Anthony Harnden, the deputy chairman of the JCVI, said: \"The primary aim of the vaccination programme has always been to prevent hospitalisations and deaths. \n\"Based on the fact that previously well children, if they do get Covid-19, are likely to have a very mild form of the disease, the health benefits of vaccinating them are small.\"\nFewer than 30 children have died with Covid in the UK. \nThe JCVI also says the benefit of vaccinating children to prevent the virus spreading to older age groups is unclear with so many vulnerable adults already fully immunised.\nNor is there good evidence that giving children the vaccine could prevent them getting long Covid, says the JCVI. \nBut Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist Warwick Medical School, said: \"This is a worrying decision at a time when we are now relying on vaccination and personal responsibility, as opposed to mandated restrictions, to get us through the pandemic.  \n\"While infected children mostly get mild symptoms, Covid-19 causes more deaths and hospitalisations in children compared to other viral diseases which have been deemed severe enough to warrant vaccination for example flu.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Leave campaigns spending investigations,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year.\nBut the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times.\nRarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister.\nHis critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10.\nMr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. \nHe left his Downing Street role following an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare.\nIn his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a \u00a340,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between \u00a3140,000 and \u00a3144,999.\nThere was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, the UK's new \"high risk\" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects.\nBut he appears to have a different career path in mind. \nIn February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm, according to Companies House, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. \nBut in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government.\nThe BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg.\nAnd he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal.\nBut he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter.\nHe plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but \"more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc\" will only be available to subscribers who pay \u00a310 a month.\nHe is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that \"slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project\".\nThis new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials.\nIn a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. \nBut he adds: \"It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments.\n\"Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation.\n\"Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules.\" \nThere are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however.\nLittle was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April.\nAfter being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April.\nAs well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make a series of accusations against the PM and questioned his \"competence and integrity\". \nThe following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson \"unfit for the job\", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns.\nHe also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying.\nThis sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations.\nIt thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time since his now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year.\nWhile staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London.\nThis revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel.\nIn an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out \"Do I feel OK driving?\"\nHe also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London.\nAsked why he had given a story that was \"not the 100% truth\" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that \"the way we handled the whole thing was wrong\".\nBoris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis. \nSome said the episode burned through the political capital the prime minister had generated months earlier during the 2019 general election.\nBut it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project.\nThe two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. \nThe combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. \nMr Cummings was credited with formulating the \"take back control\" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history.\nYet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way.\nIt proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a \"Get Brexit Done\" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. \nMany of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them.\n\"Levelling up\" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system.\nThe team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched \"elite\".\nLee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did.\nThere had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style.\nThere were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state.\nNone of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers.\nMr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order.\nBut he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs.\nA longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates.\nHe grabbed headlines when he posted an advert on his personal blog for \"weirdos and misfits with odd skills\" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked \"deep expertise\" in many policy areas.\nMr Cummings is a native of Durham, in the North East of England. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist.\nHe went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects.\nHe is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat is Chillingam Castle, in Northumberland.\nAfter a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him.\nHe played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East.\nIn what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public.\nHe is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world.\nHe re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. \nThe pair would rail against what they called \"the blob\" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. \nHe left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party.\nHe once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as \"thick as mince\" and as \"lazy as a toad\" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a \"career psychopath\". \nHis appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy.\nVote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. \nLike most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides.\nAll that has changed in recent weeks, but it would be a brave person who said he had now joined the ranks of the former Westminster insiders who make their living as pundits - a class he appears to view with as much disdain as he does his former colleagues in government."

      "text": "Lifting all coronavirus restrictions is \"reckless\", Sir Keir Starmer has said, as most legal limits on social contact are eased in England.\nThe legal requirement to wear a mask has ended, but the government says it \"expects and recommends\" the continued wearing of face coverings in crowded areas such as public transport.\nHowever, the Labour leader argued that the measure should stay in place.\nSir Keir also attacked the PM's character saying he \"causes chaos\".\nOn Sunday, the PM said now was the \"right moment\" to remove rules aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus.\nHowever, Boris Johnson urged caution, adding: \"We've got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there - cases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant.\"\nFrom midnight on Sunday the government allowed nightclubs to reopen and lifted limits on social contact.\nSir Keir argued that the prime minister's \"chaotic\" leadership style is \"dangerous\" and has \"deadly consequences for the country\".\nHe said because of Mr Johnson's leadership and mistakes during the pandemic \"people have died, more will do so.\"\nIn addition to maintaining face masks, the Labour leader said guidance advising people to work from home where they can should remain in place and that buildings needed better ventilation.\nby Harry Low at Farringdon station, London\nConfusion was the word on almost everybody's lips in the first rush hour commute since rule changes were introduced.\nAround three quarters of people were wearing masks but although face coverings are mandatory on TfL services, they're not on Thameslink trains which serve the station. \nAs passengers make the short journey across the platform, the advice changes meaning they can either remove or apply their face coverings depending on which direction they are travelling. \nChristopher McCready, who lives in Scotland but works in London, said he would continue wearing a mask despite having contracted the virus a month ago but, like many, he called for greater clarity. \n\"The whole island should be under the same rules,\" he said.\nUK-wide guidance recommending against travel to amber list countries is also being removed.\nAdults who have been fully vaccinated in the UK will not have to self-isolate for 10 days after visiting these countries - with the exception of those returning from France to England, Scotland or Wales, because of concerns over the spread of the Beta variant of the virus.\nIn Scotland, limits on social contact will remain in place and face coverings will still be mandatory, however some restrictions have been eased and pubs will be able to open until midnight.\nRestrictions are set to be relaxed in Wales on 7 August and in Northern Ireland on 26 July.\nAcross the country, coronavirus infections numbers continue to rise with 39,950 cases reported on Monday and more than 50,000 on Saturday.\nA further 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also recorded.\nSome scientists have predicted that UK infections could hit 200,000 a day later in the summer.\nHowever, modelling suggests hospital admissions, serious illness and deaths from Covid-19 will be at a lower level than in previous peaks, due to more than 68% of UK adults being fully vaccinated.\nSpeaking to the House of Commons, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi confirmed that children over 12 who are at higher risk of getting ill if they catch Covid would be offered the jab.\nThe decision was based on recommendations from the UK's vaccines experts - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nHe also said people in roles such as air traffic controllers would not have to self-isolate in order to work if they had received their second vaccination more than two weeks ago.\nMr Zahawi said the individuals would need to self-isolate \"at all other times\" and that those who are eligible for this exemption would receive \"personalised letters setting out the steps they must follow\".\nThe minister also announced that \"by the end of September\" people going to nightclubs or other venues with large crowds would need to prove that they had been fully vaccinated.\nHe said negative test would \"no longer be sufficient\" but there would be exemptions for those with \"genuine medical reasons\" for not being vaccinated.\nSir Keir also used his speech to attack the prime minister for his initial decision to avoid self isolating by taking part in a pilot scheme, which would allow him to continue to go to work while taking daily tests.\nMr Johnson and his Chancellor Rishi Sunak were contacted by NHS Test and Trace after Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive for Covid on Saturday. \nThe two men had been in a meeting with Mr Javid on Friday.\nDowning Street initially said Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak would not have to isolate because they were taking part in the pilot, but this plan was quickly dropped, following criticism from the opposition that it represented \"one rule for them and another for the rest of us\".\nSir Keir accused the prime minister and chancellor of having \"played the system\".\nSpeaking to the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Zahawi denied the government had taken the public for \"fools\", following Mr Johnson's U-turn on self-isolating.\nHe said the prime minister had \"talked about considering\" taking part in the pilot scheme \"then very quickly realised the right thing to do self-isolate because it sends a very powerful message to everyone.\"\nSir Keir also questioned why the prime minister was isolating in Chequers - his country retreat - rather than Downing Street.\n\"You would have thought given the amount of money spent refurbishing Downing Street he would have been happy staying there,\" he said.\nNo 10 has said the prime minister travelled to Chequers immediately after his meeting with Mr Javid and had been there when he was contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\nThe rise in infections has led to concern about the number of people being asked to isolate, with some businesses forced to shut some of their sites due to a lack of staff.\nThe government has said some fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in England will be allowed to continue working if contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\nHowever, the prime minister's spokesman has ruled out modifying the NHS Covid app to ensure it sends fewer isolation alerts."

Australia's two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, are both in lockdown after local cases of Covid-19 were detected.\nThe post has since been wiped from her Instagram.\nOn Monday, the Australian government confirmed it had cancelled her visa, after the TV programme sacked her. \nPolice said she had been fined A$1,000 (\u00a3537; US$737) for not wearing a face mask, and was escorted to the airport to be sent back to the UK.\nHome Affairs Minister Karen Andrews called Ms Hopkins' comments \"appalling\" and a \"slap in the face\" for Australians in lockdown.\n\"Personally, I'm very pleased she'll be leaving,\" she told broadcaster ABC. \nMs Hopkins has not commented on her deportation, but on Sunday said she had been \"joking\" in the video. \nThe controversial commentator was banned from Twitter last year for breaching its policy on hateful conduct. \nMs Hopkins, a favourite of ex-US President Donald Trump, has called migrants \"cockroaches\" and described Islam as \"repugnant\".\nMs Andrews said the decision to allow Ms Hopkins to enter the country had been made by the New South Wales state government \"on the basis of potential benefit to the economy\".\nBut opponents accused the national government of \"allowing a far-right troll into Australia\". Ms Hopkins was also detained in South Africa in 2018 for spreading racial hate.\n\"The decision\u2026 is particularly painful for the 35,000 Australians who remain stranded overseas,\" said Labor MP Andrew Giles.\nAustralia closed its borders in March 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, preventing many citizens outside the country from returning. The policy has prolonged family separations. \nBut dozens of celebrities, sports stars and others with exemptions have been able to bypass the rule."

Confidence is slipping away and we're the ones to suffer.\"\nAnother proprietor, pub owner Julie Spensley, whose son Stephen also owns a bar and a nightclub in Middlesbrough, said it would take up to 10 times longer to admit revellers if they had to show Covid passports.\nShe said: \"Unless it's mandatory, we will not be introducing it.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mrs Spensley, who co-owns the Dickens Inn with her husband Tony, said the advice was \"very unworkable for venues such as late bars and nightclubs\".\nHer son, Stephen Spensley, owns the TS One bar and Spensley's Emporium nightclub, also in Middlesbrough.\n\"Nightclubs and late bars have queues outside and that's the way they operate,\" she said.\nStaff already had to check customers' ID to make sure they were old enough to be let in, so imposing further checks would not be practical, she added.\n\"We've had it tough for the last 16 months,\" she said.\nShe stressed that she wanted people to stay safe, but questioned the wisdom of tighter restrictions on night-time venues when the government was easing the rules on social distancing and mask-wearing.\nPeople in England can do this by requesting an NHS Covid Pass via the NHS website or the NHS app.\nOnce logged in, an NHS Covid Pass can be requested. The system generates a QR code, which lasts for 28 days.\nAn NHS Covid Pass can be obtained two weeks after a second dose of the Covid vaccine, as long as both doses were given in England.\nA pass can be requested if you've had a negative PCR test or lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, which you have reported on the NHS website. These passes last 48 hours after the test result.\nAlternatively, a pass can be given following a positive PCR test result within the last six months, and when self-isolating has finished. The pass lasts for 180 days after the test result.\nPeople who have had both their jabs can also request an NHS Covid Pass letter by calling 119.

They need to think again on their reckless plan before it's too late,\" he said.\nSome scientists are predicting that UK infections - currently at about 50,000 a day - could reach 200,000 a day later in the summer.\nBut with more than 68% of UK adults fully vaccinated, modelling suggests hospital admissions, serious illness and deaths from Covid-19 will be at a lower level than in earlier peaks.\nIn a video posted on Twitter on Sunday afternoon, the prime minister said now was the \"right moment\" to move to the final stage of England's roadmap out of lockdown.\n\"If we don't do it now we've got to ask ourselves, when will we ever do it?\" he said, adding that the virus would have the \"advantage of the cold weather\" in autumn and winter.\n\"But we've got to do it cautiously. We've got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there. Cases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant.\"\nNadhim Zahawi said 90% of the most vulnerable had been vaccinated and it was right for people to take \"personal and corporate responsibility\" over measures such as wearing masks.\n\"We're doing the right thing to get as close to normal as possible, as quickly as possible,\" he told BBC Breakfast, saying that the end of the school term would reduce the spread of the virus.\nHe also said he had received the recommendation from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation about vaccinating children aged 12 to 17 and would make a statement to Parliament on Monday afternoon.\nThe committee has recommended giving the vaccine to children with conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid, children who live with someone vulnerable and those who are close to turning 18, he said.\nAs restrictions ease in England, businesses such as nightclubs - and large events - will be encouraged to use the NHS Covid Pass to check people are fully vaccinated, have natural immunity from infection or have a recent negative test. \nAt Fibre in Leeds, owner Terry George said several customers were unvaccinated or had only had one jab so far. He added the government had not provided the tools to scan for vaccination status.\nWhile some clubgoers said they were a little nervous, most were overjoyed. \"It's been literally the best night of our lives.

No-one wanted to talk about rising cases of coronavirus or the risks - they just wanted to dance. And for the first time in 16 months they could.\nUK-wide guidance recommending against travel to amber list countries is also being removed. Adults who have been fully vaccinated in the UK will not have to self-isolate for 10 days after visiting these countries - with the exception of those returning from France to England, Scotland or Wales, because of concerns over the spread of the Beta variant of the virus.\nAs the legal requirement for masks ended, signs at Manchester Piccadilly station urged travellers to continue wearing them, but several people declined.\nMark Dawson, on his way to Scunthorpe for work, said: \"I'll do what the government tells me to do but if they say I don't have to, I won't.\" \nTransport for London said it was seeing 85% of passengers wearing masks across its network and there had been no surge in commuters returning to the office.\nby Harry Low at Farringdon station\nConfusion was the word on almost everybody's lips in the first rush hour commute since rule changes were introduced. \nAround three quarters of people were wearing masks but although face coverings are mandatory on TfL services, they're not on Thameslink trains which serve the station. \nAs passengers make the short journey across the platform, the advice changes meaning they can either remove or apply their face coverings depending on which direction they are travelling. \nChristopher McCready, who lives in Scotland but works in London, said he would continue wearing a mask despite having contracted the virus a month ago but, like many, he called for greater clarity. \n\"The whole island should be under the same rules,\" he said.\nAccording to a survey by the Office for National Statistics, almost two-thirds of adults across Great Britain intend to continue wearing masks in shops and on public transport, following England's lifting of legal restrictions.\nScotland also eased restrictions on Monday - with pubs and restaurants able to open until midnight. However, limits on group meetings will remain, the return of workers to offices will be delayed, and face coverings will still be mandatory.\nRestrictions are set to be relaxed in Wales on 7 August and in Northern Ireland on 26 July.\nMeanwhile, the surge in infections - with 48,161 cases reported on Sunday and more than 50,000 on Saturday - has raised concerns about health impacts and the number of people self-isolating.\nContact tracing and self-isolation requirements remain in place.\nSupermarket Iceland and pub company Greene King are the latest businesses to shut some of their sites because too many staff had received alerts to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app for England and Wales.\nRecent figures show that more than half a million alerts were sent out in the first week of July, while absences from school have also surged.\nSome fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in England will be allowed to continue working if contacted by NHS Test and Trace, the government has said, amid concerns over employee shortages.\nAn announcement by the health secretary on Saturday that he had tested positive for coronavirus sent Mr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak into self-isolation.\nNo 10 initially said they would not have to isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing - sparking a backlash from opposition parties and businesses affected by staff quarantining.\nOn Monday, Mr Zahawi said Downing Street and the Cabinet Office would no longer be part of the pilot scheme.\nBut he said he was \"very much briefed\" that Transport for London, Network Rail and Heathrow had been part of the pilot, despite TfL saying they had been waiting to hear more about it from the government."

      "text": "Iceland and Greene King say they have had to shut shops and pubs due to staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app.\nIceland said that after keeping all of its stores open during lockdown, it has now had to shut some because 1,000 staff have been \"pinged\" by the app. \nChief executive Richard Walker said: \"The great irony is that we're now all getting vaccinated.\"\nGreene King has closed 33 pubs in the past week due to staff self-isolating.\nBoss Nick Mackenzie said the pubs group also had to shorten opening hours at some sites. He added that across the hospitality industry about one in five team members have been affected, \"and therefore it is causing a real issue for us setting up a business on a daily basis\".\nRecent figures showed more than 500,000 people in England and Wales were \"pinged\" by the app in the week to 7 July, up 46% on the previous week. \nPeople who have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 must self-isolate for 10 days.\nBusiness lobby group the CBI has warned that \"crippling staff shortages\" risk hampering an economic recovery. \nVauxhall confirmed on Monday that it has reduced its daily shifts from three to two at its Luton plant \"because of increasing numbers of employees who have been contacted by the app\".\nA spokesman for the carmaker said Vauxhall was about to embark on its yearly three-week shutdown from Friday, 23 July. By the time the Luton plant restarts in August it hopes \"the situation will have improved\".\nOthers in the car industry have also been affected by high levels of staff self-isolating. Nissan and Rolls-Royce have both warned that staff shortages could affect production.\nMeanwhile, a group representing some of the UK's biggest ports said staff shortages caused by people having to self-isolate after being contacted by the NHS app represented \"one of the most significant threats to ports' resilience in recent years\".\nThe UK Major Ports Group (UKMPG), which represents Felixstowe, the Port of Liverpool, Southampton and others, says that absence rates caused by staff self-isolating are at 10% at some ports.\n\"Whilst ports are maintaining all the controls on site that have - so far - kept ports open through the pandemic, we have no control over what happens in the wider world,\" said Tim Morris, chief executive of UKMPG.\nIceland's Mr Walker said that as well closing some stores, the chain has also had to reduce opening hours in some circumstances. \"The concern is that as this thing rises exponentially as we've just been hearing. It could get a lot worse a lot quicker,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\nMr Walker said 4% of Iceland's 30,000-strong workforce was now absent. \"In fact, we've just announced employing an additional 2,000 people on top of that to give us a deeper pool of labour, because so many people are now getting pinged.\"\nThe number of Covid cases in England and Wales surpassed 50,000 on both Friday and Saturday, the highest number since mid-January. On Monday, England lifted final Covid restrictions, including the legal requirement to wear a face covering to prevent the spread of the virus. \nWales is expected to scrap most rules on 7 August though this will not include face masks. Scotland has moved to the lowest level of restrictions of Covid restrictions but face coverings must be worn for a further three weeks. Northern Ireland will decide on Thursday to ease rules on seven days' time. \nPureGym's chief executive, Humphrey Cobbold, said his business had managed to keep all of its sites open despite rising numbers of employees forced to self-isolate, but it had been difficult.\n\"Up to 25%, in some areas, of our staff have been asked to self-isolate,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Through flexibility and sharing of labour across sites, we've been able to keep sites open so far but it's been a very close call in certain circumstances.\"\nKate Lester, founder and chief executive of Diamond Logistics, which runs a UK network of fulfilment and delivery centres, said the company has had to delay opening a new site at Motherwell in Scotland because between 20% and 25% of staff are off work.\n\"We're actually having to delay that launch for over a month which deprives our new network partner of his income and in addition to that it deprives his clients of vital logistics services,\" she said.\nToday is potentially a big day for many businesses. Capacity limits are gone; venues can fill up if they want to. That means many pubs and restaurants, for example, have the chance of turning a profit again. \nBosses have longed for this day since the pandemic began. But they face another growing problem. As infections rise, so too are the number of people told they must self-isolate after coming into contact with a positive case. This is causing a staffing problem for many, many firms. Venues and stores have had to close. Opening hours have been curtailed. \nThere is a clamour from companies, demanding the government immediately change the self-isolation rules to exempt people who have had both Covid-19 vaccines and test negative. The regime is due to be overhauled in a month's time.\nHowever, business leaders fear many more staff will be told to stay at home and therefore businesses will be forced to close at a time when they hoped to making money again.\nThe CBI has called for an immediate end to the 10-day self-isolation period for people who have been fully vaccinated. It also said daily lateral flow tests could help people who have not received both jabs get back to work.\nFrom 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they are \"pinged\" by the NHS app when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible.\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were forced to U-turn on a decision not to self-isolate after coming into contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who tested positive for Covid on Saturday.\nMr Johnson and Mr Sunak had said initially that they would not need to isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing instead. But this sparked a backlash from opposition parties and businesses.\nGreene King's Mr Mackenzie said the government needed to bring the \"test and release\" scheme forward to allow more people to come into work and \"get us back to normal again\"."

But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing.\n\"As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission.\"\nMr Lord said the industry had been taken by surprise by the latest announcement. \n\"I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I am deeply concerned by the discriminatory nature for those who either can't have the vaccine for medical reasons or age, or who do not want to,\" he said.\n\"With this one move, the Government appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation.\"\nHe added: \"How will nightclubs now compete against pubs and bars down the road where these restrictions aren't needed, or attract punters who can just as easily have a house party without these enforcements in place.\n\"I have been in the nightlife and events industry for over 25 years, but I cannot see any reason why anyone would now want to enter this sector with such financially damaging restrictions in place.\"\nEarlier, he told BBC Breakfast hospitality businesses remain \"on a cliff edge\" \nHe said over the last 18 months businesses had seen how the government \"has really not understood\" their needs and how they operate.\nHe added: \"The ten o'clock curfew is a perfect example, pushing hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets at exactly the same time. That did far worse than good.\n\"We saw ridiculous substantial meal rules - the Scotch egg rule.\n\"I took them to the High Court to compel them to drop that, which saved many businesses and jobs across the whole of the UK. \n\"So time and time again, we have seen so many mistakes.\"\n A government spokesperson said: \"We appreciate the significant impact the pandemic has had on the hospitality industry - including the night-time economy.\n\"[This] is why, on top of our unprecedented \u00a3352bn package of business support, just last week we launched our hospitality strategy to help the sector recover as well as boost resilience long-term.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures",
      "text": "Scotland has moved to the lowest level of Covid restrictions as it continues on its roadmap out of lockdown. \nUntil now only some islands had been in level zero but the rest of the country was in level one or level two. \nThe move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals.\nHowever, some  limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for \"some time\".\nUnder the level zero rules up to eight adults from four households can meet indoors at home, and up to 10 can meet in a pub or restaurant - with no need to pre-book a two-hour slot.\nUp to 15 people from 15 households can meet outdoors and up to 200 can attend weddings and funerals.\nLast week, the rules planned for level zero were modified due to the spread of the more contagious Delta variant.\nIn light of high case numbers, hospitality venues will be required to close at midnight and some physical distancing will have to be maintained outdoors, with different groups of 15 required to stay at least 1m (3ft 3in) apart in public spaces - meaning there may be limits on some outdoor events.\nA \"gradual\" return to office working has now been put back to 9 August.\nNew rules for travellers also come into force. Fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries (except France) will not need to quarantine, so long as they take a PCR test after arrival.\nDeputy chief medical officer Dr David Caesar said there were \"encouraging\" signs that infection rates had passed their peak in Scotland.\n\"We're in a slightly different phase of the pandemic than even some of our closest neighbours in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,\" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland.\n\"The data would suggest that numbers are coming down. The seven-day average is the one that we try and keep our closest eye on... We're obviously cautious, but it's looking like it's heading towards the right direction.\"\nOn Sunday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said talk of \"freedom day\" as it has been dubbed in England, where restrictions will also ease on Monday, was \"not sensible\" given the high daily numbers.\nMs Sturgeon tweeted: \"Cases in Scotland are falling, but still too high.\n\"To talk of tomorrow as 'freedom day' (England only remember) is not sensible IMO, given current situation.\n\"Vaccines going well and do offer route through - but as we vaccinate, we must ease up gradually.\"\nShe added: \"If you live in or visiting Scotland please abide by remaining safety measures.\"\nThe Scottish government has said it hopes Scotland can move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions.\nMinisters also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point.\nOn Sunday, official figures showed 1,735 new cases of Covid had been reported in Scotland in the previous 24 hours, with 9.8% of tests coming back positive. \nHospital numbers fell for a third consecutive day - there were 511 patients who had recently tested positive on Saturday with 46 of them receiving intensive care. \nNo new deaths of people with recent positive tests were recorded, but the government noted register offices are generally closed at weekends.\nScotland still has the highest level of Covid cases in the UK, according to sampling by the ONS - but the number of daily cases appears to be on a downward trend while south of the border it has been rising rapidly. \nThe UK went into lockdown on 23 March 2020. Over the summer, this was eased as the number of cases, hospital admissions and deaths dropped - and some of our freedoms returned. \nBut when cases started to creep back up again in pockets of the country, new restrictions were introduced at the start of the autumn. \nIn October the Scottish government published details of its new five-level alert system which came into force on Monday 2 November.\nJust before Christmas, it was announced that a new more contagious Covid variant - dubbed the Kent strain, though now known as the Alpha variant - was causing concern. \nIt came with warning all of Scotland would have to go into the top level of Covid restrictions on Boxing Day - and that level four restrictions may need to be made even tougher to contain its spread. \nIt was not until April that the mainland moved down to level three.\nIn May, mainland Scotland - with the exception of Glasgow and Moray - dropped down to level two, with most islands going into level one. The following month other areas also dropped down to level one, and many islands moved to level zero. \nBut 13 areas - with a combined population of 2.3million in the central belt - remained in level two due to high case numbers.\nThe whole country was due to move to level zero on 28 June but that was delayed due to the prevalence of a strain first identified in India, now known as the Delta variant.\nAlmost a third of younger adults are unvaccinated in Scotland, despite all over-18s having been offered a first dose appointment. Are you aged between 18 and 29 and have not had, or do not intend to have, a jab? What is your reason for not taking part in the programme?

      "text": "A former sub-postmaster from Pembrokeshire who was caught up in the Horizon Post Office scandal has had his conviction for false accounting overturned.\nTim Brentnall, from Roch, was prosecuted in 2010 after a \u00a322,000 shortfall was discovered at his branch.\nHe is one of 736 former Post Office managers prosecuted due to the flawed Horizon computer system.\nMr Brentnall said it had taken 16 years of stress to clear his name.\nMr Brentnall was 22 when he and his parents bought the shop and the plan was for him to have an income to help him stay in the area where he grew up.\nIn 2009, auditors arrived on behalf of the Post Office and found there was a discrepancy at his branch.\n\"I was immediately suspended and within a few days taken to Haverfordwest police station for interviews,\" he said.\n\"It was horrific. I felt totally alone and helpless.\"\nEven though Mr Brentnall knew he had not taken any money, he and his family were desperate to make up for the missing funds.\nHis parents took out a loan to pay the alleged debt, but he was prosecuted for false accounting shortly afterwards. \nLike many others in his position, he was advised to plead guilty and was given an 18-month suspended sentence, plus 200 hours of community service.\nMr Brentnall said it was impossible to find work, and he knew people were judging him.    \n\"I didn't want to go to the village pub because people were talking and saying: 'He says he hasn't done anything, but he's pleaded guilty, so there's no smoke without fire'.\n\"I lost sleep for a number of years, lost friendships, and all because people didn't believe what I was saying.\" \nHis father StJohn Brentnall said: \"The stigma of a conviction and the character assassination that Tim has had to bear for the last 10 years, it has been horrible to see him lose his self-confidence.\n\"But he stood it, he got through it and we feel very proud of him.\"  \nTwo years after his prosecution, Mr Brentnall learned he was not alone and had fallen victim to the Horizon computer system that was installed by the Post Office in 2001.\nFlaws in that system made it look as though money was going missing from Post Office branches.\nBetween 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters based on information from the flawed computer system, which wrongly showed shortfalls in sub-postmasters' accounts.   \nMr Brentnall is the latest in a long line of former sub-postmasters to have their convictions overturned in what is already the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history.  \nHis was one of 31 cases being heard in the Court of Appeal on Monday, and was one of 10 people who were told the Post Office would not be contesting the appeal.\nMany are still waiting to hear if they will receive compensation and an independent inquiry looking into the scandal was recently given extra powers.\nMr Brentnall said: \"I can stand with my head held high again and say to everyone I was right - I haven't done anything wrong and it was this system that the Post Office forced on people.\n\"There's still a fight to try to hold the people who did this to account.\n\"There are people who've known what was going on but tried to sweep it under the carpet. I don't want to rest until people have been brought to account.\n\"I feel relieved and vindicated. I can hold my head high now and know that I didn't do anything wrong\u2026 but I also feel angry that this could have happened.\""

      "text": "Scotland will follow England's example and lift its working from home guidance. \nPeople across the rest of the UK are still advised to work remotely wherever possible. \nFrom Monday 31 January, the government will no longer recommend home working wherever possible.\nInstead, employers are being asked to let workers return gradually. It wants workers to spend some time in the office and some time at home. \nA wholesale \"mass return\" to offices next week could risk pushing up infection levels, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on 19 January, Boris Johnson said that the government was no longer asking staff to work from home.\nHe said people \"should now speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office\". \nThe government had reintroduced its guidance to work remotely when it tightened Covid regulations on 8 December to help tackle the spread of Omicron. \nHowever, that guidance did also say that people should continue travelling to work if they needed \"to access equipment necessary for their role, or where their role must be completed in person\".  \nEmployers were also told to consider letting people come to work if they had a \"challenging home working environment\".\nIn Northern Ireland, ministers said that more people working from home would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they didn't tell employers to impose home working, but instead asked them to support it \"where possible\".\nIn Wales, employers are also encouraged to let people work from home where possible. Guidance says staff should not be \"required or placed under pressure to return\" to the workplace unless there's a clear business need. Employers could be fined up to \u00a310,000 for failing to allow staff to work from home where it is \"reasonably practicable to do so\".\nFrom 28 January, the requirement to work from home moves from law to guidance. \nLatest figures suggest that 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home in 2020, up from 27% the previous year.\nIn the last week of November 2021, seven in 10 travelled to work at least once. \nIn the same week, one in seven said they had been working at home and travelling to work.\nAlthough social distancing limits no longer apply across most UK workplaces businesses still have a legal duty to manage the risks to staff and customers. \nEmployers must follow official safety guidance and carry out Covid risk assessments for those staff who are in the office. \nSafety measures can include:\nFace-coverings remain mandatory for staff and customers in shops and on public transport across the UK, apart from England, where they will cease to be required in any public space on 27 January. \nRegular lateral flow testing remains widespread across the NHS and other parts of the public and private sector.\nNorthern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have already introduced Covid passport schemes which are partly designed to protect staff who work in hospitality and events. \nHowever, England will scrap its mandatory Covid certification scheme from Thursday 27 January, although venues will be able to keep checking customers' status on a voluntary basis if they wish. \nThere is more detailed advice for some industries - including construction, hospitality and manufacturing, plus specific advice for employers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIf employees feel unsafe, they can raise concerns with their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). \nWorking from home is one of the most effective ways to reduce social exposure, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nIt greatly limits face-to-face contact both with colleagues and on public transport.\nAs such, Sage says it has a \"strong impact\" against virus transmission and the R number, which represents a disease's ability to spread.\nMuch of the risk depends on how crowded it is and your distance from other people.\nWearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "text": "A lack of information about disabled access at some of Wales' tourism destinations is a \"restriction on freedom\", says a campaign group. \nDisability Wales said some locations were seen as no-go areas for wheelchair users and people with mobility issues.\nThe problem has been highlighted by one partially paralysed woman, who is attempting to navigate the Wales Coastal Path.\nAmanda Harris has started working with path teams to identify improvements.\nThe 47-year-old was badly injured in a cycling accident seven years ago.\nShe has become determined to complete the 870-mile (1,400km) coastal challenge, using a wheelchair, trike, and crutches when necessary.\n\"A few years ago, after my injury I thought perhaps I wouldn't be able to get out and explore these places,\" said Ms Harris, who lives in Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nHer injury means she can only walk for short distances and she uses a wheelchair.\n\"It is all about improving information. There is a lack of information at the moment,\" she said.\n\"I've been relying on people to tell me what's accessible and what's not. \n\"And that's quite hard because I don't know if it's accessible for me. \n\"Every mobility problem is different, so what someone sees is accessible might not be to me. \n\"So, it's about getting that information out there so people can see what the terrain is like and make a decision for themselves.\"\nMiranda Evans, policy and programmes manager at Disability Wales, said the issue \"takes away disabled people's freedom\". \n\"There needs to be a solution that doesn't restrict disabled people's access, because it also affects parents, carers and other family members,\" she said.\n\"On certain beauty spots, and along the coastal path, disabled people might have to turn around and go home because they can't progress on their routes. \n\"It destroys the experience and knocks people's confidence, and they're not likely to venture that far afield again because it's very restrictive.\"\nThe campaign group said it wanted better information online \"at our fingertips\".\nTricia Cottnam is the officer for the south Wales section of the coastal path which covers the route between Gower in the west and Chepstow in the east.\n\"What we are trying to do is get as many people as possible to use the path,\" she said.\n\"There are going to be limitations because of its very nature.\"\nOpened in 2012, the path became the first in the world to stretch the length of entire nation's coast from the Dee estuary in Flintshire, to the Severn estuary in Monmouthshire.\n\"You will come across rocky surfaces on cliffs, steep gradients and sand dunes but that's the nature and the beauty of the coast path,\" said Ms Cottnam.\n\"But there are small changes we can make, where we can explain about the gradients, explain about the type of surface there might be, what type of gates or stiles are on parts of the path, so people can decide whether to make that journey or not. \n\"And it's all about description and not prescription. It can't be one size fits all. We must be flexible.\"\nFor Ms Harris, a former patient at Cardiff's Rookwood Hospital, the challenge of the path is proving harder than she expected.\nShe has completed 50 miles so far (80km), and has been raising money for Horatio's Garden, which creates gardens in NHS spinal injury centres, and the Rookwood Spur charity.\nThe money will provide a tranquil space for spinal injury patients at Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan, which is where the new Welsh Spinal Cord Rehabilitation Centre is being located, to replace facilities at the Rookwood site.  \n\"There's already areas which I think could be improved such as access alongside stiles and dropped curbs in some places, and I've already fed that information back to Wales Coast Path,\" said Ms Harris.\n\"I know certain areas in the Gower, Pembrokeshire, Ll\u0177n Peninsula, aren't going to be accessible for me but I have a team of helpers who will do these parts I can't do. \n\"It's going to be a great journey.\n\"I'm loving that I'm finding places that are accessible and getting that information out there and improving the situation for a lot of people.\""

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The prime minister and chancellor are now self-isolating after contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who has tested positive for coronavirus.\nNo 10 initially said they would not have to isolate, as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing instead.\nBut opposition parties said it suggested there was \"one rule for them and another for the rest of us\".\nThe PM later said they had \"briefly\" considered taking part in the scheme.\nIt comes ahead of the lifting of lockdown rules in England from Monday.\nAlmost all legal restrictions are to end, including limits on how many people can meet, and nightclubs will reopen, but self-isolation rules will remain. \nFollowing news that Mr Javid had tested positive and been in contact with Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, No 10 said a workplace pilot scheme would allow them to keep working from Downing Street.\nBut the announcement met with an angry response, with Labour's Jonathan Ashworth saying it was unfair politicians appeared to have access to \"VIP testing\" to avoid self-isolation, while Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey asked if it was only available to the \"privileged few\".\nSpeaking in a video on Twitter after the U-turn, Mr Johnson said: \"We did look briefly at the idea of us taking part in the pilot scheme, which allows people to test daily, but I think it's far more important that everybody sticks to the same rules and that's why I'm going to be self-isolating until Monday 26 July.\n\"I know how frustrating it all is, but I really do urge everybody to stick with the programme and take the appropriate course of action when you're asked to do so by NHS Test and Trace.\" \nThe prime minister also defended the lifting of restrictions - amid ongoing rises in cases, deaths and hospitalisations - but urged people to be cautious.\nHe said: \"We've got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there. Cases are rising. We can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant, but we have this immense consolation and satisfaction that there is no doubt at all that the vaccine programme has very severely weakened the link between infection and hospitalisation and between infection and serious illness and death.\"\nMr Johnson will now conduct meetings remotely from Chequers, the prime minister's countryside retreat, where he was when the health secretary received his positive test result.\nMr Sunak said on Twitter: \"Whilst the test and trace pilot is fairly restrictive, allowing only essential government business, I recognise that even the sense that the rules aren't the same for everyone is wrong.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has written to the prime minister, demanding he answer how he and the chancellor were included in the workplace programme. \nAmong 10 questions, he also asked when the PM travelled to his country residence of Chequers from Downing Street, how many other ministers were covered by the workplace pilot and for a figure on how many members of the public have now deleted the NHS app.\nSir Keir wrote: \"Today's latest fiasco of yourself and the chancellor being magically selected for a testing trial so you could avoid isolation like the rest of us is just the latest example of the Conservatives fixing the rules to benefit themselves, and only backtracking when they were found out.\" \nThe managing director of the Iceland supermarket chain, Richard Walker, also criticised the proposal for Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak to avoid self-isolation.\n\"Shame the hundreds of Iceland staff who've been pinged can't avoid self-isolation. We can all do a daily lateral flow test,\" he said.\nMr Javid tested positive on Saturday morning after a meeting at Downing Street the day before, and both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak were contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\nSpeaking to the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi denied the government had taken the public for \"fools\", following Mr Johnson's u-turn on self-isolating.\nHe said the prime minister had \"talked about considering\" taking part in the pilot scheme \"then very quickly realised the right thing to do self-isolate because it sends a very powerful message to everyone.\"\nThis must be one of the fastest government U-turns ever: 157 minutes after saying the PM and chancellor wouldn't be isolating, Downing Street decided they would. \nThe reason is set out by Rishi Sunak on Twitter - ministers can't be seen to be following different rules to everyone else.\nBut questions will be asked about why No 10 initially said they would be escaping isolation. Who made the decision? Who signed it off? The prime minister and chancellor must have known about the plan. \nThere's also the fact that the PM and chancellor had the choice over whether to isolate - which most people don't at the moment.\nThe political symbolism is also highly significant. Three senior government ministers will be in isolation on the day almost all legal restrictions are lifted in England.\nThe government said there were 20 public and private sector organisations involved in the pilot scheme, including Network Rail, Transport for London (TfL), Heathrow Airport and Border Force.\nHeathrow said the programme had been an \"important tool\" that allowed it to keep the airport open, and was now calling on ministers to extend it beyond the end of July, when it is due to end.  \nBut TfL said it was \"still waiting for formal notification that we are part of this trial\". One London Underground line was forced to close on Saturday because too many staff had to self-isolate.\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick had defended the programme on the Andrew Marr Show, describing it as \"well known\" and \"long standing\".\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair added it would have been reasonable for Mr Johnson not to self-isolate, given he has been vaccinated twice, was previously infected, and is being tested regularly. \nHe said: \"I don't want the prime minister of the country to be in isolation at the moment. I need him, you know, at his desk doing his job.\"\nThe UK recorded a further 48,161 cases and 25 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Sunday. On both Friday and Saturday daily cases exceeded 50,000 - the first time this level has been reached since mid-January.  \nMore than half a million alerts telling people to self-isolate were sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the first week of July, with supermarkets saying they may have to cut opening hours or shut shops due to a lack of staff.\nAbsences from school have also surged, with 840,000 pupils self-isolating in the first week of July.\nMr Jenrick said self-isolation was \"an important part of keeping the virus under control\", adding that a study had showed the NHS Covid app had prevented 600,000 infections and 8,000 deaths.\nHowever, he said the government was ending self-isolation in England for entire school bubbles on Monday and from 16 August fully vaccinated people will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive.\nMike Cherry, national chairman of The Federation of Small Businesses, said the government should now urgently review whether it should bring forward the changes to self-isolation.\n\"It could expand the pilot scheme that ministers currently enjoy to those at the front line of the economy,\" he said.\nMr Javid is the latest in a series of government figures to test positive during the pandemic, including his predecessor Matt Hancock and Mr Johnson.\nThe health secretary said on Twitter that he had felt \"a bit groggy\" on Friday and took a rapid lateral flow test the following morning, which was later confirmed with a PCR test.\nIn addition to the meeting at Downing Street, Mr Javid had been working from his office at the Department of Health and Social Care in Whitehall last week and was in the Commons chamber three times.\nHe is also known to have visited a care home in south London on Tuesday. Aashna House in Streatham has a 100% vaccination rate among staff and residents, however."

      "tags": "Israel,Cyber-attacks,Phone Hacking",
      "text": "Rights activists, journalists and lawyers around the world have been targeted with phone malware sold to authoritarian governments by an Israeli surveillance firm, media reports say.\nThey are on a list of some 50,000 phone numbers of people believed to be of interest to clients of the company, NSO Group, leaked to major news outlets.\nIt was not clear where the list came from - or how many phones had actually been hacked.\nNSO denies any wrongdoing.\nIt says the software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists and is made available only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human rights records.\nIt said the original investigation which led to the reports, by Paris-based NGO Forbidden Stories and the human rights group Amnesty International, was \"full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories\".\nBut it added that it would \"continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action\".\nThe allegations about use of the software, known as Pegasus, were carried on Sunday by the Washington Post, the Guardian, Le Monde and 14 other media organisations around the world.\nPegasus infects iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras. \nMedia outlets working on the investigation said they had identified more than 1,000 people spanning over 50 countries whose numbers were on the list. \nThey include politicians and heads of state, business executives, activists, and several Arab royal family members. More than 180 journalists were also found to be on the list, from organisations including CNN, the New York Times and Al Jazeera.\nMany of the numbers were clustered in 10 countries: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to the reports. \nWhen contacted by the outlets involved in the investigation, spokespeople for these countries either denied that Pegasus was used or denied that they had abused their powers of surveillance.\nIt was not clear how many of the devices on the list had actually been targeted, but forensic analysis of 37 of the phones showed there had been \"attempted and successful\" hacks, the Washington Post reported.\nThis included people close to Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in October 2018 while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. His body was then dismembered. \nThe investigation found that spyware was installed on his fianc\u00e9e's phone days after his murder, and that his wife's phone was targeted with spyware between September 2017 and April 2018. \nThe NSO Group said its technology was \"not associated in any way with the heinous murder\".\nThe phone of Mexican journalist Cecilio Pineda Birto also appeared twice on the list, including in the month before he was murdered, the investigation found. \nHis phone disappeared from the scene of the murder so a forensic examination was not possible. NSO said that even if his phone was targeted, that did not mean that data collected was connected with his murder. \nThe phones of two Hungarian investigative journalists, Andras Szabo and Szabolcs Panyi, were found to have been successfully infected with the spyware.\nMr Panyi told Forbidden stories that learning of the hack was \"devastating\".\n\"There are some people in this country who consider a regular journalist as dangerous as someone suspected of terrorism,\" he said.\nThe Hungarian government was \"not aware of any alleged data collection\", a spokesperson told the Guardian. \nIn India, more than 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and two ministers in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government were reported to be on the list. \nThis included the  key opposition figure Rahul Gandhi, with two mobile phone numbers belonging to him found in the list. Mr Gandhi no longer has the devices so it was not possible to analyse them to determine if he had been hacked.\nIndia's government has denied using unauthorised surveillance. \nMore details about who has been targeted are expected to be released in the coming days.\nWhatsApp sued NSO in 2019, alleging the company was behind cyber-attacks on 1,400 mobile phones involving Pegasus. At the time, NSO denied any wrongdoing, but the company has been banned from using WhatsApp.\nThe allegations here are not new. What is new is the scale of the targeting of innocent people that's allegedly taking place. Nearly 200 reporters from 21 countries have their phone numbers on this list, and more names of high-profile public figures are expected to be revealed.\nThere are plenty of unknowns in these allegations - including where the list comes from and how many of the phone numbers were actively targeted with spyware. NSO Group has once again come out swinging and denies all accusations. However, it's a blow for the company, which is actively trying to reform its reputation.\nOnly two weeks ago it released its first \"transparency report\" detailing human right policies and pledges. Amnesty International brushed the 32-page document off as a \"sales brochure\".\nThese latest allegations will do further damage to its image, but they won't hurt the company financially. There are very few private companies able to produce the sort of invasive spy tools that NSO sells, and clearly the largely unregulated market for the software is booming."

The fire brigade said the capital Vienna saw more rainfall in an hour on Saturday night than in the previous seven weeks. \nIn the Upper Bavaria region, one person was killed as heavy rains deluged basements and roads.\nMeanwhile in western Germany, authorities said the Steinbachtal dam, south-west of Bonn, remained at risk of breaching after residents were evacuated from homes downstream.\nEuropean leaders have blamed climate change for the floods, which have also affected Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.\nExperts say global warming makes torrential rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began.\nMrs Merkel said the world had to \"be faster in the battle against climate change\".\nShe walked through the badly-hit village of Schuld, surveying the damage and speaking to residents and emergency workers.\nLater she pledged to fast-track aid for reconstruction.\n\"We are by your side,\" she said, describing the situation as \"terrifying\".\n\"It is shocking - I can almost say that the German language doesn't have words for the destruction that's been wreaked,\" she said.\n\"What I could see, however, is also incredibly comforting - how people are sticking together, how they are helping each other, the solidarity that is there.\"\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz said a package of \u20ac300m ($354m; \u00a3257m) in immediate aid would be proposed at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.\nThe scale of the damage is becoming clear, as rescue crews continue to look for victims.\nAt least 157 people are now known to have died in the floods in Germany, including four firefighters. Some 31 people have died in Belgium.\nThe states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland have been the worst affected in Germany.\nThousands of people were reported missing during the height of the floods, but many have since been accounted for.\nIn the spa town of Bad Neuenahr in Rhineland-Palatinate's Ahrweiler district, residents were determined to begin the clean-up operation, scraping mud from the streets and clearing piles of debris.\nBut the task is huge, with many businesses and livelihoods in the town swept away, electricity and gas still cut off and communication lines destroyed. \n\"Everything is completely destroyed, you don't recognise the scenery,\" wine shop owner Michael Lang told Reuters.\nBaker Gregor Degen told AFP news agency he had gathered a group of neighbours to start clearing away mud and debris.\nHe had been ready to go to work the day after the floods but water levels were too high, he said. More than 110 people have been killed and 670 injured in Ahrweiler, police say.\nMeanwhile a senior German politician has been criticised for laughing during a visit to affected areas.\nArmin Laschet, who is the conservative candidate to replace Mrs Merkel when she steps down later this year, was caught on camera apparently joking with colleagues as President Frank-Walter Steinmeier was expressing sympathy to victims.\nMr Laschet later tweeted (in German) that he regretted his behaviour, but commentators and politicians were quick to condemn him.\n\"Laschet laughs while the country cries,\" Bild newspaper said on its website.\n Are you affected by the flooding?

      "text": "There are fears a beauty spot could be left covered in litter if \"wild\" camping and illegal overnight parking increase with lockdown restrictions being eased.\nIn Porth Ysgaden, Gwynedd, there were reports of human waste left on paths and toilets emptied into the sea last year after people parked up overnight.\nOne wild camper said most of them left no trace and cleaned up after others. \nHowever, some living nearby fear the situation could get worse this summer.\nChris Brady of Tudweiliog Community Council said he feared the area could be inundated with \"wild\" campers and people parking illegally overnight as more people opt to holiday in the UK because of Covid-19.\n\"We don't mind them coming here to enjoy the views, but some of the campers have no respect at all and I think the situation will get worse this summer,\" he said. \nIn Wales and England you only have the right to camp on land belonging to someone else if you have the permission of the landowner.\nIf you do so without permission you are committing trespass - a civil offence which you cannot be arrested for. But if you don't leave immediately when asked to do so by the landowner - or somebody acting on their behalf - you may be committing the criminal offence of aggravated trespass.\nScotland is different, as most unenclosed land is legal to camp on.\nIn Wales, there is a code of conduct for campers to follow which is based on a principle of \"leave no trace\", with campers urged to bury toilet waste away from water sources, pick up litter and leave if asked to.\nBut there have been concerns about a growing number of so-called \"fly campers\" or \"dirty campers\" - where people leave behind their camping gear - including tents, chairs and barbecues after staying illegally in the outdoors.\nCouncillor Seimon Glyn said that while most people with campervans stayed on nominated sites, some preferred the wild.\n\"We often find evidence of people leaving human waste on paths and the contents from portable toilets being poured into the sea,\" he said.\n\"That concerns us - not only from an environmental point of view, but also because of health and safety.\" \nGwynedd council is putting up more signs in the area, warning people not to camp overnight, but Mr Glyn said they were \"already being ignored\".\n\"This isn't an issue that is unique to Porth Ysgadan, all across Wales other beauty spots are facing similar problems,\" he said.\nA number of councils told Newyddion S4C they had recorded an increase in wild camping last year and the programme has seen footage of people \"wild\" camping at Padarn Park in Llanberis, Snowdonia, despite clear signs asking people not to stay overnight.\u00a0 \nOne wild camper said most campers were respectful, leaving no trace, and even cleaning up after others. \n\"We only want to spend as much time in nature as possible, I think as long as we care for the environment we are in and leave it in a better state than we found it, what's the harm?\n\"As with any land, if we are asked to move by the landowner we would do so without hesitation.\"\nThe British Mountaineering Council said the vast majority of visitors were keen not to harm the environment and said it had launched a new tool kit to try and help people to leave no trace and camp in the most sustainable way.\nGwynedd Council said it employed a specialist security team \"to shut the car park gates every evening and to deal with any cases of wild camping\". \nIn Pembrokeshire, the council has introduced early morning patrols, issuing fines of up to \u00a370 to tackle the rise in illegal overnight parking.\nMarc Owen, Pembrokeshire's streetcare and parking manager, said it was \"a big issue in 2020\" with littering, waste disposal and throw-away barbecues causing problems.\n\"We live in a beautiful county. This year so far it hasn't been so bad - but it is early in the season,\" he said.\n\"It is adding extra pressures and extra tension within communities. We need to make sure that people who come down to Pembrokeshire protect, preserve and respect the area.\"\nPhoebe Smith is a wild camper and author and said the scenes did not reflect the values of wild campers.\nShe said: \"If you are a true wild camper, no-one should even know you've done it, you would take out all your rubbish with you, which includes toilet waste, and the only thing that would be left behind would maybe be an indentation on the grass of your tent.\n\"The images we're seeing is not wild camping it's fly camping.\"\nShe added that because of the ongoing pandemic and lockdown restrictions, a lot of people who do not understand how to wild camp properly are taking to it as they have not been able to go to campsites and that people should be encouraged to continue, but in the correct way.\nShe said: \"In order to make people care about the natural world and to protect it, you have to do something to make them fall in love with it, which means making it very accessible especially inner city kids.\"\nShe added that in some parks in England, it was legal and because of that \"local children are taught from a young age how to do it responsibly, which means that it's not just completely covered with litter and people aren't doing it incorrectly\"."

      "text": "The Met Office has issued one of its new-style extreme heat weather warnings for the first time for parts of the UK.\nThe amber warning covers large parts of Wales, all of south-west England and parts of southern and central England. \nIt will be in place until Thursday, when temperatures are expected to peak.\nIt warns of the potential impact of the heat on people's health, as the UK experiences a prolonged period of sweltering conditions. \nAll four UK nations recorded the hottest day of the year over the weekend, and forecasters warned temperatures would continue to climb and could reach 33C (91.4F) in some western areas.\nSteven Ramsdale, from the Met Office, said: \"The high temperatures are going to continue through a large part of this week. \n\"Many areas will continue to reach heatwave thresholds but the amber extreme heat warning focuses on western areas where the most unusually high temperatures are likely to persist.\"\nThe UK's highest temperature of the year so far was recorded on Sunday at Heathrow, where it reached 31.6C (88.9F), while on the same day Wales hit a high of 30.2C (86.4F) in Cardiff.\nOn Saturday, Northern Ireland saw its hottest day since records began with 31.2C (88.1F) in Ballywatticock, County Down, while Scotland reached 28.2C (82.8F) in Threave, in Dumfries and Galloway.\nThe Met Office launched its new extreme heat warning at the start of June 2021 to highlight potential widespread disruption and adverse health effects.\nIt comes after a record-breaking number of heatwave deaths were recorded in England last summer.\nThe Met Office warning advises that people vulnerable to extreme heat are likely to experience \"adverse health effects\", while the rest of the population could suffer heat exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses.\nIt also warns that more people are likely to visit coastal areas, lakes and rivers leading to an \"increased risk of water safety incidents\".\nSix people drowned in English lakes and rivers over the weekend, with rescuers warning of the invisible but deadly dangers of open water.\nChloe Brimicombe, a PhD heatwaves researcher at the University of Reading, said there were likely to be increased hospital admissions over the next few days due to heat stress - which is a build up of body heat as conditions prevent people from cooling down - and other heat-related health issues.\nShe said: \"Vulnerable people do die. Outdoor workers can get long-term kidney disease. We can also see a rise in air pollution, which affects people's lungs.\"\nHeatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions."

We've waited a long time.\n\"People ask if you have to wear a mask in the shop and they have been very good. Obviously not everybody abides by it but most people do.\"\nShe said she would not be challenging people who did not wear coverings. \"Not from this weekend,\" she explained.\n\"If they walk in with a mask, I'm very pleased. If they don't we stand back.\"\nShe did not expect much to change with the relaxation of the rules in England.\n\"People realise the rules are not the same but on the whole they are very good,\" added Diane.\n\"They're out to enjoy themselves and that's it. People are appreciating Wales and we're glad to serve them.\"\nOver on the beach, Sarah was visiting with her friend Sharon from Rhuddlan.\n\"I just came back from London yesterday and it was heaving,\" said Sarah.\n\"People weren't wearing masks. I think we're more protected in Wales because it's not as densely populated.\nShe said even if rules were to be relaxed in Wales, she would still wear one in places like supermarkets.\n\"I think it's a gradual process. It's difficult to imagine that one day you have to protect yourself and the next day it's total freedom.\n\"With the numbers still increasing you've just got to be wary, haven't you?\"\nTracey Rush had come for a trip from her home in Wrexham, on the border with England.\n\"I actually work in a hospital and I'm very used to wearing a mask,\" she said.\n\"We went away a few weeks ago and a lot of English people were not wearing masks at all.\n\"It's a problem going forward I think, that we're going to have to have Welsh and English rules being so different.\"\nWhatever the the rules will end up as in Wales, she thinks she will continue to wear her mask.\n\"I work in a place where there's high-risk people so [I'll wear it] to protect myself and to protect any spread from where I work,\" said Tracey, adding she was expecting to have to wear a mask in work for at least 12 months more."

      "text": "Supermarkets have warned they will have to cut opening hours or even shut shops if the number of workers forced to self-isolate continues to rise.\nM&S said the number of workers being notified by the NHS app is rising exponentially, and it may have to reduce hours if there are shortages.\nA leading supermarket, which declined to be named, said it could lead to massive disruption of food supplies.\n\"And there's a risk that there won't be sufficient staff to open shops.\"\nLast week, over 500,000 alerts were sent to users of the NHS Test and Trace app in England and Wales for the week to 7 July, a rise of 46% on the previous week. \nM&S chief executive Steve Rowe told The Times that the number of people being forced to self-isolate is \"a major issue across every industry at the moment\". \nHe said: \"Our Covid cases are roughly doubling every week and the pinging level is about three to one of Covid cases, so we're seeing that growing exponentially.\"\nHe said: \"If there's shortages we'll have to manage it by changing hours of stores, reducing hours.\"\nFrom 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they are \"pinged\" by the NHS app when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid.  They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible.\nBut another UK supermarket warned: \"The clock is ticking and the government needs to act fast to get people back to work if they have a negative test.\n\"If not, we could be heading towards crisis point next month.\"\nA spokeswoman for Morrisons said: \"As per the whole of the UK, we are experiencing a rise in cases and close contact notifications.\"\nBut she added: \"We provide guidance and support for colleagues who may need to self-isolate including sick pay and have Covid secure controls in place in all our stores to ensure we can continue to operate and keep them open. Throughout the whole of the pandemic, we have not been required to close a store.\"\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents the industry, said that the government must bring forward the changes on self-isolation from 16 August \"so that people who are fully vaccinated or have a negative test are not forced to needlessly quarantine\" when they are contacted by the app.\nBRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said: \"We are already seeing a serious impact on retail operations as a result of staff having to self-isolate and this will only get worse right across the economy, as cases are already rising fast and the final restrictions are eased.\"\nLord Karan Bilimoria, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said that amid \"crippling staff shortages, speed is of the essence\".\nHe called for an immediate end to \"the self-isolation period of 10 days for people who are double-jabbed\" and \"a route out of isolation for those not yet fully vaccinated through daily lateral flow tests\".\nIt comes as both the prime minister and the chancellor u-turned on a decision not to self-isolate after coming into contact with health Secretary Sajid Javid, who announced on Saturday that he had tested positive for Covid.   \nBoris Johnson and Rishi Sunak initially said they planned to keep working on essential government business under a pilot scheme that involves daily testing.\nHowever, it prompted a backlash by opposition parties as well as the managing director of the retailer Iceland, Richard Walker, who tweeted: \"Shame the hundreds of Iceland staff who've been pinged can't avoid self-isolation. We can all do a daily lateral flow test.\"\nThe rising number of people being forced to self-isolate is impacting other sectors. Car-makers Nissan and Rolls-Royce have both warned that staff shortages could impact production at their plants.\nAround 900 workers at Nissan's Sunderland plant have been sent home after being told to self-isolate. \nRolls-Royce said it may have to halve production if more employees are contacted by the Test and Trace app. \nMr Rowe also said: \"Where the industry will see the pain is in the supply chain, because logistics runs tight anyway to be efficient.\"\nThe union Community, which represents steelworkers across the UK as well as people working in logistics, said rising cases of coronavirus coupled with staff members having to self-isolate, has led to a lack of drivers being able to work. \n\"This is causing disruption in the industry, and reinforces the evidence government has been reckless in its approach to easing restrictions and should reconsider its approach,\" a spokesman for Community said.\nOn Monday, final Covid restrictions will be lifted in England, including the legal requirement to wear a face mask in enclosed spaces. \nOn Friday, the number of daily coronavirus cases reported in the UK surpassed 50,000 for the first time since mid-January. It recorded 54,674 cases on Saturday."

      "text": "There are calls to respect beauty spots as the weather gets hotter and Covid restrictions are eased in Wales.\nNatural Resource Wales (NRW) has urged sun-worshippers and beauty seekers to respect local communities ahead of an expected arrival of visitors over the next few weeks during the summer break.\nParking, littering and vandalism were all reported as problems for popular areas last year.\nNRW said patrols would be increased but individuals must \"behave responsibly\".\nOn Saturday, some restrictions were lifted in Wales, meaning people no longer have to socially distance outside. \nFrom 7 August, more rules will be removed - including the end to most other social distancing and the requirement to wear mask inside pubs and restaurants.\nNRW said its sites had already seen a significant increase in visitors since lockdown began to be eased in March.\nBut while the majority of visitors left no trace behind, many sites had been \"bearing the brunt\" of some who \"show little to no regard or respect for the areas they have come to enjoy\", it said.\nThat included forests being used as \"makeshift car parks and campsites\" and the scattering of litter and other waste.\nNRW said it would be working with the police and \"will not hesitate to take enforcement action\" to prevent a repeat of last summer.\nRichard Owen, team leader for estate recreation planning and land stewardship, said: \"While we are delighted to welcome people back to our sites... we must maintain a balance between the wishes of individuals to enjoy the outdoors and the responsibilities each and every one of us has to protect nature and to respect our local communities.\"\nA continuing problem for some sites is mess left behind by people camping, barbecuing and lighting bonfires.\nNRW said one of the most prevalent issues it experienced in the Welsh countryside was the impact of wildfires and fly camping - where people pitch tents or park campervans without the landowner's permission and do not clean up after themselves.\nLast summer in Porth Ysgaden, Gwynedd, there were reports that human waste was dumped into the sea.\nNRW is urging people to follow the Countryside Code, including parking responsibly, planning ahead to avoid crowds and cleaning up after themselves.\nEmma Edwards-Jones is projects manager at Snowdonia-Active - a non-profit consultancy for outdoor activities and conservation.\nShe said people needed to take personal responsibility when outdoors and to plan thoroughly for activities.\nThe majority of people were being responsible and doing it right, she said, \"but there are some who haven't ventured into the outdoors before and for example, are buying a paddleboard in the morning then heading straight out onto the water in the afternoon\".\n\"Unfortunately, some haven't got the understanding that it isn't a playground and they don't know how to take care of themselves, others and the environment they have come to enjoy.\n\"For some who have not done a lot outdoors they don't always know what to expect and they're surprised by rural environments with limited access to facilities such as toilets and parking - there is a real lack of understanding of how to behave.\"\nShe said personal safety was not just about themselves but reducing the strain on emergency services and respecting the environment.\n\"We ask people to ask themselves three questions before they set off: do I know what the weather will be like? do I have the right gear? do I have the right skills?\n\"Personal safety and responsibility for the environment come hand in hand - a lot of people work hard to care for our landscapes and we want to work with visitors so that everyone can enjoy the coast and countryside of Wales,\" she said.\nLesley Jones, chief executive of Keep Wales Tidy, said it was essential rivers, beaches, parks and green spaces were kept clean and safe for everyone to enjoy. \n\"We saw a devastating increase in litter at iconic beauty spots when restrictions eased last summer and none of us want to see the same thing happen again this year.\n\"Litter attracts more litter. Just one piece becomes just two pieces, until the tens and the hundreds of pieces are a real and growing danger to wildlife and to our own health and well-being and it is no longer possible for these areas to be enjoyed,\" she said."

      "tags": "Nightclubs,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People attending nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather in England will need to be fully vaccinated from the end of September, the government says. \nLatest figures show 35% of 18 to 30-year-olds have not had their first jab. \nCurrently nightclubs and other crowded venues are only encouraged to ask clubbers to show proof of vaccination, a negative test result or immunity.\nBut Boris Johnson said he was concerned by the continuing risk of transmission.\nThe announcement came on the day nightclubs in England were allowed to reopen after 16 months of closure. \nThe prime minister told a press conference on Monday: \"I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere. But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing.\n\"As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission.\n\"And I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over 18s have had their chance to be double jabbed we're planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather.\"\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said nightclubs and other such venues could be \"potential super spreading events\" because of crowds in close contact.\n\"I would expect that with opening of nightclubs, we'll continue to see an increase in cases, and we will see outbreaks related to specific nightclubs as well,\" he said.\nHow have you been affected by issues covered in this story?\nNightclubs are still closed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe Welsh government said it would never mandate the use of vaccination certificates but that businesses would be free to ask for them.\nAcross the UK, 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIt's easy to understand how a loud and busy nightclub could be the perfect stomping ground for Covid. \nHaving lots of people packed closely together, snogging, singing and shouting in a confined space with relatively poor ventilation creates ideal conditions for a virus carried in our spit to spread. \nAdd in the fact that many of those attending may not have had two or even one dose of a vaccine that helps protect against catching and transmitting the virus, and you could have a super-spreading event on your hands. \nThe Netherlands recently tried reopening its clubs and quickly decided to close them again amid rising infection rates. Its government said most of the new infections occurred in nightlife settings and parties with large numbers of people. \nFor now, it is asking its citizens to use their common sense and act responsibly; keeping gatherings small and manageable. Time will tell if the UK might go the same way. \nMany nightclubs have shut down during the pandemic and the industry reacted angrily to the prime minister's announcement.\n\"So, 'freedom day' for nightclubs lasted around 17 hours then,\" said Michael Kill, boss of the Night Time Industries Association. \n\"Leaving aside the fact that this is yet another chaotic U-turn that will leave nightclubs who have been planning for reopening for months having to make more changes to the way they operate - this is still a bad idea. \n\"80% of nightclubs have said they do not want to implement Covid passports, worrying about difficulties with enforcing the system and a reduction in spontaneous consumers, as well as being put at a competitive disadvantage with pubs and bars that aren't subject to the same restrictions and yet provide similar environments.\"\nBoss of UK Hospitality Kate Nicholls called the announcement \"a hammer blow\" for a struggling industry trying to rebuild. \nOne major nightclub firm, Rekom UK, which owns 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, and Fiction, said clubs had become a political football. \nBoss Peter Marks said: \"Mandatory Covid passports may make sense one day once the entire adult population has been offered vaccines, but does government really think this threat will entice the 'vaccine wary' to take the vaccine? They will just stay later in the pubs and hold their parties in their houses.\"\nMark Harper MP, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative backbenchers, also criticised the plans, saying the government was \"effectively moving to compulsory vaccination.\"\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, he called on the government to bring forward the evidence for the policy in September ahead of any vote, saying he didn't think the evidence from pilot schemes supported the idea. \nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi MP promised to share the evidence with the Commons, \"working with the nightclub industry or at-risk large scale events that are indoors\"."

      "text": "Scotland's social distancing regulations are being reviewed following a row with cross-border rail operators, the first minister has said.\nNicola Sturgeon said lawyers would see whether \"clarification or tightening\" of the 1m rule was necessary.\nOn Monday London North Eastern Railway (LNER) told customers it was operating \"under English guidance\" as the measure had been lifted down south.\nTransport Scotland criticised the firm for issuing \"inaccurate advice\".\nOperator Avanti West Coast also refused to enforce the 1m rule on its cross-border services, and will instead make announcements about changes in restrictions as trains enter Scotland.\nCurrently people in Scotland should stay 1m from each other in public places - but the rule has been lifted in England.\nScottish legislation states that anyone providing a service in a level zero area take measures to ensure that \"as far as reasonably practicable\", that a 1m distance is maintained.\nDuring a Covid briefing on Tuesday, the first minister said she had seen commentary suggesting trains may not be included in the law because they were not classified as \"premises\".\nShe said: \"I've just asked our lawyers to look at that to see whether there is any clarification or tightening required.\n\"But the intention is clear. I would expect companies operating in Scotland to follow the law in Scotland and follow the guidance in place in Scotland, even if it is not contained in statute.\"\nHours after saying it would not enforce Scottish regulations, LNER changed its position saying it was \"reviewing its approach\" on Anglo-Scottish services. \nIt said it would provide an update in due course.\nA spokesperson for the firm said: \"The safety of our customers and colleagues remains our top priority. We are continuing to provide an enhanced cleaning programme onboard our trains and at our stations as well as reminding customers to wear a face mask, unless exempt. \n\"We are also using our reservation system to prevent overcrowding and our website to continue to inform customers which are our least busy and busier services.\"\nThe first minister thanked the firm for \"making clear\" it would follow Scottish guidance.\nThe BBC understands that Avanti West Coast will make announcements on trains leaving Carlisle, advising people of Scotland's social distancing rules to give them a chance to move seats.\nThe firm has encouraged passengers to travel at quieter times.\nMeanwhile, operator ScotRail said \"physical distancing can't be guaranteed\" in stations or on trains and asks people to \"take personal responsibility\". \nTransport Scotland earlier said the \"law was clear\" and that rail operators had to take steps to ensure social distancing was \"reasonably practicable\" in level zero areas.\nA spokesman said: \"It is our expectation that operators providing a public transport service in Scotland to comply with the law as far as is reasonably practical and inform passengers using their services.\"Transport Scotland officials received assurance from LNER on Friday that their messages to customers would be changed to reflect and respect Scottish government law and guidance. It is not acceptable that LNER has continued to issue inaccurate advice.\"\nScotland has moved to the lowest level of Covid restrictions, while England has lifted most legal restrictions.\nThe move means more people in Scotland will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals but there are some \"modifications\".\nIn public places, one-metre physical distancing remains for people from different households.\nSome limits on outdoor meetings are also being maintained and the mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for \"some time\"."

The judge said the killings were \"particularly sadistic\" and he doubted Pitchfork would ever be released.\nHowever, the Parole Board said last month that he was suitable for release.\nThis led to a challenge by Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, but this was refused by a judge-led review.\nPitchfork is being kept in prison until final arrangements, such as where he is going to be housed, are completed.\nWhen he is freed, he will have regular meetings with his probation officer, which is standard for those released on licence.\nPitchfork's additional conditions include measures to protect his victims' families from unwanted contact with him.\nLike all prisoners released on licence, he can be recalled to prison if he breaches his conditions.\nAt the time the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland's challenge was refused, Dawn's uncle Philip Musson said: \"It sends the message that child rapists, killers, murderers can at some point in time resume their lives when they themselves have deprived their victims of their lives. \n\"That's an unacceptable position as far as I'm concerned.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "Children aged 12 to 15 are to be offered a second dose of the Covid vaccine.\nIt's in response to concerns about the newly identified Omicron variant.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises the UK governments on vaccines - has said that 12 to 15-year-olds should be offered a second jab - to be given at least 12 weeks after the first.\nIt's one of of a number of measures the JCVI say should be carried out, in case the Omicron variant spreads more easily or is more severe than current types of Covid.\nChildren aged 16 and 17 are already being offered a second dose.\nEngland and Scotland have already said they will act on the JCVI's advice, and it is likely to be accepted in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nNo. When vaccination for 12-15s was first rolled out, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said it would be as an \"offer\".\nHe said young people and their parents needed to be supported, and there should be no stigma attached to their choice.\nHealthy children aged 12 to 17 are advised to wait 12 weeks after testing positive for coronavirus before having their Covid jab.\nA four-week gap applies to children who are deemed at higher risk because of underlying health conditions, or because they live with vulnerable adults.\nAlthough parental consent is being sought, children under 16 who can prove they understand the risks and benefits can ask for the vaccine - or refuse it - if they disagree with their parents.\nThis important legal test of whether a child can consent to treatment is known as \"Gillick competence\". It is named after a famous dispute in which a teenager wanted contraceptive advice without her mother's consent.\nIn practice, it would be extremely unusual for a child under 13 to be judged Gillick-competent.\nTeenagers aged 16 and 17 don't need parental permission, unless there are exceptional circumstances. \nUnder-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine has also been authorised for use in children in the UK.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for under-12s in the UK. \nThe MHRA - which regulates medicines in the UK - said today that despite initial concerns about side-effects in under-18s, monitoring and a \"thorough review\" had found the jab to be safe, with \"no new safety issues\". \nEarlier in the year, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were linked to extremely rare cases of heart inflammation in young men. However, the EMA said that the benefits of vaccination still far outweighed the risks. \nAlmost all children and young people are at very low risk from Covid-19. \nData for England suggests about 25 children died from Covid in the first 12 months of the pandemic. \nThe majority of them also had severe health problems, including complex neurodisabilities. \nOnly six had no recorded health conditions. \nIn the year to 31 August 2021, Public Health England statistics suggest there were about 50 deaths among under-19s.\nMany countries are vaccinating children over the age of 12.\nCorrection 21 September 2021: An earlier version of this article wrongly implied that the Gillick competence test was named after a case involving a mother and daughter and this line has been amended."

England ended most of its remaining restrictions on Monday, while Scotland also eased some curbs as it moved to level zero.\nSome restrictions were lifted in Wales on Saturday, bringing an end to social-distancing outside. In Northern Ireland, a new Covid-19 certificate app is being prepared for launch next week amid a \"final push\" to get younger people vaccinated.\nThe number of daily Covid cases is often lower at the beginning of the week due to reporting delays and a \"weekend effect\". \nThe number of patients admitted to hospital with Covid in the last seven days was 39.5% higher than the previous week, government data showed, with 4,317 admissions over the latest period.\nThe number of deaths in the last seven days was 48% higher than the previous week, with 296 recorded."

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Everyone knows Dominic Cummings's name, and usually not for flattering reasons.\nHaving covered politics for nearly 20 years, it is at the heart of my job to get to know senior figures in all the political parties, and advisers in government and in opposition. \nBut I have never known a backroom figure who has caused such rage, or who has enjoyed stirring up his opponents quite as much.\nIt's no secret that he has fallen out with Boris Johnson in spectacular style. It's hard to think of a bust-up and betrayal that's been as vicious and sustained. \nMr Cummings has written thousands of words about what he sees as Mr Johnson's flaws already. \nHe gave seven hours of brutally unrelenting evidence to MPs about the many things that he believes went wrong during the government's handling of the pandemic. \nThe former aide is an important witness to recent history but has his own agenda, and has been accused of trying to rewrite that history to give himself a more flattering role.  \nMr Cummings has never before though agreed to sit down and account for his own role in the pandemic, and also be questioned about his own efforts helping Mr Johnson in office, securing a Brexit deal and a huge election victory, or his time as boss of the Vote Leave campaign.\nIndeed, the first time that he promised he would do an interview, one day, was after the referendum in 2016, when we asked if he would answer questions about how he ran that campaign, how it behaved, and how it won. \nIn the five years that followed so much has happened that has changed the UK. \nCummings's detractors would say he is responsible for much of the political trauma. He became a household name because of the public outrage at his journey out of lockdown. \nNo-one was closer to the prime minister in government for more than a year. \nAside from Mr Johnson himself, perhaps no one else's decisions and judgements counted as much over a crucial period.\nArguably, no one other political campaigner's view of the world made such a difference to the country in recent times.\nAnd certainly, no one other political adviser has inspired such venom, attracted such conspiracy theories, and launched thousands of memes. \nThere are many people in the Conservative Party who believe his credibility is shot because of how he has explicitly tried to attack Mr Johnson in recent months.\nMPs have already expressed frustration that, in their view, he hasn't provided overwhelming evidence of the explosive claims he's already made.\nGiven his own reputation for provocation and playing with reality as a campaigner, it's not unreasonable to wonder if he can be believed now.\nHis arguments at times can seem contradictory, even though it feels like he has clear scripts in his head that he wants to follow. \nMr Cummings styles himself as someone who only wants to do what he thinks is the right thing, whatever it takes, and doesn't care very much what anyone else thinks. \nDespite his normal sartorial choices - crumpled shirts, beanie hats and tracksuit bottoms while in No 10 - he cared enough when we sat down this month to wear a new shirt for our interview, fresh with creases from the packet. \nHe arrived wearing a baseball cap along with his face mask, to avoid being spotted, and pages of scrawled notes in preparation. \nAnd rather than slink off into infamy, five years after he first said he would talk, we sat down and spoke for hours with the cameras rolling.\nThe interview might make you want to throw rocks at the TV. He might provoke you, in the way that winding his opponents up became his political trademark. His picture of what went on in Downing Street might alarm you too. \nBut his claims are very much his version of events.\nThey might help you understand more, for better or worse, what has really gone in in the last few years and what his extraordinary fallout with Mr Johnson was really about.  \nWhatever you think of Dominic Cummings, when big things happened, he was in the room.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Long Covid,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Self-isolation,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nearly all remaining Covid restrictions are coming to an end. But with infection rates and hospital admissions already rising sharply, it is a significant gamble.\nOne expert likens what is being done to taking the \"control rods out of a nuclear reactor\".\n\"This is going to make things worse than they are now and we don't know when it will peak,\" says Loughborough University data analyst Dr Duncan Robertson.\nAnd that in many ways goes to the heart of the issue. \nThis is our first \"natural wave\" of Covid - all the others have been brought to an end through lockdown and restrictions. The plan is for this one to exhaust itself. So predicting what will happen is much more difficult. \nThe move has been given the personal backing of chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and a number of the scientists advising him. Infection rates were always going to rise at this stage of the roadmap - more mixing means it is easier for the virus to spread.\nBut with significant levels of immunity from vaccination and natural infection the hope is spread of the virus will be brought under control in the coming weeks.\nSome have suggested the government should wait longer before taking this step. But infections are already rising so that will not halt the rise.\nAnd, according to Prof Whitty, were we to wait any longer, there is a risk the peak of infections this summer wave could be pushed to the autumn, which could make things worse with flu and other viruses circulating.\nBut that does not mean government scientists do not have concerns. Behind the scenes, they have been questioning the policy on face masks, in particular, after ministers made big play of the fact mask-wearing would no longer be legally required. Not because it will dramatically alter the course of rising infections, but because of the message it sent out - that controlling infection no longer mattered.\nThis has led to a definite change of approach with ministers now stressing the need to keep wearing masks in crowded indoor places. \nThe reason is clear from the results of the latest modelling to be released. It looked at the impact of people returning almost immediately to normal behaviour, and compared it with a gradual resumption over months.\nThe results estimated the gradual approach could halve the summer peak and avoid what is called an overshoot - whereby the surge in cases means greater numbers become infected than need be, before this summer wave peaks. The modelling shows this is much more important in reducing the peak than simply delaying the lifting of restrictions.\nIt is why Prof Whitty has also referred to the importance of the public \"going slowly\" in the way they embrace new freedoms.\nProf Matt Keeling, a modeller at the University of Warwick, has gone even further. \"If there is one message - the public is going to control the trajectory we are on,\" he said.\nBut this is just one of many unknowns, which explains the huge range around the central estimate that hospital admissions will peak this summer at 1,000 to 2,000 a day. (The winter wave just gone hit 4,000 in comparison.)\nAnd if this does happen, it will come at a significant cost. While the vaccination programme has reduced the number of Covid deaths 10-fold, there could still be 100 to 200 deaths a day. About half of those are expected to be in unvaccinated people. It will also cause major disruption to the NHS. To put those summer figures into context, hospitals would expect to see about 1,000 admissions a day in the depths of winter, for all types of respiratory infections. \nWill 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire?\n\"We would get through it as we have before,\" says Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. \"But it would be at the expense of elective care and other treatments.\"\nAnother consequence will be more people struggling with long Covid either because it takes them time to recover after being hospitalised or from persistent symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, which for a small minority appear to happen after milder illness. \nBut, in the end, unless restrictions are re-introduced, this wave is only likely to come to an end when the wall of immunity - from vaccination and natural infection - is high enough. And when that happens, England could find itself in the very strong position, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, hinted  last week. He said we were reaching the level of immunity where \"big waves\" may be in the past.\nThis does not mean herd immunity - given how infectious the Delta variant is and the changing nature of the virus, many experts now question whether this will be possible. Covid, they believe, is going to be around forever.\nInstead, scientists expect some sort of equilibrium will be reached, whereby the R number, the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, will fluctuate around one.\nThis will see more manageable waves ebb and flow. And with vaccines offering good protection against serious illness, society will be more willing to tolerate the burden. \nAfter all, in the most recent bad winter - 2017-18 - there were 300 to 400 flu deaths a day at the peak, more than is being predicted for this summer's Covid peak.\nWill we get there in the coming months? It is, one of the key government modellers told me, really too close to call.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick\nAre you still shielding and are concerned that restrictions are lifting in England?

      "tags": "Home education,Homeschooling,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of children registering for home education in the UK rose by 75% in the first eight months of the current school year, according to BBC research.\nIn north-west England numbers were 92% up on the previous two-year average, figures from 153 councils show.\nSome parents and councils - including in former hotspot Bolton - say the increase is down to \"Covid anxiety\".\nThe Department for Education says it supports home-educating parents and plans to launch a registration system. \nCoronavirus lockdowns meant that school buildings were closed to most pupils from the end of March to September last year. \nBut increasing numbers of parents have switched to home-educating their children, removing them from the school register and notifying the local council.\nMore than 40,000 pupils were formally taken out of school in the UK between September 2020 and April 2021, compared with an average of 23,000 over the previous two years.\nAs of January 2021, there were 8.9 million pupils attending school in England, including state and independent schools.\nIn June, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said he was \"absolutely committed\" to a register of home-educated children, and said its introduction was \"imminent\".\nParents told the BBC that health fears and worries that their children's learning would suffer had led them to home-educating.\nNovena-Chanel officially took her son, Imari, out of school in November last year. Mother to a new baby, she was worried Imari wasn't thriving in class.\n\"He was starting to regress. They were doing phonics and he can read already,\" she said. \"The school said they couldn't give him higher-level work.\"\nImari is now thriving academically, she says, and she has no concerns about him being cut off from other children.\n\"With a long-term home-school plan, the concern is usually the social element. But these home-educated children have to learn to be among other people - they meet teenagers in the community, and can talk to anyone.\"  \nIn Surrey, Victoria also removed her child from school for health concerns - yet she describes herself as a \"reluctant\" home-schooler.\n\"We feel we've been forced into this situation because of the pandemic,\" she says. \"I think what made us extra cautious was his asthma - he had a couple of hospital stays from the common cough.\" \nVictoria says her son, Edward, didn't play with another child between February 2020 and June 2021 due to the family's concerns over catching the virus. \nShe says the amount of educational material now available online means home-educating hasn't been too difficult, but that her \"heart isn't in it\" for the longer term.\nThe risks of Covid-19 for children attending school are \"very much lower than for adults,\" says Russell Viner, professor in adolescent health at University College London.\n\"Children can bring infection back into the family home - and parents who are clinically extremely vulnerable may be understandably nervous about this risk, although it would be exceptionally rare for this to require children not to attend school.\n\"There can be reasons that parents choose not to send their children to school. However, the science doesn't support a role for Covid-19 in this decision.\" \nNaomi, from Kent, says the pandemic \"accelerated the decision\" to remove daughter Bella, now nine, from school in early March 2020.\n\"We were nervous about taking that massive leap because it was the unknown,\" she said. \"Covid gave us a push, but that's not why we did it.\"\nNaomi says that Bella, who is awaiting a formal autism diagnosis, was struggling in school but thrived once at home.\n\"We wouldn't [otherwise] have had that break in school. I felt duty-bound to send her in, but because she wasn't there, you could see how happy she was.\"\nFor Howard, based near Hull, the pandemic was also \"the final push\".\nHe took his children out of school permanently in March 2020. One of his children has autism and the family had experienced a \"very difficult time\" with special-needs provision.\n\"I think we had reached the limit of what we could do in the structure,\" he says. \"From the experience we are having, I'd be hard pressed to think about going back.\"\nTheir stories are far from unique. There was a 75.6% rise in home education between September 2020 and April 2021, compared with the averages for the same school terms over the previous two school years.\nEvery nation and region of the UK saw at least a 50% rise, based on the councils that responded. \nFor some, the rate was much higher. \nIn Oldham - where the number of home-educated children has doubled since 2019 - the council suggested the rise was \"due to Covid anxiety\".\nBolton Council said its 61% rise was \"mainly due to family concerns relating to Covid, particularly as Bolton had the highest rate of infection in the country for some time\".\nThe figures are based on Freedom of Information responses from 153 of the 205 county councils and unitary authorities in Great Britain, and all of Northern Ireland, which submitted results as a whole.\nThey do not account for children taken off the register after the end of April 2021, or who have since returned to the classroom.\nThe \"Covid effect\" meant home-education charity Education Otherwise was inundated with support requests in September 2020, membership secretary Wendy Charles-Warner says.\nShe describes home-educating as \"different but equal\" to school.\n\"If they would thrive and reach their potential at school, [then] that's right for your child. A fear-driven choice because of Covid, that's not the best choice\".\nVictoria, in Peterborough, has been educating 11-year-old daughter Isabella at home for four years. \nShe urges other parents to think carefully before going down the home-education route, even though it ended up a \"much better fit\" for her family.\nIsabella has ADHD and Asperger syndrome, and was labelled \"naughty\" at school for not understanding social situations, her mum says. She also developed phobias which Victoria says the school wasn't willing or able to accommodate.\n\"It's not easy. You're talking about being with your child 24/7. Other than groups she goes to and the tutoring she has, the rest of it is down to the parent - it's up to you to organise all that and to pay for it. You have to know what you're taking on.\" \nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: \"Many appear to have chosen home education because they have lost faith in the government's approach to school safety during the pandemic. \n\"A combination of rising case numbers in schools, and the government's decision to relax a number of the safety measures could mean that we see this trend continue unless the government does far more to reassure these parents.\"\n The Department for Education says it introduced \"robust protective measures\" in schools, including regular Covid testing and keeping pupils in bubbles.\nIt said: \"Although many parents provide a good standard of education, home education is never a decision that should be entered into lightly. Now more than ever, it is absolutely vital that any decision to home-educate is made with the child's best interests at the forefront of parents' minds.\n\"We remain committed to a registration system for children not in school and will provide further details in due course.\"\nData analysis and charts by Daniel Dunford"

      "text": "The Scottish government has announced a further easing of the Covid rules.\nGuidance urging people to work from home wherever possible is to be relaxed in favour of a \"hybrid\" system of office and remote working from Monday 31 January.\nRestrictions on large outdoor events came to an end on 17 January, then rules on indoor events and venues, including the need for table service in hospitality premises, were lifted on 24 January.\nNew guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday 31 January.\nThis will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.\nBusinesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.\nThe requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be reduced from 2m to 1m from 31 January.\nAnd face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.\nFrom Friday 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland.\nThose who are not fully vaccinated will still have to take a pre-departure test no more than two days before they travel, then take a PCR test on or before day two after their arrival.\nA raft of new measures introduced in December in response to the spread of the Omicron variant have already been removed.\nThese included limits on the number of people who could attend large public events; restrictions in pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places; and the closure of nightclubs.\nAdults and children aged 12 and over still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as before, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport.\nBusinesses are legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid, including physical distancing and screens.\nIn hospitality, face coverings can be removed while dancing, drinking and dining. Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

Old friends were amused to see me described as woke and Marxist. By Thursday night, the boss called and I'd been taken off air for the summer.\"\nHe added: \"Whatever nerdy academics tell you about Black Lives Matter associations, taking the knee is now a simple, bold statement that you reject racism.

Just one piece becomes just two pieces, until the tens and the hundreds of pieces are a real and growing danger to wildlife and to our own health and well-being and it is no longer possible for these areas to be enjoyed,\" she said."

This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment.

Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work."

      "tags": "Companies,Personal finance,Post Office Ltd,Post offices",
      "text": "The Court of Appeal has cleared 12 more former subpostmasters who were wrongly convicted of offences during the Post Office Horizon scandal.\nIt brings the total of judgements overturned to 59, but hundreds more are hoping for similar decisions.\nBetween 1999 and 2015, they were sacked or prosecuted after money appeared to vanish from accounts at their branches.\nThe problems were caused by the Horizon computer system in Post Office branches which turned out to be flawed.\nSome subpostmasters were imprisoned after being convicted of stealing money.\nIn April, 39 people had verdicts against them overturned, following on from the overturning of six other convictions in December.\nMore people have been affected by this than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK.   \nThe Horizon system was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. \nBut from an early stage, it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. \nHorizon-based evidence was used by the Post Office to successfully prosecute 736 people.\nThree judges quashed the convictions of Robert Ambrose, Hasmukh Shingadia, John Armstrong, Timothy Brentnall, Jerry Hosi, Gurdeep Singh Dhale, John Dickson, Abiodun Omotoso, Malcolm Watkins, Sami Sabet, Carina Price and Rizwan Manjra.\nTheir appeals were unopposed by the Post Office.\nAt a hearing in March, the court heard subpostmasters' lives were \"irreparably ruined\", with some losing marriages, jobs and homes after they were prosecuted by the Post Office.\nAn independent inquiry is being held into the affair.\nOne of the 12, Hasmukh Shingadia, came under particular scrutiny as he was a guest the the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.\nHe ran the local Post Office and shop in Upper Bucklebury, West Berkshire, and had become friends with the family of Kate Middleton, seeing her grow up and selling her sweets at the shop.  \nHe repaid the shortfall to the Post Office, was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 180 hours of community service. \nMr Shingadia said: \"What has happened to people has been appalling. Those who were in charge of the Post Office must be held to account at a Public Inquiry now, and dealt with appropriately from whatever that inquiry uncovers.\" \nHaving spoken to many who have had their convictions overturned it's not possible to over-state the importance of this news to the 12 individuals who have had their lives and careers shattered by wrongful convictions. Many faced time in prison, bankruptcy, and were unable to find new work because of their criminal records.\nBut for hundreds of others in the same position, hoping to wipe their criminal records clean, today also brings more worrying news. Although the 12 who have had their names cleared were unopposed, another 15 people's cases are being opposed by the Post Office. A judge will now decide whether the Court will grant permission to appeal against those convictions, which may not happen until the Autumn. \nAlthough the Post Office has said they urge \"anybody who believes that they may have a relevant case to come forward\", it's clearly not going to be the straightforward process that many had hoped for. After years of fighting the Post Office at every turn to clear their names the battles are not over yet.\nMonday's cases were the fourth group represented by Hudgell Solicitors to see their appeals through to a successful conclusion.\nNeil Hudgell said it had been another significant day in court for a group of people who suffered badly. \nThey \"did no wrong, were bullied into admitting to crimes they had not committed, made to pay back large sums of money they had not taken and who saw their lives irreparably damaged as a result\".  he said.\nHe added: \"This group again includes people who spent time in prison. Sadly, what happened to each individual and their families can never be reversed.

      "title": "Covid restrictions ease as Scotland moves to level zero",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures",
      "text": "Scotland has moved to the lowest level of Covid restrictions as it continues on its roadmap out of lockdown. \nUntil now only some islands had been in level zero but the rest of the country was in level one or level two. \nThe move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals.\nHowever, some  limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for \"some time\".\nUnder the level zero rules up to eight adults from four households can meet indoors at home, and up to 10 can meet in a pub or restaurant - with no need to pre-book a two-hour slot.\nUp to 15 people from 15 households can meet outdoors and up to 200 can attend weddings and funerals.\nLast week, the rules planned for level zero were modified due to the spread of the more contagious Delta variant.\nIn light of high case numbers, hospitality venues will be required to close at midnight and some physical distancing will have to be maintained outdoors, with different groups of 15 required to stay at least 1m (3ft 3in) apart in public spaces - meaning there may be limits on some outdoor events.\nA \"gradual\" return to office working has now been put back to 9 August.\nNew rules for travellers also come into force. Fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries (except France) will not need to quarantine, so long as they take a PCR test after arrival.\nDeputy chief medical officer Dr David Caesar said there were \"encouraging\" signs that infection rates had passed their peak in Scotland.\n\"We're in a slightly different phase of the pandemic than even some of our closest neighbours in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,\" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland.\n\"The data would suggest that numbers are coming down. The seven-day average is the one that we try and keep our closest eye on... We're obviously cautious, but it's looking like it's heading towards the right direction.\"\nOn Sunday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said talk of \"freedom day\" as it has been dubbed in England, where restrictions will also ease on Monday, was \"not sensible\" given the high daily numbers.\nMs Sturgeon tweeted: \"Cases in Scotland are falling, but still too high.\n\"To talk of tomorrow as 'freedom day' (England only remember) is not sensible IMO, given current situation.\n\"Vaccines going well and do offer route through - but as we vaccinate, we must ease up gradually.\"\nShe added: \"If you live in or visiting Scotland please abide by remaining safety measures.\"\nThe Scottish government has said it hopes Scotland can move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions.\nMinisters also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point.\nOn Sunday, official figures showed 1,735 new cases of Covid had been reported in Scotland in the previous 24 hours, with 9.8% of tests coming back positive. \nHospital numbers fell for a third consecutive day - there were 511 patients who had recently tested positive on Saturday with 46 of them receiving intensive care. \nNo new deaths of people with recent positive tests were recorded, but the government noted register offices are generally closed at weekends.\nScotland still has the highest level of Covid cases in the UK, according to sampling by the ONS - but the number of daily cases appears to be on a downward trend while south of the border it has been rising rapidly. \nThe UK went into lockdown on 23 March 2020. Over the summer, this was eased as the number of cases, hospital admissions and deaths dropped - and some of our freedoms returned. \nBut when cases started to creep back up again in pockets of the country, new restrictions were introduced at the start of the autumn. \nIn October the Scottish government published details of its new five-level alert system which came into force on Monday 2 November.\nJust before Christmas, it was announced that a new more contagious Covid variant - dubbed the Kent strain, though now known as the Alpha variant - was causing concern. \nIt came with warning all of Scotland would have to go into the top level of Covid restrictions on Boxing Day - and that level four restrictions may need to be made even tougher to contain its spread. \nIt was not until April that the mainland moved down to level three.\nIn May, mainland Scotland - with the exception of Glasgow and Moray - dropped down to level two, with most islands going into level one. The following month other areas also dropped down to level one, and many islands moved to level zero. \nBut 13 areas - with a combined population of 2.3million in the central belt - remained in level two due to high case numbers.\nThe whole country was due to move to level zero on 28 June but that was delayed due to the prevalence of a strain first identified in India, now known as the Delta variant.\nAlmost a third of younger adults are unvaccinated in Scotland, despite all over-18s having been offered a first dose appointment. Are you aged between 18 and 29 and have not had, or do not intend to have, a jab? What is your reason for not taking part in the programme? We would also like to hear from older adults in Scotland who have decided not to have the vaccination.\nYou can now get in touch with BBC Scotland on the phone messaging service, WhatsApp. \nTo start using the app, simply download WhatsApp on to your smartphone free from the internet.\nThen add our WhatsApp number +44 7902 704679 to your phone's contact list.\nPlease make sure you read our terms of use and privacy policy."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Dominic Cummings,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Thousands of people died needlessly as a result of government mistakes in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Dominic Cummings has said.\nThe PM's former top aide said Boris Johnson was \"unfit for the job\", claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns.\nHe also claimed Matt Hancock should have been fired for lying - something denied by the health secretary.\n\"Tens of thousands of people died, who didn't need to die,\" Mr Cummings added.\nAt a marathon seven-hour evidence session, the former Downing Street insider painted a picture of policy failure, dithering and a government that had no useful plan for handling a pandemic.\nHe told MPs: \"The truth is that senior ministers, senior officials, senior advisers like me fell disastrously short of the standards that the public has a right to expect of its government in a crisis like this.\"\nHe added: \"I would like to say to all the families of those who died unnecessarily how sorry I am for the mistakes that were made and for my own mistakes at that.\"\nMr Cummings - who was forced out of Number 10 at the end of last year after an internal power struggle - said those on the front line of the pandemic were like \"lions\" being \"led by donkeys\".\nBut he claimed Mr Johnson had told him he liked to be surrounded by \"chaos\" in Downing Street, because it meant everyone had to look to the PM \"to see who is in charge\".\nAsked if he thought Mr Johnson was a \"fit and proper person\" to get the UK through the pandemic, Mr Cummings replied: \"No.\"\nMr Johnson hit back at some of his former aide's allegations at Prime Minister's Questions, insisting that the government's priority had always been to \"save lives\".\nBut Mr Cummings said that despite nearly losing his own life to Covid, the PM thought the first national lockdown, on 23 March last year, had been a mistake - and he was against a so-called \"circuit breaker\" lockdown in autumn 2020 for economic reasons, despite scientific advice.\nAsked on what basis the PM had taken this decision, Mr Cummings said: \"He wasn't taking any advice, he was just taking his own decision that he was going to ignore the advice.\"\nHe added: \"The cabinet wasn't involved or asked.\"\nAsked if the prime minister had said he would rather see \"bodies pile high\" than take the country into a third lockdown, as reported by the BBC, Mr Cummings said: \"I heard that in the prime minister's study.\"\nMr Johnson has denied making these comments.\nThe former adviser reserved his most savage criticism for Matt Hancock, claiming the health secretary should have been fired for \"15 to 20\" different things - accusing him of \"criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm\".\nHe said he had repeatedly called on Mr Johnson to sack Mr Hancock, calling him \"completely incapable of doing the job\".\nThe prime minister had been furious when he came back to work after recovering from coronavirus to find that untested patients had been discharged to care homes in England, thereby allowing the virus to spread, Mr Cummings claimed.\nBoth he and the PM had been told \"categorically in March that people will be tested before they went back to care homes\".\nSubsequent government claims about putting a \"shield\" around care homes were \"complete nonsense\", he said.\nMr Cummings also attacked Mr Hancock over PPE shortages, and accused him of \"disgraceful behaviour\" in setting a \"stupid\" target of offering 100,000 Covid tests a day, which he said had disrupted wider work to establish the test and trace system.\nCommittee chairman Greg Clark said Mr Cummings must provide written evidence to back up his claims about Mr Hancock, who will be quizzed by the MPs in two weeks' time.\nMr Hancock said he had not seen Mr Cummings' evidence in full adding \"instead I've been dealing with getting the vaccination rollout going, especially to over-30s, and saving lives\". \nHowever he added that he would have \"more to say\" when he gives a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday.\nEarlier, a spokesman for Mr Hancock said: \"We absolutely reject Mr Cummings' claims about the health secretary.\n\"The health secretary will continue to work closely with the prime minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by variants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic.\"\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the \"very grave allegations\" appeared to be \"well-founded\" and the health secretary \"needs to give us an explanation\" if the country is to \"maintain confidence in him\".\nIn other explosive claims, Mr Cummings said:\nMr Cummings was questioned by the Health and Science select committees, for their inquiry into \"lessons learnt\" on the government's response to the pandemic.\nBefore the hearing began, he tweeted a picture of a whiteboard on which the government's \"plan B\" for the first wave of the virus was sketched out.\nHe told the MPs the original plan had been for limited intervention, with the hope of achieving \"herd immunity\", and he was \"completely baffled\" by Downing Street's denial of this.\nHe said the herd immunity strategy was abandoned when the scale of the death toll that would result from it became clear.\nMr Cummings was frank about some of his own failings - and admitted that his defence of a trip to County Durham during the first lockdown had \"undermined public confidence\".\nBut he said he had made the journey due to threats against his family - and he defended his claim that he had driven his family to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight, saying the story was too \"weird\" to have been made up.\nHe also gave his version of his departure from Downing Street, saying his relationship with Mr Johnson had broken down after the second national lockdown in October.\n\"The fact that his girlfriend (Carrie Symonds) also wanted rid of me was relevant but not the heart of the problem,\" he told MPs.\nHe said he regarded Mr Johnson as \"unfit for the job\" and that he had been \"trying to create a structure around him (the PM) to try and stop what I thought were extremely bad decisions and push other things through against his wishes\".\nHe also described how a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee on 12 March had been disrupted by US President Donald Trump wanting to start a \"bombing campaign\" against Iraq.\nAt the same time, he added, Mr Johnson's partner Carrie Symonds was \"going crackers\" about a \"completely trivial\" story in the Times regarding the dog she co-owned with the prime minister.\nResponding to Mr Cummings' evidence, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: \"Boris Johnson's casual disregard for the safety of the British people has had fatal consequences. \n\"From care homes to borders, repeatedly locking down too late and failing to learn from his mistakes, the PM's decisions and failures resulted in tens of thousands of avoidable deaths.\"\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson told MPs: \"The handling of this pandemic has been one of the most difficult things this country has had to do for a very long time and none of the decisions have been easy,\" he said.\n\"To go into a lockdown is a traumatic thing for a country, to deal with a pandemic on this scale has been appallingly difficult, and we have at every stage tried to minimise loss of life, to save lives, to protect the NHS and we have followed the best scientific advice that we can.\"\nHe added that he had not seen Mr Cummings' evidence to the select committee.\nConservative MP Tobias Ellwood defended the prime minister, saying that ministers should be free to speak their minds and even ask \"silly questions\" without \"fear that one day they may be quoted or misquoted back to you\".\n\"That completely diminishes the competence of the No 10 machine,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nMore than 127,000 people diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the UK since the start of the pandemic."

He had had Parkinson's for over a decade.\nHis son Steve Finan O'Connor said he was a \"unique comedian who was light years ahead of political correctness\". \nO'Connor rose to fame on TV show Opportunity Knocks, which he won three times. \nHe went on to star in The Comedians and host shows including Name That Tune, Crosswits and the Tom O'Connor Show. \nHe leaves a wife and four children, as well as 16 grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.\nHis son added: \"Tom was famously known for a brand of humour that was 100% clean and always totally family friendly.\" \nHe said his father, who was also an actor, was a \"firm TV favourite\".    \nO'Connor was born in Bootle, Merseyside, and went on to become a maths teacher and assistant headteacher.  \nHe started his showbusiness career as a singer, before introducing comedy into his act - he was still teaching during the day, and performing on the club circuit at night.    \nHe became a professional entertainer in 1972, establishing himself as a household name with shows like Pick Pockets and The Zodiac Game. \nHe hosted Name That Tune from 1976 until 1983. \nHis career also saw him appearing at the Royal Variety Show at the London Palladium and being the subject of This Is Your Life. \nAs well as hosting quiz shows - which also included I've Got a Secret and Gambit - he was also an actor, starring as Father Tom in daytime soap Doctors in the early 2000s. He won the celebrity edition of Come Dine With Me in 2010 and competed on the Pointless Celebrities quiz show with his daughter-in-law, Olympic gold medallist Denise Lewis, the following year. \nO'Connor also made appearances as a guest in Countdown's dictionary corner and received an award from the Channel 4 quiz for being the first to mark 100 appearances on the show.\nIn a video on his website, O'Connor said: \"When I grew up as a kid in wartime Merseyside, I never dreamed I'd have a career that started as a schoolteacher, went to folk singer, then country and western singer, stand-up talker and TV presenter. I've been lucky.\"\nDenise Lewis said she had watched his TV shows with her mother on Saturday nights and when she first met him, was overwhelmed at how sweet, genuine and kind he was. \n\"It was exactly the person we saw on TV day and night,\" she added. \nTV presenter Piers Morgan was among those to pay tribute to O'Connor, calling him a \"Liverpool legend and a very funny man\".\n\"Sad news. Thanks for all the laughs, Tom,\" he said on Twitter.\nBBC Breakfast host Dan Walker tweeted that O'Connor was \"kind, funny and a true gent\".\nLiverpool City Council said: \"Sad news breaking about the death of veteran Liverpool comedian Tom O'Connor. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.\""

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nMost legal restrictions imposed to halt the spread of coronavirus in England are lifted today, with the removal of limits on the number of people you can meet or the events you can attend. Some people have already been out clubbing. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still urging caution.\nIn Scotland, you might still be unable to visit nightclubs but pubs and restaurants can now open until midnight, as the nation moves to its lowest level of restrictions. It means up to eight adults from four households can meet indoors at home, and as many as 10 in a pub or restaurant. Up to 15 people from 15 households can meet outdoors, with as many as 200 allowed at weddings and funerals.\nAmid rising concerns over shortages caused by the number of people being told to isolate by the NHS Covid-19 app, some fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in England are to be allowed to carry on working when \"pinged\". Staff, including social care workers, will be exempt from isolating in \"exceptional circumstances\", when absences could lead to a \"significant risk of harm\". \nBritish commentator Katie Hopkins will be deported from Australia for bragging about flouting hotel quarantine rules by opening her hotel room door without a mask, says the Canberra government. Ms Hopkins, who was to star in TV's Big Brother Australia, posted a video - now wiped - saying she would \"lie in wait\" for workers to deliver food so she could open the door \"naked with no face mask\".\nAs restrictions ease across the UK, most people might be glad to see the end of limits on life. But for some, the switch to online prompted by the pandemic is a development they don't want to see reversed.

      "text": "Video conferencing firm Zoom has struck a multibillion dollar deal to buy a cloud-based call centre operator in a bet on the future of hybrid working.\nThe firm announced the $14.7bn (\u00a310.7bn) acquisition of Five9 in a blog post on Sunday.\nZoom boss Eric Yuan said the deal would allow its customers to \"reimagine the way they do business\".\nIt marks the firm's biggest takeover, and comes even though staff are beginning to return to the office.\nInvestors have been watching for clues as to how the firm would fare as social distancing restrictions lift and more people are vaccinated.\nThe pandemic, which prompted an abrupt shift to remote work for many businesses around the world, transformed Zoom into a household name practically overnight.\nZoom has said it does not expect growth to continue at the pace it enjoyed last year, but so far business remains strong.\nThe company expects sales to rise more than 40% this year, reaching more than $3.7bn (\u00a32.66bn).\nIn the last three months of 2020, sales were up 370% compared to the same period in 2019, hitting $882.5m, it said in March. \nThe firm, which charges businesses for its remote meeting software in addition to more limited free use for the general public, said the acquisition of Five9 marked a shift in strategy. It is now prioritising its cloud-calling product Zoom Phone and conference-hosting product Zoom Rooms.\n\"This acquisition is... positioning us to accelerate Zoom's growth and play an even stronger role in driving the digital future, bringing companies and their customers closer together,\" its founder Eric Yuan said.\nFive9's call centre software is used by more than 2,000 clients such as Under Armour, Lululemon and Olympus, and the deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022 having been approved by the boards of both companies.\n\"This is a high-priced deal which appears to attempt to build out the Zoom Phone offering,\" said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. \nBut he added: \"Paying such a high price for a non-differentiated offering smacks of attempts to move into adjacent markets as Zoom fatigue sets in.\"\nA question mark has been raised over the future of hybrid working, although other tech firms such as Google and Microsoft have invested in their video-conferencing offer during the pandemic.\nBut others such as global workspace provider IWG have said that they expect working from home some of the time will become the norm - especially as firms will be looking to save money and be more environmentally-friendly by using less office space."

      "text": "Some children and young people aged over 12 in Northern Ireland are to be offered a Covid vaccine.\nOfficials say those with specific underlying health conditions and who are at risk of serious illness from the virus can now receive the Pfizer/BioNtech jab.\nTeenagers within three months of their 18th birthday can also get a jab.\nAt present health officials are not recommending routine universal vaccination of under 18s. \nThe list of eligibility currently includes those with severe neuro-disabilities, Down's Syndrome, underlying conditions resulting in immunosuppression, and those with profound and multiple learning disabilities, severe learning disabilities or who are on the learning disability register.  \nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the vaccination programme had always been \"guided by the expert advice\". \n\"The decision by the medicines regulator to approve the Pfizer vaccine for use in this younger age group has only been taken after rigorous assessment of both safety and effectiveness,\" he said. \nMr Swann said the announcement by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) underlined the important role of the vaccines. \nThe JCVI advises government ministers on which people should be offered a vaccine.\nAdditionally, vaccines will be offered to young people over 12 who live with someone who is immunosuppressed. \nThis is aimed at providing increased protection for the more vulnerable members of the household.\nParent or guardian consent will be required ahead of vaccination. \nNorthern Ireland chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride said the JCVI had carefully examined the risk of Covid-19 to children and young people against the potential benefits of vaccination. \n\"While the evidence strongly indicates that almost all children and young people are at very low risk from Covid-19, a small number of children and young people with underlying chronic conditions are at increased risk and will benefit from the protection offered by vaccination.\"\nSir Michael said the JCVI will keep this advice under review. \nThe Department of Health is continuing to operate a number of walk-in Covid-19 vaccine clinics across Northern Ireland this week.\nThe appointment-free pop-ups were established as part of a \"final push\" to get younger people vaccinated.\nMeanwhile, the Department of Health has said the Northern Ireland version of the Covid-19 vaccine certificate app should be ready to go from Monday 26 July.\nCurrently travellers are using an interim system to prove that they have had both jabs.\nAnyone travelling from Northern Ireland between 20 and 25 July can access a downloadable certificate and QR code.\nDr Eddie O'Neill, from the department, said certificates are \"designed specially for the EU specification\".\nHe said the certificate and QR code should be readily usable within the EU.\nDr O'Neill said once people download the app, they'll be invited to register an account, prove their identity and then be able to request a certificate.\n\"There's an automated matching process and then on their app they will be able to get the QR code,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \nHe said that it works in a similar way to the NHS app in England.\nLast week, more than two million people in the Republic of Ireland got their certificates, which contain QR codes, by email and post.\nBut most Irish passport holders in Northern Ireland will not be able to access the certificate because they were vaccinated outside of the Republic of Ireland.\nAnother 1,776 positive cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland were reported on Monday - that figure is more than triple the number reported on Sunday which was 537.\nThere has been one further coronavirus-related death.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she has been \"quite disturbed by some of the imagery \" she has witnessed in the last 24 hours after Covid restrictions were lifted in England. \nThe move means there are no limits on how many people can meet and it means nightclubs can open for the first time since March 2020.\nMs O'Neill said the Northern Ireland Executive would always \"set its own path and would continue to do so\".\nEast Antrim Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson criticised Mr Swann, saying he should not try to \"blackmail ministers into just listening to the Covid obsessed advice that seems to be prevalent in policy making at present\".\nMr Swann`s party colleague Alan Chambers supported the health minister, saying exercising caution was the correct approach. \nMeanwhile, anyone travelling to Northern Ireland from France must continue to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. \nFrom Monday, anyone arriving from a country on the so-called amber list do not have to quarantine if fully UK vaccinated. \nHowever, the Department of Health said this will not apply to arrivals from France due to \"the persistent presence of cases ... of the Beta variant\".

      "text": "Children over 12 who are at higher risk of getting ill if they catch Covid will be offered the jab, the vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has confirmed. \nBut the vast majority of children in the UK, who are low risk, will not be offered the vaccine for now. \nHowever, some healthy children over 12 who live with other vulnerable people can have the vaccine, as well as those on the cusp of turning 18. \nIt means, overall, around 370,000 children will be eligible. \nThe UK is in marked contrast with other countries - such as the US and Canada - which have mass vaccinated children aged 12 to 17.\nThe decision is based on recommendations from the UK's vaccines experts - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Ministers in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each then approve the plans.\nThose newly eligible include vulnerable children, aged 12 to 15, with:\nVulnerable 16 and 17-year-olds were already able to get the vaccine. \nThose aged 12 to 17 will also be offered a vaccine if they live with somebody with a weak immune system. \nTeenagers within three months of their 18th birthday will be offered the jab - the aim is to protect people leaving school before they start work or university.  \nMr Zahawi said the NHS had been asked to offer the vaccine as soon as possible and that eligible children would be contacted by the health service. \nThey will all be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine because it is the only one approved for use in children aged 12 to 17 in the UK.\nThe European Medicines Agency says heart inflammation following the vaccine is a very rare side effect which can be treated with rest and anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. \nDo you have any questions about masks, rule changes and vaccinations?\nProf Anthony Harnden, the deputy chairman of the JCVI, said: \"The primary aim of the vaccination programme has always been to prevent hospitalisations and deaths. \n\"Based on the fact that previously well children, if they do get Covid-19, are likely to have a very mild form of the disease, the health benefits of vaccinating them are small.\"\nFewer than 30 children have died with Covid in the UK. \nThe JCVI also says the benefit of vaccinating children to prevent the virus spreading to older age groups is unclear with so many vulnerable adults already fully immunised.\nNor is there good evidence that giving children the vaccine could prevent them getting long Covid, says the JCVI. \nBut Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist Warwick Medical School, said: \"This is a worrying decision at a time when we are now relying on vaccination and personal responsibility, as opposed to mandated restrictions, to get us through the pandemic.  \n\"While infected children mostly get mild symptoms, Covid-19 causes more deaths and hospitalisations in children compared to other viral diseases which have been deemed severe enough to warrant vaccination for example flu.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "Andrew Lloyd Webber has said the theatre industry is \"on its knees\" due to self-isolation Covd-19 rules.\nHe was speaking after the opening two nights of his new show Cinderella were cancelled because some cast and crew members were told to self-isolate. \nHe said the current system was \"completely, completely untenable\" and pleaded with the government to listen.\nCulture secretary Oliver Dowden has said he was \"deeply disappointed\" to hear about Cinderella's closure.\n\"Whilst the need to self isolate is an economy wide issue, I recognise the particular challenges it presents to the arts and I'm strongly making the case for that in government,\" Mr Dowden added.\nMonday and Tuesday's Cinderella performances at the Gillian Lynne theatre in London were halted after a member of the cast tested positive for Covid-19 at the weekend, resulting in close contacts having to self-isolate. \nThat positive test had already led to two preview performances being scrapped on Saturday. \nAnother West End musical, The Prince of Egypt, also announced it had to cancel shows on Monday and Tuesday after a single positive Covid-19 case within the company.\nIt will put on socially-distanced performances on Wednesday and Thursday before retuning to full capacity on Friday.\nAnd a theatre in Hull has had to cancel its first full-capacity performances since last year after cast members tested positive for Covid-19.\nHull New Theatre had been due to stage a short run of smash-hit West End show Six the Musical this week. The shows have now been rescheduled to next April.\nLord Lloyd-Webber said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson \"doesn't seem to grasp what we're about in theatre\".\nHe said that close contacts of the positive case had been given additional PCR tests, as had anyone due to perform on Monday night. All those tests came back negative.\nIt's not clear when the show will now open.\nA spokesman for the production told the BBC: \"It's hard to see a route forward under the current rules, but we will do everything we can to come back.\"\nLord Lloyd-Webber said he is determined to open Cinderella in London and has so far ignored \"siren voices\" suggesting he moves it to Broadway.\n\"I'm not going to do that, I can't do that,\" he said. \"I'm a Brit and we've got a fantastic cast and so we will open here, but who knows? 2084? I don't know.\"\nLord Lloyd Webber added: \"We cannot function with this current system. We can't isolate every time somebody may or may not have it. It just simply doesn't work.\n\"Please, please will this government for once listen to us. Listen. We do know what we're doing, we do. Just listen and knock all these platitudes and endless, endless blunt instruments that don't apply across the board.\"\nLord Lloyd-Webber added Mr Dowden \"does his best\" but \"I don't think he's really able to be that effective\".\n\"This is the last chance for this government to show they have the remotest interest in theatre,\" he said. \"I do worry at the end of the day that the government doesn't regard theatre as anything other than nice to have.\n\"I don't think they have a clue of what the real economic value to the country theatre is, and indeed all forms of live entertainment.\"\nHe added: \"It's so vital this government understands the economics of what they're doing, let alone the idiocy.\nBut not everyone was sympathetic to Lord Lloyd-Webber's situation, including theatre critic Mark Shenton.\n\"No one MADE him try to open a new musical in a pandemic. And yet now it's everyone else's fault but his own,\" he wrote.\nSome West End shows have re-opened recently or have opened at full capacity having operated at 50% capacity prior to Monday's rule changes. They include Lord Lloyd-Webber's Joseph and His Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\nSome of the musicals and plays currently open in the West End:\nOther shows are set to open or re-open later this month, including Phantom of the Opera, Come From Away and Anything Goes. \nHowever, Sir Kenneth Branagh's theatre company announced on Monday it had axed an upcoming London production after Covid-enforced absences stopped its cast attending rehearsals.\nAlso on Monday, Lord Lloyd-Webber said: \"Freedom day had turned into closure day,\" referring to 19 July being the date when many coronavirus restrictions were lifted in England.\n\"We have been forced into a devastating decision which will affect the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of people and disappoint the thousands who have booked to see the show,\" said Lord Lloyd-Webber.\n\"Cinderella was ready to go. My sadness for our cast and crew, our loyal audience and the industry I have been fighting for is impossible to put into words.\"\nCinderella opened last month with an audience capacity of 50% after Lord Lloyd-Webber rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's offer for it to be included in the live events pilot scheme.\nActress Carrie Fletcher tweeted on Monday to say she was \"completely and utterly gutted\" at the news.\nMichael Ball, currently starring in Hairspray in the West End, which recently had to scrap 10 of its performances due to a positive Covid test, tweeted his sympathy.\nActors' union Equity said in a statement: \"Due regard must be given by the government to the industry's pleas to enable the opening of productions where it is safe to do so, and it must bring forward the planned changes to self-isolation rules.\"\nEquity previously called for workers in the entertainment industry who have come into close contact with someone with Covid-19 to not have to self-isolate (unless they have tested positive themselves) from 19 July when other restrictions were lifted, rather than the current planned date of 16 August.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Floods,Germany,Angela Merkel,Climate change,Severe weather",
      "text": "Germany's government has hit back at criticism over its warning systems after the worst flooding in decades left at least 160 people dead.\nThe deluge caught many off guard, sweeping away houses and leaving residents trapped in rising waters. More than 170 people are still missing.\nThe opposition Green Party said the disaster showed Germany must prepare better for extreme weather events. \nBut Interior Minister Horst Seehofer defended the government's actions. \nLocal communities should decide how to respond, he said. Under Germany's political system, regional states are responsible for emergency efforts. \n\"It would be completely inconceivable for such a catastrophe to be managed centrally from any one place - you need local knowledge,\" he said.\nHe called the criticism \"cheap election rhetoric\". Germany votes in September to elect a successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel. She is retiring after 16 years in power. \nFlood warning systems sent out alerts a few days before the heavy rain. However, they failed to reach many residents or officials in time. \nArmin Schuster, head of the Federal Office for Civil Protection, said \"the warning infrastructure wasn't our problem, but the effectiveness with which authorities and the population reacted to these warnings\". \nHe said \"we sent out 150 warnings via our apps, via the media\". But in many cases, he said, it was impossible to predict even half an hour ahead which places would be hit hardest.\nBut some have questioned the usefulness of warning apps, as the floods severed many phone links.\nMany factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.\nOn the ground the risk of floods is easing as the weather improves. \nIn the severely hit Ahrweiler area, in Rhineland-Palatinate, the death toll rose to 117 on Monday. In North Rhine-Westphalia, at least 46 people died.\nA massive clean-up is under way. German media report oil pollution of rivers, including parts of the Rhine, from heating oil in flooded cellars and abandoned cars.\nThe government is considering an aid package of about \u20ac400m (\u00a3344m; $470m).\nDonations, including clothes and other essentials for people left homeless, have poured in from other parts of Germany. \nA priority is to provide drinking water. In some flooded areas, officials say, damaged water pipes cannot be repaired quickly."

      "text": "A Florida man has become the first to be sentenced to prison for his part in the US Capitol riots on 6 January. \nPaul Allard Hodgkins pleaded guilty in June to one felony count of entering the Capitol to obstruct Congress. He was jailed for eight months. \nProsecutors had asked for a term of 18 months, saying Hodgkins \"contributed to the collective threat to democracy\". \nThe sentence is expected to set a benchmark for hundreds of upcoming cases from the Capitol riots. \nHodgkins, 38, told a Washington DC court that taking part in the invasion of the Capitol had been a \"foolish decision\". \nHe said he regretted \"the damage that day's incident caused and the way this country that I love has been hurt\".\nThe crane operator from Tampa, was among an estimated 800 people who breached the Capitol on 6 January. \nThe FBI has so far arrested more than 535 people for criminal activity on the day of the siege. \nVideo footage shows Hodgkins inside the Senate chamber, wearing a Trump 2020 t-shirt, with a pair of goggles around his neck and a Trump flag slung over his shoulder. \nCourt documents include a selfie taken by Hodgkins inside the Senate. One of the most prominent participants in the riots, the so-called QAnon Shaman, can be seen in the background. \nProsecutors noted that Hodgkins did not personally engage in violence or destroy property. \nA lawyer for Hodgkins had asked for judge for leniency, saying any sentence given \"will pale in comparison\" to the lifelong shame he will carry.\nHodgkins' felony sentence follows one other Capitol riot sentence issued so far. \nAnna Morgan-Lloyd, a 49-year-old woman from Indiana, received three years of probation and no jail time after pleading guilty in June to a disorderly conduct charge, a misdemeanour. \nMs Morgan-Lloyd, who was inside the Capitol for around 10 minutes and did not engage in violence, apologised for taking part."

      "text": "Health and care workers are being \"left behind\" in efforts to vaccinate the world against Covid-19, nursing leaders say.\nThere were promises they would be among the first to be jabbed.\nBut the International Council of Nurses (ICN), which represents 27 million professionals, says tens of millions have not even had one dose. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates around 200 have died each day since the pandemic began. \nHoward Catton, chief executive of the ICN, says: \"If this was an airline going down every day with 200 people on board, there'd be immediate investigations.\n\"You've got nurses and healthcare workers knowing that they are at higher risk, knowing that there is a way to protect them\u2026 and that people who are far less vulnerable in other countries are getting that protection. But they are being left behind.\n\"It feels that despite all of the warm words of support, nurses and healthcare workers are in some way are dispensable or disposable. \nMandy Malambo, a nurse in Lusaka, Zambia, has had one dose of a Covid vaccine and is eagerly awaiting her second. \n\"Things have been very, very difficult during the pandemic,\" she says. \"We have been short-staffed, and the number of cases we are receiving each and every single day is overwhelming.\n\"The staff are not able to take care of these Covid patients. so work has been very, very stressful, especially when you think, what if today is the day that I contract coronavirus?\n\"It's really scary. We're just hoping for the best.\"\nReporting of infections and deaths among healthcare workers is patchy and the true figure is thought to be far higher than the 6,643 officially reported to the WHO. \nMany countries are not officially reporting the number of health and care workers who have died of Covid, and the WHO estimates the real figure is at least 115,000 - and potentially much higher.  \nThe organisation's Dr Jim Campbell says: \"It's a moral responsibility that we should all be concerned about.\" \nThere are around 135 million health and care workers around the world, according to the International Labour Organization.\nThe latest data reported to the WHO from 140 countries suggests just one in eight is fully vaccinated, the vast majority in richer nations. \nDr Phionah Atuhebwe, from the WHO's Regional Office for Africa, says 2.4 million health workers across 38 countries have had at least one dose of a vaccine - but another 66.2 million doses are needed to ensure all health and care workers in the region are double-jabbed.\n\"We are concerned about the availability of vaccines to healthcare workers and (about) vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers,\" she said,\nIn Nigeria, for example, health workers have a range of concerns around safety and supply, but research also found they were unable to take time off work for vaccination.\nThe ICN says it's essential there is a better record of how many healthcare workers fall ill and die from Covid.\n\"The data will raise some difficult and uncomfortable questions about the level of risk, and whether there could have been more effective policy responses to protect those people,\" says Mr Catton. \n\"But I say, don't be fearful of bringing this data forward because you're worried about the accountability. Think about how bringing this data forward can better protect healthcare workers and save their lives.\"\nCovid vaccines are scarce internationally, particularly in lower-income countries.\nIt's also these countries that tend to have precious few health and care workers. \nThe wider concern is that if they are not protected, the communities they serve are also left more vulnerable. \nFollow @TulipMazumdar on Twitter."

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lifting all coronavirus restrictions is \"reckless\", Sir Keir Starmer has said, as most legal limits on social contact are eased in England.\nThe legal requirement to wear a mask has ended, but the government says it \"expects and recommends\" the continued wearing of face coverings in crowded areas such as public transport.\nHowever, the Labour leader argued that the measure should stay in place.\nSir Keir also attacked the PM's character saying he \"causes chaos\".\nOn Sunday, the PM said now was the \"right moment\" to remove rules aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus.\nHowever, Boris Johnson urged caution, adding: \"We've got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there - cases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant.\"\nFrom midnight on Sunday the government allowed nightclubs to reopen and lifted limits on social contact.\nSir Keir argued that the prime minister's \"chaotic\" leadership style is \"dangerous\" and has \"deadly consequences for the country\".\nHe said because of Mr Johnson's leadership and mistakes during the pandemic \"people have died, more will do so.\"\nIn addition to maintaining face masks, the Labour leader said guidance advising people to work from home where they can should remain in place and that buildings needed better ventilation.\nby Harry Low at Farringdon station, London\nConfusion was the word on almost everybody's lips in the first rush hour commute since rule changes were introduced.\nAround three quarters of people were wearing masks but although face coverings are mandatory on TfL services, they're not on Thameslink trains which serve the station. \nAs passengers make the short journey across the platform, the advice changes meaning they can either remove or apply their face coverings depending on which direction they are travelling. \nChristopher McCready, who lives in Scotland but works in London, said he would continue wearing a mask despite having contracted the virus a month ago but, like many, he called for greater clarity. \n\"The whole island should be under the same rules,\" he said.\nUK-wide guidance recommending against travel to amber list countries is also being removed.\nAdults who have been fully vaccinated in the UK will not have to self-isolate for 10 days after visiting these countries - with the exception of those returning from France to England, Scotland or Wales, because of concerns over the spread of the Beta variant of the virus.\nIn Scotland, limits on social contact will remain in place and face coverings will still be mandatory, however some restrictions have been eased and pubs will be able to open until midnight.\nRestrictions are set to be relaxed in Wales on 7 August and in Northern Ireland on 26 July.\nAcross the country, coronavirus infections numbers continue to rise with 39,950 cases reported on Monday and more than 50,000 on Saturday.\nA further 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also recorded.\nSome scientists have predicted that UK infections could hit 200,000 a day later in the summer.\nHowever, modelling suggests hospital admissions, serious illness and deaths from Covid-19 will be at a lower level than in previous peaks, due to more than 68% of UK adults being fully vaccinated.\nSpeaking to the House of Commons, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi confirmed that children over 12 who are at higher risk of getting ill if they catch Covid would be offered the jab.\nThe decision was based on recommendations from the UK's vaccines experts - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nHe also said people in roles such as air traffic controllers would not have to self-isolate in order to work if they had received their second vaccination more than two weeks ago.\nMr Zahawi said the individuals would need to self-isolate \"at all other times\" and that those who are eligible for this exemption would receive \"personalised letters setting out the steps they must follow\".\nThe minister also announced that \"by the end of September\" people going to nightclubs or other venues with large crowds would need to prove that they had been fully vaccinated.\nHe said negative test would \"no longer be sufficient\" but there would be exemptions for those with \"genuine medical reasons\" for not being vaccinated.\nSir Keir also used his speech to attack the prime minister for his initial decision to avoid self isolating by taking part in a pilot scheme, which would allow him to continue to go to work while taking daily tests.\nMr Johnson and his Chancellor Rishi Sunak were contacted by NHS Test and Trace after Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive for Covid on Saturday. \nThe two men had been in a meeting with Mr Javid on Friday.\nDowning Street initially said Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak would not have to isolate because they were taking part in the pilot, but this plan was quickly dropped, following criticism from the opposition that it represented \"one rule for them and another for the rest of us\".\nSir Keir accused the prime minister and chancellor of having \"played the system\".\nSpeaking to the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Zahawi denied the government had taken the public for \"fools\", following Mr Johnson's U-turn on self-isolating.\nHe said the prime minister had \"talked about considering\" taking part in the pilot scheme \"then very quickly realised the right thing to do self-isolate because it sends a very powerful message to everyone.\"\nSir Keir also questioned why the prime minister was isolating in Chequers - his country retreat - rather than Downing Street.\n\"You would have thought given the amount of money spent refurbishing Downing Street he would have been happy staying there,\" he said.\nNo 10 has said the prime minister travelled to Chequers immediately after his meeting with Mr Javid and had been there when he was contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\nThe rise in infections has led to concern about the number of people being asked to isolate, with some businesses forced to shut some of their sites due to a lack of staff.\nThe government has said some fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in England will be allowed to continue working if contacted by NHS Test and Trace.\nHowever, the prime minister's spokesman has ruled out modifying the NHS Covid app to ensure it sends fewer isolation alerts."

      "text": "Thousands of racehorses are being sent to slaughterhouses in Britain and Ireland, a BBC Panorama investigation has found.\nSome of the slaughtered animals were once owned and trained by some of the biggest names in racing.\nCovert recording also showed how rules designed to protect horses from a cruel death appear to be regularly ignored at one of the UK's biggest abattoirs.\nThe abattoir told the BBC it did not accept any form of animal abuse.\nOne expert described the covert footage, from cameras installed by the campaign group Animal Aid, as evidence of clear breaches of the regulations.\nLast February, a picture of top trainer Gordon Elliott sitting on a dead horse sent shockwaves through the world of racing and beyond.\nElliott, who has trained three winners of the Grand National, was roundly condemned, and suspended from the sport until 9 September this year.\nThe incident caused uproar, but it also highlighted the fate of many horses in the industry who die while racing, in training or in abattoirs.\nFreedom of information requests revealed that 4,000 former racehorses were slaughtered in Britain and Ireland since the beginning of 2019. Most, but not all, were trained in Ireland.\nAnimal Aid, which has long campaigned for an end to horse racing, set up covert cameras at Drury and Sons, an abattoir in England which has a licence to kill horses.\n\"When we looked at the footage we were absolutely astounded at the sheer volume of young thoroughbreds,\" said Animal Aid spokesman Dene Stansall.\nThe footage was recorded over four days at the end of 2019 and the start of 2020. \nIt captured dozens of former racehorses being slaughtered, the majority of them from Ireland and the majority young.\nSome of the horses shot in the abattoir had previous illustrious racing careers, winning thousands of pounds.\nThree of them had been trained by Gordon Elliott at his state-of-the-art stables in County Meath, Ireland.\nHe told Panorama none of the three animals were sent to the abattoir by him.\nThe horses had retired from racing due to injury, he said, and were not under his care when they were killed.\nElliott said two of the horses were sent to a horse dealer \"to be rehomed if possible, and if not, to be humanely euthanised\" in line with the regulations.\nHe said he gave the third horse to another rider as requested by its owner.\nAnd he said the first time he learned of their fate was when Panorama contacted him.\nElliott said he has ensured the appropriate and proper treatment and welfare of animals that have been in his possession and has rehomed a substantial number of them.\nWatch Panorama: The Dark Side of Horse Racing, on BBC One on Monday at 20:30 BST, or later on BBC iPlayer.\nAnimal Aid's cameras also captured what appear to be breaches of rules designed to protect animals from unnecessary cruelty.\nThe regulations say horses should not be killed in sight of each other.\nThe footage recorded horses being shot together 26 times over the four days of filming.\nProf Daniel Mills, a veterinary behavioural specialist from the University of Lincoln, who has seen the footage, said: \"A gunshot going off is going to be startling, seeing another horse suddenly drop, these are all going to be very distressing for a horse in this situation.\"\nThat is not the only breach of the rules.\nThe regulations also say every effort should be made to ensure a rapid death. But the footage showed that sometimes the death was far from instant.\nOn 91 occasions the cameras recorded a slaughterman shooting horses, not close up, but from a distance.\nReviewing the footage of one such killing, Prof Mills said: \"It doesn't look like the horse is even stunned. You can see it's turning its head. It seems to have got some control actually over its head and neck.\n\"Taking a shot from a distance at a horse, to me, that's completely out of order. If you're going to euthanise a horse, you've got to get a bullet in the right place.\n\"If that's representative of how they're being killed, then we've got a really serious problem.\"\nThe abattoir, Drury and Sons, told Panorama that they \"take great care to maintain high welfare conditions and do not accept any form of animal abuse\".\nThey said all horses are \"humanely destroyed'' and that on occasions where issues do occur, they take ''swift action to review and rectify\" them.\nSome of the racehorses killed while Animal Aid cameras were filming had been transported from Ireland, travelling more than 350 miles (560km) by road and sea.\nSome animals were said to be carrying career-ending injuries.\nVeterinary expert Dr Hannah Donovan, who reviewed the footage, said: \"[Travelling] 350 miles potentially carrying an injury is not a humane process. This is unnecessary suffering.\"\nDr Donovan said: \"The bottom line is horses, if they are to be euthanised, could and should be euthanised at home. Simple as that.\"\nProf Mills said the racing authorities' own guidelines clearly set out what should happen to horses when their racing career ends.\n\"The industry's own regulations recommend that you should make provision for all the animals that you're responsible for,\" he said.\nHorse Racing Ireland, the governing body for racing in Ireland, said it placed great importance on the welfare of the people and horses in the industry.\nThe British Horseracing Authority said it has demonstrated \"a clear commitment to improving already high standards of care for racehorses\u2026 before, during and after racing\".\nIt said it would \"consider carefully any issues raised\" by the Panorama programme. \nDene Stansall of Animal Aid said: \"I can understand why people are attracted to racing, because I was attracted to it myself.\n\"[But] because of the poor welfare record, the number of horses dying and being killed in slaughterhouses, I can no longer support that - and I think a lot of the public would feel the same way.\"\nPanorama: The Dark Side of Horse Racing, is on BBC One on Monday at 20:30 BST, or watch later on BBC iPlayer."

      "text": "Northern Ireland's new highest recorded temperature could be exceeded this week, the Met Office has suggested.\nThe hottest day on record was provisionally reported on Saturday when the temperature in Ballywatticock, near Newtownards in County Down, hit 31.2C.\n\"It is possible the [provisional] record may be challenged again on Wednesday or Thursday,\" said John Wylie of the Met Office.\n\"This time it is more likely across central or western parts.\"\nThe previous high was 30.8C set in the summers of 1976 and 1983.\nMr Wylie said that Saturday's temperature record was \"quoted as provisional until the site has been checked by the Met Office\".\n\"This value will then be compared to other maximum temperatures nearby with the prevailing weather situation,\" he said.\n\"At the moment we're not seeing anything which might cause us to suspect that value.\"\nThe checks were standard practice, he said, with a small group of people having to assess the information and decide whether the temperature \"can be accepted as a new regional maximum\".\nMr Wylie said the \"footprint of climate change\" was being seen \"all over our weather patterns now all over the northern hemisphere\".\n\"These extreme events where temperatures might have hit 30C in Northern Ireland - originally we'd have been seeing that every seven years,\" he said.\n\"In the last while that has come down to every three or four years.\n\"These events are becoming more extreme and more frequent.\"\nThere are about 30 weather stations in Northern Ireland, which include a mixture of automatic and manual recording.\nDonald Ferguson, the Met Office's regional network manager for Northern Ireland, is due to inspect the station at Ballywatticock on Tuesday.\nHis inspection was an important part of the record verification process, he said.\n\"I have to check the equipment is fully functional and compare it against my reading on my inspector-standard instrument,\" he added.\n\"I also have to check the exposure of all the instruments, for example how much shelter the instrument [at Ballywatticock] has - not too much and not too little.\n\"This is the first part of the process - hopefully we will have official confirmation within a week.\n\"Why we have to check is that, for example there were record temperatures reported in Strathclyde Park near Motherwell a few years ago and when they went out to check it was an ice-cream van pumping out heat across the thermometer.\"\nMr Wylie, who is Met Office weather advisor for Northern Ireland, said he believed several factors had combined to produce the high temperature reading at Ballywatticock.\nKillowen, also in County Down, had hit 29.9C, before that figure was overtaken later in the day.\n\"It was a very hot day - the reason we got it is we have been sitting under high pressure for several days,\" said Mr Wylie.\n\"The temperatures had been rising slowly day on day and with light winds, unbroken sunshine and extremely dry ground conditions.\n\"Conditions were perfect for unusually high temperatures.\n\"We are less than a month past the summer solstice and the sun is very high in the sky, which means we are getting maximum benefit from solar heating.\n\"All of the conditions came together at the right time and right proportions.\"\nThis week was going to be another hot week, he said.\n\"Temperatures [will be] rising again from Tuesday to Thursday and it will be Friday or the weekend before they return to more normal weather for Northern Ireland.\""

      "title": "Covid-19: Critical staff to avoid isolation and some under-18s to get jab",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nSome fully vaccinated people in critical roles in England, including NHS and care staff, will no longer need to self-isolate if they are a close contact of a positive coronavirus case. Speaking from isolation at his country residence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference that workers involved in the supply of food, water, electricity, as well border and railways staff would be among those exempt from quarantine to allow them to work. But he said this would be a \"very, very small number of named critical workers\". It comes as firms including Iceland and Greene King say they have had to shut shops and pubs due to staff shortages caused by people being told to isolate by the NHS Covid app. \nChildren over the age of 12 who are at higher risk of getting ill if they catch coronavirus will be offered the Covid jab, the vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has confirmed. Most children in the UK, who are low risk, will not be offered the vaccine for now. However, some healthy children over 12 who live with other vulnerable people can have the jab, as well as those on the cusp of turning 18. It means, overall, a few hundred thousand children will be eligible. The decision is based on advice from UK vaccines experts - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Read more on which children are being vaccinated and why.\nFull vaccination will be made a condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather in England from September, under government plans revealed by the PM. Boris Johnson told a news briefing that he was concerned by the \"continuing risk\" of transmission posed by nightclubs. He said the measures would come in at the end of September - when all over-18s should have been offered both jabs. The latest figures show 35% of 18 to 30-year-olds have still not had both jabs. Currently nightclubs and other crowded venues are only encouraged to ask revellers to show proof of vaccination, a negative test result or immunity.\nThe Republic of Ireland has eased its Covid restrictions on international travel, meaning most double-vaccinated passengers do not have to self-isolate. On Monday 19 July, Ireland signed up to the EU Digital Covid Certificate system which gives users proof of vaccination, negative test results or recovery from coronavirus. Passengers arriving in Ireland from outside the EU will not have to quarantine or have travel-related Covid tests provided they can show valid proof of vaccination or proof they have recovered from Covid in the past 180 days. Isolation rules have also been relaxed for fully vaccinated UK passengers. \nA man with Covid who has had the longest hospital inpatient stay in the Scottish Borders has urged people to get vaccinated. Scott Drummond, 52, has been receiving treatment for more than 180 days, having caught the virus in January - before he was eligible for the jab. He was in intensive care for three months and said \"on three occasions my wife was advised that it looked like I might not make it\". Since then he has been moved to a ward for rehabilitation and ongoing care and has had to learn to speak again. He said anyone who was over 18 and could get the vaccine should do so to \"protect yourself and your loved ones\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\n...you can remind yourself of any changes to rules or restrictions wherever you live, by checking our guide.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The Duke of Sussex will share \"mistakes and lessons learned\" during his life in a memoir to be published next year.\nAnnouncing the deal with publishers Penguin Random House, Prince Harry said he would reflect \"the highs and lows\" and be \"accurate and wholly truthful\".\nHarry, who alongside his wife Meghan stepped back from royal duties last year, will donate proceeds to charity.\nThe BBC has been told the duke has recently spoken privately with his family about writing the book.\nA spokesperson for the duke added that he would not be expected to obtain permission for the project from Buckingham Palace.\nThey did not provide additional details on what share of the proceeds would be donated to charity.\nAnd Penguin did not disclose the terms of its deal, which includes an audio book and international rights.\nThe duke, 36, said in a statement: \"I'm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become.\"\nHe added: \"I've worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story - the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned - I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. \n\"I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I've learned over the course of my life so far and excited for people to read a first hand account of my life that's accurate and wholly truthful.\"\nMarkus Dohle, of Penguin Random House, described the duke as being among \"world-renowned leaders, icons, and change-makers we have been privileged to publish over the years\". \nA press release described the book as \"intimate and heartfelt\" and \"honest and moving\".\nIt added: \"Prince Harry will offer an honest and captivating personal portrait, one that shows readers that behind everything they think they know lies an inspiring, courageous, and uplifting human story.\"\nThe Sussexes have established an organisation called Archewell, which has production arms alongside a non-profit foundation.\nIn May, it was announced that the Duchess of Sussex would publish a children's book, the Bench, about father-son relationships, as seen through the eyes of mothers with the same publisher.\nIt was said to be inspired by the bond between Harry and their son.\nHarry and Meghan, 39, now live in the US with their two-year-old son Archie, and their daughter Lilibet, who was born in California on 4 June.\nEarlier this month, the duke joined his older brother, the Duke of Cambridge, at Kensington Palace to unveil a statue of Diana, Princess of Wales on what would have been their mother's 60th birthday.\nHarry has previously spoken of what he has described as his family's unwillingness to talk about his mother's death and of his use of drink and drugs to cope with the pain of losing her.\nHe has also said he wanted to \"break the cycle\" of the \"pain and suffering\" of his upbringing with his own children."

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson was reluctant to tighten Covid restrictions as cases rose last autumn because he thought people dying from it were \"essentially all over 80\", Dominic Cummings has claimed.\nHe also said the prime minister had messaged him to say: \"I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff.\"\nMr Johnson had wanted to let Covid \"wash through the country\" rather than destroy the economy, Mr Cummings said.\nThe claims came in an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.\nIt is the first time Mr Cummings - Mr Johnson's former chief adviser - has given a one-on-one TV interview during his career in politics.\nIn response, Downing Street said the prime minister had taken the \"necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice\" throughout the pandemic.\nAnd the government had prevented the NHS \"from being overwhelmed through three national lockdowns\", a spokesperson added.\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Mr Cummings also said that, near the start of the pandemic last year, Mr Johnson had wanted to keep his weekly face-to-face meetings with the Queen going - but he had to warn his boss that she might die if she caught coronavirus.\nAnd he defended his controversial decision to drive to his parents' farm in County Durham after the first lockdown started, but admitted he had not \"come clean\" about all the reasons behind it, including \"security concerns\" around his family home in London.\nThis is the first major interview Mr Cummings has given, but he has answered MPs' questions on the government's response to Covid.\nThe claims made at that session were explosive, but he's since been criticised for failing to provide the evidence to back up some of those assertions.\nDominic Cummings: The Interview will be broadcast in the UK on BBC Two at 19:00 BST on Tuesday, and it will be available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds\nCovid cases dipped last summer but began to rise rapidly again as autumn started, prompting a debate within government about what measures were needed.\nMr Cummings told the BBC that he, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty had pushed for tougher restrictions from mid-September - Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty declined to comment.\nMr Cummings went on to allege Mr Johnson had said: \"No, no no, no, no, I'm not doing it.\"\nThe prime minister had \"parts of the media and Tory party screaming\" not to increase restrictions and \"always referred\" to the Daily Telegraph, for which he had previously written a column, as \"my real boss\", Mr Cummings said.\nOn 13 October, with Covid deaths having risen to more than 100 a day, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for a \"circuit-breaker\" lockdown of two to three weeks, but the government decided against this.\nIn a WhatsApp message sent on 15 October, shared with the BBC, Mr Johnson appears to have described himself as \"slightly rocked by some of the data on Covid fatalities\".\nThe \"median age\" for those dying was between 81 and 82 for men and 85 for women, the prime minister allegedly wrote, adding: \"That is above life expectancy. So get Covid and Live longer.\n\"Hardly anyone under 60 goes into hospital... and of those virtually all survive. And I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff. Folks I think we may need to recalibrate... There are max 3m in this country aged over 80.\"\nHe reportedly went on to write: \"It shows we don't go for nationwide lockdown.\"\nBut on 31 October the prime minister announced a four-week lockdown for England to begin on 5 November, saying this was needed to protect the NHS as figures suggested deaths could reach \"several thousand a day\" without \"tough action\".\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Business Minister Paul Scully defended the PM's actions during the autumn, adding that economic restrictions also had an impact on people's health and lives and \"you have to take all of those factors into account\".\nHe said the 17-day so-called firebreak lockdown in Wales, introduced around two weeks before England's autumn lockdown, \"didn't have a particularly big effect at the time\".\n\"These decisions are not quite as black and white as necessarily we can make them now,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme. \nLooking back to the start of the pandemic, Mr Cummings told the BBC he had intervened to stop Mr Johnson continuing to see the Queen, then aged 93, for weekly face-to-face meetings.\nMr Cummings claimed that, on 18 March last year, the PM had said: \"I'm going to see the Queen... That's what I do every Wednesday. Sod this. I'm going to go and see her.\"\nHe added that he had told Mr Johnson: \"There's people in this office who are isolating. You might have coronavirus. I might have coronavirus.\n\"You can't go and see the Queen. What if you go and see her and give the Queen coronavirus? You obviously can't go.\"\nHe continued: \"I just said, 'If you give her coronavirus and she dies, what are you going to [do]? You can't do that. You can't risk that. That's completely insane.'\n\"And [the PM] said - he basically just hadn't thought it through - 'Yeah...I can't go'.\"\nDowning Street denied that this incident took place and Buckingham Palace declined to comment.\nOn 27 March last year, four days after the first lockdown began, Mr Cummings drove his wife and son from London to his parents' farm in County Durham.\nWhile staying there, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle on 12 April, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London.\nWhen these details were revealed they provoked huge anger - and accusations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel.\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out \"Do I feel OK driving?\"\nHe also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London.\nAsked why he had given a story that was \"not the 100% truth\" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that \"the way we handled the whole thing was wrong\".\n\"What I should have done is either just resigned and said nothing about anything,\" he said, \"or I should have spoken to my family and said, 'Listen, we're just gonna have to come clean about the whole thing.'\"\nMr Cummings was repeatedly challenged throughout the interview to back up his version of events.\nHe says many of his claims will be corroborated if there is a public inquiry.\nLabour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said NHS workers, patients, and the relatives of Covid victims would find Mr Cummings's interview \"shocking and difficult to hear\".\n\"The revelations are further evidence that the prime minister has made the wrong calls time and again at the expense of public health,\" he added. \n\"Boris Johnson is reckless, unfit to govern and a public inquiry cannot be delayed\".\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \"Since the start of the pandemic, the prime minister has taken the necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice.\n\"The government he leads has delivered the fastest vaccination rollout in Europe, saved millions of jobs through the furlough scheme and prevented the NHS from being overwhelmed through three national lockdowns.\n\"The government is entirely focused on emerging cautiously from the pandemic and building back better.\"\nSir Iain Duncan Smith - who briefly employed Mr Cummings as an adviser when he was Conservative leader, said the prime minister should be judged on the decisions he made, rather than the processes that led up to them.\nOf Mr Cummings, he said: \"He obviously is a very bitter man, I know I employed him, I sacked him. I know exactly how he works, this will go on for some time.\""

      "text": "Ocado has cancelled thousands of orders after a fire at a fulfilment centre in south-east London on Friday.\nThe online grocer said the blaze started when three of the robots that help pick its groceries collided at the Erith site.\nAbout 800 staff had to be evacuated and firefighters worked through the night to contain the incident. \nIt is the second fire involving robots at Ocado. Its Andover facility burned down in 2019 after an electrical fault.\nShares in the company slipped by about 3% in early trade on Monday.\nOcado handles up to 150,000 orders a week at the Erith warehouse.\nThe company said the fire would cause \"disruption to operations\" but that it was \"working to restore normal service as soon as possible\". \n\"We expect the facility to begin operating within the coming week and thank customers whose orders are affected for their patience.\n\"We would like to also thank the London Fire Brigade and all the other emergency services for their hard work and professionalism in dealing with this incident.\"\nIt said no one had been injured in the fire and all its staff were safe. The damage is limited to a small section of its warehouse, it added, although it could not say when the site would reopen. \nThe retailer has contacted all affected customers, but there was a mixed reaction on social media. \nOne angry customer tweeted: \"I'm sorry that there is a fire and glad that it appears no one is hurt, but why do I have to find out on twitter?\"\nShe added: \"This is the 3rd or 4th order in a row that has been messed up.\"\nOthers expressed support for the firm, with one tweeting: \"Whilst it may be inconvenient, some more compassion for the business and staff affected might be nice!\"\nOcado's fulfilment centres are highly automated. \nAt Erith, hundreds of robots zip around a grid, collecting groceries and bringing them to members of staff who will pack them into boxes, which are then loaded on to trucks for delivery.\nHowever, a fault in a battery charging unit caused a robot to catch light at Ocado's Andover distribution centre in 2019. \nThe site, which processed 30,000 orders a week at the time, burned for four days and was completely destroyed. It has since been rebuilt.\nOcado, which was the UK's third biggest online grocer last year, has seen huge growth during the pandemic, with sales up 40% in the first three months of the year.\nIt also continues to strike technology licensing partnerships with grocery chains around the world, including Groupe Casino in France and Kroger in the US.

      "tags": "China,Cyber-attacks,Microsoft,United States,Cyber-security",
      "text": "The UK, US and EU have accused China of carrying out a major cyber-attack earlier this year.\nThe attack targeted Microsoft Exchange servers, affecting at least 30,000 organisations globally.\nWestern security services believe it signals a shift from a targeted espionage campaign to a smash-and-grab raid, leading to concerns Chinese cyber-behaviour is escalating.\nThe Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) has also been accused of wider espionage activity and a broader pattern of \"reckless\" behaviour.\nChina has previously denied allegations of hacking and says it opposes all forms of cyber-crime.\nThe unified call-out of Beijing shows the gravity with which this case has been taken. Western intelligence officials say aspects are markedly more serious than anything they have seen before.\nIt began in January when hackers from a Chinese-linked group known as Hafnium began exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange. They used the vulnerability to insert backdoors into systems which they could return to later. \nThe UK said the attack was likely to enable large-scale espionage, including the acquisition of personal information and intellectual property. \nIt was mainly carried out against specific systems which aligned with Hafnium's previous targets, such as defence contractors, think tanks and universities.\n\"We believe that cyber-operators working under the control of Chinese intelligence learned about the Microsoft vulnerability in early January, and were racing to exploit the vulnerability before [it] was widely identified in the public domain,\" a security source told the BBC.\nIf this had been all, it would have been just another espionage operation. But in late February something significant changed. \nThe targeted attack became a mass pile-in when other China-based groups began to exploit the vulnerability. The targets scaled up to encompass key industries and governments worldwide.\nIt had turned from targeted espionage to a massive smash-and-grab raid. \nWestern security sources believe Hafnium obtained advance knowledge that Microsoft intended to patch or close the vulnerability, and so shared it with other China-based groups to maximise the benefit before it became obsolete. \nIt was the recklessness of the decision to spread the vulnerability that helped drive the decision to call out the Chinese publicly, officials say. \nThe UK is also understood to have raised the issue of Chinese cyber-activity in private with Beijing over an extended period, including handing over dossiers of evidence. \nMicrosoft went public about the vulnerability on 2 March and offered a patch to close it. At this point, more hackers around the world had realised its value and piled in. \nAround a quarter of a million systems globally were left exposed - often small or medium-sized businesses and organisations - and at least 30,000 were compromised.\nWestern governments accuse the MSS of using hackers for hire and want it to sever ties with them.\nThe UK Foreign Office said the Chinese government had \"ignored repeated calls to end its reckless campaign, instead allowing state-backed actors to increase the scale of their attacks and act recklessly when caught\".\nThe White House said it reserved the right to take additional actions against China over its cyber activities.\nThe EU, meanwhile, said the hack had \"resulted in security risks and significant economic loss for our government institutions and private companies\".\nBut Western spies are still struggling to understand why Chinese behaviour has changed. If the hackers were authorised to escalate, it would suggest a step-change in what the country is willing to do and raise the fear that they no longer care about being caught. \nThat is partly why so many governments have joined together to signal their concerns. Japan, Australia, Canada and New Zealand have joined Nato in issuing a statement in \"solidarity\".\nThe countries also called out wider Chinese behaviour which it linked to two groups known as APT 40 and APT 31, which are believed to be linked to the MSS.\nDespite the strong language, there are no signs of fresh sanctions against China. In contrast, new sanctions were placed on Russia for the recent SolarWinds campaign which many experts believe was less serious than the Microsoft Exchange campaign linked to China.\nSome officials, however, hope China is more sensitive than Russia to international pressure.\nThe US Department of Justice has announced criminal charges against four MSS hackers which it said were linked to a long-term campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors in a least a dozen countries.\nUltimately, Western security sources believe the MSS is behind all the activity revealed today and hope co-ordinated international action will put pressure on their activities.
