      "tags": "Universal Credit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A Conservative peer who helped design the universal credit system has renewed her call for a vote on the end of the \u00a320-a-week top-up to the benefit.\nBaroness Philippa Stroud said it was a \"really bleak day\" for many families as the extra money is withdrawn from Wednesday.\nBut the new justice secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC the top-up was always meant to be temporary.\nExtending the booster payment would cost around \u00a36bn a year.\nThe government has said that spending has to be brought under control after unprecedented emergency interventions during the pandemic.\nMr Raab defended the withdrawal of the booster payment, insisting the government wanted to \"avoid the benefits and welfare trap\" and universal credit was designed to encourage people back into work.\nHe pointed out the \u00a3400bn ministers put into helping the economy, workers and the most vulnerable was \"clearly unsustainable\" in the long-term.\nBut the government has continued to help jobless people find work, he added, citing the \u00a34.3bn stimulus package unveiled by the chancellor last year.\nMr Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we've done - national living wage, personal allowance, the ending of the over-reliance on cheap labour from abroad which depresses wages - is so critical to our vision for the economy.\"\nUniversal credit is a benefit for working-age people and was brought in to merge six benefits - such as income support and child tax credit - into one payment.\nIt can be claimed whether a person is in or out of work and is drawn by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales - with almost 40% of them classed as being in employment.\nThe benefit is made up of a standard allowance - which differs according to age and personal circumstances - plus any additional amounts that apply, such as having children, a disability or health condition that stops someone from working.\nA \u00a320-a-week increase to universal credit was brought in as a temporary measure to help those on low incomes hit financially by coronavirus lockdowns.\nThe extra universal credit payment works out as about \u00a387 a month, or \u00a31,040 a year.\nThe scheme is officially due to end on Wednesday, but the exact date the money will stop being paid will vary depending on the day a person usually receives their universal credit.\nYou can read more here.\nBaroness Stroud, who is chief executive officer of the Legatum Institute think tank, told the same programme that their calculations showed the withdrawal of the top-up would push 840,000 people into poverty - including 290,000 children.\n\"There are people who are out of work who will move back into work, but there are also 450,000 who will move into poverty today as a result of this who have disabilities or who have children who are disabled,\" she said.\nBaroness Stroud reiterated her call for a cross-party House of Lords vote on the decision to remove the \u00a320-a-week top-up \"that would say to the House of Commons, think again on this issue\".\nShe previously told the BBC she would table an amendment to the Social Security Bill when it reached the House of Lords, but this has not yet happened.\nFor Nicola Flower, from Cornwall, the uplift in universal credit has helped her stay warm by paying for heating bills during her cancer treatment.\nShe told the BBC she has had to shield for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic and is still waiting for an operation.\n\"I had no choice but to go on it [universal credit],\" she said. \"It was a godsend because I wouldn't have managed otherwise. I have never been on benefits before in my life. I have always done three jobs.\"\nNicola, who worked as a seamstress, in a supermarket and as a cleaner, said the she knew the \u00a320 uplift was \"an extra\", but added with fuel prices and gas prices rising, she could do with the money.\nYou can read more here.\nCampaigners, charities, and MPs have called for the top-up to be made permanent to help those who are still struggling.\nThe Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) has urged the government to continue the uplift, saying food banks are struggling to support \"ever-increasing\" numbers of people.\nThe network - which represents 500 UK food banks and providers - says it is \"running out of options\" as volunteer numbers and public donations have dropped, food supply shortages have caused problems, and staff are already stretched to meet current demand.\nEarlier this week the homelessness charity Crisis warned that about  100,000 renters could face eviction when the \u00a320 booster payment ends.\nThe Labour party accused ministers of being \"complacent about the cost of living crisis\" amid concerns over rising energy prices and the end to the top-up in universal credit.\nIts shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned the end to the booster payment risked \"plunging\" people into fuel poverty.\nPaddy Lillis, general secretary of the shopworkers union Usdaw, said: \"It is shameful the government is removing this crucial lifeline for low-paid workers and their families; particularly as they face rising utility bills and national insurance increases, along with fuel and food shortages that are impacting the cost of living.\"\nHe urged the prime minister to \"do the right thing\" by cancelling the withdrawal of the universal credit top-up and \"committing to reforming a social security system that doesn't provide the support working families need\".\nBut the government has insisted the uplift to universal credit was always meant to be temporary and designed to help people through the toughest stages of the pandemic.\nIt added that higher wages, rather than taxpayer-funded benefit rises, would be the best way to tackle poverty as the country emerged from Covid restrictions."

      "tags": "UK devolution,Scottish government,UK Supreme Court,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "Judges at the Supreme Court have ruled that provisions in two bills passed by MSPs were beyond Holyrood's powers.\nMSPs unanimously backed the bills - which enshrine treaties on children's rights and local government in Scots law - prior to May's Holyrood election.\nHowever after a challenge from UK law officers, judges said the legislation could affect Westminster's ability to make laws for Scotland.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said this showed the limits of devolution.\nThe bills will now go back to Holyrood to be reconsidered and amended by MSPs, with the Scottish government saying it is committed to bringing them into law \"at the earliest possible opportunity\".\nOpposition parties backed this, but accused Scottish ministers of playing \"cynical political games\" over the issue.\nThe challenge concerned two bills passed in the closing days of the previous parliamentary session, which both aimed to incorporate aspects of international treaties into Scots law.\nNeither bill was controversial at Holyrood, and both were passed unanimously by MSPs. However, the UK government did raise concerns about them, and submitted a challenge to the Supreme Court claiming they were beyond the remit of the devolved parliament.\nUK law officers insisted the challenge was not based on the substance of the legislation - the UK government signed up to both of the treaties in question in the 1990s and says it is \"deeply committed\" to protecting children's rights - but on its potential impact.\nTheir submission to the court said the standards set by the bills could be applied to laws passed at Westminster as well as Holyrood - meaning the Scottish courts would have \"extensive powers to interpret and scrutinise primary legislation passed by the sovereign UK parliament\".\nThe Scottish government defended the legislation, claiming that stripping provisions from the UN Convention bill would \"limit the protections available for children and young people\".\nAnnouncing the verdict on Wednesday morning, Lord Reed said the court had unanimously agreed that four provisions of the UN Convention bill and two provisions of the European Charter bill were outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament.\nThe court agreed that they would affect the UK government's ability to make laws for Scotland, in breach of the Scotland Act.\nThe bills will now return to Holyrood and can be looked at again by MSPs in a \"reconsideration stage\" to bring them into line with the court's ruling.\nThis is the case for Mr Wightman's members bill despite the fact he is no longer an MSP - it can instead be taken on in parliament by an alternative member.\nInevitably, the judgement is a little more complex and nuanced than you might be led to believe by politicians of all stripes who fired out comments within minutes of it being handed down.\nNone of the arguments heard in court had anything to do with children's rights or local government - this was about the law-making process rather than the principles of the bills themselves.\nAnd this means it has tapped into a more fundamental dispute between ministers in Edinburgh and London, about the extent of Holyrood's powers.\nClearly, the Scottish government thinks there should be no limit on Holyrood's powers, because they think Scotland should be independent. But this case tells us little about the prospects for a fresh referendum, or how the courts might view legislation for one.\nUltimately, the two bills could likely be brought into line with the judgement with a few strokes of a pen - Mr Wightman says it should be \"straightforward\".\nBut that may well be lost amid the sound and fury of the familiar constitutional row which the ruling is sure to provoke.\nMr Swinney said the Scottish government \"fully respects the court's judgement\", but was \"bitterly disappointed\".\nHe said the ruling would require \"careful consideration\", but said the government remained committed to incorporating the UN Convention into Scots law to the greatest degree possible.\nThe deputy first minister added: \"One thing is already crystal clear - the devolution settlement does not give Scotland the powers it needs.\"\nMeanwhile Mr Wightman said he was \"disappointed but not surprised\" by the judgement, saying that \"the amendments required to resolve the incompatibility are straightforward\".\nHe added that while it had raised a wider point about Holyrood's powers, a \"huge amount of nonsense\" was likely to be talked about the ruling.\nOpposition parties still back getting the bills into law, but were critical of the Scottish government's approach.\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the SNP had \"shamefully used children's rights to play nationalist games\".\nConstitution spokesman Donald Cameron said: \"There was never any dispute over the substance of the policy, only the legality of parts of the bill. But the SNP sought to politicise it from the very beginning.\"\nLabour MSP Sarah Boyack said: \"This court case has been a needless distraction from what really matters. This damning verdict makes it clear that the SNP have been playing cynical political games at the expense of children's human rights.\"\nAnd Lib Dem MSP Willie Rennie said it was \"depressingly predictable\" that the government had waited for a \"constitutional clash\" before making changes to the legislation."

      "tags": "Scottish exam results,A-levels,Young people,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have received their A-level results, and final Scottish Highers results have also been released.\nBecause of the pandemic, grades have been determined by teachers' estimates, rather than exams.\nTop A-level grades have reached a record high - with 44.8% getting A* or A grades. \nThe percentage of pupils achieving A to C grades in their Highers was 87.3% - down slightly on 2020.\nA combination of coursework, mock exams and essays have been used by teachers to decide grades.\nThe head teacher of each school had to sign off the results and say there was evidence to back them up.\nThe freedom given to schools meant students have had very different experiences this year - with some doing more tests than others. \nTo ensure consistent judgements were made, some measures were put in place by exam boards - such as requiring a sample of student work to be submitted.\nLast year, when exams were also cancelled, results were initially calculated based on an algorithm, before a U-turn meant teachers estimates were used in most cases.\nIf students think a grade is wrong, they can first ask their school or college to check whether it has made a mistake.\nIf that's the case, a new grade can be sent to the exam board, which will decide what to do.\nIf the school confirms the grade but the student still believes it is incorrect, then they can ask for an appeal, which their school or college is expected to submit on their behalf.\nThe exam board may correct it, although any new grade could be higher or lower than the one given on results day.\nIn England, the deadline to send an appeal to the exam board is 17 September. \nThere is an earlier deadline of 23 August for priority appeals - for example, if a student has not got their first choice of university place confirmed. \nIn Wales and Northern Ireland the appeals process is slightly different.\nSchools and colleges will set their own deadlines for receiving appeals, which will be earlier than these dates. \nFirst of all, try not to panic.\nOne option is to contact the university's admissions office, which may have some flexibility if you narrowly missed your offer, or could suggest a different course.\nYour school or college's careers adviser can also help discuss options such as a gap year, work or an apprenticeship.\nAnother popular option is clearing, which matches students with spare university places. \nUntil 19 October, you can apply for a course through clearing if you've missed out on an offer - or have declined your firm choice. You must register and then apply on the Ucas Track system.\nBefore you add a university as a clearing choice, you need to call them directly to discuss whether they will potentially accept you.\nAdditionally, in England exams will be held in October in their normal format. Any student can take one of these exams if they were due to take one in the summer, and can use their highest grade from those or the teacher estimates.\nAdvanced level qualifications - known as A-levels - are subject-based qualifications taken mostly by pupils aged 16-18 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland after they have done their GCSEs.  \nIn England, pupils must stay in education or training until they are 18.\nStudents normally study three or more A-levels over two years which are assessed by a series of exams. They can lead to university, further study, training, or work. \nIn England, the government \"very much hopes and intends\" for exams to go ahead in 2022, according to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. \nBut schools are set to get advance notice of topics, so students are not disadvantaged by Covid disruption. Full details will not be confirmed until early in the autumn term.\nIn Wales, plans are currently being developed. However, some subjects will be adapted \"to reflect the disruption there has been\".\nExams will take place in Northern Ireland, but students will sit \"significantly fewer\" in each subject.\nPupils across Scotland are receiving confirmation of the grades for their Highers and Advanced Highers, while younger pupils get the final grades for their National 5 qualification.\nThe percentage of pupils achieving A to C grades in their Highers fell from 89.3% in 2020 to 87.3% in 2021.\nBut that total is still significantly above the 75% pass rate from 2019, and a record high number of awards overall.\nA total of 90.2% of Advanced Higher candidates achieved a pass, down from 93.1% in 2020, while National 5 scores dropped from 89% to 85.8%.\nProvisional grades based on teacher assessment were awarded across all qualifications in June to allow more time to appeal. The deadline for any appeal is 12 August.\nA decision on whether exams will be held in 2022 is due shortly."

      "text": "Amazon is expanding its presence on the High Street by opening its first non-food store in the UK.\nThe shop, in the Bluewater shopping mall near Dartford, will sell around 2,000 of its most popular and best-rated products.\nIt's called Amazon 4-star, because every item has been given more than four stars by customers.\nHowever, one retail expert said the shop could be \"muddled and uninspiring\".\nThis will be the first Amazon 4-star store outside the US, where there are already more than 30 outlets. \nThe range of products, which takes in books, consumer electronics, toys, games and homeware, reflects what Amazon customers are buying online.\nThere's a \"Most Wished For\" section, for instance, showing the most popular products from customers' wish lists. \nDigital price tags are used to ensure the prices are the same in-store and online. Shoppers don't need to have an Amazon account to use it. \nAnd customers will also be able to collect items ordered online as well as return items without the need for packaging and labels.\nAndy Jones, director of Amazon 4-star UK, declined to say how many more stores he plans to open in the UK.\nThis global giant is often accused of killing the High Street by undercutting traditional retailers and paying less tax.\nNow it's moving onto their physical patch as well. \nHowever, retail expert Natalie Berg said the Amazon move \"is purely about experimentation\".\nThe giant's aim, she said, is to encourage more online shopping.\n\"This is not about shifting more product; it's about baiting shoppers into Amazon's ecosystem,\" Ms Berg said. \n\"It's about getting shoppers to engage with Amazon's devices, reminding Prime customers of the value in their memberships, and offering additional choice when it comes to collection and returns of online orders.\" \nAmazon has already opened six grocery convenience stores in the UK with checkout-free technology. \nBut Ms Berg said the jury is still out as to whether the world's most disruptive retailer can do one of the most fundamental retail tasks - run stores. \n\"The 4-star concept has the potential to be a bit muddled and uninspiring,\" she said.\n\"The store features a smorgasbord of products, the result of Amazon's very scientific, data-led approach to physical retail.\n\"But when you strip out the high-tech touches, I struggle to see how it differentiates from any other retailer,\" says Ms Berg. \nLandlords, though, may welcome the move as they try to find new players to take on empty shops, driven largely by our shopping habits moving online."

      "tags": "Local Government Association,Local government,Institute for Fiscal Studies",
      "text": "Council tax in England could rise by as much as \u00a3220 per year within three years, researchers have said.\nThis is to keep local services running and help pay for social care reforms, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank said.\nIt comes amid warnings that councils continue to face severe funding pressures due to the pandemic and must find new sources of income.\nThe government said it had given them \u00a312bn since the start of the crisis.\nUnder current government spending plans, council tax bills will need to rise by at least 3.6% a year just to keep services running at pre-pandemic levels, the IFS said.\nThat would mean bills would have to rise by \u00a3160 by 2024-25, it said.\nBut extra cost pressures that eat into central government grants could easily push up council tax by 5% a year, or \u00a3220 by 2024-25, it said.\nIn addition, the government's plans for social care, which include capping costs, won't be completely paid for by a planned rise in National Insurance contributions, the IFS said.\nThe plans are likely to cost \u00a35bn per year eventually, it said, nearly three times the funding currently allocated.\nThe government has made much of the idea that after decades of governments neglecting the increasingly pressing issue of underfunded social care, this was a nettle it was determined to grasp.\nWhat's concerning in the IFS report is who might get stung. \nA large part of the goal of the social care reforms was to address unfairness in the means-testing system.\nBut the IFS report highlights the risk that, without further funding, it could create new unfairness elsewhere.\nTo extend publicly-funded care to those who've spent \u00a386,000 of their own money on fees will cost extra, and local authorities may only be able to recoup that by tightening eligibility criteria - so many poorer people lose access.  \nSecond, the way the funds are allocated to local authorities dates back to 2013.\nBecause some areas like Blackpool have seen their populations fall, but others, like Tower Hamlets have seen them jump since then, the risk is that the money won't go where it needs to.\nIFS research economist Kate Ogden said: \"The government has stepped up with billions in additional funding for councils to support them through the last 18 months.\n\"It is likely to have to find billions more for councils over the next couple of years if they are to avoid cutting back on services, even if they increase council tax by 4% a year or more.\"\nShe said that the coming financial year is \"likely to be especially tough\", with ongoing Covid-19-related pressures and squeezes on budgets\nShe added that the local government funding system was \"hopelessly out of date\", being based on 2013 population levels, leading to \"unfairness\" in the distribution of resources between councils.\nCouncil tax goes towards funding local services such as policing, the fire service and street cleaning. The funding is topped up with grants from central government and business taxes.\nHowever, these central government grants were slashed between 2009-10 and 2019-20, especially in areas such as public transport, housing and planning.\nThe Local Government Association said councils \"continue to face severe funding and demand pressures that will stretch the local services our communities rely on to the limit\".\n\"The significant financial pressures facing local services cannot be met by council tax income alone,\" said LGA chairman James Jamieson. \"Councils are particularly alarmed that the government's solution for tackling social care's core existing pressures appears to be solely through the use of council tax, and the social care precept.\"\nMr Jamieson called for local services to be \"the top priority\" in the upcoming Spending Review.\nA government spokesperson said: \"The government has allocated more than \u00a312bn directly to councils since the start of the pandemic - with more than \u00a36bn available to spend as they see fit - recognising that councils are best placed to deal with local issues.  \n\"We have also taken historic action to fix the social care crisis - the Health and Social Care Levy will raise \u00a312bn a year to fund the NHS and social care. \n\"The Spending Review will continue to focus on supporting jobs and delivering the public's key priorities.\""

      "tags": "China,Taiwan",
      "text": "Tensions with China are at their worst in 40 years, Taiwan's defence minister has said, warning of the risk of an accidental strike between the two.\nChiu Kuo-cheng's comments came after China sent a \"record number\" of military jets into Taiwan's air defence zone for four consecutive days.\nTaiwan considers itself a sovereign state. China, however, views Taiwan as a breakaway province.\nIt has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification. \nWhile Chinese jets have not been flown all the way to the island, Mr Chiu warned that there was a risk of a \"misfire\".\nTaiwan's air defence zone, which it monitors for threats, extends over an area that covers the Taiwan Strait and a large swathe of the Chinese mainland. They consider jets crossing an unofficial line between China and Taiwan as an incursion.\nMr Chiu also warned China would be capable of mounting a full-scale invasion of the island by 2025. \nHe was speaking as a parliamentary committee in Taipei considered a multi-billion-dollar defence spending bill to build missiles and warships. \nAcknowledging that China already has the capacity to invade, he said such a move would get easier in coming years, though he did not elaborate.\nTaiwan broke away from the mainland as communists seized power in 1949. \nAnalysts have warned that Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that Taiwan's government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and wants to deter its President Tsai Ing-wen from taking any steps in that direction.\nA number of Western allies of Taiwan have expressed concern at China's open display of military might recently.\nHowever, US President Joe Biden said his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had agreed to abide by the \"Taiwan agreement\". \nMr Biden appeared to be referring to Washington's longstanding \"one China\" policy under which it recognises China rather than Taiwan.\nHowever, this agreement also allows Washington to maintains a \"robust unofficial\" relationship with Taiwan. The US sells arms to Taiwan as part of Washington's Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must help Taiwan defend itself.\nThe \"One China\" policy, which Mr Biden and Mr Xi are believed to have referred to, is a key cornerstone of Sino-US relations but is distinct from the One China principle, whereby China insists Taiwan is an inalienable part of one China to be reunified one day.\n\"I've spoken with [Mr] Xi about Taiwan. We agree ... we'll abide by the Taiwan agreement,\" said President Biden. \"We made it clear that I don't think he should be doing anything other than abiding by the agreement.\nDespite the heightened tensions, relations between China and Taiwan have not deteriorated to levels last seen in 1996 when China tried to disrupt presidential elections with missile tests and the US dispatched aircraft carriers to the region to dissuade them.\nAt one level you might expect Taiwan's defence minister to be sounding the alarm like this, speaking at a hearing into whether military spending should be increased.\nThe same thing happens around the world.\nHowever, he is not alone in warning that tensions between Taiwan and mainland China have been increasing quite seriously.\nThis all still seems like we are a long way from war but Chiu Kuo-cheng is also not the only person to have warned of the potential for accidental shooting at a time of high pressure.\nEvery time dozens of mainland fighter jets and bombers fly into Taiwan's air defence zone, Taipei scrambles its own aircraft. It is not hard to imagine a scenario whereby a misunderstood signal or action could lead to a deadly incident.\nThere is considerable debate amongst analysts as to whether Beijing might be building towards a move to retake Taiwan by force.\nEach time a Chinese government official or a senior party member threatens to do this it fuels fears that this could come sooner rather than later.\nAnd such threats have been coming thick and fast recently.\nThere have even been concerns that the spate of patriotic military movies being released here could be designed to soften the public up about the need for war as a national duty.\nMany people, especially those living in Taiwan, will be hoping that Xi Jinping did make commitments to Joe Biden in the way that the US president reported he did - and that a bloody cross-Strait solution is not being considered as a serious option."

The state's Republican governor had also refused to block the sentence from being carried out. \nElected officials, racial justice activists and faith leaders joined the efforts to spare Johnson's life. \nA representative of Pope Francis -  who in 2018 changed the teachings of the Catholic faith to officially oppose the death penalty in all circumstances - wrote last week to Missouri's governor that the pope \"wishes to place before you the simple fact of Mr Johnson's humanity and the sacredness of all human life\".\nBut on Monday, Governor Mike Parson announced the state would \"deliver justice and carry out the lawful sentence Mr Johnson received in accordance with the Missouri Supreme Court's order\".\nWriting in support of the execution, Attorney General Eric Schmitt said that the facts of Johnson's actions \"plainly reflect the offender's ability to plan, strategise, calculate, and scheme effectively\".\nJohnson had asked to be executed by firing squad but his request was denied by the Missouri Supreme Court, and he was instead executed by lethal injection.\nIn a handwritten statement before his death, Johnson apologised for his crimes and thanked his family, friends and lawyer for their support. \nHe is the first inmate to be put to death in the state since May 2020 and the seventh to be executed in the US this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

      "title": "Climate change: NHS staff fighting to make hospitals greener",
      "tags": "COP26,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Climate change,Environment,NHS,Bangor,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Welsh NHS needs to \"lead by example\" in the fight against climate change to avoid future health problems, say hospital staff trying to cut carbon emissions.\nAt Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, staff are volunteering after shifts during Covid-19 to work on green schemes.\nDoctors said major overhauls were needed to ensure the health service stops adding to global warming.\nNHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall said progress was being made.\nThe outgoing chief executive added that while the health service was under huge pressure, it must focus on climate change alongside the Covid crisis.\nThe NHS accounts for about 2.6% of Wales' emissions of planet-warming gases - a carbon footprint of approximately one million tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year.\nAt hospitals across Wales, concerned NHS staff are setting up green groups and working extra hours without pay to try and decarbonise sites.\nDoctors, nurses, pharmacists and non-clinical staff at Ysbyty Gwynedd joined forces in 2019 in a bid to make the hospital run more sustainably.\nThe team has planted trees and wildflowers, switched to less polluting anaesthetic gases, and initiated trials of reusable personal protective equipment (PPE).  \nJunior doctor Tom Downs - who founded the Ysbyty Gwynedd Green Group - said it had been \"something really positive to focus on\" during the pandemic.\nBut he said for staff, who may already be working a 70-hour a week, finding time to volunteer was \"a real challenge\".\nWhen BBC Wales visited the hospital, some of the staff involved came in on days off or after a night shift to show us around.\nConsultant anaesthetist Dr Lisa Hancock, who has been working on biodiversity schemes, including planting a new wildflower meadow, said she wanted the planet to \"be a better place\" for her eight-year-old daughter.\nThere are plans to plant 100 trees, with the idea that some of the hospital's mental health patients could help with the upkeep as part of their treatment.\n\"On a sunny day when you see the butterflies outside the ward, and hear the birdsong... it's harder to be sad,\" she said.\nThe group has also published cycle-to-work guides for staff to cut down on car fumes and successfully lobbied for new shower facilities.\nSome of the biggest transformations have taken place inside the hospital itself, including changing the gas used to put patients to sleep.\nThey worked out that using Desflurane for an hour to anaesthetise a patient, generated emissions similar to driving 320km (200 miles) in a car, whereas an alternative called Sevoflurane - which worked just as well - was like driving 6.5km (4 miles).\n\"We're saving the equivalent of driving 27,500 miles a month,\" consultant anaesthetist Dr Carsten Eickmann said.\nBut he said the scale of the emissions cuts required to tackle climate change meant major overhauls were needed from the top.\nIn recent heatwaves, temperatures had reached over 30 degrees in some parts of the hospital, and old single-glazed windows and a lack of insulation on the 1980s hospital site meant huge wastage of energy, he claimed.\nDr Eickmann said there needed to be people working in the NHS specifically on its climate change response, while Dr Downs added the health service had a responsibility to \"lead by example\".\n\"Just as the health workforce are on the front lines of the pandemic, they'll likewise be on the front lines of the climate emergency and the health impacts that we see from that,\" he said.\nDr Goodall - who is moving to a new job as the Welsh government's top civil servant after running the NHS since 2014 - said he welcomed a \"groundswell of support\" from staff.\n\"It's really important for us to recognise that this makes a difference to healthcare for the future,\" he said, pointing to the link between air pollution and a variety of diseases.\n\"We want to make sure the NHS isn't just asking others to act - we have a responsibility to be focused [on this].\"\nOn the calls for more action from the top, he said expectations had been set at a national level but all the different NHS organisations needed their own plans.\nWhile the NHS was under huge pressure, Dr Goodall said focusing on climate change would help make the transformations needed to services after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"The NHS, alongside all other public services in Wales, will need to step up and increase its level of contribution over the forthcoming years,\" he said.\nNHS Wales published its Decarbonisation Strategic Delivery Plan earlier this year, with targets to reduce emissions 16% by 2025 and 34% by 2030.\nBut the Welsh government wants the public sector as a whole to reach net zero emissions by the same year - so the document said this should be seen as a \"minimum contribution\" to that goal. \nIt proposes, among other things, that every building will have undergone an energy-efficiency upgrade with large scale renewable electricity schemes deployed and low-emission or electric ambulances procured."

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson,Conservative Party Conference",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has promised to \"get on with the job\" of uniting and levelling up the UK, in a speech to the Conservative Party conference.\nIn an upbeat address peppered with jokes, but light on new policy, the prime minister claimed a high-wage, high-skilled economy was being created in the wake of Brexit and the pandemic.\nHe also defended tax rises to pay for the NHS and vowed to fix social care.\nThe 45-minute speech was his first to a conference since the pandemic began.\nIn it, the prime minister said the overwhelming Conservative general election victory in 2019 placed an onus on his government to deliver change demanded by voters.\nThe main theme of his speech was \"levelling up\", with the PM saying that reducing gaps between regions would ease pressure on south-eastern England, while boosting places that felt left behind.\nHe also repeated pledges set out at during his party's conference this week in Manchester to crack down on crime, improve transport links and broadband, and reform the housing market.\nAnd he sought to reassure Tories anxious about plans to increase National Insurance to pay for the NHS and social care by claiming it was what predecessor Margaret Thatcher would have done, if the economy had been hit by a \"meteorite\" like the pandemic.\n\"She would have wagged her finger and said that more borrowing now is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes later,\" he said. \nBoris Johnson is an optimist. \nThe prime minister wants a new economic model with better pay and conditions. He wants to persuade voters his is the party to distribute wealth and opportunity more evenly across the UK. He wants people to feel good about the future.\nLevelling up has been the slogan repeated by ministers at this conference. We only got a sliver of meat on the bones today. This was a speech thin on policy, big on jokes and rhetorical flourishes. \nConservatives love Mr Johnson because he makes them feel good - it's a strategy that is key to understanding his success as a politician. \nBut will it be enough? There are some difficult months ahead for many people. \nRising prices, supply chain issues, the end of the universal credit top-up and furlough. \nMany Conservatives acknowledge the cost of living squeeze - and are worried about the impact. \nCritics will accuse the prime minister of ignoring those big issues in favour of what they see as vague promises for the future. \nBut the hope in Manchester was that Boris Johnson's unflinchingly upbeat vision of a post-Brexit, post-pandemic Britain is as popular with voters as it is with Tory activists.\nThe Conservative conference has taken place amid concerns over rising inflation, supply chain problems, and petrol and worker shortages.\nBut Mr Johnson insisted that the present problems were the result of an economic rebound in the wake of Covid shutdowns.\nHe added that controls on immigration represented the \"change that people voted for\" in the 2016 Brexit referendum, while also promising to end declining home ownership among young people by building more housing. \nHe announced a \u00a33,000-a-year bonus for teachers, as an incentive for struggling areas of England to recruit maths and science specialists. The policy replaces a similar nationwide scheme that has recently been phased out. \nDowning Street said the new \"levelling up premium\" would cost \u00a360m, but no details have yet been given over which areas will qualify. \n\"There is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"You will find talent, genius, flair, imagination, enthusiasm - all of them evenly distributed around this country. But opportunity is not.\"\nMr Johnson referred to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who was recently photographed dancing in an Aberdeen nightclub, as \"Jon Bon Govi\" - an allusion to the rock star Jon Bon Jovi.\nHe also mocked Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he has frequently dubbed \"Captain Hindsight\".\n\"If Columbus had listened to Captain Hindsight, he'd be famous for discovering Tenerife,\" he joked.\nBut Sir Keir accused Mr Johnson of \"playing this game where he's pretending that he's just sort of just landed from the Moon and he's looking around and saying, 'Things look pretty awful around here, we need a bit of levelling up, things are so awful'\".\nHe told ITV's Peston programme: \"He and the Tories have been in government for 11 years, so we're in this state because of the way that they have governed the country.\"\nThe CBI business lobby group said Mr Johnson said set out a \"compelling vision\" but had so far \"only stated his ambition\" on raising wages. \nShevaun Haviland, who heads the British Chambers of Commerce, said firms supported the aim of a higher-wage, higher-skill economy but warned: \"This will not happen overnight.\""

      "tags": "Shami Chakrabarti,Sarah Everard murder,Metropolitan Police Service,House of Lords",
      "text": "A Labour peer is to demand a fuller inquiry into the Metropolitan Police and the circumstances surrounding the murder of Sarah Everard. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel announced a non-statutory inquiry on Tuesday into \"systematic failures\" that allowed her killer to remain a police officer.\nPolicing Minister Kit Malthouse said a non-statutory inquiry would be faster.\nBut Shami Chakrabati said non-statutory inquiries lacked both independence and powers to make witnesses appear.\nThe former shadow attorney general has now tabled an amendment to the government's policing bill - due back in the Lords in two weeks - demanding a statutory inquiry, led by a judge, to begin within a month of the law passing. \nAnd she has put another proposal forward to ensure police officers are not allowed to ask a woman to get into a car unless they are accompanied by another officer. \nA Home Office spokeswoman said it stood by the department's earlier commitment, that to \"provide assurance as swiftly as possible\" the inquiry will be on a non-statutory footing, which can be converted to a statutory inquiry if required.\nShe added: \"The chair and terms of reference for the inquiry will be confirmed in due course.\"\nThe killing of Ms Everard sent shockwaves throughout the UK and raised questions about the safety of women on the streets. \nWhen details of her murder emerged last week - that serving police officer Wayne Couzens used his warrant card to fake an arrest to kidnap her, before raping and killing her - the police faced growing calls for answers over its policies and procedures.  \nThe Met confirmed it would carry out an independent review into its standards and culture, and the  Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is also carrying out a review.\nBut Ms Patel said a Home Office inquiry would \"give the independent oversight needed to ensure something like this can never happen again\".\nThe department said the inquiry would initially be non-statutory but could be converted to a statutory one if required, with Mr Malthouse telling BBC Radio 4's PM the first option was much quicker to put in place.\nBut Baroness Chakrabati pointed to the review into the murder of Daniel Morgan, where a non-statutory panel set up by then-Home Secretary Theresa May took eight years to report back.\nWhen its report was finally released, the panel said its work was \"made more difficult\" by not having the power to \"compel witnesses to testify, nor could we compel the Metropolitan Police to disclose documents in a timely manner\".\nIn her amendment, the Labour peer wants an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 - making it statutory - to start within one month of the policing bill being approved to \"identify the lessons to be learned for the professional culture, funding, vetting and organisation of policing, the prevention of violence against women and the investigation and prosecution of misogynistic crimes\".\nThe amendment also says the chair should be a senior woman judge or retired judge, alongside a panel of other members with relevant experience.\nBaroness Chakrabati told the BBC: \"Neither the Met commissioner's internal review [into the circumstances surrounding Ms Everard's death] nor the home secretary's non-statutory inquiry will have either the robust independence or powers to compel cooperation that are so urgently required. \n\"The Daniel Morgan review panel described the obstruction they faced in June. \n\"Anything short of a full-blown judge-led 2005 Act inquiry will short-change women who have been let down by the police and criminal justice system for at least a decade.\"\nThe Home Office said: \"The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts B Bill is currently going through Parliament and we will consider amendments as they are raised.\""

      "tags": "Cyber-crime,Computer hacking,Princess Latifa,United Arab Emirates,Princess Haya case,Cyber-attacks,Mohammed Al Maktoum,Dubai,Cyber-security",
      "text": "The High Court has found that the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, interfered with British justice by ordering the hacking of the phone of his ex-wife, Princess Haya of Jordan.\nThe phones of her solicitors, Baroness Fiona Shackleton and Nick Manners, were also targeted during their divorce custody case, according to the court. \nPrincess Haya said the discovery had made her feel \"hunted and haunted\". \nSheikh Mohammed denied any knowledge of the hacking. \nHe said the court's findings were based on evidence that was not disclosed to him, and that they were \"made in a manner which was unfair\".\nThe judgments are a blow to the sheikh and a further revelation as to his treatment of female members of his family.\nThe High Court judgments, which were published on Wednesday afternoon, referred to the hacking as \"serial breaches of (UK) domestic criminal law\", \"in violation of fundamental common law and ECHR rights\", \"interference with the process of this court and the mother's access to justice\" and \"abuse of power\" by a head of government.\nThe president of the Family Division of the High Court found that \"the mobile phones of the mother (Princess Haya), two of her solicitors, her personal assistant and two members of her security staff had been the subject of either successful or attempted infiltration by surveillance software. The software used is called Pegasus software and was that of an Israeli company, the NSO Group.\"\nThe court concluded that the surveillance was carried out \"by servants or agents of the father (Sheikh Mohammed), the Emirate of Dubai or the [United Arab Emirates] and that the surveillance occurred with the express or implied authority of the father\". \nThe extent of the hack is shocking in what data it gave the hackers access to.\nNSO's Pegasus software, often referred to as \"spyware\", is able to track the location of the individual using the phone, read their SMS messages, emails and messages in other apps, as well as eavesdrop on their phone calls and access their contact list, passwords, calendar dates and photographs. In other words, it gives the hacker complete access to all the data they want to see in their target's phone. \nIt also allows the hacker to activate the target's phone without their knowledge, recording their activity and even taking photographs and screenshots. \nSimilar spyware is alleged to have been deployed by Saudi government agents, working on the orders of the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, against dissidents living abroad, including associates of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nIt is extremely difficult for a victim of such spyware to even detect that their phone has been infected with Pegasus. \nIn the ongoing custody case between Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya at the Family Division of the High Court, her legal team said the hacking took place with his \"express or implied authority\".\nThe president of the court concluded that \"in relation to the mother (Princess Haya), it is clear that the [hacking] attempt succeeded with a very substantial amount of data (265MB) being covertly extracted from her phone\". \nSheikh Mohammed denied any knowledge of the hacking and said he did not instruct anyone to use NSO \"or any software in this way\". His legal team said he was not prepared to enter into any debate in relation to what security systems the UAE might have. \nThe allegations against Dubai's ruler were supported by testimony given by an expert technology witness, Dr William Marczak, who is based in California and is a senior research fellow at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which researches digital surveillance.\nHe told the court he had no doubt the phones were hacked using NSO's Pegasus software. He also concluded \"with high confidence\" that the phones were hacked by a single operator in a nation state. He concluded with medium confidence that it was most unlikely to be any state other than the UAE.\nPrincess Haya's legal team first became aware that they had been hacked after an urgent phone call made by Cherie Blair QC, the wife of former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, to Baroness Shackleton. Mrs Blair acts as an adviser to NSO Group on business and human rights related issues.\nA senior member of NSO's management team called Mrs Blair from Israel on 5 August 2020 to inform her that \"it had come to their attention that their software may have been misused to monitor the mobile phones of Baroness Shackleton and HRH Princess Haya\".\nThe NSO staff member then told Mrs Blair that those phones could no longer be accessed using NSO software and they asked for her help in contacting Baroness Shackleton.\nNSO, which has previously been accused by human rights groups of enabling autocratic states to carry out intrusive surveillance of dissidents and journalists, has insisted in public statements that it only supplied its spyware to enable governments to counter criminals and terrorists.\nNSO is believed to have terminated its contract with the UAE.\nThe hack took place during a critical phase in Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya's divorce custody case at the High Court in the summer of last year. \nThe guardian appointed for her children said it \"impacts crucially on the mother and her wellbeing. It is a very pernicious experience if the mother has been subjected to surveillance of the type that she understands that she has been\".\nPrincess Haya's legal team told the court that \"the mother has been living in fear of her life frankly, and in fear of the children's security since April of [2019]\".\nThe court also heard how Sheikh Mohammed had attempted to buy a property in Surrey, Parkwood Estate, so close to his ex-wife's home at Castlewood, that \"if anyone chose to use it, it is in prime position for direct or electronic surveillance\".\nHer legal team said \"there is a powerful objective case as to why the mother should be genuinely in fear if the father has access to a property overbearing her own\".\nReferring to the proposed property purchase, Princess Haya told the court: \"It feels as if I am being stalked, that there is literally nowhere for me to go to be safe from (the father), or those acting in his interests. It is hugely oppressive.\" \nSheikh Mohammed, a close ally of Britain's and a billionaire racehorse owner, was found by the High Court in March 2020 to have threatened and intimidated Princess Haya.\nThe court also found proven allegations that he kidnapped and forcibly returned to Dubai two of his own daughters, Sheikha Latifa and Sheikha Shamsa. \nThis February, BBC Panorama obtained secretly filmed footage of Sheikha Latifa saying she was imprisoned by her father in a villa converted into a jail.\nShe recounted how she had attempted to escape her family by boat in 2018 but was recaptured by armed men off the coast of India, tranquilised and forcibly returned to Dubai. \nThe UN later demanded to see proof she was alive and well. \nPhotographs have since been posted on social media showing her accompanied by female friends in a Dubai mall, and holidaying in Madrid and Iceland. \nHuman rights campaigners remain suspicious that she is still not at liberty or able to speak freely.\nA law firm saying it is acting on her behalf has asked the media to leave her alone.\nDuring the recent hearings in the High Court, Princess Haya's legal team said that previous abductions were made possible by hacking, which \"enabled the identification of the whereabouts of Princess Latifa and she was then rendered back to Dubai\". \nPrincess Haya, a daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and half-sister of King Abdullah II, fled Dubai in 2019 for Britain along with her two children after learning that her husband had ordered the abduction of Sheikha Latifa and Sheikha Shamsa. \nShe has since said she is living in fear of her life after receiving threatening messages from agents of her former husband. \nNow her legal team is accusing agents of the Emirate of Dubai of acting on his behalf in hacking the phones of Princess Haya, her solicitors, Baroness Shackleton and Nick Manners, as well as her personal assistant and two members of her security staff. \nThe hacking took place in July and August 2020 \"at a time of significant events\" in the court proceedings when hearings were taking place over the welfare of the children.\nThe judgment concluded that \"the allegations of hacking came before the court at a time when it had already made very serious findings against the father\".\nDuring the long-running custody case at the High Court, Sheikh Mohammed has tried on several occasions through appeals to keep details of the allegations against him out of the public eye. But both in March 2020 and now, in October 2021, they have been made public, although he did not seek to appeal the most recent order permitting publication of these judgments. \nWednesday's ruling that, despite his denials, a sovereign ruler has interfered in the course of British justice by ordering the hacking of UK phones, including of a member of the House of Lords is both shocking, embarrassing and damaging to Sheikh Mohammed's international reputation.\nSumming up the hacking allegations made by Princess Haya, her barrister Nicholas Cusworth QC told the court: \"It is now clear, essentially, that the mother is engaged in a terrible game, a terrible life or death game of grandmother's footsteps in the dark. While she seeks answers about property purchases, hackers apparently get to work interfering with her privileged communications.\"\nAfter the publication of the judgments Sheikh Mohammed said in a statement: \"I have always denied the allegations made against me and I continue to do so. These matters concern supposed operations of state security. \n\"As a head of government involved in private family proceedings, it was not appropriate for me to provide evidence on such sensitive matters either personally or via my advisers in a foreign court.\"\nHe added: \"Neither the Emirate of Dubai nor the UAE are party to these proceedings and they did not participate in the hearing. The findings are therefore inevitably based on an incomplete picture.\n\"In addition, the findings were based on evidence that was not disclosed to me or my advisers. I therefore maintain that they were made in a manner which was unfair.\"\nEmbarrassing as this is for Sheikh Mohammed, there is little or no prospect of his ever having to face any police questioning. \nAs Dubai's sovereign ruler, he remains a huge figure in the equestrian world, he owns extensive properties in the UK and has been photographed with the Queen at race meetings such as Ascot. The emirate of Dubai is home to around 100,000 British expatriates and both he and the wider UAE government are considered close allies of the UK. \nThe story is unlikely to get much coverage in the government-monitored media in the UAE, and here in London the UAE Embassy has declined to comment on the case, saying it is a private family matter. \nThe sheikh himself has sovereign immunity from any future potential prosecution."

      "text": "Boris Johnson is to promise that his government will show more \"guts\" than any before as it works to deal with issues facing society and the economy.\nIn his Conservative Party conference speech, the prime minister will pledge to move the entire UK towards high-wage, high-skill employment.\nAnd he will accuse previous Labour and Tory governments of \"delay and dither\".\nHis speech, expected at 11.30 BST, will be his first to the Conservative audience since before the pandemic.\nThis week's conference in Manchester has taken place amid concerns over rising inflation, supply chain problems, and petrol and worker shortages.\nBut on Tuesday, the prime minister told the BBC he was \"not worried\" about current problems, arguing that the economy was under short-term stress as it recovered from the worst of Covid.\nHe will use his speech to proclaim an optimistic, combative message to Conservatives, and the wider electorate.\n\"After decades of drift and dither this reforming government, this can-do government that got Brexit done, is getting the vaccine rollout done and is going to get social care done,\" he will say.\n\"We are dealing with the biggest underlying issues of our economy and society, the problems that no government has had the guts to tackle before.\"\nMr Johnson's conference speech last year was viewed only online because of Covid restrictions.\nBut he will deliver his address this year in front of a packed conference hall, with some delegates queuing from the early morning to secure their place. \nThis year's comes on the same day that the government officially ends the \u00a320-a-week universal credit top-up brought in to help low-income households during the pandemic.\nAnd it follows the announcement last month of an extra tax to fund social care and the NHS in England, which has prompted anger among some Conservative MPs.\nThere are some underlying tensions between what's going on in this conference and what's happening in parts of the country.\nBoris Johnson is trying to sell a new economic vision - his post-Brexit realignment.\nGone, the PM says, is mass immigration, to be replaced with higher wages and better conditions to encourage people into key sectors.\nWhat's happening just now, says Mr Johnson, is stresses and strains after the pandemic.\nBut for many people life feels a bit uncertain. Costs are rising. Inflation is a worry. Universal credit is being reduced for millions.\nThere are fears in the Conservative Party too about the cost of living over winter. \nSo while Mr Johnson sells his economic plan for the future, many will want assurances about the next few weeks and months.\nWhen he addresses the Manchester conference, the prime minister will restate his commitment to \"level up\" all areas of the UK - a pledge credited with helping his party take many previously Labour-held seats in northern England and the Midlands at the 2019 general election.\nHe will say the country is moving \"towards a high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy\", in which \"everyone can take pride in their work and the quality of their work\".\nMr Johnson will say \"talent, genius, flair, imagination, enthusiasm\" are \"evenly distributed around this country\", adding: \"There is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others, or why people should feel they have to move away from their loved ones, or communities to reach their potential.\"\nThis, he will argue, will take \"pressure off parts of the overheating South East, while simultaneously offering hope and opportunity to those areas that have felt left behind\".\nThe prime minister is not expected to make an announcement on raising the level of the national living wage. \nThe Low Pay Commission is expected to make a recommendation on a national living wage later this month, ahead of the Budget, but earlier this year, the commission predicted it would recommend a rate of \u00a39.42 an hour from April 2022.\nSome Conservative supporters have raised concerns that the party might be regarded as neglecting its traditional heartlands in favour of its newly conquered former Labour seats.\nThe loss of the previously true-blue constituency of Chesham and Amersham, Buckinghamshire, to the Liberal Democrats in a by-election in June added to those worries.\nBut Mr Johnson will argue that altering society in the wake of Brexit will benefit the whole UK.\n\"We are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity, all of it enabled and assisted by uncontrolled immigration,\" he will say.\nInstead of using migrant labour to keep wages down, he will say, the system must work to \"allow people of talent to come to this country, but not to use immigration as an excuse for failure to invest in people, in skills and in the equipment or machinery they need to do their jobs\".\nOn Sunday the government announced that 300 temporary visas would be issued to overseas lorry drivers to ease fuel shortages.\nSome 4,700 visas intended for foreign food haulage drivers are being extended, as well as 5,500 for foreign poultry workers."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has promised to \"get on with the job\" of uniting and levelling up the UK, in a speech to the Conservative Party conference.\nIn an upbeat address peppered with jokes, but light on new policy, the prime minister claimed a high-wage, high-skilled economy was being created in the wake of Brexit and the pandemic.\nHe also defended tax rises to pay for the NHS and vowed to fix social care.\nThe 45-minute speech was his first to a conference since the pandemic began.\nIn it, the prime minister said the overwhelming Conservative general election victory in 2019 placed an onus on his government to deliver change demanded by voters.\nThe main theme of his speech was \"levelling up\", with the PM saying that reducing gaps between regions would ease pressure on south-eastern England, while boosting places that felt left behind.\nHe also repeated pledges set out at during his party's conference this week in Manchester to crack down on crime, improve transport links and broadband, and reform the housing market.\nAnd he sought to reassure Tories anxious about plans to increase National Insurance to pay for the NHS and social care by claiming it was what predecessor Margaret Thatcher would have done, if the economy had been hit by a \"meteorite\" like the pandemic.\n\"She would have wagged her finger and said that more borrowing now is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes later,\" he said. \nBoris Johnson is an optimist. \nThe prime minister wants a new economic model with better pay and conditions. He wants to persuade voters his is the party to distribute wealth and opportunity more evenly across the UK. He wants people to feel good about the future.\nLevelling up has been the slogan repeated by ministers at this conference. We only got a sliver of meat on the bones today. This was a speech thin on policy, big on jokes and rhetorical flourishes. \nConservatives love Mr Johnson because he makes them feel good - it's a strategy that is key to understanding his success as a politician. \nBut will it be enough? There are some difficult months ahead for many people. \nRising prices, supply chain issues, the end of the universal credit top-up and furlough. \nMany Conservatives acknowledge the cost of living squeeze - and are worried about the impact. \nCritics will accuse the prime minister of ignoring those big issues in favour of what they see as vague promises for the future. \nBut the hope in Manchester was that Boris Johnson's unflinchingly upbeat vision of a post-Brexit, post-pandemic Britain is as popular with voters as it is with Tory activists.\nThe Conservative conference has taken place amid concerns over rising inflation, supply chain problems, and petrol and worker shortages.\nBut Mr Johnson insisted that the present problems were the result of an economic rebound in the wake of Covid shutdowns.\nHe added that controls on immigration represented the \"change that people voted for\" in the 2016 Brexit referendum, while also promising to end declining home ownership among young people by building more housing. \nHe announced a \u00a33,000-a-year bonus for teachers, as an incentive for struggling areas of England to recruit maths and science specialists. The policy replaces a similar nationwide scheme that has recently been phased out. \nDowning Street said the new \"levelling up premium\" would cost \u00a360m, but no details have yet been given over which areas will qualify. \n\"There is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"You will find talent, genius, flair, imagination, enthusiasm - all of them evenly distributed around this country. But opportunity is not.\"\nMr Johnson referred to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who was recently photographed dancing in an Aberdeen nightclub, as \"Jon Bon Govi\" - an allusion to the rock star Jon Bon Jovi.\nHe also mocked Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he has frequently dubbed \"Captain Hindsight\".\n\"If Columbus had listened to Captain Hindsight, he'd be famous for discovering Tenerife,\" he joked.\nBut Sir Keir accused Mr Johnson of \"playing this game where he's pretending that he's just sort of just landed from the Moon and he's looking around and saying, 'Things look pretty awful around here, we need a bit of levelling up, things are so awful'\".\nHe told ITV's Peston programme: \"He and the Tories have been in government for 11 years, so we're in this state because of the way that they have governed the country.\"\nThe CBI business lobby group said Mr Johnson said set out a \"compelling vision\" but had so far \"only stated his ambition\" on raising wages. \nShevaun Haviland, who heads the British Chambers of Commerce, said firms supported the aim of a higher-wage, higher-skill economy but warned: \"This will not happen overnight.\""

      "text": "The maker of Quality Street and Lion bars has said it is experiencing some supply chain problems ahead of the Christmas period.  \nBut Mark Schneider, the chief executive of Nestle, told the BBC that it was working hard to make sure products made it on to shelves this winter.\nA number of sectors have had problems with their supply chains due to a chronic shortage of HGV drivers.\nFactors including global bottlenecks with shipping have also played a part.\n\"Like other businesses, we are seeing some labour shortages and some transportation issues but it's our UK team's top priority to work constructively with retailers to supply them,\" he said. \nWhen asked whether he could guarantee Quality Street would be in the shops this Christmas he replied: \"We are working hard.\"  \nNestle, which also makes Aero and KitKat, is the world's largest producer of dairy products - and works with hundreds of thousands of farmers around the world with millions of cows.  \nAhead of a major climate summit in Glasgow next month, chief executive Mark Schneider was in the UK to launch a range of non-dairy, plant-based alternatives to its milk and chocolate in an attempt to further reduce the company's greenhouse gas emissions.  \nAgriculture accounts for 20% of the world's greenhouse emissions and methane from belching cows is a major contributor. \nAlong with new non-dairy products, Nestle is also working with new types of feed for cattle that produce less methane per litre of milk produced.\nMr Schneider also admitted it was responding to the commercial reality of a market that has seen consumers - particularly those who are younger and more affluent - move away from dairy products to oat and soya-based alternatives.\n\"We think less meat and dairy is good for the planet, but it's also good for diet and health, and it is also a big commercial opportunity,\" Mr Schneider said.\nHe said that these alternative products would cost more than their dairy equivalents at first but that the cost would come down over time.  \n\"The first unit is always going to be a little more expensive, this is a hump you have to get over, and then at some point economies of scale kick in making them more affordable as we have seen in electric cars.\n\"Some consumers are willing to pay a premium now for products that pave the way for that,\" he said.

      "text": "First Minister Paul Givan has said he hopes Northern Ireland's government will not have to deploy contingency coronavirus plans to help manage health pressures this winter. \nThe executive will meet on Thursday to look at the remaining Covid-19 rules.\nThose include social distancing in hospitality venues and mandatory wearing of face coverings. \nMr Givan said he hoped there would be the \"headspace\" to approve more relaxations.\nThe executive previously agreed that decisions taken at its meeting on 7 October will take effect on 14 October.\nThe first minister said officials were continuing to monitor rates of transmission, and that there had been a \"marked decrease\" in the number of hospital admissions.\n\"In that context I would hope we can take further steps forward,\" he said.\n\"We'll then look to contingency plans should it become necessary - but I hope it isn't. \n\"I believe people in our society have the power to take sensible decisions, take their own personal responsibility seriously - all of that will help us avoid having to ever deploy a contingency plan over that winter period.\n\"But it is prudent that the executive makes plans for that and has tools at its disposal, should it be required.\" \nThe issue of so-called vaccine passports is also likely to be raised again at Thursday's meeting.\nLast week, Health Minister Robin Swann warned that a delay by the executive in agreeing a vaccine passport policy had limited options for easing more restrictions.

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson,Conservative Party Conference",
      "text": "Boris Johnson is to promise that his government will show more \"guts\" than any before as it works to deal with issues facing society and the economy.\nIn his Conservative Party conference speech, the prime minister will pledge to move the entire UK towards high-wage, high-skill employment.\nAnd he will accuse previous Labour and Tory governments of \"delay and dither\".\nHis speech, expected at 11.30 BST, will be his first to the Conservative audience since before the pandemic.\nThis week's conference in Manchester has taken place amid concerns over rising inflation, supply chain problems, and petrol and worker shortages.\nBut on Tuesday, the prime minister told the BBC he was \"not worried\" about current problems, arguing that the economy was under short-term stress as it recovered from the worst of Covid.\nHe will use his speech to proclaim an optimistic, combative message to Conservatives, and the wider electorate.\n\"After decades of drift and dither this reforming government, this can-do government that got Brexit done, is getting the vaccine rollout done and is going to get social care done,\" he will say.\n\"We are dealing with the biggest underlying issues of our economy and society, the problems that no government has had the guts to tackle before.\"\nMr Johnson's conference speech last year was viewed only online because of Covid restrictions.\nBut he will deliver his address this year in front of a packed conference hall, with some delegates queuing from the early morning to secure their place. \nThis year's comes on the same day that the government officially ends the \u00a320-a-week universal credit top-up brought in to help low-income households during the pandemic.\nAnd it follows the announcement last month of an extra tax to fund social care and the NHS in England, which has prompted anger among some Conservative MPs.\nThere are some underlying tensions between what's going on in this conference and what's happening in parts of the country.\nBoris Johnson is trying to sell a new economic vision - his post-Brexit realignment.\nGone, the PM says, is mass immigration, to be replaced with higher wages and better conditions to encourage people into key sectors.\nWhat's happening just now, says Mr Johnson, is stresses and strains after the pandemic.\nBut for many people life feels a bit uncertain. Costs are rising. Inflation is a worry. Universal credit is being reduced for millions.\nThere are fears in the Conservative Party too about the cost of living over winter. \nSo while Mr Johnson sells his economic plan for the future, many will want assurances about the next few weeks and months.\nWhen he addresses the Manchester conference, the prime minister will restate his commitment to \"level up\" all areas of the UK - a pledge credited with helping his party take many previously Labour-held seats in northern England and the Midlands at the 2019 general election.\nHe will say the country is moving \"towards a high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy\", in which \"everyone can take pride in their work and the quality of their work\".\nMr Johnson will say \"talent, genius, flair, imagination, enthusiasm\" are \"evenly distributed around this country\", adding: \"There is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others, or why people should feel they have to move away from their loved ones, or communities to reach their potential.\"\nThis, he will argue, will take \"pressure off parts of the overheating South East, while simultaneously offering hope and opportunity to those areas that have felt left behind\".\nThe prime minister is not expected to make an announcement on raising the level of the national living wage. \nThe Low Pay Commission is expected to make a recommendation on a national living wage later this month, ahead of the Budget, but earlier this year, the commission predicted it would recommend a rate of \u00a39.42 an hour from April 2022.\nSome Conservative supporters have raised concerns that the party might be regarded as neglecting its traditional heartlands in favour of its newly conquered former Labour seats.\nThe loss of the previously true-blue constituency of Chesham and Amersham, Buckinghamshire, to the Liberal Democrats in a by-election in June added to those worries.\nBut Mr Johnson will argue that altering society in the wake of Brexit will benefit the whole UK.\n\"We are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity, all of it enabled and assisted by uncontrolled immigration,\" he will say.\nInstead of using migrant labour to keep wages down, he will say, the system must work to \"allow people of talent to come to this country, but not to use immigration as an excuse for failure to invest in people, in skills and in the equipment or machinery they need to do their jobs\".\nOn Sunday the government announced that 300 temporary visas would be issued to overseas lorry drivers to ease fuel shortages.\nSome 4,700 visas intended for foreign food haulage drivers are being extended, as well as 5,500 for foreign poultry workers."

      "tags": "Dominic Raab,Sarah Everard murder,Women,Misogyny",
      "text": "Justice Secretary Dominic Raab has been accused of failing to understand the meaning of the word misogyny in an interview about violence against women.\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said \"insults and misogyny is absolutely wrong whether it's a man against a woman or a woman against a man\".\nMisogyny refers to a hatred or prejudice towards women.\nOpposition parties seized on his apparent confusion after he was corrected by the interviewer.\nLabour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: \"No wonder the Conservatives are hopeless at tackling violence against women and girls.\"\nLiberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Wera Hobhouse said: \"It's little wonder the Conservatives are failing to tackle misogyny when their justice secretary doesn't even seem to know what it is.\n\"These comments are an insult to the millions of women and girls impacted by misogyny and show just how out of touch the Conservatives are on this issue. \n\"Women and girls deserve better than these callous remarks.\" \nDuring the interview, Mr Raab reiterated the government's opposition to making misogyny a hate crime, arguing it would lead to \"criminalising insults\".\nCalls for misogyny to be made a hate crime have increased, following the conviction of Wayne Couzens for the murder of Sarah Everard, and such a move is backed by Labour and the Lib Dems.\nAsked on BBC Breakfast if the government would make misogyny a hate crime, Mr Raab - who was made justice secretary in September - said it was a \"legitimate\" debate to have but argued that it wouldn't \"solve the problem we've got\". \nWhen a crime is carried out against someone - such as assault, harassment or criminal damage - if it is proven that it was because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity, it is considered a hate crime.\nThere is no specific hate crime offence in England and Wales, but when a crime falls into one of the above categories, judges have enhanced sentencing powers and can increase the punishment as a result.\nCampaigners say sex and gender should be added to this list, arguing misogyny is one of the \"root causes\" of violence against women.\nMr Raab added that \"insults, and misogyny is or course absolutely wrong, whether it's a man against a woman or a woman against a man\".\nBBC Breakfast Presenter Sally Nugent told Mr Raab that the dictionary definition of misogyny is in fact hatred towards women. \nAsked to clarify his comments later in the interview, Mr Raab said: \"What I meant was, if we are talking about things below the level of public order offences of harassment, intimidation, which are rightly criminalised - if we are talking about, effectively, insults with a sexist basis, I don't think that criminalising those sorts of things will deal with the problem that we have got at the heart of the Sarah Everard case.\n\"Just criminalising insulting language even if it is misogynistic doesn't deal with the intimidation, the violence and the much higher level of offence and damage and harm that we really ought to be laser-like focused in on,\" he added.\nOne of those supporting making misogyny a hate crime is Sue Fish the ex-chief constable of Nottinghamshire.\nShe told the BBC it would be \"one vital step\" towards ensuring women are not subject to violence."

      "tags": "Companies,Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "High energy costs are forcing manufacturers to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers.\nIceland boss Richard Walker said higher energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now \"inevitable\".\nThe warning came as analysts predicted that household energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds next year.\nThey said the energy price cap, which protects domestic consumers, could soar by \u00a3400 in the spring.\nCornwall Insight forecasts that the energy price cap will rise to about \u00a31,660 by next summer.\nThat is about 30% higher than the record \u00a31,277 level for the cap set for winter 2021-22, which began at the start of October.\n\"With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September 2021 and a new level for the default tariff cap, the Great British energy market remains on edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation,\" said Craig Lowrey, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem said the price cap \"will ensure that consumers don't pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter\".\nBut if gas prices stay high, the price cap will rise, Ofgem said.\nThe regulator said its \"number one priority is to protect customers\", but acknowledged \"this is a worrying time for many people\". \nBut while the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices.\nMr Walker warned that Iceland's energy bill would go up by \u00a320m next year. Alongside higher salaries to address lorry driver shortages and other new costs, he said grocery prices would have to increase.\n\"It's inevitable that we will see price rises,\" he told the BBC. \"The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world. \n\"Our margins are very very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases.\"\nAndrew Large, director general of the Confederation of Paper Industries, said: \"This is a highly inflationary situation for the British economy and members will clearly be in a position where they do try to pass those costs on to consumers where they can.\"\nOne paper manufacturer, the Northwood Group, said the industry had been \"left to fend for itself\" in the face of \"horrendous\" knock-on effects from the gas price rise.\n\"The spike [in gas prices] that we have seen since January is equivalent to a 550% price increase, which of course destroys any industrial planning,\" said chairman Paul Fecher.\nLaura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said many of her member firms could even be forced to stop production \"due to uneconomic higher energy costs\".\nThis could cause \"severe damage\" to production facilities such as brick kilns, which could not easily be turned off at short notice, she said.\nMeanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said that by decarbonising the UK's power supply, the country will protect customers from volatile fossil fuel prices.\n\"The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,\" he told a conference organised by trade body Energy UK.\nHe said that the government's recent pledge to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 - 15 years ahead of the previous target - would help.\n\"Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nThe Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills.\nIt said that the next increase in the price cap, due to come in from 1 April 2022, could be \u00a3500 or even higher.\nFounder Joe Malinowski warned: \"If things don't settle down soon, increases of \u00a3600, \u00a3700 or even \u00a3800 cannot be ruled out.\"\nNine energy suppliers have already collapsed in recent weeks and more could be facing the same fate.\nThey were unable to keep their price promises as the wholesale price of gas soared. \nTheir customers have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds when they moved to a new provider and away from whichever low-rate fixed deal their supplier had offered.\nSome of the heat was drawn from the crisis on Wednesday when Russia said it would increase gas supplies to Europe.\nUK wholesale gas prices hit a record high during the day before falling after the Russian intervention.\nBut price volatility could continue as investors remain nervous about low stockpiles of gas across Europe.\nIf you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company.\nNormally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now.\nUntil recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available.\nThe cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase.\nSo for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter.\nThe energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThat includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas.\nThe cap was increased on 1 October, with about 15 million households facing a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nThat's a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by \u00a384, to \u00a31,042.\nWill you be affected by rising energy prices?

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nA \u00a320-a-week increase to universal credit, brought in to help people at the start of the Covid pandemic, is being withdrawn from Wednesday. Universal credit is a benefit claimed by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales - with almost 40% of them classed as being in employment. The government says higher wages, rather than taxpayer-funded benefit increases, are the better option. But these three women say the impact of the cut will be massive.\nScientists believe they can explain why some people who catch Covid develop chilblain-like lesions on their toes and even fingers. Covid toe seems to be a side effect of the body switching into attack mode to fight off the virus - and researchers say they have pinpointed the parts of the immune system that appear to be involved. The findings, in the British Journal of Dermatology, may help with treatments to ease the symptoms. Covid toe tends to affect children and teenagers.\nMandatory Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introduced in Wales on 11 October, after Welsh ministers won a knife-edge vote. The measures were passed with 28 politicians voting for, and 27 voting against. People going to clubs and big events will now be expected to show evidence of being fully vaccinated or having a recent negative Covid test.\nScotland's first recognised Covid outbreak, which was traced to a Nike conference in Edinburgh, did not result in community transmission. A Public Health Scotland report found a single case among the 71 delegates led to 38 further infections, mostly among people at the conference. It was reported to Health Protection Scotland on 2 March last year, but only became public following a BBC investigation. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon later hit back at suggestions that the outbreak was covered up.\nA concert is being live-streamed free to all UK care homes to thank staff for their efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic. The London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) is playing at the Forum in Bath on Thursday. The Care Quality Commission is promoting the concert, and has contacted care homes across the country to let them know it is available.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "text": "A Conservative peer who helped design the universal credit system has renewed her call for a vote on the end of the \u00a320-a-week top-up to the benefit.\nBaroness Philippa Stroud said it was a \"really bleak day\" for many families as the extra money is withdrawn from Wednesday.\nBut the new justice secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC the top-up was always meant to be temporary.\nExtending the booster payment would cost around \u00a36bn a year.\nThe government has said that spending has to be brought under control after unprecedented emergency interventions during the pandemic.\nMr Raab defended the withdrawal of the booster payment, insisting the government wanted to \"avoid the benefits and welfare trap\" and universal credit was designed to encourage people back into work.\nHe pointed out the \u00a3400bn ministers put into helping the economy, workers and the most vulnerable was \"clearly unsustainable\" in the long-term.\nBut the government has continued to help jobless people find work, he added, citing the \u00a34.3bn stimulus package unveiled by the chancellor last year.\nMr Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we've done - national living wage, personal allowance, the ending of the over-reliance on cheap labour from abroad which depresses wages - is so critical to our vision for the economy.\"\nUniversal credit is a benefit for working-age people and was brought in to merge six benefits - such as income support and child tax credit - into one payment.\nIt can be claimed whether a person is in or out of work and is drawn by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales - with almost 40% of them classed as being in employment.\nThe benefit is made up of a standard allowance - which differs according to age and personal circumstances - plus any additional amounts that apply, such as having children, a disability or health condition that stops someone from working.\nA \u00a320-a-week increase to universal credit was brought in as a temporary measure to help those on low incomes hit financially by coronavirus lockdowns.\nThe extra universal credit payment works out as about \u00a387 a month, or \u00a31,040 a year.\nThe scheme is officially due to end on Wednesday, but the exact date the money will stop being paid will vary depending on the day a person usually receives their universal credit.\nYou can read more here.\nBaroness Stroud, who is chief executive officer of the Legatum Institute think tank, told the same programme that their calculations showed the withdrawal of the top-up would push 840,000 people into poverty - including 290,000 children.\n\"There are people who are out of work who will move back into work, but there are also 450,000 who will move into poverty today as a result of this who have disabilities or who have children who are disabled,\" she said.\nBaroness Stroud reiterated her call for a cross-party House of Lords vote on the decision to remove the \u00a320-a-week top-up \"that would say to the House of Commons, think again on this issue\".\nShe previously told the BBC she would table an amendment to the Social Security Bill when it reached the House of Lords, but this has not yet happened.\nFor Nicola Flower, from Cornwall, the uplift in universal credit has helped her stay warm by paying for heating bills during her cancer treatment.\nShe told the BBC she has had to shield for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic and is still waiting for an operation.\n\"I had no choice but to go on it [universal credit],\" she said. \"It was a godsend because I wouldn't have managed otherwise. I have never been on benefits before in my life. I have always done three jobs.\"\nNicola, who worked as a seamstress, in a supermarket and as a cleaner, said the she knew the \u00a320 uplift was \"an extra\", but added with fuel prices and gas prices rising, she could do with the money.\nYou can read more here.\nCampaigners, charities, and MPs have called for the top-up to be made permanent to help those who are still struggling.\nThe Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) has urged the government to continue the uplift, saying food banks are struggling to support \"ever-increasing\" numbers of people.\nThe network - which represents 500 UK food banks and providers - says it is \"running out of options\" as volunteer numbers and public donations have dropped, food supply shortages have caused problems, and staff are already stretched to meet current demand.\nEarlier this week the homelessness charity Crisis warned that about  100,000 renters could face eviction when the \u00a320 booster payment ends.\nThe Labour party accused ministers of being \"complacent about the cost of living crisis\" amid concerns over rising energy prices and the end to the top-up in universal credit.\nIts shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned the end to the booster payment risked \"plunging\" people into fuel poverty.\nPaddy Lillis, general secretary of the shopworkers union Usdaw, said: \"It is shameful the government is removing this crucial lifeline for low-paid workers and their families; particularly as they face rising utility bills and national insurance increases, along with fuel and food shortages that are impacting the cost of living.\"\nHe urged the prime minister to \"do the right thing\" by cancelling the withdrawal of the universal credit top-up and \"committing to reforming a social security system that doesn't provide the support working families need\".\nBut the government has insisted the uplift to universal credit was always meant to be temporary and designed to help people through the toughest stages of the pandemic.\nIt added that higher wages, rather than taxpayer-funded benefit rises, would be the best way to tackle poverty as the country emerged from Covid restrictions."

      "tags": "Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Bulb",
      "text": "Together Energy is the latest UK supplier to collapse due to rising gas prices. \nTwenty-eight energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. \nMore than three million customers have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. \nOfgem said a new supplier will be found for Together Energy's 176,000 domestic customers, whose supply will continue without interruption. \nThe other companies which have already gone out of business are: \nAmpoweruk Ltd, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy Limited, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice, Goto, Green, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy Limited, Money Plus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy Limited, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Utility Point, Zebra Power Limited and Zog Energy.  \nFirms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices.\nIf your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. \nBecause of its size, Bulb has been put into an arrangement called \"special administration\". \nThe company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it means Bulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything. \nThe accounts held by the other failed firms are automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.\nYou can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff.\nOfgem has sent customers to the following suppliers: \nOfgem and Citizens Advice both recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch.\nThere's no need to cancel direct debits.\nIf you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks.\nIf you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business.   \nIt's unlikely. \nUsually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. \nBut at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nThose coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs.\nA tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust says simple changes to our homes and energy habits could help offset the current price rises.\nThe price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months.\nIt's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases.\nAbout 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland saw a 12% rise in their energy bills on 1 October, when a higher price cap took effect.\nOfgem has now said it will review how the price cap is calculated to make sure it accurately reflects the risks faced by companies. \nIt will publish its conclusions in February, and a new price cap will be announced before it is implemented in April 2022.\nIn Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, a number of suppliers have also announced price increases in recent months.\nA worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies has meant gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia have risen dramatically. \nSupplies of renewable energy in Great Britain were also reduced by the least windy summer since 1961. \nA fire at a National Grid site in Kent closed a power cable supplying electricity from France. \nRising gas prices also led to a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is widely used in the food and drink industry."

      "tags": "France,Brexit,Fishing industry",
      "text": "France has intensified pressure on the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights, warning bilateral co-operation could be at risk.\nThe government in Paris is angry that the UK granted 12 licences out of 47 bids for smaller vessels to fish in its territorial waters.\nFrench Prime Minister Jean Castex has accused the UK of not respecting its Brexit deal commitments on fishing.\n\"Britain does not respect its own signature,\" he told French MPs.\n\"Month after month, the UK presents new conditions and delays giving definitive licences... this cannot be tolerated.\" \nThe prime minister warned that all bilateral agreements with the UK could be at risk if the European Commission did not take a tougher stance on the UK government. No details were given, but the two countries have a raft of agreements covering defence, security and border controls as well as energy and trade.\nThe UK's Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said the government's approach has been reasonable and fully in line with its commitments.\nSpeaking at the Conservative party conference, the UK's Brexit minister rejected French claims that the UK was in breach of the Brexit trade deal.\nLord Frost insisted that 98% of EU applications to fish in British waters had been granted, adding that the UK had been \"extremely generous\". \nThe Commission said it was in constant contact with UK authorities to ensure all licence applications were dealt with as soon as possible. \"The UK has published its methodology and we are now discussing the differences with the British and Jersey authorities regarding the rights of the boats involved.\"\nBBC Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker says there is little sense that the Commission is poised to act, with post-Brexit relations in a delicate state as the EU prepares solutions for fixing the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol.\nFresh tensions surfaced last week between Britain and France over post-Brexit fishing rights.\nFrance was infuriated last week by the relatively small number of licences granted to smaller vessels, when Sea Minister Annick Girardin spoke of French fishing being \"taken hostage\" for political ends. \nThe UK said it would consider further evidence to support remaining bids for fishing rights.\nFrance on Tuesday repeated its threat to cut the UK off from energy supplies. \nA UK government document in July said that 47% of the country's electricity imports were from France.\nFrench Europe Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune told Europe 1 radio: \"The UK depends on our energy exports, they think they can live alone while also beating up on Europe and, given that it doesn't work, they engage in aggressive one-upmanship.\"\nThe Channel island of Jersey became a flashpoint for tensions last May, when French fishermen staged a protest outside the port of St Helier and two Royal Navy ships were sent to patrol the area.\nAt the time Ms Girardin threatened to cut off Jersey's electricity supply - 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France.\nFrench fishermen complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences.\nUnder an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice."

      "tags": "COP26,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Climate change,Environment,NHS,Bangor,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Welsh NHS needs to \"lead by example\" in the fight against climate change to avoid future health problems, say hospital staff trying to cut carbon emissions.\nAt Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, staff are volunteering after shifts during Covid-19 to work on green schemes.\nDoctors said major overhauls were needed to ensure the health service stops adding to global warming.\nNHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall said progress was being made.\nThe outgoing chief executive added that while the health service was under huge pressure, it must focus on climate change alongside the Covid crisis.\nThe NHS accounts for about 2.6% of Wales' emissions of planet-warming gases - a carbon footprint of approximately one million tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year.\nAt hospitals across Wales, concerned NHS staff are setting up green groups and working extra hours without pay to try and decarbonise sites.\nDoctors, nurses, pharmacists and non-clinical staff at Ysbyty Gwynedd joined forces in 2019 in a bid to make the hospital run more sustainably.\nThe team has planted trees and wildflowers, switched to less polluting anaesthetic gases, and initiated trials of reusable personal protective equipment (PPE).  \nJunior doctor Tom Downs - who founded the Ysbyty Gwynedd Green Group - said it had been \"something really positive to focus on\" during the pandemic.\nBut he said for staff, who may already be working a 70-hour a week, finding time to volunteer was \"a real challenge\".\nWhen BBC Wales visited the hospital, some of the staff involved came in on days off or after a night shift to show us around.\nConsultant anaesthetist Dr Lisa Hancock, who has been working on biodiversity schemes, including planting a new wildflower meadow, said she wanted the planet to \"be a better place\" for her eight-year-old daughter.\nThere are plans to plant 100 trees, with the idea that some of the hospital's mental health patients could help with the upkeep as part of their treatment.\n\"On a sunny day when you see the butterflies outside the ward, and hear the birdsong... it's harder to be sad,\" she said.\nThe group has also published cycle-to-work guides for staff to cut down on car fumes and successfully lobbied for new shower facilities.\nSome of the biggest transformations have taken place inside the hospital itself, including changing the gas used to put patients to sleep.\nThey worked out that using Desflurane for an hour to anaesthetise a patient, generated emissions similar to driving 320km (200 miles) in a car, whereas an alternative called Sevoflurane - which worked just as well - was like driving 6.5km (4 miles).\n\"We're saving the equivalent of driving 27,500 miles a month,\" consultant anaesthetist Dr Carsten Eickmann said.\nBut he said the scale of the emissions cuts required to tackle climate change meant major overhauls were needed from the top.\nIn recent heatwaves, temperatures had reached over 30 degrees in some parts of the hospital, and old single-glazed windows and a lack of insulation on the 1980s hospital site meant huge wastage of energy, he claimed.\nDr Eickmann said there needed to be people working in the NHS specifically on its climate change response, while Dr Downs added the health service had a responsibility to \"lead by example\".\n\"Just as the health workforce are on the front lines of the pandemic, they'll likewise be on the front lines of the climate emergency and the health impacts that we see from that,\" he said.\nDr Goodall - who is moving to a new job as the Welsh government's top civil servant after running the NHS since 2014 - said he welcomed a \"groundswell of support\" from staff.\n\"It's really important for us to recognise that this makes a difference to healthcare for the future,\" he said, pointing to the link between air pollution and a variety of diseases.\n\"We want to make sure the NHS isn't just asking others to act - we have a responsibility to be focused [on this].\"\nOn the calls for more action from the top, he said expectations had been set at a national level but all the different NHS organisations needed their own plans.\nWhile the NHS was under huge pressure, Dr Goodall said focusing on climate change would help make the transformations needed to services after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"The NHS, alongside all other public services in Wales, will need to step up and increase its level of contribution over the forthcoming years,\" he said.\nNHS Wales published its Decarbonisation Strategic Delivery Plan earlier this year, with targets to reduce emissions 16% by 2025 and 34% by 2030.\nBut the Welsh government wants the public sector as a whole to reach net zero emissions by the same year - so the document said this should be seen as a \"minimum contribution\" to that goal. \nIt proposes, among other things, that every building will have undergone an energy-efficiency upgrade with large scale renewable electricity schemes deployed and low-emission or electric ambulances procured."

      "text": "A \u00a320-a-week increase to universal credit (UC), brought in to help people on low incomes struggling through the Covid pandemic, is being withdrawn from Wednesday.\nThe government has always said the extra money was going to be temporary, but MPs, pressure groups and charities have argued it should be kept in place to help those who are struggling.\nWe asked three women how the reduction will affect their lives.\nAlthough the reduction in Harriet Duffy's UC payment is imminent, she can barely think about the financial impact. \"I feel overwhelmed,\" she says. \"I literally just take each day as it comes. It's been daunting.\"\nShe's been on UC since February last year. When hit by a car while cycling, Harriet fractured her leg, and was forced to leave her twin jobs as a door-to-door charity helper and call centre worker.\nThe \u00a320 uplift made a \"phenomenal difference\", she says. \"People have come to rely on it.\"\nAnd the money has been all the more important in the last few months. Harriet now has a four-month-old son. \"We are currently in temporary accommodation. I'm in a hotel until the 18th, but after that I've not got a clue where I am going to be.\n\"The accommodation has no access to laundry facilities - I'm using launderettes and living off microwave meals. This all comes at an expense. Losing that extra bit of income will be devastating.\"\nFor a start, Harriet says she won't be able to do basic things, like go to the launderette as often. With a baby, that could be a problem. She'd like to go back to work, but with such a young baby \"it's just not possible\".\n\"I'm completely aware this [uplift] hasn't always been part of UC and was only supposed to be temporary,\" she says when asked for a message to the government. \"But a lot people have become reliant on it during this time.\"\nFor Nicola Flower, from Cornwall, the uplift in universal credit has helped her stay warm by paying for heating bills during her cancer treatment.\nShe told the BBC she has had to shield for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic and is still waiting for an operation.\n\"I had no choice but to go on it [universal credit],\" she said. \"It was a godsend because I wouldn't have managed otherwise. I have never been on benefits before in my life. I have always done three jobs.\"\nNicola, who worked as a seamstress, in a supermarket and as a cleaner, said the she knew the \u00a320 uplift was \"an extra\", but added with fuel prices and gas prices rising, she could do with the money.\n\"When I was going through my treatment I was quite ill and I needed the heating on day and night so it allowed me to pay for that, otherwise I don't know what I would have done to be quite honest,\" she said. \"I would have gone into debt.\"\n\"I was quite ill, especially with the chemotherapy,\" she adds. She also suffers issues with her joints and fears the problem could get worse when it gets colder. \"I will need the heating on to keep my joints warm.\"\nNicola said she knows she \"physically\" cannot go back to doing three jobs and isn't sure if she could go back to two.\n\"If I had to go back to doing one job, my lifestyle would have to change dramatically,\" she said. \"I have no options at the moment, I'm not fit to go back to work.\"\nShe said the government had \"not got a clue how the average person manages, lives, survives\". \"I don't think half of them know how much a pint of milk is,\" she added.\nDeirdre McCausland was a secondary school teacher in England before moving to Northern Ireland. She thought she could get a job but \"fell into the benefits trap\".\nDeirdre said the \u00a320-a-week UC uplift made a \"massive\" difference to her. Her daughter may not have been able to go to grammar school without the extra cash.\n\"It got to the point where if I hadn't had the \u00a320 extra, I was contemplating putting her into a school where perhaps it was closer and the uniform was cheaper,\" she said.\nDeirdre's daughter needs to get the bus, but doesn't qualify for a weekly bus pass. \"As you can imagine, the money [\u00a320] goes a long way,\" Deirdre says.\nHer daughter wants to pursue a career in music, and the money is helping to pay for her piano and guitar lessons.\n\"That's what she wants to do in later life, and I may have to take something away from her. It will gall me to have to say to her: 'I need to make cutbacks',\" Deirdre says. The reduction \"will have a massive impact on my children\", she adds.\n\"When government is deciding these things, they don't speak to real people with real experiences. They don't realise the impact that will have on children.\"\nShe says there is a \"domino effect\" which means a reduction in benefits leads to debt, effects on adult and child mental health, and it perpetuates poverty.\nA government spokesman said: \"We've always been clear that the uplift to Universal Credit was temporary.\n\"It was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so.\n\"Universal credit will continue to provide vital support for those both in and out of work and it's right that the government should focus on our Plan for Jobs, supporting people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more.\"\nReporting by BBC social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan and Claire Jones"

      "text": "Next chief executive Lord Wolfson has said labour shortages could be solved by companies hiring overseas workers and paying a \"visa tax\".\nStaff were not available in the places needed and seasonal workers were difficult to recruit, he told the BBC's Today programme.\nNext has warned warehouse and logistics staffing is under pressure. \nThe comments are the latest in exchanges between the pro-Brexit Tory peer and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nMr Johnson said Lord Wolfson \"doesn't want any kind of control or restraint on the number of people that he can access from abroad to run his business\".  \nBut in response, Lord Wolfson said this was \"absolutely not\" the case.\nLord Wolfson suggested businesses could get visas for skills they \"desperately need\" and recommended that they should have to pay UK workers the same amount as overseas workers. To make this competitive, he argued businesses should have to pay a \"visa tax on top - lets say 7% of wages\".  \n\"We need to design a system that delivers the skills but at the same time makes sure UK workers are not deprived of opportunities that they might want,\" he said.\nHe added that this solution would \"ensure people are not being brought into the UK to undercut UK workers because they will always be more expensive and it provides the skills Britain desperately needs to keep its industry moving\".\nHe suggested that only UK businesses should be able to apply for these visas, rather than workers, and that it should not cost the employers more than recruiting in the UK. \nThe retail chain currently pays store sales consultants and stock assistants between \u00a36.55 to \u00a39.21 an hour and warehouse operatives between \u00a39.30 and \u00a311.26 an hour.\nAt Next, Lord Wolfson said that warehouse wages had gone up by around 60% in the last 10 years and 70% for Christmas wages, and added that \"wages have already gone up significantly\". \nBut, he said the firm was still finding that there were not enough workers in particular areas who wanted to move for short periods of time.\nLast week, Next warned of price rises and staff shortages before Christmas unless immigration rules were eased.\nIt also said higher shipping costs, particularly for larger furniture items, were pushing up its prices. \nThe company's warning over potential staffing issues during the festive period was made in its half-year results, which showed profit before tax was up by 5.9% compared to 2019 levels.\nThe firm said rising shipping costs had driven up prices by about 2%, with its larger home products \"bearing the brunt of the increase\".\nIt added that in the first half of next year, it expected prices to increase by an average 2.5%, with homeware prices up 6%."

      "text": "The boss of Intel says the US chipmaker is no longer considering building a factory in the UK because of Brexit. \nPat Gelsinger told the BBC that before the UK left the EU, the country \"would have been a site that we would have considered\".\nBut he added: \"Post-Brexit... we're looking at EU countries and getting support from the EU\".\nIntel wants to boost its output amid a global chip shortage that has hit the supply of cars and other goods.\nThe firm - which is one of the world's largest makers of semiconductors - says the crisis has shown that the US and Europe are too reliant on Asia for its chip-making needs. \nIntel is investing up to $95bn (\u00a370bn) on opening and upgrading semiconductor plants in Europe over the next 10 years, as well as boosting its US output.\nBut while Mr Gelsinger said the firm \"absolutely would have been seeking sites for consideration\" in the UK, he said Brexit had changed this.\n\"I have no idea whether we would have had a superior site from the UK,\" he said. \"But we now have about 70 proposals for sites across Europe from maybe 10 different countries. \n\"We're hopeful that we'll get to agreement on a site, as well as support from the EU... before the end of this year.\"\nMicrochips are vital components in millions of products from cars to washing machines, but they have been in short supply this year due to surging demand and supply chain issues. \nIt has led to shortages of popular goods like cars and computers and driven up prices - issues Mr Gelsinger said were set to continue into Christmas.\n\"There is some possibility that there may be a few IOUs under the Christmas trees around the world this year,\" he said. \n\"Just everything is short right now. And even as I and my peers in the industry are working like crazy to catch up, it's going to be a while.\"\nHe said things would \"incrementally\" improve next year but were unlikely to stabilise until 2023.\nIntel's expansion comes as the overall market for semi-conductors is set more than double in the next seven years to around $800bn. \nThe firm also hopes to secure subsidies from US and European politicians, who feel their reliance on Asia for chips could threaten national security. \nToday the US only produces around 12% of the world's semiconductors, while Korea's Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) account for 70% of global supply. \n\"It is clearly part of the motivation of a globally balanced supply chain that nobody should be too dependent on somebody else,\" Mr Gelsinger told the BBC.  \nIntel will continue outsourcing some of its chip-making but eventually hopes to make most of its products in-house. Competing won't be easy, though. \nChip-making is still far cheaper in Asia and Intel's rivals continue to expand. TSMC, the world's largest contract maker of semi-conductors, will spend $100bn on increasing capacity over the next three years while Samsung invests $205bn.\nMr Gelsinger said he is confident Intel can still regain its leading edge. \"This is an industry that we created in the US, Intel's the company that puts silicon into Silicon Valley,\" he said. \n\"But we realise these are good companies, they're well capitalised, they're investing, they're innovating together. So we have to re-earn that right of unquestioned leadership.\" "

      "tags": "Money,Ofgem,Energy industry,UK economy,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high before falling after Russia said it was boosting supplies to Europe.\nRussia President Vladimir Putin appeared to calm the market after gas prices had risen by 37% in 24 hours to trade at 400p per therm on Wednesday.\nUK gas was 60p per therm at the start of the year, but high global demand and reduced supply has driven prices up.\nThe high cost of wholesale gas has seen several UK energy firms collapse and halted production across industries.\nFollowing Mr Putin's comments on supplies, gas prices dropped to about 257p a therm later on Wednesday.\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the changing gas prices underlined the \"volatility in the market and the nervousness amongst investors about low stockpiles of gas across Europe\".\n\"When Putin's promises help calm the storm of rising prices which was pummelling financial markets, it's clear investors are desperate for any gust of good news blowing in,\" she said.\nThe surge in prices led to Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents steel, chemical and fertiliser firms, calling on the government to help keep businesses and industries running.\nIndustry leaders said surging costs had already resulted in steel production halting \"at times of peak demand\".\nLast month, US-owned CF Industries shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies because of the rise in gas prices, before the government stepped in to meet its operating costs for its Teesside plant for three weeks.\nThe shut down led to a shortage of carbon dioxide - a by-product of the fertiliser factories - which sparked warnings from food producers and supermarkets of shortages in the supply of fresh produce. The gas is to stun animals for slaughter and in packaging to prolong shelf life.\n\"We have already seen the impact of the truly astronomical increases in energy costs on production in the fertiliser and steel sectors,\" said Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group.\n\"Nobody wants to see a repeat in other industries this winter, given that UK EIIs [energy intensive industries] produce so many essential domestic and industrial products and are intrinsically linked with many supply chains.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"We are determined to secure a competitive future for our energy intensive industries and in recent years have provided them with extensive support, including more than \u00a32bn to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. \n\"Our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\"\nBesides industry struggles, a total of nine energy suppliers have collapsed in recent weeks, which has affected nearly 1.73 million customers in September alone.\nThe companies that have gone bust have been mostly smaller firms, which have been unable to deliver price promises to customers because of the surge in gas prices.\nFirms going bust has also had a knock on effect to auto-switching services, with Look After My Bills, famous for its popularity on BBC Two's Dragon's Den, \"pausing\" its operations, and fellow auto-switching company Flipper closing down completely.\nFlipper said in a statement that it had withdrawn from the market and was closing because it could \"no longer sustain the great savings\" its customers had \"come to expect\".\nMeanwhile, Look After My Bills said it was \"temporarily pausing\" its switching service, but would be \"back as soon as we can\" access energy deals \"right\" for customers.\nAffected customers have been told they will be switched to a new tariff by energy regulator Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier.\nIt has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm.\nJonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills.\nA higher energy price cap came into force on Friday, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nCustomers are protected from sudden hikes in gas prices through the energy price cap, which sets maximum prices and charges for those on a standard or default tariff.\nHowever, the next revision of the cap, which will affect bills from the start of April, is likely to rise significantly to reflect the greater costs faced by suppliers.\nAnalysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will have an annual bill of \u00a31,600 and the impact of the crisis could be felt into 2023. \n\"The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade by challenger suppliers has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,\" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey."

      "tags": "Companies,Tesco,Retailing,Supermarkets",
      "text": "Tesco has seen sales and profits grow faster than expected as Britain's biggest supermarket group shrugged off the pandemic impact.\nIn the six months to August, Tesco said it \"outperformed\" the grocery sector, but also flagged that the sales surge could now start to \"fall away\".\nBut it would still mean stronger profits growth this year than was first thought, a Tesco statement said.\nIt came as rival Morrisons said it was recruiting 3,000 staff for Christmas.\nThe jobs are in distribution centres and manufacturing sites across the UK, ranging from warehouse and production staff to pickers and packers, as well as other skilled roles such as fork-lift truck drivers. \nLike Morrisons, Tesco is adjusting to labour shortages and supply chain problems in the run-up to the key festive period. \nHowever, chief executive Ken Murphy said the company was \"in good shape for Christmas\", adding he believed the company's resilience was due to its \"long-standing partnerships with suppliers\".\n\"With various different challenges currently affecting the industry, the resilience of our supply chain and the depth of our supplier partnerships has once again been shown to be a key asset,\" he said.\nBut he told a conference call with journalists that there would still \"be bumps in the road in the run-up to Christmas. We're seeing our share of challenges\".\nAnalyst Sophie Lund-Yates, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said \"Tesco's enormous scale means it is weathering the supply chain crisis better than others. It is times like these when being the biggest fish in the pond really counts.\n\"The size of Tesco's distribution network also can't be overstated, which again gives the group the flexibility to deliver the goods at scale.\"\nTesco's group revenues jumped by 5.9% to \u00a330.4bn for the six months compared with the same period last year. Operating profits increased by 28% to \u00a31.3bn for the period.\nSales in the first six months of Tesco's financial year rose 2.6% to \u00a327.3bn, while UK like-for-like sales rose 1.2%, having risen 0.5% in the first quarter.\nAnalysts said Tesco was benefiting from its huge online business, from a pricing strategy that matched the prices of German-owned discounter Aldi on around 650 products and the success of its Clubcard Prices loyalty scheme, which offered lower prices to members.\nBut the company has again signalled concerns about possible food price inflation, following Tesco chairman John Allan's warning last month in an ITV interview that costs could rise by 5% this winter.\nBritain's biggest retailer is on a bit of a roll. Trading has been better than expected and with impressive results. Even Tesco Bank has bounced back to profitability. \nThe retailer says it has managed to keep hold of most of the new customers it gained during the pandemic after doubling its online slots. \nThe focus now is delivering Christmas amid a whole host of supply chain challenges. Boss Ken Murphy says Tesco is in good shape for the all-important festive trading and that the business has many unique advantages. For instance, it makes extensive use of rail to deliver supplies.\nTesco sends 65,000 containers across the UK by rail every year and it wants to increase that to 90,000 in the next few months to help mitigate the shortage of drivers. \nTesco's huge scale may also help it weather the storm, but Mr Murphy also expects \"bumps in the road\" ahead. \nJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said likely price rises, along with the HGV driver shortage, pointed to the future looking \"more uncertain\" for Tesco. \n\"The supermarket has already warned the UK government that the shortage of lorry drivers could cause severe disruption to deliveries, causing panic buying in the run-up to Christmas,\" she said.\n\"While this may push up sales temporarily, it also means chaos when stock runs out and rising costs for the supermarket, which it may struggle to pass on to its customers in a competitive market. \n\"Add supply chain disruption, an energy crisis, wage inflation and a lack of workers to the basket, Tesco has considerable headwinds in the final quarter of the year.\"\nMeanwhile, Morrisons said it was anticipating that Christmas trading would be busier than usual as \"customers try to make up for last year's restricted celebrations\".\nThe company said its new jobs, with pay starting at \u00a310 an hour, included both permanent and temporary roles. \nMorrisons underlined in its statement that it \"welcomed\" 16-24-year-olds, saying that full training would be given, so \"no prior experience is required\"."

It's also what fuels accusations that he isn't serious about the country's problems and would rather crack a joke than crack a problem. \nDon't doubt though for a moment that Boris Johnson is deadly serious about power and holding on to it. \nThere is concern in some corners of government, including among some cabinet ministers, that Number 10 is brushing away concerns about the economy too easily.\nIn our interview with the prime minister this morning he said he's \"not worried\" about the squeeze on supply chains, labour shortages or inflation. \nSpeaking earlier he said there was no crisis. And he's trying to use this moment to argue that what we are seeing are merely the birth pangs of a new economic model. \nBusiness will sort things out quickly, he believes, it's down to the market to fix it, rather than government to \"patch and mend\". \nBut talk to some of his colleagues, some of whom made their own warnings about specific economic pinch points before the summer, and you don't quite hear the same. \nWhen the prime minister displays a disregard for Westminster's conventions or politesse it's one thing. But running the risk of looking like you don't understand everyday concerns is another. \nThe polls right now suggest that the government is not being punished for queues at the pump or empty shelves. Johnson loyalists credit his political appeal that seems to defy natural gravity. But if prices continue to creep up and disruption continues, those feelings could turn. \nYou can't just tell people to cheer up if their gas bill is going up, their weekly shop costs more and they are losing \u00a320 a week from universal credit. \nAfter what they consider a successful first big foreign trip, and dominance in the polls, Downing Street is in a bullish mood. \nBut confidence can tip into complacency - a sentiment that few voters would reward.

      "tags": "Teaching,Conservative Party,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Labour has accused Boris Johnson of announcing a \"less generous recycling\" of a scheme aimed at luring more maths and science teachers to deprived areas.\nIn his Conservative Party conference speech, the PM said the \"best\" staff would get \u00a33,000 tax-free salary boost from the \"levelling up premium\".\nBut Labour said this effectively meant a return to recently scrapped early-career payments for teachers.\nThese were worth up to \u00a37,500 in areas of England with high educational needs.\nIn his conference speech in Manchester, Mr Johnson promised the government would work to bring better jobs and pay to all areas.\nBut he argued that, for this to happen, educational opportunities had to be spread more evenly.\nMr Johnson said: \"There is absolutely no reason why the kids of this country should lag behind and why so many should be unable to read or write or do basic mathematics at 11.\"\nHe added that \"to level up you need to give people the options, the skills that are right for them, and to make the most of those skills and knowledge you need urgently to plug all the other gaps in the infrastructure that are still holding people and communities back\".\n\"We are announcing a levelling up premium of up to \u00a33,000 to send the best maths and science teachers to the places that need them most,\" Mr Johnson also said.\nUnder the new scheme, teachers in the first five years of their careers will be able to get the payments if their specialist subject is maths, physics, chemistry or computing.\nDowning Street said this would cost \u00a360m over three years, with the money coming from new funding, and would support staff recruitment and retention.\nEarly-career payments, which initially applied only to maths teachers, were introduced in England in 2018-19.\nGiven to those in their third and fifth years in the job, they amounted to \u00a35,000, or \u00a37,500 in areas with high educational needs.\nIn 2020-21, the scheme expanded to include - with lower payments - maths, physics, chemistry and foreign languages teachers starting postgraduate teacher training.\nBut the scheme was scrapped for those starting training in the 2021-22 academic year.\nFor Labour, shadow education secretary Kate Green said: \"The Conservatives have no idea how to improve education and outcomes for young people. The premium announced today is a less generous recycling of an old policy that Boris Johnson's government scrapped just a year ago.\n\"Under the Conservatives, teacher vacancies have more than doubled, school funding will be lower in real terms next year than it was in 2010 and the promised \u00a330,000 teacher starting salary has still not been delivered.\"\nNatalie Perera, chief executive of the Education Policy Institute, called Mr Johnson's announcement that the government was reinstating targeted payments to get teachers into challenging areas a \"welcome move - albeit one that has come late in the day\".\nSam Freedman, a former adviser at the Department for Education, told BBC Radio 4's the World at One: \"It is a policy that existed, was introduced in 2018, lasted a couple of years and then was scrapped.\n\"So this is actually a kind of U-turn and they are bringing it back in a slightly tweaked form, which is certainly welcome because we have a serious recruitment problem and retention problem with teachers that this may do a small amount to help with, but it is not a new policy.\""

I am essentially just left in the dark, like, figure it out on your own.\"\nRebecca Logan, a former fitness instructor and nurse, is an advocate for long Covid sufferers in Northern Ireland.\nShe said the situation was \"desperate and inexcusable\".\n\"Since this time last year, I have been trying to get answers about when we will get health service help,\" she said.\nMs Logan said the situation was \"absolutely appalling\".\n\"Large numbers of working-age people have been left with no support or guidance from the NHS, while they become more and more debilitated.\"\nThe programme also features Newtownards pastor Mark McClurg who faced a life-threatening battle with Covid in March 2020 and still has long Covid.\nHe said: \"My faith is what I am. It's what's carried me through from ICU to this moment in time. \n\"And the amount of people who have continually prayed for me, that's just so humbling.\"\nThe Department of Health (DoH) said it intends to have new services for the treatment and assessment of long Covid available in all health trust areas by the end of October.\nHowever, the department admitted to Spotlight that it also has not yet collected the data required to assess what services are actually needed.\nAn estimated 20,000 people in Northern Ireland have some form of long Covid.\nMs McNulty suspects she caught Covid-19 while working in a pharmacy in March 2020.\nShe is no longer able to work or study, and had to end her three-year relationship with her Italian boyfriend.\n\"There is a fear that this could be forever. That this could be my life,\" she said.\nMs Logan now uses a wheelchair and walking stick because she can't walk far without being breathless.\n\"I hosted a meeting of people with long Covid the other night, and there were people so desperate and even crying,\" she said.\n\"People in their 40s, young children, all ages. People grieving the life they had before long Covid hit them, it's heart-breaking.\"\nIn the UK, long Covid is broadly defined as a condition that develops during or after the initial Covid-19 infection; continues for more than 12 weeks; and its symptoms cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.\nMore than 200 symptoms have been linked to the illness, but some of the main symptoms are: extreme fatigue, breathlessness, brain fog (neurological and memory loss), heart problems and severe headaches.\nMore than one-in-10 people in the UK who have had Covid-19 are self-reporting with long Covid symptoms, according to a recent survey by the Office of National Statistics (ONS). \nIt is estimated that about \u00a32.5m a year will be needed for long Covid support in Northern Ireland.\nThe Department of Health said there are difficulties collecting data on long Covid because of a changing picture in which some people recover but others become ill.\nInformation is now being gathered but it will be a number of months before there is enough to analyse, the department said.\nSpotlight's Living with Long Covid is available on BBC iPlayer."

      "text": "Britons will no longer be advised to avoid holidays to 32 destinations, including Bangladesh, Fiji, Gambia and Malaysia, the Foreign Office has said.\nThe change should make it easier for people visiting these locations to obtain travel insurance. \nThese destinations were not on the government's red list, but the Foreign Office had still warned against non-essential travel to them due to Covid.\nEarlier this week, travel rules in the UK were simplified.\nThe Foreign Office said this latest change in policy followed the \"improved public health in many countries\" and the \"decreased risk to British nationals\" as a result of the vaccine rollout.\nThe advice would apply except in \"exceptional circumstances\", such as if the local healthcare system was overwhelmed, it added.\nWhen the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country, all but a handful of travel insurance policies are invalid.\nIt will continue to advise against all but essential travel for all red list countries where the risk to British nationals is deemed to be \"unacceptably high\".\nThe government is also expected to announce on Thursday changes to the red list. There are currently 54 destinations on the list, including Mexico, Cuba, all of mainland South America, and southern and eastern Africa.\nThe inbound vaccination list - the list of countries in which a person can be vaccinated and this status is recognised by the UK - could also increase. \nPiece by piece, international travel is starting to open up. \nThis week, the UK government divided the globe into red and non-red countries, meaning that travelling to the UK from much of the world - for those fully vaccinated - became much simpler. The Foreign Office's changes will make travel easier too. \nAll eyes are now on the red list, particularly on regions like South America and southern Africa which have had restrictions from early this year. The travel industry has been pushing to reduce the list as far as possible. Will the government slash it or be more cautious?\nBut the red list isn't the whole story for those hoping to travel to the UK. \nThere are still many countries the UK doesn't yet recognise vaccination certificates from and travellers have to be vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen or AstraZeneca or must self isolate on arrival. As many countries used other vaccines on their populations, there's a danger that access to the UK could become split. \nForeign Secretary Liz Truss said: \"These rule tweaks will make travelling more straightforward, supporting businesses and families right across Britain - and allow more of us to see friends and loved ones with greater peace of mind. \n\"We're striking the right balance between keeping people safe which remains our priority and giving them the freedom to exercise personal responsibility, while supporting the travel sector as it continues to recover.\" \nOn Monday, the traffic light travel system was replaced by a single red list.\nRed-list countries are those the UK government says should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\".\nTesting rules are also being eased for people travelling from non-red list destinations who have been vaccinated in the UK, the EU, the US, or any of 18 other recognised countries.\nThe full list of destinations for which the Foreign Office has eased its travel advice is: Algeria; Armenia; Bangladesh; Belarus; Benin; Comoros; Tokelau and Niue; Djibouti; Equatorial Guinea; Fiji; Gambia; Guinea; Kazakhstan; Kiribati; Kosovo; Liberia; Madagascar; Malaysia; Marshall Islands; Micronesia; Nauru; Sao Tome and Principe; Senegal; Solomon Islands; Togo; Tonga; Tuvalu; Vanuatu; Congo; America Samoa; French Polynesia; and Ghana."

      "text": "Tina Turner sold the rights to her music catalogue, including hits like The Best and Nutbush City Limits, to music publishing company BMG.\nThe deal also sees BMG acquire the rights to Turner's name, image, and likeness for future sponsorship and merchandising deals.\nThe company did not disclose how much it paid, but industry sources said the figure would be north of $50m (\u00a337m).\nTurner said she was confident her music was \"in reliable hands\".\nThe 81-year-old is one of the most recognisable and vibrant stars in pop music history.\nBorn Anna Mae Bullock in Tennessee, she joined Ike Turner's band as a backing singer when she was 18. Within two years, she was the star of the show, and the duo scored a string of hits with future R&B standards like A Fool In Love, River Deep, Mountain High and Nutbush City Limits. \nIke and Tina married in 1962, but their relationship was turbulent and violent and she filed for divorce in the 70s.\nTurner's solo career quickly eclipsed that of her partnership with Ike, with five platinum albums including 1984's Private Dancer, which went three times platinum in the UK.\nHer biggest hits include that record's title track, What's Love Got To Do With It, The Best, Steamy Windows and the Bond theme Goldeneye.\nShe has received 12 Grammy Awards and will enter the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame as a solo artist in October - her second induction after entering the pantheon with Ike Turner in 1991. \nThe deal with BMG sees her handing over her share of the recording and publishing rights for those hits and dozens more, spanning the six decades of her career. Warner Music will remain the record company distributing the star's music.\n\"Tina Turner's musical journey has inspired hundreds of millions of people around the world and continues to reach new audiences,\" said BMG boss Hartwig Masuch. \n\"We are honoured to take on the job of managing Tina Turner's musical and commercial interests. It is a responsibility we take seriously and will pursue diligently. She is truly and simply, the best.\"\nHe said the company intended to introduce Turner's work to new audiences, particularly on streaming and music-focused social media platforms like TikTok.\n\"Like any artist, the protection of my life's work, my musical inheritance, is something personal,\" said Turner in a statement.\n\"I am confident that with BMG and Warner Music, my work is in professional and reliable hands.\"\nThe star has largely been in retirement since 2009, but interest in her work has surged thanks to the 2021 HBO documentary Tina, and a West End musical based on her life, Tina.\nShe is the latest artist to cash in on the value of their back catalogue, following in the footsteps of Blondie, Shakira and Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks.\nUniversal Music Group paid somewhere near $400m (\u00a3295m) to acquire Bob Dylan's entire songbook last year, while Neil Young made about $150m (\u00a3110m) by selling a 50% share of his music to London-based investment company Hipgnosis.\nThe deals give superstar artists and writers a guaranteed windfall, while the new owners collect royalties every time the songs are streamed, sold or placed in movies.\nThe pandemic seems to have accelerated the trend, with rock legend David Crosby saying he was forced to sell his songs to Irving Azoff's Iconic Artists Group in March because of his \"inability to play live\".\n\"I can't work ... and streaming stole my record money,\" he explained in a tweet while the deal was being negotiated.\n\"I have a family and a mortgage and I have to take care of them so it's my only option... I'm sure the others feel the same.\" \nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Police Scotland,Edinburgh,Sexism",
      "text": "The culture in an armed policing unit within Police Scotland was \"horrific\" and an \"absolute boys' club\", an employment tribunal has found. \nIt accepted evidence of a \"sexist culture\" in the armed response vehicles unit (ARV) in the east of Scotland. \nFormer firearms officer Rhona Malone raised the tribunal against the force alleging sex discrimination and victimisation. \nHer victimisation claims succeeded but the discrimination claim was dismissed.\nIt also found that Ms Malone was an \"entirely credible and reliable witness\", but the evidence of her former superior, Insp Keith Warhurst, was \"contradictory, confusing and ultimately incredible\". \nInsp Warhurst sent an email in January 2018 saying two female firearms officers should not be deployed together when there were sufficient male staff on duty. \nPolice Scotland apologised unreservedly to Ms Malone and said it would address the issues raised in the judgement \"as a matter of urgency\".  \nMs Malone told BBC Scotland she was \"extremely emotional and phenomenally grateful\". \nHer solicitor, Margaret Gibbon, described the employment tribunal's judgement as \"damning\". \n\"The employment tribunal's findings lay bare the misogynistic attitudes and culture within armed policing and the hostile treatment police officers face when they try to call it out,\" she added. \n\"Of equal concern is the employment tribunal's findings that it did not consider credible much of the evidence it heard from Police Scotland's witnesses, including testimony from high-ranking police officers and senior members of staff.   \n\"The serious issues this judgement brings to light need to be urgently addressed by Police Scotland\".\nMs Malone had worked as a police officer for seven years before becoming an authorised firearms officer (AFO) in Police Scotland's ARV team in 2016. \nShe was based in Edinburgh, Fettes Team 1, in October 2016, where she was one of two women in a team of 12 AFOs. Of 60 AFOs in Edinburgh's ARV division, four were women.  \nIn its judgement, the tribunal accepted evidence that there was an \"absolute boys' club culture\" within the ARV which was \"horrific\". It also found: \nThe tribunal also accepted that Insp Warhurst sent an email saying two female officers should not be deployed together. \nIn the email he referred to \"the obvious differences in physical capacity\" and said it made \"more sense from a search, balance of testosterone perspective\". \nBut the tribunal found that the instruction was not implemented, as staff were told it did not represent the views of senior management. As a result of this, it dismissed the direct discrimination claim.  \nIf the email had been acted upon, the tribunal said it would have been viewed as \"inherently discriminatory\". \nHowever the tribunal did accept Ms Malone's claims of victimisation. \nThese related to incidents including a threat of withdrawing her firearms authority, a suggestion that she could be transferred to Stirling, handling of grievances and a failure to investigate complaints. \nIn one of the tribunal hearings, Richard Creanor, a former firearms officer, said there was \"absolutely a boys' club culture\" that existed in parts of Police Scotland's armed response unit and also claimed Insp Warhurst had sent a message with a picture of topless women to a WhatsApp group of police officers. \nHe told the hearing: \"You have to understand the culture in firearms, they operate within their own rules.\"\nLawyer Stewart Healey, acting for Police Scotland, suggested to Mr Creanor during the evidence session that he \"had it in for Mr Warhurst\" and was making up the claims.\nBut the tribunal ruling accepted Mr Creanor's evidence and described him as a \"credible and reliable\" witness. \nThe tribunal judgement was also critical of two senior officers. \nIt found the evidence of Ch Supt Andrew McDowell's \"implausible\" in that the reason he gave for not investigating Ms Malone's complaint was because he \"receives thousands of emails\". \nThis was described as  \"wholly unsatisfactory\" in the judgement given Ch Supt McDowell's seniority. \nIn addition, the judgement said the actions of Police Scotland official Alasdair Muir were \"neither honest nor reasonable\". \nIn a statement published in response to the judgement Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams, of Police Scotland, said the culture in armed policing in 2017 and 2018 was unacceptable. \n\"Since then we have worked hard to improve standards but we know there is much still to do,\" he said.  \n\"As an organisation, our response when a dedicated female officer raised legitimate concerns was no where near good enough. I apologise unreservedly to Ms Malone for those failings and for the significant impact they had on her,\" he added. \n\"This judgement highlights serious issues and we will set out action to address them as a matter of urgency.\""

      "text": "Tesco has seen sales and profits grow faster than expected as Britain's biggest supermarket group shrugged off the pandemic impact.\nIn the six months to August, Tesco said it \"outperformed\" the grocery sector, but also flagged that the sales surge could now start to \"fall away\".\nBut it would still mean stronger profits growth this year than was first thought, a Tesco statement said.\nIt came as rival Morrisons said it was recruiting 3,000 staff for Christmas.\nThe jobs are in distribution centres and manufacturing sites across the UK, ranging from warehouse and production staff to pickers and packers, as well as other skilled roles such as fork-lift truck drivers. \nLike Morrisons, Tesco is adjusting to labour shortages and supply chain problems in the run-up to the key festive period. \nHowever, chief executive Ken Murphy said the company was \"in good shape for Christmas\", adding he believed the company's resilience was due to its \"long-standing partnerships with suppliers\".\n\"With various different challenges currently affecting the industry, the resilience of our supply chain and the depth of our supplier partnerships has once again been shown to be a key asset,\" he said.\nBut he told a conference call with journalists that there would still \"be bumps in the road in the run-up to Christmas. We're seeing our share of challenges\".\nAnalyst Sophie Lund-Yates, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said \"Tesco's enormous scale means it is weathering the supply chain crisis better than others. It is times like these when being the biggest fish in the pond really counts.\n\"The size of Tesco's distribution network also can't be overstated, which again gives the group the flexibility to deliver the goods at scale.\"\nTesco's group revenues jumped by 5.9% to \u00a330.4bn for the six months compared with the same period last year. Operating profits increased by 28% to \u00a31.3bn for the period.\nSales in the first six months of Tesco's financial year rose 2.6% to \u00a327.3bn, while UK like-for-like sales rose 1.2%, having risen 0.5% in the first quarter.\nAnalysts said Tesco was benefiting from its huge online business, from a pricing strategy that matched the prices of German-owned discounter Aldi on around 650 products and the success of its Clubcard Prices loyalty scheme, which offered lower prices to members.\nBut the company has again signalled concerns about possible food price inflation, following Tesco chairman John Allan's warning last month in an ITV interview that costs could rise by 5% this winter.\nBritain's biggest retailer is on a bit of a roll. Trading has been better than expected and with impressive results. Even Tesco Bank has bounced back to profitability. \nThe retailer says it has managed to keep hold of most of the new customers it gained during the pandemic after doubling its online slots. \nThe focus now is delivering Christmas amid a whole host of supply chain challenges. Boss Ken Murphy says Tesco is in good shape for the all-important festive trading and that the business has many unique advantages. For instance, it makes extensive use of rail to deliver supplies.\nTesco sends 65,000 containers across the UK by rail every year and it wants to increase that to 90,000 in the next few months to help mitigate the shortage of drivers. \nTesco's huge scale may also help it weather the storm, but Mr Murphy also expects \"bumps in the road\" ahead. \nJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said likely price rises, along with the HGV driver shortage, pointed to the future looking \"more uncertain\" for Tesco. \n\"The supermarket has already warned the UK government that the shortage of lorry drivers could cause severe disruption to deliveries, causing panic buying in the run-up to Christmas,\" she said.\n\"While this may push up sales temporarily, it also means chaos when stock runs out and rising costs for the supermarket, which it may struggle to pass on to its customers in a competitive market. \n\"Add supply chain disruption, an energy crisis, wage inflation and a lack of workers to the basket, Tesco has considerable headwinds in the final quarter of the year.\"\nMeanwhile, Morrisons said it was anticipating that Christmas trading would be busier than usual as \"customers try to make up for last year's restricted celebrations\".\nThe company said its new jobs, with pay starting at \u00a310 an hour, included both permanent and temporary roles. \nMorrisons underlined in its statement that it \"welcomed\" 16-24-year-olds, saying that full training would be given, so \"no prior experience is required\"."

      "text": "Record house prices and a lack of foreign travel may have helped an unexpected boom in one niche market. \nDemand for plots of woodland is reportedly soaring, with many buying land that cannot be developed.\n\"It's just so tranquil,\" said Iain Rich, 57, from his newly-purchased woodland in rural west Wales.\n\"I had my birthday party here recently, which was lovely, just a barbecue and a bottle of bubbly which we chilled down in the stream.\"\nHe and wife Helen enjoy nursing a campfire, surrounded by moss-covered oak trees dating back hundreds of years.\nThe only noise we can hear comes from a lone buzzard circling overhead.\nIt was disconcerting at first, when the last bar of phone signal vanished at least half a mile ago, but then it was peaceful.\nAs idyllic as their spot is, perched at the top of an ancient tree-covered valley, this was never their plan.\nLike so many other first-time wood owners across the UK, it was the pandemic that changed their path.\n\"I think, in all honesty, because we've both retired, our grand plan was to travel,\" admits Helen, 57.\n\"We had pretty grand plans, but that came to a sudden and grinding halt with Covid.\"\nIt was Iain who then suggested the couple look at woodlands during the first lockdown, after becoming curious about for sale signs he'd spotted while out cycling.\nSince then they haven't looked back, buying two neighbouring plots in just a few months.\nIt means many of their evenings and weekends are now spent battling brambles, but there are perks too.\n\"People who buy woodlands do it because they love it,\" said Iain.\n\"We get itchy feet when we haven't been. We just want to get the fire going and get the tent out.\" \nHe said they have invested about \u00a380,000, but \"it's been worth it for us\". \n\"Probably, as an investment, for the first time in our lives, it's actually working. We have children who also love the area.\"\nHelen added: \"We'll pass it on to the next generation and then, hopefully, they'll pass it on to next generation after that.\"\nUntil the pair bought their woodland, it had been left relatively untouched and unexplored for decades.\nThere are many vast clumps of land in private ownership, with no commercial or economic use.\nCompanies, such as the one Iain and Helen bought from, said it was gradually acquiring huge forgotten plots and selling them off in manageable chunks to wilderness enthusiasts.\nEven now, more than six months after buying their site, Iain and Helen own swathes of mysterious woodland they have yet to explore.\nThey hope hidden in the acres of brambles could be forgotten freshwater springs or clues to the woodland's use in centuries gone by.\n\"There is a lot of woodland across the whole of the UK, but particularly in Wales, that is undermanaged,\" explained specialist Chris Colley from Woodlands.co.uk\n\"Ancient woodland and more recently-planted woodland needs management. It needs tender care to maximise its environmental benefit and its value for wildlife.\n\"A managed wood will have more biodiversity than something that's been left alone untended.\"\nThe business Chris works for, and others, have said that woodland sales have skyrocketed since the pandemic, with almost all stock selling out.\n\"Up to the start of the pandemic it was a steady business, the average wood that would go on the market would probably take two or three months to find a buyer,\" said Chris.\n\"Since the pandemic, that has gone down to maybe two weeks, and we're quite often putting woods on the market now and they're selling within two or three days.\n\"It's a huge increase in demand for somewhere to get away from the world, to get away from the pandemic and to reconnect with nature.\"\nFor Katie de Silva, buying her small plot of woodland, nestled among towering poker-straight conifers in Pembrokeshire, was also an opportunity to reconnect her young family.\n\"My husband has always been a chef, and a very good one, so he's always had to work away and the kids hardly ever saw him,\" she said.\n\"When lockdown happened, it was amazing. We actually got to have six months together. I think it really opened up opportunities for us to become a real family again.\"\nThey had spent the first lockdown living in a flat above a shop with no outside space, so they looked into buying a patch of woodland for children Mia, nine, and Kai, six, to have \"adventures\".\n\"I thought it was a bit bonkers at first,\" said Katie.\n\"Also, we were planning to buy a house and I'd always looked for somewhere that had loads of outdoor space, but with lockdown, house prices soared.\n\"This has meant by having a piece of woodland, we don't actually need much of a garden.\"\nSome woodlands can cost hundreds of thousands, but most are smaller sites costing between \u00a320,000 and \u00a350,000.\nIn an effort to keep costs down, Katie's family bought their site with friends before dividing it up.\nThe fact they made a decision to purchase during the first lockdown in March 2020, meant they were able to rely heavily on the woods when tight restrictions returned again last winter.\n\"It was really tough that second lockdown,\" reflected Katie.\n\"This gave us a reason to get out, and to push through it, and to do something really great.\n\"Even in the middle of winter, when it was freezing cold, we could get the children out and they'd spend about eight hours down here digging and rolling and doing what kids do.\n\"You can go to the woods for free, of course, you don't need to buy one. \n\"We wanted to camp out and we love building things, and it's the pride in doing it, it's really important to us.\"\nLike retirees Iain and Helen, Katie and her husband bought their wood with one eye on the future.\n\"It's meant to be a piece of land that stays with us,\" said Katie.\n\"The children can enjoy growing up here. We're all nature lovers. \n\"This is a culmination of everything we always wanted to have. It really means something.\""

      "text": "Students and parents should have confidence in how grades in Wales will be awarded this year, the new education minister has said.\nGCSE and A-Levels will be decided by schools and colleges after exams were cancelled in a bid to avoid a repeat of last summer's exam \"fiasco\".\nBut one headteacher has said the workload for staff was \"extraordinary\".\nEducation minister Jeremy Miles said the \"right balance\" had been struck in \"extremely challenging\" circumstances.\nThe system for deciding grades descended into chaos in he middle of the coronavirus pandemic last summer after thousands of results were downgraded by examining officials.\nIt led to the previous education minister issuing an apology and abandoning the results, instead relying on teachers' original estimated exam grades.\nThis summer's results are being determined by teachers after exams were cancelled - but many schools have scheduled assessments to collect evidence for grades.\nThe head at one south Wales secondary said staff and students were under \"immense pressure\".\n\"There's around 30,000 grades that we as a school need to award to students,\" said Hugo Hutchison, head of the 1,700-pupil Monmouth Comprehensive School.\n\"For each of those 30,000 grades we need to write an individual subject record. It is an enormous amount of work.\n\"And for each of those grades, there are also a number of assessments, a number of papers that counts towards it.\"\nMr Hutchison said it felt the assessment model this year was like \"building an aeroplane, whilst we are already flying it\".\nIt said this was all at an \"incredibly difficult time\" for pupils who have lived through the Covid pandemic.\nRebecca Williams from the Welsh teaching union UCAC said her members were \"under strain\".\n\"The want learners to get their results and for those to be fair,\" she said.\n\"But doing that is putting immense strain on individuals and on the system as a whole.\"\nThe head of the Welsh exams body WJEC said he accepted reaction to how the grading system was working had been \"fairly mixed\".\n\"But I think the system coming together is trying to provide the best option it can under very difficult circumstances,\" said Ian Morgan\nMr Morgan said schools and colleges had been given \"flexibility\" to use a range of evidence to back-up grades, including tests and access to past exam papers.\n\"I think from the learners point of view, learners just want fairness,\" he added.\n\"From a parent's point of view, parents want to know that learners are being treat fairly and appropriately.\nMr Morgan said he recognised there were \"difficulties and pressures\" for schools implementing the grading system.\n\"I understand it's challenging and I'm not walking away from the challenge that it has created,\" he said. \"The schools and colleges know their learners best.\"\nWales' new education minister said he thought the grading system was \"deliverable\".\n\"I've seen an extraordinary effort put in to design a system with school leaders which is credible and equitable,\" said Mr Miles.\n\"So, that balance of trusting teachers to make the judgments they can make about the attainment of their pupils on the one hand, but also having a mechanism to ensure consistency across the system - I think that balance has been struck.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nBritons will no longer be advised to avoid holidays to 32 destinations around the world - including Bangladesh, Fiji, Gambia and Malaysia. The change, announced by the Foreign Office, should make it easier for people going to these places to get travel insurance. These countries and destinations were not on the red list - but the Foreign Office was still advising against non-essential travel to them because of Covid. It comes after travel rules in the UK were simplified this week.\nA Conservative peer who helped design the universal credit system has called again for a vote on the end of the \u00a320-a-week top-up to the benefit. Baroness Philippa Stroud said it was a \"really bleak day\" for many families as the extra money - which the government says was designed to help people through the toughest stages of the pandemic - is withdrawn from today. New Justice Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC the top-up was always meant to be temporary. \nBoris Johnson said former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would have warned against more borrowing to help public finances after Covid, because it would mean higher interest rates and taxes later. Addressing his party conference on dealing with the pandemic, he said the Conservatives had \"looked after the NHS for most of its history\" and could \"rise to the challenge\" and deal with the backlog of work.\nThe average gender pay gap of all firms that reported in the past financial year is 10.4% - the same as the average in 2019-20. Covid has had a disproportionate impact on women, who have been more likely to lose work and earnings during the pandemic. Of the companies that reported by 5 October, 7,572 had a pay gap that favoured men, 1,286 had a pay gap favouring women and 770 reported no pay gap. The BBC looked at a company's median pay gap - that is, the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man.\nBusinesses and music lovers have said they feel \"torn\" after the introduction of Covid passes for nightclubs and large events in Wales. Critics say the pass will divide society and make it harder for businesses to recover lockdown losses. But others, like 19-year-olds Lucy Rees and Holly Hermann, who used passes to get into a concert last night, say they feel safer going to events. \"I was really confused to begin with... but then it was easy,\" Lucy tells the BBC.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "text": "Amazon is expanding its presence on the High Street by opening its first non-food store in the UK.\nThe shop, in the Bluewater shopping mall near Dartford, will sell around 2,000 of its most popular and best-rated products.\nIt's called Amazon 4-star, because every item has been given more than four stars by customers.\nHowever, one retail expert said the shop could be \"muddled and uninspiring\".\nThis will be the first Amazon 4-star store outside the US, where there are already more than 30 outlets. \nThe range of products, which takes in books, consumer electronics, toys, games and homeware, reflects what Amazon customers are buying online.\nThere's a \"Most Wished For\" section, for instance, showing the most popular products from customers' wish lists. \nDigital price tags are used to ensure the prices are the same in-store and online. Shoppers don't need to have an Amazon account to use it. \nAnd customers will also be able to collect items ordered online as well as return items without the need for packaging and labels.\nAndy Jones, director of Amazon 4-star UK, declined to say how many more stores he plans to open in the UK.\nThis global giant is often accused of killing the High Street by undercutting traditional retailers and paying less tax.\nNow it's moving onto their physical patch as well. \nHowever, retail expert Natalie Berg said the Amazon move \"is purely about experimentation\".\nThe giant's aim, she said, is to encourage more online shopping.\n\"This is not about shifting more product; it's about baiting shoppers into Amazon's ecosystem,\" Ms Berg said. \n\"It's about getting shoppers to engage with Amazon's devices, reminding Prime customers of the value in their memberships, and offering additional choice when it comes to collection and returns of online orders.\" \nAmazon has already opened six grocery convenience stores in the UK with checkout-free technology. \nBut Ms Berg said the jury is still out as to whether the world's most disruptive retailer can do one of the most fundamental retail tasks - run stores. \n\"The 4-star concept has the potential to be a bit muddled and uninspiring,\" she said.\n\"The store features a smorgasbord of products, the result of Amazon's very scientific, data-led approach to physical retail.\n\"But when you strip out the high-tech touches, I struggle to see how it differentiates from any other retailer,\" says Ms Berg. \nLandlords, though, may welcome the move as they try to find new players to take on empty shops, driven largely by our shopping habits moving online."

      "text": "\"It's all about him\" is how one cabinet minister described Boris Johnson's week in Manchester at the Conservative conference. \nThe platform was his. The Tory party truly is his.\nHis closing speech was almost as much about entertaining the home crowd as outlining new policy. \nBut little matter, perhaps. In that room - at that moment - the prime minister was in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country, unafraid to weave together clashing political traditions.  \nA Conservative leader raising tax to pay for the health service, and cheered for promising to send protesters \"snugly\" to jail.\nThe size of his political personality and ambition leaves little oxygen for anyone else here, let alone air for the opposition to breathe.\nBut that alone can't be a match for the scale of the country's problems. Charisma is not a substitute for solutions for concerns firms and families hold right now.\nAnd away from this conference that persona can grate as well as delight. The prime minister says he seeks to unite, but is a divisive figure.\nOne of Mr Johnson's colleagues suggested that he's a politician on a bungee cord - he leaps to plummet, then soars to great heights, then drops again.\nThere are plenty of acute problems this autumn and, of course, unforeseen events that could drag him down.\nBut many Tories believe they leave Manchester tonight on their way to a fifth term in office - a modern record that the prime minister would love to set.

      "text": "A stink bug that can spoil crops and infest homes has been trapped in Surrey as part of a monitoring study. \nThe brown marmorated stink bug is native to Asia, but has spread to parts of Europe and the US, where it can destroy fruit crops.\nA lone stink bug was caught at RHS Garden Wisley this summer within weeks of the setting up of a pheromone trap.\nThe adult may be a stowaway brought in on imported goods or part of an undiscovered local population.\nDr Glen Powell, head of plant health at RHS Garden Wisley, said the stink bug may become commonplace in gardens and in homes within a decade.\n\"This isn't a sudden invasion but potentially a gradual population build-up and spread, exacerbated by our warming world,\" he said. \nIt's not yet clear if stink bugs are living undetected in parts of England or are rare visitors that hitch-hike in on imported goods or passenger luggage and survive for only a short time. So far, no eggs or immature bugs have been found that would suggest the bug is breeding and has set up home.\nThe bug has been caught only twice before in pheromone traps set up to lure it in by means of a natural chemical - in all cases as lone instances. The previous finds were at Rainham Marshes in Essex and in the wildlife garden of London's Natural History Museum.\nAccording to the department for the environment, Defra, the bug has been intercepted in the UK on several occasions - in passenger luggage flown in from the US, clothing and wood imports from the US, and stone imported from China.\nThe trap at Wisley is part of a national monitoring project led by a plant science research company, NIAB EMR, in Kent, and funded by Defra.\nDr Michelle Fountain, head of pest and pathogen ecology at NIAB EMR, said: \"[The] brown marmorated stink bug represents a significant threat to food production systems in the UK so it is crucial that we continue to monitor any establishment and spread of the pest.\"\nThere are more than 40 species of stink bugs, also known as shield bugs, already present in the UK. Most pose no threat to plant health and are not considered pests.\nBrown marmorated stink bugs, which have a distinctive rectangular-shaped head, get their name from the odour they emit when threatened.  \nIn the US, they can invade houses, clustering in their hundreds, and can be devastating for farmers, destroying fruit such as nectarines and peaches and feeding on a wide range of ornamental trees, vegetables and other plants.\nInvasive species cost the UK economy over \u00a31.8bn a year and can threaten the survival of other plants and animals. A Defra spokesperson said: \"The brown marmorated stink bug is not a significant threat to our crops - but as with all pests and diseases we will continue to monitor any threats closely.\"\nAnyone finding what they believe to be a brown marmorated stink bug is asked to take a picture and report the sighting at BMSB@niab.com or via email to Entomology@rhs.org.uk.\nThe insect can be confused with other species - more information can be found here.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

Fully enclosing the site would not be possible for some time, it added. \nThe Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and Memorial preserves the Nazi extermination camp set up on occupied Polish soil by Germany during World War Two.\nAt least 1.1 million people were murdered at Auschwitz in the four and a half years after it opened in 1940. Almost one million of them were Jews. The majority of the victims were sent to the gas chambers at Birkenau.\nIsrael's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial condemned what it said was an \"attack not only on the memory of the victims, but also on the survivors and any person with a conscience\".\nWhile vandalism at Auschwitz is rare, in 2010 a Swedish man was jailed for more than two years for plotting the theft of the infamous \"Arbeit macht frei\" sign that hangs over the entrance.\nEarlier this year the wall of a Jewish cemetery near the camp was defaced with swastikas and other Nazi symbols.

The phone didn't ring,\" the MS said.\nThey added that Ms Jones then offered Mr Davies another 30 seconds to get in touch before eventually deciding to proceed.\nAt the time of the vote on Tuesday evening Ms Jones said: \"We are holding the vote please, and we have made every opportunity possible for that... member to get in, including sharing my personal phone.\"\nShe later added: \"It is a member's responsibility to give themselves sufficient time to secure their Zoom connection in time for voting, just as it is for any member travelling to the Senedd to vote.\"\nOn Wednesday she declined to give Mr Davies a chance to make a personal statement to the Senedd, saying as he had shared it with the media it was already in the public domain.\nMr Davies later put the statement on Facebook, saying he was not able to call the presiding officer: \"I was already on a call at that time frantically speaking with Welsh Conservative staff members in an attempt to solve the ICT problems.\"\nWith the whole opposition against the plans, and Labour controlling only half of the Senedd's 60 seats, if Mr Davies voted there would have been a tie.\nThe new law would have failed to pass as a result.\nAsked about holding a re-run of the vote, Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers that that is \"not how democratic processes work\".\n\"You don't keep on having a vote until you get the answer that you want,\" she said.\n\"Actually this is a system that's been in place for about four months already. People have been using it throughout the summer. \n\"What we know is that the people of Wales want to be protected.\"\n\"We had a huge mandate as a result of the election because of our cautious approach.\"\nConservative Monmouth MS Peter Fox told the programme that a re-run \"would be a difficult thing to do\".   \n\"Democracy has a set of processes, and you have to follow them and, you know, sometimes you don't like the outcome of the decision or the circumstances in which you've created a decision. \n\"But democracy is what it is and if you start eroding that where are you ending up?\"\nFollowing the vote the Welsh Conservatives called for the ending of the hybrid arrangements.\nBut there was frustration in the party outside of the Senedd group of Tories.\nTory councillor David Fouweather, of Newport, tweeted that the Conservative group should have got their whip \"sorted\", adding: \"Letting Wales down. Abolish the assembly.\"\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth also rejected a re-vote. \nAnalysis by BBC Wales political reporter Adrian Browne\nParliaments, and governments, are generally reluctant to re-run votes because doing so can open a huge can of worms.\nDo so on this occasion and it's not hard to imagine politicians routinely queueing up for a re-vote on this or that issue, conjuring up ingenious, or not so ingenious, arguments as to why.\nThe Senedd authorities insist there was no failure on their part to allow every Senedd member a fair chance to vote on Covid passes, and therefore there is no case for a re-match.\nThis was down to a particular Conservative member, Gareth Davies, not doing what he needed to do to vote, they say.\nMr Davies, of course, disputes this.\nMistakes when voting do happen from time to time, by the way, but tend to go unnoticed by the world at large because there are usually no significant consequences.\nHowever, fifteen years ago the Labour Welsh health minister of the day, Brian Gibbons, caused great amusement by pressing the wrong button and, with help from a party colleague who failed to vote with Labour, accidentally backed an an inquiry into the state of the Welsh Ambulance Service.\nThat vote stood and all the indications are that this one will too."

      "text": "Australia is to stop sending asylum seekers to Papua New Guinea (PNG), marking an end to its controversial detention regime in the nation.\nPNG is one of two Pacific countries paid by Canberra to detain asylum seekers and refugees who attempt to reach Australia by boat.\nAustralia said its arrangement with PNG would conclude by the end of the year.\nBut it will continue its divisive \"offshore processing\" policy on the remote island nation of Nauru.\n\"Australia's strong border protection policies\u2026 have not changed,\" Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said on Wednesday.\n\"Anyone who attempts to enter Australia illegally by boat will be returned, or sent to Nauru,\" she added, without clarifying it is not illegal to seek asylum.\nThe 120 asylum seekers and refugees remaining in PNG will have the option to resettle there or to be moved to detention in Nauru.\nDuring Australia's eight-year presence in PNG, there have been major incidents of violence, including hunger strikes, riots and the murder of an Iranian asylum seeker by guards.\nIn total, 13 people detained by Australia in PNG and Nauru have died from violence, medical inattention and suicide.\nFormer detainee and refugee Thanus Selvarasa said the closure was \"a good decision, but eight years is too long and PNG is not safe for refugees to resettle\".\n\"We came to Australia seeking asylum, we were moved to offshore processing. They change policy each time, they are playing politics with our lives,\" he said in a statement.\nOther activists called for Australia to provide safe resettlement for the remaining men.\nAustralia has sent more than 1,900 men to detention centres on the island while their applications for refugee status were being processed.\nMany have languished there for years because Australia hardened its immigration law in 2013 to deny resettlement visas to asylum seekers who arrive by boat.\nAustralia argues its policies are justified because they prevent deaths at sea.\nBut offshore and indefinite detention has been widely criticised as harmful, inhumane and in breach of international law.\nRights groups and the UN have frequently criticised Australia's centres in PNG and Nauru for substandard conditions.\nIn 2017, Australia paid a A$70m (\u00a337m; $50m) settlement to over 1,900 detainees who had sued for harm suffered in detention.\nIt was also forced to shut its Manus Island detention centre, after PNG's Supreme Court decision ruled it was illegal.\nExperts say the closure of the PNG facilities had been expected as Canberra had not sent new asylum seekers there in recent years."

      "text": "An ex-firearms officer says she has been through \"absolute hell\" after an employment tribunal found evidence of a sexist \"boys' club\" culture in a Police Scotland armed response unit.\nRhona Malone's case was brought after a senior officer said two female armed officers should not be deployed together. \nHer victimisation claims succeeded but a sex discrimination claim was dismissed.\nPolice Scotland has apologised. \nIt said its response at the time was \"nowhere near good enough\" and will address the issues raised by the ruling as a \"matter of urgency\".\nMs Malone told BBC Scotland \"I've finally got justice, the acknowledgement I've been looking for.\"\nShe continued: \"I didn't want to leave my job, there was no reason for this, it was completely unnecessary.\n\"I didn't need to go to court for any of this, but they made it so difficult. They put me and my family through absolute hell and torture, for years I was in limbo.\n\"As a police officer I stood up for people's rights, I expected the same in return.\"\nBefore the tribunal action commenced Ms Malone says Police Scotland offered her a pay-out on the condition she signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) - a legal document to stop her speaking about what happened and from assisting any colleagues in a similar situation.\nMs Malone refused as she says this \"went against everything I believed in\".\nShe added: \"Because they [Police Scotland] have hidden behind NDAs, not dealing with the problem or dealing with the culture, this happened to me and it took my career away from me.\n\"It took my mental health away from me, I loved my job.\"\nIn its judgement, the employment tribunal accepted evidence that there was an \"absolute boys' club culture\" within the armed response unit in Edinburgh where Ms Malone worked. \nIt also found Sgt Rachel Coates, a former colleague of Ms Malone, was told by a senior firearms instructor that women should not become authorised firearms officer \"because they menstruated and that affected their temperament\".\nWhen Sgt Coates asked if female authorised firearms officer could wear trousers and a top, rather than a one-piece, so it would be easier to go to the toilet, the firearms instructor swore at her.\nThe outcome of Rhona Malone's case is a serious and embarrassing blow for the reputation of Scotland's national force, at a time when sexism within UK policing is under fierce scrutiny.\nThe employment tribunal has said she was a respected and committed officer with an exemplary record before she joined the firearms unit in Edinburgh in October 2016.   Less than four years later she had retired from the force on the grounds of ill-health.\nAfter hearing from serving and former officers, the tribunal has accepted that the culture within the armed response unit was an \"absolute boys club.\" That description came from a man - a former police sergeant.\nIt's accepted that a chief firearms instructor said female officers shouldn't be equipped with guns because menstruation would affect their temperament.\nThe tribunal decided that the evidence of the inspector whose email began all of this was not credible, and that Rhona Malone was victimised through a bungled grievance handling process, much of which involved a newly appointed female area commander.\nPolice Scotland has more than 22,000 police officers and support staff who on a daily basis perform a vital role, protecting the public and bringing criminals to justice.\nThe number of individuals involved in this one case was very small and major organisations lose employment tribunals from time to time, but Police Scotland is not just any old organisation and a firearms unit is not just any old department.\nIn its response to the tribunal's findings, the force has made no attempt to dispute any of this or play it down. Instead it said it's worked hard to improve standards and knows \"there is still much to do.\"\nLast year former Lord Advocate Dame Elish Angiolini QC raised concerns about discrimination within Police Scotland.  At the time, the Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said he was committed to improving public confidence in the force.  \nThat task won't be any easier after this case.\nThe tribunal also found that Ms Malone was an \"entirely credible and reliable witness\", but the evidence of her former superior, Insp Keith Warhurst, was \"contradictory, confusing and ultimately incredible\".\nInsp Warhurst sent an email in January 2018 saying two female firearms officers should not be deployed together when there were sufficient male staff on duty.\nIn the email he said it made \"more sense from a search, balance of testosterone perspective\". \nBut the tribunal found that the instruction was not implemented, as staff were told it did not represent the views of senior management. As a result of this, it dismissed the direct discrimination claim. \nMs Malone said she felt \"every department shut the door on me\" when she tried to deal with the issue when she was still employed by the force.  \nShe added: \"My reputation was really affected, I was being targeted because I was standing up for myself and they couldn't deal with that - all they wanted to do was protect their self interest.\"\nMs Malone claimed there was a culture of \"self preservation\" among senior officers in the force rather than getting to the root cause of any issues.\nAssistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said: \"It is clear the culture in armed policing in 2017 and 2018 was unacceptable. Since then, we have worked hard to improve standards but we know there is much still to do.\n\"Sexism, misogyny and discrimination of any kind is deplorable. It has no place in society and no place in policing. Everyone in policing has a responsibility to lead change so we better reflect, represent and serve our communities and improve the experience of officers and staff.\n\"As an organisation, our response when a dedicated female officer raised legitimate concerns was nowhere near good enough. I apologise unreservedly to Ms Malone for those failings and for the significant impact they had on her.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable Williams said the force would address the issues raised by the ruling as a \"matter of urgency.\""

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

      "text": "Pupils could face lower grades in 2022 as Qualifications Wales aligns its approach with England. \nAcross the border the UK government wants to wind unusually inflated grade levels back to pre-Covid levels over two years.\nThe Welsh regulator has confirmed next year it wants to see a \"midway point\" between the results of 2019 and 2022.\nThe plan is that by 2023 results will be back in line with those of pre-pandemic years.\nQualifications Wales chief executive, Philip Blaker, said GCSE, AS and A level students had faced \"unprecedented disruption\" over the past 18 months. \n\"We want to make sure that their assessments next summer are as fair as possible,\" he said.\n\"Next year we will see a return to normal assessments which provide a fair and consistent approach for learners.\n\"We have considered the fairest way to award grades, taking views from stakeholders across Wales and working with other qualifications regulators across the UK.\n\"Our approach will align with that taken in England. This means that results in 2022 will reflect broadly a midway point between 2021 and 2019 and provides a level playing field for Welsh learners, particularly those applying for admission to universities across the UK.\"\nMr Blaker warned people were living in \"uncertain times\".\nHe said: \"If circumstances change, and the exam series is cancelled we are putting contingency plans in place that will allow schools and colleges to award grades in an approach based upon that used in summer 2021.\n\"We will work with WJEC to inform schools and colleges of these plans so everyone is clear what needs to be done. \n\"We know that learners may be anxious and have concerns about the return to exams, which is why we are planning a range of communications to support them.\"\nA-Level students at Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy in Llanrwst, Conwy county, welcomed the move. \nFfion, 16, said: \"It's better we are going back to more normal grades as opposed to keeping going with the ridiculous grade inflation we have now.\"\nEben, also 16, said the experience \"will help us going forward\", adding: \"At the moment we only have one small experience of exams, of revising and preparing.\"\nThis year A level and GCSE grades rose, after being based on estimates by teachers. \nQualifications Wales said it had announced there would be exams in March, though there were calls for clarity over next year's exams in Wales from teachers and unions in July. \nIt said 2022 would act as a \"transition year\" to reflect the disruption to  learners' education caused by the pandemic.\nBut exams could yet be cancelled because of the pandemic.\nQualifications Wales said: \"If exams are cancelled, schools and colleges will be asked to award centre-determined grades to learners.\n\"The centre-determined grade approach would be similar to that used in 2021, but with some improvements to take account of the learning from this year.\""

      "tags": "Children,Vaccination,Malaria",
      "text": "Children across much of Africa are to be vaccinated against malaria in a historic moment in the fight against the deadly disease.\nMalaria has been one of the biggest scourges on humanity for millennia and mostly kills babies and infants. \nHaving a vaccine - after more than a century of trying - is among medicine's greatest achievements.\nThe vaccine - called RTS,S - was proven effective six years ago.\nNow, after the success of pilot immunisation programmes in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, the World Health Organization says the vaccine should be rolled out across sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high malaria transmission. \nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said it was \"a historic moment\". \n\"The long-awaited malaria vaccine for children is a breakthrough for science, child health and malaria control,\" he said. \"[It] could save tens of thousands of young lives each year.\"\nMalaria is a parasite that invades and destroys our blood cells in order to reproduce, and it's spread by the bite of blood-sucking mosquitoes.\nDrugs to kill the parasite, bed-nets to prevent bites and insecticides to kill the mosquito have all helped reduce malaria.\nBut the greatest burden of the disease is felt in Africa, where more than 260,000 children died from the disease in 2019. \nIt takes years of being repeatedly infected to build up immunity and even this only reduces the chances of becoming severely ill.\nDr Kwame Amponsa-Achiano piloted the vaccine in Ghana to assess whether mass vaccination was feasible and effective.\n\"It is quite an exciting moment for us, with large scale vaccination I believe the malaria toll will be reduced to the barest minimum,\" he said.\nConstantly catching malaria as a child inspired Dr Amponsa-Achiano to become a doctor in Ghana.\n\"It was distressing, almost every week you were out of school, malaria has taken a toll on us for a long time,\" he told me.\nThere are more than 100 types of malaria parasite. The RTS,S vaccine targets the one that is most deadly and most common in Africa: Plasmodium falciparum.\nTrials, reported in 2015, showed the vaccine could prevent around four in 10 cases of malaria, three in 10 severe cases and lead to the number of children needing blood transfusions falling by a third. \nHowever, there were doubts the vaccine would work in the real world as it requires four doses to be effective. The first three are given a month apart at five, six and seven months old, and a final booster is needed at around 18 months.\nThe findings of the pilots were discussed by two expert advisory groups at the WHO on Wednesday.\nThe results, from more than 2.3 million doses, showed:\n\"From a scientific perspective, this is a massive breakthrough, from a public health perspective this is a historical feat,\" said Dr Pedro Alonso, the director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme.\n\"We've been looking for a malaria vaccine for over 100 years now, it will save lives and prevent disease in African children.\"\nHaving just seen the world develop Covid vaccines in record time, you might be wondering why it has taken so long with malaria?\nMalaria is caused by a parasite which is far more insidious and sophisticated than the virus that causes Covid. Comparing them is like comparing a person and a cabbage.\nThe malaria parasite has evolved to evade our immune system. That's why you have to catch malaria time and time again before starting to get even limited protection. \nIt has a complicated life cycle across two species (humans and mosquitoes), and even inside our body it morphs between different forms as it infects liver cells and red blood cells.\nDeveloping a malaria vaccine is like nailing jelly to a wall and RTS,S is only able to target the sporozoite form of the parasite (this is the stage between being bitten by a mosquito and the parasite getting to the liver).\nIt is why the vaccine is 'only' 40% effective. However, this is still a remarkable success and paves the way for the development of yet more potent vaccines.\nThe vaccine, developed by the pharmaceutical giant GSK, is not going to replace all the other measures for controlling malaria such as insecticide-treated bed nets. It will be used alongside them to get closer to the goal of zero deaths from malaria.\nAnd it won't be used outside of Africa where different forms of malaria, which the vaccine can't protect against, are more prevalent.\nDr Ashley Birkett, from the Path malaria vaccine initiative, said rolling out the vaccine was a \"historic event\" that would \"take away fear\" from families.\nHe told me: \"Imagine your young child could be healthy one day and full of potential and then after the bite of an infected mosquito, while playing with friends or sleeping in a bed, they could be dead in a couple of weeks.\n\"Malaria is a huge problem, it's frightening and scary.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

As I understand, he disputes that he was present and was the gunman.\"\nThe 14-year-old is alleged to have lied to police by claiming he spent part of the day logged on to online school lessons, but records showed he did not attend any lessons after logging on at 08:30 GMT.\nThe alleged gunman was arrested a week later and said he knew of Keon but \"they had never fallen out\".\nHe also told police that he had gone to a friend's house and watched television until about 23:00 before booking a taxi home, but Mr Burrows told the jury: \"He gave the phone number for the phone he said he had used to book the taxi.\n\"There is no record of that number being used to book a taxi.\"\nThe prosecutor said the CCTV footage showed the other attackers were armed with large knives, with which Keon was stabbed repeatedly.\nKeon died in hospital about two hours after suffering eight sharp force injuries and an injury to a major artery.\n\"As I understand, they each dispute that they were present,\" Mr Burrows told the court.\nThe \"short and brutal\" attack lasted about 30 seconds, Mr Burrows told the court, continuing even after Keon tried to get up and run away.\nMr Burrows told the jury: \"He [Keon] was shot at whilst he was on the ground,\" adding the group continued \"hacking at him with large knives\".\nThe court heard a vehicle, which had been stolen and was on false plates, later crashed in Wheeler Street, Birmingham, where forensic evidence including a hunting knife was recovered.\n\"Plainly, it's obvious this attack was planned,\" Mr Burrows said.\n\"In short, the prosecution say, when you consider all the evidence from the CCTV and phone records, it is clear that these defendants are those shown in the CCTV, and that they were all involved in the murder of Keon Lincoln.\"\nMichael Ugochukwu, of Twyning Road, Edgbaston, Tahjgeem Breakenridge, of Oldfield Road, Balsall Heath and Kieron Donaldson, of Aston Lane, Perry Barr, all aged 18, are on trial, alongside two youths aged 14 and 16, who are from Birmingham and Walsall respectively. \nMr Donaldson, the court heard, is not alleged to have been present at the scene of the attack but to have \"helped and supplied weapons\".\nAs well as the murder charge, the 14-year-old defendant denies possessing a handgun with intent to endanger life.\nMr Breakenridge, Mr Ugochukwu and the 16-year-old also deny unlawful possession of a knife.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "'Chief dragon' is UK's oldest meat-eating dinosaur",
      "tags": "Fossils,Palaeontology,Dinosaurs,Natural History Museum",
      "text": "More than half a century after first being unearthed from a Welsh quarry, four small fossil fragments have finally been assigned to a new species of dinosaur.\nResearchers from London's Natural History Museum say Pendraig milnerae is the oldest meat-eating dinosaur ever discovered in the UK. \nIt existed over 200 million years ago, their analysis suggests. \nThe name Pendraig means \"chief dragon\" in Middle Welsh.\nThe animal was very likely the apex, or top, predator in its environment. That said, it wasn't exactly a giant. Think of something chicken-sized with a very long tail.\n\"It was a typical theropod; so, a meat-eating dinosaur that walked around on two legs, like T. rex or Velociraptor that you'll know from the movies, but much earlier in time,\" explained the NHM's Dr Stephan Spiekman.\nThis is one of those classic fossil stories. \nPendraig is described by just four, albeit beautifully preserved, bone pieces. A vertebra, elements of the pelvis and a femur. These items were originally pulled from a limestone quarry near Cowbridge in South Wales in the 1950s. \nTheir interesting features were occasionally discussed within the NHM, but then the fossil material somehow got lost in the vast collections of the museum, mistakenly stored with crocodilian remains.\nOnly recently were the bones recovered from the \"wrong drawer\" and recognised for their true significance.\nPendraig is really ancient. It's late Triassic in age. It could be as much as 214 million years old, putting it close to the base of dinosaur emergence. \nIndeed, Pendraig would have been a fossil when the previously mentioned T. rex and Velociraptor were still strutting their stuff in the Cretaceous, just before the asteroid struck to wipe them both from the face of the Earth 66 million years ago.\n\"We've only got these four fragments, but the preservation is fantastic. The fossil is completely three dimensional; it's undistorted,\" Dr Spiekman told BBC News.\n\"What's so interesting and important here is that we're getting to see the very early stages of the evolution of the dinosaurs. These animals eventually came to dominate the Earth, but in the late Triassic they were only one of several groups of reptiles that were living on land.\"\nThe geological study of the British Isles tells us that during this time, what is now the Bristol Channel region of the UK was a series of islands made from much older limestone that had been folded and pushed upwards.\nPendraig would have lived somewhere across the archipelago. \nHow this particular specimen died, we can only speculate. But its bones were embedded in a gryke, or fissure, in the limestone. Perhaps the dino fell in; maybe it was already dead and got washed in during a flood. No-one can say for sure.\nThere's a bit of a puzzle related to the size of the animal, which is on the small side of what might be expected. Dr Spiekman wondered if Pendraig might be an example of dwarfism, a phenomenon you sometimes see in species that are confined to islands and their limited resources. But the analysis in this case came to no firm conclusions. \nThe second part of Pendraig's name - its species name - recognises an influential figure in British dinosaur science: Angela Milner, who died in August.\nThe former deputy keeper of palaeontology at the Natural History Museum was associated with another major theropod discovery in the 1980s - an animal called Baryonyx - and was key in helping to bring Pendraig milnerae to light again.\n\"It wasn't lost for very long in the collections, but it was Angela we have to thank for tracking it down. She'd remembered seeing it and went off to look through the museum's drawers. And after three or four hours she returned to say, I found it!\" recalled co-author Dr Susie Maidment.\n\"Angela had a really influential career in UK palaeontology and was a huge loss to us here at the museum. We were some way through describing the fossil when she died, but we wanted to honour her by naming the fossil after her.\"\nPendraig milnerae is reported in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scientists believe they can explain why some people who catch Covid develop chilblain-like lesions on their toes and even fingers. \nCovid toe appears to be a side effect of the body switching into attack mode to fight off the virus. \nThe researchers say they have pinpointed the parts of the immune system that appear to be involved. \nThe findings, in the British Journal of Dermatology, may help with treatments to ease the symptoms. \nIt can happen at any age, but affects children and teenagers more commonly.\nFor some it is painless, but the rash can be extremely sore and itchy, with tender blisters and swelling.\nSofia, who is 13 and from Clackmannanshire in Scotland, was barely able to walk or wear shoes when she developed Covid toe earlier this year. \nOver the summer, she told BBC Scotland's The Nine how she relied on a wheelchair for longer walks. \nThe affected skin - usually the toes, but sometimes the fingers - can look red or purple. Some people develop painful raised bumps or areas of rough skin. There can also be pus. \nSome have it for months, others for weeks. \nOften, they will have none of the classic Covid symptoms, such as the persistent cough, fever and loss or change in smell or taste. \nThese latest study findings, based on blood and skin tests, suggest two parts of the immune system may be at play.\nBoth involve mechanisms the body uses to fight coronavirus. \nOne is an antiviral protein called type 1 interferon, and the other is a type of antibody that mistakenly attacks the person's own cells and tissues, not just the invading virus. \nCells lining small blood vessels supplying the affected areas are also involved, say the investigators from the University of Paris, France.\nThe researchers studied 50 people with suspected Covid toe in the spring of 2020, and 13 others with similar chilblains lesions that were not linked to Covid infections, because they occurred long before the pandemic began. \nThey hope the finds will help patients and doctors better understand the condition.\nUK podiatrist Dr Ivan Bristow said, for most - like the regular chilblains typically seen during cold spells and in people who have problems with circulation - the lesions usually go away on their own. \nBut some may need treatment with creams and other drugs.\n\"The confirmation of the cause will help to develop new treatments to manage it more effectively,\" he said. \nDr Veronique Bataille, a consultant dermatologist and spokeswoman for the British Skin Foundation, said Covid toe was seen very frequently during the early phase of the pandemic, but has been less common in the current Delta variant wave.\nThat might be down to more people being vaccinated or having some protection against Covid from past infections. \n\"Presentations after vaccination are much rarer,\" she said.\nCovid-related skin problems can appear quite a while after the acute infection and in people who have no other symptoms, so the link with the virus is sometimes not made, she said. \nThe British Association of Dermatologists has a list of skin conditions that might be linked to Covid."

      "text": "Next chief executive Lord Wolfson has said labour shortages could be solved by companies hiring overseas workers and paying a \"visa tax\".\nStaff were not available in the places needed and seasonal workers were difficult to recruit, he told the BBC's Today programme.\nNext has warned warehouse and logistics staffing is under pressure. \nThe comments are the latest in exchanges between the pro-Brexit Tory peer and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nMr Johnson said Lord Wolfson \"doesn't want any kind of control or restraint on the number of people that he can access from abroad to run his business\".  \nBut in response, Lord Wolfson said this was \"absolutely not\" the case.\nLord Wolfson suggested businesses could get visas for skills they \"desperately need\" and recommended that they should have to pay UK workers the same amount as overseas workers. To make this competitive, he argued businesses should have to pay a \"visa tax on top - lets say 7% of wages\".  \n\"We need to design a system that delivers the skills but at the same time makes sure UK workers are not deprived of opportunities that they might want,\" he said.\nHe added that this solution would \"ensure people are not being brought into the UK to undercut UK workers because they will always be more expensive and it provides the skills Britain desperately needs to keep its industry moving\".\nHe suggested that only UK businesses should be able to apply for these visas, rather than workers, and that it should not cost the employers more than recruiting in the UK. \nThe retail chain currently pays store sales consultants and stock assistants between \u00a36.55 to \u00a39.21 an hour and warehouse operatives between \u00a39.30 and \u00a311.26 an hour.\nAt Next, Lord Wolfson said that warehouse wages had gone up by around 60% in the last 10 years and 70% for Christmas wages, and added that \"wages have already gone up significantly\". \nBut, he said the firm was still finding that there were not enough workers in particular areas who wanted to move for short periods of time.\nLast week, Next warned of price rises and staff shortages before Christmas unless immigration rules were eased.\nIt also said higher shipping costs, particularly for larger furniture items, were pushing up its prices. \nThe company's warning over potential staffing issues during the festive period was made in its half-year results, which showed profit before tax was up by 5.9% compared to 2019 levels.\nThe firm said rising shipping costs had driven up prices by about 2%, with its larger home products \"bearing the brunt of the increase\".\nIt added that in the first half of next year, it expected prices to increase by an average 2.5%, with homeware prices up 6%."

      "text": "The wave of job cuts many expected at the end of the furlough scheme has not happened, early data suggests.\nThe number of redundancies proposed by employers in September was close to record lows.\nMany businesses with large numbers of furloughed workers say they have taken everyone back, and unions had not heard of major redundancy processes.\nAround one million workers were thought to be on furlough when the scheme ended.\nThe furlough scheme, where government paid a proportion of workers' wages when their employers couldn't, ended in September after 18 months.\nThere were concerns that many employers would not be able to pay their workers' wages when the scheme ended, and would have to cut jobs. \nHowever, the number of firms planning redundancies was still close to record lows in September. \nJust over 200 firms in Great Britain informed the government of plans to make redundancies in September, with a total of 13,836 jobs at risk.\nThis was a slight increase on August, but far below the levels seen last summer, and among the lowest numbers seen in data which stretches back to 2006.\nThese figures don't include smaller firms, because employers are only obliged to notify government when making 20 or more jobs redundant.\nNonetheless the fact that they file at the start of the process gives an early indication of how the labour market is developing.\nOther evidence also suggests that the number of job losses as a direct result of the end of furlough was lower than had been feared. \nThe Community, CWU, GMB, Prospect, Unite and Usdaw trade unions had not received news of any major redundancies among their members when contacted by the BBC this week.\nGoogle searches for 'redundancy' - another early indicator of possible job losses - showed a small increase at the end of September, but it was still less than a quarter of the levels seen at the worst of the pandemic last summer.\n\"With estimates of actual redundancies and of real-time online searches related to redundancy both lower than before the pandemic, it looks like the worst is well and truly behind us now on job losses,\" said Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies.  \nAround a million people were thought to be on furlough by the time the scheme ended, of whom around half were working part-time and partly furloughed, according to estimates from the Resolution Foundation think-tank. \nThe BBC contacted the 31 employers which claimed \u00a31m or more in June, the most recent month for which official figures have been published.\nNone told the BBC they were making significant numbers of redundancies, though some declined to comment or failed to reply. \nMany of the big users for the furlough scheme were airlines and air travel businesses, as international travel is still far below pre-pandemic levels.\nBritish Airways was the biggest user of the scheme, claiming over \u00a310m in June. It had brought all its furloughed workers back by the end of September. \nOther major scheme users Easyjet, Jet2, Ryanair, Tui, Virgin Atlantic, Hays Travel, Airbus, delivery firm DHL, air traffic controller NATS, baggage handler Swissport, plus Gatwick, Heathrow, Manchester and Stansted airports all told the BBC they are not making redundancies because of the end of the furlough scheme.\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss wrote on LinkedIn that \"the furlough scheme has been crucial to Virgin Atlantic and many other companies throughout the pandemic, helping us to protect as many jobs as possible.\"\nTravel firms have already shed thousands of jobs in the early months of the pandemic.\nWith a number of travel restrictions lifted in recent weeks, and more to expected soon, many in the industry are optimistic that further job cuts will not be necessary.  \nOutside the travel industry, J D Wetherspoon and Travelodge said they had already brought all their furloughed workers back in the summer. \nHowever, some the workers returning from furlough may have to work part-time for a while, if firms don't have enough work to keep them busy full-time.\nAnd workers at smaller employers may not be so fortunate as those at larger companies.  \n\"Six in ten furloughed workers were at firms with less than 20 employees,\" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"I do worry about the capacity of those firms to bring back staff on a full-time basis.\""

      "tags": "Money,Ofgem,Energy industry,UK economy,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high before falling after Russia said it was boosting supplies to Europe.\nRussia President Vladimir Putin appeared to calm the market after gas prices had risen by 37% in 24 hours to trade at 400p per therm on Wednesday.\nUK gas was 60p per therm at the start of the year, but high global demand and reduced supply has driven prices up.\nThe high cost of wholesale gas has seen several UK energy firms collapse and halted production across industries.\nFollowing Mr Putin's comments on supplies, gas prices dropped to about 257p a therm later on Wednesday.\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the changing gas prices underlined the \"volatility in the market and the nervousness amongst investors about low stockpiles of gas across Europe\".\n\"When Putin's promises help calm the storm of rising prices which was pummelling financial markets, it's clear investors are desperate for any gust of good news blowing in,\" she said.\nThe surge in prices led to Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents steel, chemical and fertiliser firms, calling on the government to help keep businesses and industries running.\nIndustry leaders said surging costs had already resulted in steel production halting \"at times of peak demand\".\nLast month, US-owned CF Industries shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies because of the rise in gas prices, before the government stepped in to meet its operating costs for its Teesside plant for three weeks.\nThe shut down led to a shortage of carbon dioxide - a by-product of the fertiliser factories - which sparked warnings from food producers and supermarkets of shortages in the supply of fresh produce. The gas is to stun animals for slaughter and in packaging to prolong shelf life.\n\"We have already seen the impact of the truly astronomical increases in energy costs on production in the fertiliser and steel sectors,\" said Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group.\n\"Nobody wants to see a repeat in other industries this winter, given that UK EIIs [energy intensive industries] produce so many essential domestic and industrial products and are intrinsically linked with many supply chains.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"We are determined to secure a competitive future for our energy intensive industries and in recent years have provided them with extensive support, including more than \u00a32bn to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. \n\"Our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\"\nBesides industry struggles, a total of nine energy suppliers have collapsed in recent weeks, which has affected nearly 1.73 million customers in September alone.\nThe companies that have gone bust have been mostly smaller firms, which have been unable to deliver price promises to customers because of the surge in gas prices.\nFirms going bust has also had a knock on effect to auto-switching services, with Look After My Bills, famous for its popularity on BBC Two's Dragon's Den, \"pausing\" its operations, and fellow auto-switching company Flipper closing down completely.\nFlipper said in a statement that it had withdrawn from the market and was closing because it could \"no longer sustain the great savings\" its customers had \"come to expect\".\nMeanwhile, Look After My Bills said it was \"temporarily pausing\" its switching service, but would be \"back as soon as we can\" access energy deals \"right\" for customers.\nAffected customers have been told they will be switched to a new tariff by energy regulator Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier.\nIt has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm.\nJonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills.\nA higher energy price cap came into force on Friday, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nCustomers are protected from sudden hikes in gas prices through the energy price cap, which sets maximum prices and charges for those on a standard or default tariff.\nHowever, the next revision of the cap, which will affect bills from the start of April, is likely to rise significantly to reflect the greater costs faced by suppliers.\nAnalysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will have an annual bill of \u00a31,600 and the impact of the crisis could be felt into 2023. \n\"The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade by challenger suppliers has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,\" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey."

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Climate change,Reality Check,Pensions,Conservative Party Conference",
      "text": "The Conservatives made a series of promises to voters in their 2019 election manifesto, which Boris Johnson campaigned on to win a big majority and become prime minister. \nAmid the upheaval created by the coronavirus pandemic, is the government on track to fulfil these key manifesto commitments?\nThe Conservatives promised this for England by March 2025. \nThe latest figures show there were 313,836 full-time equivalent NHS nurses and health visitors in September 2021. While that is up 17,743 since December 2019, it still leaves 32,257 full-time equivalent posts to fill over the next three-and-a-half years.\nOn GPs, there were 35,991 full-time equivalents in post in November 2021. That's up by 1,283 since December 2019.\nAnd if you exclude trainees and locums (doctors who temporarily fill a rota gap or who are not yet fully qualified), GP numbers have actually fallen by 72 since December 2019.\nBy either measure, an increase of 6,000 is a long way off.\nAsked about the target by the Health and Social Care Committee in November 2021, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"I definitely want to see that increase, but I am not going to pretend that we are on track when clearly we are not.\"\nThe Conservatives promised this for England and Wales by March 2023.\nThe latest figures, up to 31 December 2021, show an extra 11,048 police officers recruited. This is compared with 31 March 2019, the baseline the Home Office uses to track the 20,000 target. \nWith just over a year until the deadline, the government is more than half way to reaching its target.\nBut critics continue to point to the fact this does not compensate for the 20,545 officer reduction between March 2010 and March 2019 - under Conservative governments.\nThis promise was certainly achieved in a literal sense, as the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. \nBritain departed from the EU's single market and customs union 11 months later, after agreeing a basic free trade deal with its neighbours. \nBut if the slogan implied Brexit would be done and dusted, this has clearly not happened. \nA huge amount remains unresolved. Disputes about Northern Ireland and fishing rights continue to fester. \nFrom food exporters to musicians who want to tour Europe, many people are still struggling to deal with new bureaucracy. \nAnd severe labour shortages in a number of industries have roots in the decision to cut ties with the EU.\nA large number of trade deals have been signed around the world to replace the ones the UK had in Europe, but the promise of a quick deal with the United States hasn't happened.\nSupporters of Brexit say sovereignty has been restored, and unwanted regulations can now be cut. But taking back control is still a work in progress.\nEU citizens wishing to live and work in the UK now have to apply via a points-based system (PBS), the same as citizens from the rest of the world.\nA visa is awarded if an applicant qualifies for a certain number of points. Having a job offer from an approved employer for a skilled job and being able to speak English provides 50 points, for example.\nBefore Brexit, these reforms were not possible because the UK was part of the EU single market, which gives citizens the freedom to live and work in all EU countries.\nThe process has not been all plain sailing. Leaving the EU single market is one of the factors that has contributed to the HGV driver shortage, because EU drivers can no longer come and go as they please. The government has had to introduce 5,000 temporary visas for this sector. \nBut the PBS is in place, as promised. \nThis decides how much the state pension increases each year, depending on which one of these is highest:\nIt was introduced in 2010, and the 2019 Conservative manifesto said it would stay for the duration of this Parliament.\nBut this promise was broken on 7 September when the government announced it was suspending the triple lock for a year. Instead of rising with average wages - the highest of the three measures - the government said pensions would rise by either inflation or 2.5% instead.\nIt said the unique situation of the pandemic justified the move.\nAt the start of pandemic, many people were placed on furlough, which meant they were earning less.\nNow, as people come off it and return to full pay, this has been recorded as a large rise in average earnings - up 8.3% between May and July compared with a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. Under the triple lock, this would have meant a big rise in the state pension.\nThis promise has been broken. \nThe UK's annual aid budget has been reduced to 0.5% of GNI (gross national income) - a cut of about four billion pounds.\nAgain, the government blamed the pandemic - saying it had inflicted \"immense\" damage on the economy and cutting aid spending would help restore the public finances.\nIt says the 2015 legislation, which introduced the 0.7% target, refers to \"fiscal circumstances\" which governments may refer to, if they fail to meet it.\nSpending will return to 0.7%, the government says, but only when:\nBut some MPs have questioned when these tests will be met.\nThe promise on National Insurance (NI) has been broken. \nNI is a tax paid by workers on their earnings and on the profits of self-employed workers. Employers also pay extra NI contributions for staff.\nIn September 2021, the government announced that these groups will pay 1.25p more NI in the pound from April 2022. \nThe government says this will raise \u00a312bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS.\nA proportion will then be moved into the social care system over the next three years. \nDefending the NI rise, Mr Johnson said the extra money would help with \"catastrophic [care] costs faced by millions of people up and down the country\". \nFrom April 2023, NI will return to its current rate, but the extra tax will stay as a new Health and Social Care Levy.\nNet zero is the point at which the country is taking as many climate-changing gases out of the atmosphere as it is putting into it.\nThe government has already taken some action, like continuing the move away from the use of coal and towards renewable energy. The sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from 2030.\nIt has also set a target of reducing emissions (from 1990 levels) by 78% by 2035.\nThe independent Climate Change Committee said that the government had \"an achievable and affordable vision\" but added: \"further steps will need to follow quickly to implement the policies and proposals mapped out in the Net Zero Strategy if it is to be a success\".\nUpdate: This piece was published on 4 October 2021 (at the time of the Conservatives' party conference) and has been updated to reflect the latest figures on NHS staff and police recruitment.

      "text": "Two scientists have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on building molecules that are mirror images of one another.\nGerman-born Benjamin List and Scotland-born David MacMillan were announced as the winners at an event in Stockholm.\nTheir chemical toolkit has been used for discovering new drugs and making molecules that can capture light in solar cells.\nThe winners will share the prize money of 10 million krona (\u00a3842,611).\nAsked how he felt winning, Prof MacMillan, from Princeton University, said: \"Dazed, confused, elated, proud, sentimental, weepy - you name it. I feel all of those things right now.\"\nProf List was on holiday with his family when he heard the news: \"I absolutely didn't expect this huge surprise,\" adding that he \"thought it was a joke\" when he received the call from Sweden.\nThe scientific process in question, called asymmetric organocatalysis, has made it much easier to produce asymmetric molecules - chemicals that exist in two versions, where one is a mirror image of the other.\nChemists often just want one of these mirror images - particularly when producing medicines - but it has been difficult to find efficient methods for doing this. \nSome molecules with mirror versions have different properties. An example is the chemical called carvone, which has one form that smells like spearmint and a counterpart that smells like the herb, dill.\nNobel Committee member Prof Peter Somfai reasoned that, if the body can differentiate between two mirror images, the same might be true for drugs used to treat illnesses. In other words, different versions of the same molecule might have different effects when ingested.\n\"Then it becomes important to be able to make only the mirror image of a drug that has the desired physiological effect,\" said Prof Somfai, during the news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nOne tragic example of this principle was the drug thalidomide, approved for treating morning sickness and other conditions in the 1950s. It was withdrawn when it was found to cause disabilities in babies.\nThalidomide medication contained two mirror versions of the same chemical compound mixed in together. One of these versions damaged the developing foetus.\nDavid MacMillan, 53, was born in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, and is the James S McDonnell Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Princeton University in New Jersey.\nBenjamin List, also 53, is from Frankfurt, Germany. He is a professor at the University of Cologne and the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research. \nTheir work focused on catalysts, substances that can speed up chemical reactions without becoming part of the final product. \nWhile at Harvard University in the late 1990s, MacMillan had been working with metal catalysts. But the types used in his research were rarely taken up by industry. The problem was that, while the oxygen-free and moisture-free conditions demanded by some metal catalysts were possible to achieve in the lab, this was much more difficult at large scales.\nThe Scottish chemist began designing simple organic molecules (chemicals that contain carbon and hydrogen bonded together) which could do the same job as metals, but were not destroyed by moisture.\nMeanwhile, Benjamin List was working towards a similar goal. He had been able to show that a simple amino acid called proline could act as a highly effective catalyst. It was also cheap and environmentally-friendly.\nProf Somfai, who works at Sweden's Lund University, said List and MacMillan had \"rationalised their findings\" in such a simple way that  it was immediately appreciated by the scientific community\". \nHe added: \"This resulted in a 'gold rush' - or an explosion - in this area... It's easy to design new things given this easy explanation.\"\nThe Nobel Committee said the technique had \"taken molecular construction to an entirely new level\".\nThe Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written a year before his death in 1896.\nA total of 187 individuals have received the chemistry prize since it was first awarded in 1901.\nOnly seven of these laureates have been women. One person, the British biochemist Frederick Sanger, won the prize twice - in 1958 and 1980.\nThe country that has had most chemistry laureates is the United States, with 72 winners. Germany and the UK share second place with 34 laureates each.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.\n2020 - Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna received the award for developing the tools to edit DNA.\n2019 - John B Goodenough, M Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino share the prize for their work on lithium-ion batteries.\n2018 - Discoveries about enzymes earned Frances Arnold, George P Smith and Gregory Winter the prize\n2017 - Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson were awarded the prize for improving images of biological molecules\n2016 - Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Fraser Stoddart and Bernard Feringa shared the prize for the making machines on a molecular scale.\n2015 - Discoveries in DNA repair earned Tomas Lindahl and Paul Modrich and Aziz Sancar the award."

      "text": "A former Facebook employee has told US politicians that the company's sites and apps harm children's mental health and stoke division in society.\nFrances Haugen, a 37-year-old former product manager turned whistleblower, heavily criticised the company at a hearing in the Senate.\nFacebook has faced growing scrutiny and increasing calls for its regulation.\nFounder Mark Zuckerberg hit back, saying the latest accusations were at odds with the company's goals.\nIn a letter to staff, he said many of the claims were \"illogical\" and pointed to Facebook's efforts to fight harmful content.\n\"We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health,\" he said in the letter, made public on his Facebook page. \"It's difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives.\"\nFacebook is the world's most popular social media site. The company says it has 2.7 billion monthly active users. Hundreds of millions of people also use the company's other products, including WhatsApp and Instagram.\nBut it has been criticised on several fronts - from failing to protect users' privacy to not doing enough to halt the spread of disinformation.\nMs Haugen told CBS News on Sunday that she had shared a number of internal Facebook documents with the Wall Street Journal in recent weeks.\nUsing the documents, the WSJ reported that research carried out by Instagram showed the app could harm girls' mental health. \nThis was a theme Ms Haugen continued during her testimony on Tuesday. \"The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people,\" she said. \nShe criticised Mark Zuckerberg for having wide-ranging control, saying that there is \"no one currently holding Mark accountable but himself.\"\nAnd she praised the massive outage of Facebook services on Monday, which affected users around the world. \n\"Yesterday we saw Facebook taken off the internet,\" she said. \"I don't know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilise democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies.\"\nThe answer, she told senators, was congressional oversight. \"We must act now,\" she said. \nMr Zuckerberg, in his letter, said the research into Instagram had been mischaracterised and that many young people had positive experiences of using the platform. But he said \"it's very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids\".\nOn Monday's outage, he said the deeper concern was not \"how many people switch to competitive services or how much money we lose, but what it means for the people who rely on our services to communicate with loved ones, run their businesses, or support their communities\".\nBoth Republican and Democratic senators on Tuesday were united in the need for change at the company - a rare topic of agreement between the two political parties.\n\"The damage to self-interest and self-worth inflicted by Facebook today will haunt a generation,\" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said. \n\"Big Tech now faces the Big Tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth,\" he added, a reference to how tobacco firms hid the harmful effects of their products. \nFellow Republican Dan Sullivan said the world would look back and ask \"What the hell were we thinking?\" in light of the revelations about Facebook's impact on children.\nIn a statement issued after the hearing, Facebook said it did not agree with Ms Haugen's \"characterisation of the many issues she testified about\". But it did agree that \"it's time to begin to create standard rules for the internet.\" \n\"It's been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act,\" the statement read.\n Zuckerberg rattled\n Mark Zuckerberg's blog is lengthy and thoughtful. He doesn't name Frances Haugen - but he has clearly been rattled.\nHis main argument is that the research she leaked has been misrepresented by both her and the media. He argues that the negative internal research has been cherry-picked and positive conclusions brushed over. \nInterestingly, he thinks this episode could have a chilling effect on internal research in companies - worried that bad conclusions might one day be leaked. \nBut there is of course a simple come back to this. Release the data. \nFacebook and other social media companies don't have to do internal research; they could let their data be analysed independently. \nTo be fair to Facebook, the company does give researchers some access. However, only Facebook has the full spectrum of user metrics needed to fully analyse its effect on society. \nHis arguments too are at times overly simplified. Why would we want to make people angry, he asks. \nI'm sure he doesn't. But it's been proven over and over again that social media that provokes any emotion, whether it be laughter, love or anger gets more engagement.\nZuckerberg believes passionately that Facebook is a force for good. It's becoming harder and harder to find people on Capitol Hill who think that."

      "tags": "Policing,Sarah Everard murder,Metropolitan Police Service,Priti Patel",
      "text": "An inquiry will be launched into \"systematic failures\" that allowed Wayne Couzens to continue to be a police officer, Priti Patel announced. \nThe home secretary said the public \"have a right to know\" why he remained in the Metropolitan Police despite concerns about his behaviour.\nCouzens kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while he was a serving officer, using his police warrant card.\nHe has since been linked to allegations of indecent exposure.\nThe Met has faced mounting questions over its policies and procedures in the wake of Ms Everard's murder.\nIt was revealed Couzens - who worked as an armed officer in the Met's parliamentary and diplomatic protection team - was linked to several alleged incidents of indecent exposure, including in the days before  Ms Everard's abduction in March.\nSpeaking at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Ms Patel said: \"We need answers as to why this was allowed to happen.\n\"I can confirm today there will be an inquiry, to give the independent oversight needed, to ensure something like this can never happen again.\"\nThe Home Office said the inquiry would be in two parts, with the first examining Couzens' behaviour and establishing a definitive account of his conduct in the lead up to his conviction for Ms Everard's murder.\nIt said the second part would address specific issues, such as vetting procedures, standards, discipline and workplace behaviour. \nThe exact nature of the inquiry is still unclear.\nThe Home Office said it would initially be non-statutory but could be converted to a statutory one if required.\nIf statutory, the inquiry would have the legal power to call witnesses and limit the government's control over how it operated.\nThe person who would lead the inquiry and its terms of reference would be confirmed \"in due course\".\nPolicing minister Kit Malthouse pointed out the first option - a non-statutory inquiry - was much quicker to put in place but stressed it would not begin until the separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) inquiry was complete.\nOn BBC Radio 4's PM, he acknowledged his surprise on finding out that examining social media postings had only became a part of the police vetting procedure a year ago.\nThe modern world was moving fast, he said. The vetting \"net\" has to be as tight as possible, with a regard for recruits' right to privacy while ensuring they were \"the right people with the right values\", he added.\nJamie Klingler, co-founder of the campaign group Reclaim These Streets, set up after Sarah Everard's murder, insisted the inquiry needed to be statutory and judge-led - and needed to include women.\n\"It seems really specific about Wayne Couzens and not about the system that allowed a Wayne Couzens to happen,\" she told the BBC.\n\"It's not admitting that there is systemic misogyny within the force that allowed this to happen, and by not doing so it's pushing it under the carpet rather than exposing [it] at all levels.\"\nCouzens, 48, killed Ms Everard, 33, after stopping her on a street in Clapham, south London. He was sentenced to a whole-life prison term last week.\nSpeaking earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he did not support calls to make misogyny a hate crime, saying there was \"abundant\" existing legislation to tackle violence against women.\nHe told BBC Breakfast that \"widening the scope\" of what you ask the police to do would just increase the problem - but recruiting and promoting more female officers would help change the culture within forces.\nThere is an air of crisis in British policing as it faces a significant moment of reckoning.\nNever have leaders felt that public trust is so low they have had to advise women to consider fleeing if they are uncomfortable when confronted by one of their own officers.\nThis is the aftershock of the appalling crimes of Wayne Couzens, who kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Metropolitan Police.\nDespite repeated attempts to force Home Secretary Priti Patel's hand, she has very publicly backed Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick by renewing her contract last month.\nBut questions now confront policing - and the difficulty its chiefs and ministers are having in answering them is why the crisis feels too deep.\nWas Couzens' ability to pull on the uniform a failure of the system?\nIs there a wider cultural problem?\nAnd how should police leaders and the government respond?\nRead more from Dominic here.\nMet Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who has rejected calls to resign, confirmed on Monday there would be a separate independent review into the force's standards and culture.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Dame Cressida said Ms Everard's murder had made \"everyone in the Met furious and we depend on public trust\".\n\"In this country policing is done by consent and undoubtedly the killing of Sarah and other events has damaged public trust,\" she said, adding she was determined to rebuild it.\nLabour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said it was important the inquiry looked at how allegations of violence against women and girls were handled by police officers, as well as Couzens' conduct and the culture within the police.\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said the inquiry \"must leave no stone unturned\" and should address reports of \"widespread cultural issues\".\nSpeaking earlier at the Conservative Party conference, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said making communities safer and allowing women to walk home feeling safe at night was his \"number one priority\".\nThe Met Police said 650 more police officers would patrol hotspot areas in London over the next six months, with 150 of these working in local wards as \"Bobbies on the beat\".\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "The prime minister is not taking the prospect of a national pig cull seriously, according to a top vet.\nSome 600 pigs have already been shot and a mass cull is \"the next stage\", the National Pig Association said. \nBoris Johnson asked a journalist if he had ever eaten a bacon sandwich, saying: \"Those pigs when you ate them, were not alive\".\nVet Duncan Berkshire, who is involved in planning any cull, said the remarks were \"enormously disappointing\".\nMr Berkshire is liaising with the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) over the logistics of tackling farms' overcrowding concerns as adult pigs are not being slaughtered fast enough. \nAbattoir labour shortages are being blamed on Brexit and the Covid pandemic.\nMr Berkshire said: \"Unfortunately those discussions are around the horrific case where we are looking at not only when, but also how, we will have to enact a cull of healthy animals which would then just go for incineration,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nHe said the numbers of pigs that had already been culled \"are unfortunately starting to rack up\". \n\"We are already at a few hundred at the moment. But if we don't get movement soon on the backlog of pigs that is present on farms at the moment, we are going to have to enact some of these more drastic actions.\"\nMr Johnson made his bacon sandwich comments to Times Radio journalist Tom Newton Dunn.\nWhen asked about the prime minister's remarks, Mr Berkshire told Today: \"He is unable to see the difference between what we have as a UK supply chain...[and] the absolute abhorrent food wastage that will be the case if we end up having to shoot healthy pigs\".\nHe said the animals \"in every other way would be fit for everyone to eat but we are just going to end up having to put them in a skip and send them for incineration\".\n\"It's distressing enough just having to start planning for that absolute wastage,\" he said.\nPig farmer Kate Morgan said Mr Johnson's comments were an \"absolute insult\" and a \"kick in the teeth\".\nShe said unless the government solves the shortage of butchers in processing plants by issuing short-term visas for foreign workers, she may have to cull pigs on her East Yorkshire farm \"by the end of October\".\nZoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pig Association said there was difference between animals being killed for food and culled.\nResponding to the PM's comments, she said: \"These animals were going to feed the nation. It should not be allowed to happen.\"\nShe called on the government to increase the number of worker visas for abattoirs, and to lower the English language requirement.\n\"At the moment it's the same level as doctors or vets\", she said.\nShe warned that while there has not been a mass cull of pigs yet, such a measure is \"the next stage in the process\".\nOne Yorkshire farmer had to kill hundreds of \"perfectly healthy, viable piglets\" as he no longer had space for them,  a friend told the BBC."
